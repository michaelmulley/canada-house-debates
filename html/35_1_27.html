	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-219, an act to amend the Immigration 
Act (visitors' visas).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to present this bill 
amending the visitor visa provisions of the Immigration Act. 
The bill was presented in the past Parliament.
<P>
	The bill would permit the Canadian relatives of visitors to 
place a surety with the Government of Canada prior to the 
application for visa by the non-Canadian visitor.
<P>
	At present Canadians have no role in this process. I believe, as 
do others, that their participation in the process by means of a 
surety would enhance the prospects of the visitor obtaining a 
visa and enabling the visit to take place.
<P>
	The bill specifically provides that the absence of such a surety 
will not be considered by visa officers so as not to prejudice all 
others who are applying for visas who do not happen to have 
relatives in Canada.

honour this morning of presenting a petition signed by close to 
300 residents of my riding of Rosemont. They call on the 
government to reinstate budgets for social and co-operative 
housing and denounce the federal government's plans to 
increase subsidized rents by 20 per cent.
<P>
	In the riding of Rosemont alone, more than 1,000 families are 
on the waiting list for social housing whereas all budgets have 
been frozen.

	As you undoubtedly know, Mr. Speaker, the Régie du

has authorized the private sector to increase rents by only .5 per

were to authorize rent increases of 20 per cent.
<P>
	With the budget only several hours away, my constituents in 
the riding of Rosemont call upon the Minister of Finance to 
uphold the commitments he made during the last election 
campaign. It is vital that he dispel any uncertainty weighing on 
the least fortunate and that he restore decent funding for the 
construction of new social housing units.

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue)</B> 
moved that Bill C-11, an act to amend the Excise Act, the 
Customs Act and the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise today to speak in 
favour of Bill C-11. As Minister of National Revenue, I have a 
responsibility to do all I can to maintain and protect the integrity 
of the Canadian border and to ensure that Canadian tax laws are 
respected. For these reasons, I have been deeply affected by the 
dramatic increase in smuggling.
<P>
	Some people still argue that it is a regional problem and that 
the federal government's four-point program to fight smuggling 
and tobacco use only hinges on regional interests. That is totally 
false.
<P>
	The growth of the smuggling trade in Canada, especially 
tobacco smuggling, is a national problem requiring a solution at 
the national level. Let us look at the facts.
<P>
	Contraband tobacco amounts to some $5 billion or about 40 
per cent of the $12.4 billion Canadian tobacco market.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	This means that about $1.6 billion worth of contraband 
cigarettes are sold in our communities, on our streets and in our 
schools every month. As a result, unfortunately, our young 
people who want to start smoking now have practically 
unlimited access to cheap contraband tobacco. This situation 
clearly undermines the federal and provincial governments' 
efforts to discourage tobacco use through high prices.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This means that smuggling is undermining both federal and 
provincial efforts to discourage smoking. Unfortunately the 
problem we are facing today does not stop there. Smuggling has 
cost the federal treasury approximately $1 billion in the last 
fiscal year. It cost the provincial treasuries another billion 
dollars in the past year.
<P>
	These are direct losses that cannot be recovered, but these 
revenue losses have been increasing sharply in recent months. 
Smuggling is therefore, in my opinion, undermining our fiscal 
situation and our social programs at both the federal and 
provincial levels. The problem is growing. This problem is 
intolerable.
<P>
	Revenue losses are not the whole problem. Because the 
smuggling trade is increasingly run by organized crime and 
according to enforcement agencies organized crime now con-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1651"> 1651 </A></B>
<P>
trols most of the $5 billion tobacco smuggling trade, literally 
billions of dollars are being funnelled out of the hands of 
Canadian citizens and into the hands of  criminals who also ply 
their illegal trade in alcohol, paramilitary weapons, drugs, 
immigrants and other contraband products.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In a nutshell, the only beneficiaries of the current situation are 
the gangs of criminals who sell drugs in our schools, arm our 
offenders and destabilize Canadian society. The losers are the 
majority of Canadians who obey the law, pay their taxes and 
want to live without fearing for their safety. The situation keeps 
getting worse.
<P>
	Smuggling also has a detrimental effect on law-abiding small 
merchants; it is pushing these people to the brink of bankruptcy. 
In short, smuggling penalizes Canadians who want to earn an 
honest living.
<P>
	Smuggling undermines the rule of law in this country and 
hampers the government's efforts to reduce tobacco use, mainly 
among young Canadians. It also robs federal and provincial 
finance departments of important revenues.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said two weeks ago in this House: ``We 
are dealing with a problem of law enforcement and organized 
crime, with health issues, with federal-provincial relations-''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yet despite the wide ranging breadth of the issue and the 
impact it is having on our communities, on our social system and 
on respect for the law, there are still those who argue that it is a 
regional problem. These people point to the province of Quebec 
and say: ``They have a problem but we don't''. The evidence 
simply does not support such a simplistic position.
<P>
	Let me go over some of the statistics for members. It is true 
that the smuggling problem is currently most acute in Quebec 
where it has been at least until very recently. It is also true that it 
has grown and was growing in that province. It has been growing 
alarmingly in every other province of the country.
<P>
	I ask hon. members to consider the facts. The market share of 
contraband tobacco was estimated at only 9 per cent in Quebec 
four years ago. Today contraband represents an estimated 60 per 
cent to 65 per cent of the Quebec market.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Contraband tobacco represented about 12 per cent of Atlantic 
Canada's tobacco market in 1990 or four years ago. Today 
contraband constitutes approximately 40 per cent of that 
market. In 1992, only two years ago, contraband tobacco 
represented 13 per cent of Ontario's tobacco market and today it 
represents close to 35 per cent.
<P>
	In the west where the smuggling problem is clearly less acute 
at the moment, contraband tobacco accounted for only 9 per cent 
of tobacco sales a little more than a year ago. However today 
contraband tobacco in western Canada has increased to 15 per 
cent of the market. That in terms of growth is a 60 per cent 
increase in one year.
<P>
	It is perverse to continue to view this problem as a problem of 
only one province. There is an obvious trend to which members 
and the Canadian public must pay attention. Whether one lives 
in the maritimes, in Ontario, in Quebec or in the west, 
smuggling is growing at a rapid rate across the country and has 
become a national problem.
<P>
	I will now deal with lessons to be learned.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First, inaction is not a solution. It is no longer possible to 
ignore the problem. Obviously, if we do not take energetic 
measures now, the amount of contraband tobacco in our 
communities will continue to grow and organized crime will 
continue to grow rich from the illegal profits.
<P>
	The former Conservative government let the smuggling 
problem grow to such an extent that the present government 
cannot tolerate it today. Our government refuses to look away 
and pretend that the problem can be solved by half-measures. 
We also refuse to pretend that the smuggling problem affects 
only one region of the country.
<P>
	Smuggling is a national problem, so the solution must also be 
national in scope. We must take strong measures now. We cannot 
allow cheap smuggled tobacco to continue to come into our 
communities and into the hands of young Canadians. We cannot 
allow the rule of law in this country to continue to be flouted. I 
repeat: inertia and half-measures are not realistic solutions. 
That is why today I support Bill C-11, an act to amend the 
Excise Act, the Customs Act and the Tobacco Sales to Young 
Persons Act.
<P>
	The proposed amendments support the government's 
four-point initiative to fight tobacco smuggling and use. With 
these amendments, we will give Canadian police authorities 
additional legal powers to fight smuggling. We will also 
improve the government's efforts for young people's health.
<P>
	Taken together, the amendments tabled in the House will help 
establish the integrity of Canadian laws and the Canadian border 
and, perhaps most important, stop the increase in smuggling in 
regions of the country where it has not yet reached disturbing 
levels.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore the first amendment in the bill applies to the Excise 
Act. It will effectively increase the resources that can be brought 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1652"> 1652 </A></B>
<P>
to bear in the fight against smuggling. It will do so by allowing 
the government to give to police forces other than the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police the authority to enforce sections of 
the  Excise Act that allow for the seizure of tobacco, alcohol and 
vehicles used in illegal smuggling activities.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The government will be able to provide provincial police 
forces-in particular the Sûreté du Québec and the Ontario 
Provincial Police but also municipal police forces-as 
appropriate with the additional legal tools they need to combat 
smuggling and the organized criminals who control the 
smuggling trade. This means there will be a substantial increase 
in the level of police resources working with the federal 
government to put an end to smuggling.
<P>
	Second, the proposed amendments to the Customs Act and the 
Excise Act will provide police forces with the authority to 
destroy certain seized products without hindering the ability of 
authorities to carry out prosecution successfully. This reduction 
in the storage of contraband will save Canadian taxpayers over 
$200,000 a year by eliminating the storage costs of the property 
seized.
<P>
	Third, we have a proposal to amend the Excise Act in order to 
clearly stamp individual cigarettes on which taxes have been 
paid. I might add that while there may be some technical 
questions yet to be determined, it would also be possible to mark 
individual cigarettes that are in duty-free shops or individual 
cigarettes which have been exported. We will have a differential 
ability to have individual cigarettes marked to indicate what 
particular taxes have been paid on them. This will allow law 
enforcement agencies to identify more easily those smoking 
contraband tobacco products.
<P>
	Fourth, we have two proposed amendments to the Tobacco 
Sales to Young Persons Act. The first will make it illegal for 
tobacco manufacturers to package cigarettes in packages 
containing fewer than 20 cigarettes. This will effectively kill the 
so-called kiddie packs of six or a similar number of cigarettes.
<P>
	The second amendment to the Tobacco Sales to Young 
Persons Act will prohibit the importation of tobacco products 
into Canada by a person under the age of 18. This is 
complementary to other measures that will be taken internally to 
reduce the possibility of possession of tobacco by people below 
that age.
<P>
	As a result of these two measures and other provisions young 
Canadians should find it greatly more difficult to obtain tobacco 
products.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The four-point plan to fight smuggling and tobacco use is a 
comprehensive action plan which deals with the whole 
smuggling problem, and Bill C-11 is an integral part of this 
plan. It deals with the need for tougher enforcement in the fight 
against smuggling. It deals with the need to get rid of organized 
crime which controls smuggling activities. It also deals with the 
need to protect the health of young Canadians. In short, Bill 
C-11 is an  integral part of the government's solution to a 
national problem.
<P>
	For these reasons, I ask the House to support the passage of 
Bill C-11.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the official 
opposition critic for training and youth, I welcome this 
opportunity to present the position of the Bloc Quebecois on Bill 
C-11, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Customs Act and 
the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act.
<P>
	As youth critic, I intend to address those provisions of the bill 
that are aimed at reducing tobacco sales to young people, 
because smoking is a very serious problem among young 
people, and is probably one of the worst threats to the health of 
young people today.
<P>
	In fact, according to a study carried out in 1992 by Health and 
Welfare Canada, 38,000 Canadians die each year of 
smoking-related diseases. From 80 to 90 per cent of all cases of 
emphysema and bronchitis are caused by cigarette smoking. I 
say this because we often think of lung cancer, but there are 
other diseases as well. Thirty per cent of young Canadians and 
Quebecers are smoking today, about the same proportion as for 
adults. It is a problem that is not going away.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	In 1989, it was estimated that young Canadians between the 
ages of 12 and 19 spent more than $436 million on cigarettes, 
and that amount is even higher today. Ninety per cent smoked 
regularly, and by regularly I mean every day. Fifty-eight per 
cent of young smokers had from 11 to 25 cigarettes daily. 
Seventy-five per cent of teenagers who smoked developed the 
habit before the age of 17, and the average age at which they 
started to smoke-surprisingly, this figure is going down-was 
13, in other words, they started smoking when they were 13 
years old.
<P>
	Other studies have shown that a gradual decrease was 
reversed in 1989, when smoking by young people started to 
increase. The age at which young people smoke their first 
cigarette has continued to go down. In fact, according to the 
National Clearing House on Tobacco and Health, between 1965 
and 1989 smoking by young people in the 15-to-19 age group 
dropped from 55 per cent to 21 per cent among males and 37 per 
cent to 21 per cent among females. That was the good news. 
However, since 1989, 23.8 per cent of all students surveyed said 
they smoked daily, and the percentage was about the same for 
both girls and boys. Smoking increased considerably in 1991 
and 1993 among students, especially students in their first year 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1653"> 1653 </A></B>
<P>
of high school, rising from 6.1 per cent in 1989 to 9.4 per cent in 
1993.
<P>
	Furthermore, according to several studies conducted by the 
National Clearing House on Tobacco and Health, there is 
evidence that links poverty, unemployment, smoking, 
alcoholism and drug addiction.
<P>
	Education is also an interesting factor to determine the 
population most likely to engage in such activities. Still 
according to the National Clearing House on Tobacco and 
Health, 34 per cent of individuals aged 15 and over smoke, as 
opposed to 18 per cent of people with a university education. 
Thirty-six per cent of the poorest members of our society 
smoke, as opposed to 25 per cent of the wealthiest members of 
that society.
<P>
	The economic measures put in place by previous governments 
in Canada since 1984 have had a negative social impact by 
increasing poverty among Canadians. Young people have been 
particularly affected by these measures. In 1990, 40 per cent of 
young Quebecers were living in poverty. Today, youth 
unemployment in Quebec has reached nearly 20 per cent.
<P>
	However, I doubt that the figures I just quoted shed enough 
light on the real causes of smoking by young people. I believe 
more research is necessary for a more thorough analysis of a 
phenomenon that is constantly changing. We have every reason 
to be concerned about the future health of our young people and 
the burden on our health system.
<P>
	It should come as no surprise to hon. members that the 
Official Opposition supports adopting measures to restrict 
tobacco consumption in general and by young people in 
particular. It should be a foregone conclusion for any political 
party that is concerned about public health. However, we do 
have a number of questions about the bill before the House today 
and these concern its chances of succeeding if the legislation is 
not properly enforced or if no effective measures are taken to 
achieve the bill's objective.
<P>
	There is, first of all, the matter of the government's timing in 
tabling Bill C-11. It should be noted that this bill was tabled in 
the House of Commons two days after the Prime Minister 
announced, on February 8, various measures including tax 
reductions to fight cigarette smuggling.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	We would almost think that, all of a sudden and off the cuff as 
we see it, this government was trying to give the impression it 
could solve every problem related to tobacco use.
<P>
	Why dit it wait until February 8 to put into force the Tobacco 
Sales to Young Persons Act adopted by the House of Commons 
in third reading on February 12, 1993? That was a year ago, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	Another fundamental issue is the will or capacity of the 
federal government to enforce its legislation respecting tobacco 
use.
<P>
	This concern flows from this government's apparent 
reluctance to fight propaganda and incapacity to react to this 
rising problem. Other pieces of legislation also come to mind.
<P>
	In an article published in <I>Le Soleil</I> on February 13 last, we 
learned that, over a four-year period, the federal government 
had not imposed a single fine under its Non Smokers' Health 
Act, an act to regulate smoking in its own buildings, and this in 
spite of innumerable complaints and no less than 102 violations 
reported during the first three years of operation of this act. Not 
one of the violation notices resulted in fines. The only action 
actually taken seems to have been to hand out warnings.
<P>
	As members of the Official Opposition, we are fully prepared 
to contribute to the legislative process, but the government still 
has to enforce not only the legislation Parliament passes from 
now on, but also legislation passed previously.
<P>
	It would be interesting to know what steps the government 
intends to take to ensure compliance with certain provisions of 
Bill C-11, including those relating to the requirement to stamp 
all tobacco products individually and the manufacturing and 
sale of cigarettes in packages containing fewer than 20 
cigarettes. All this is fine. It is one thing to say you want to do 
something, but how will you go about it? That is a very 
important point, as far as I am concerned. How will the sale of 
individual cigarettes be controlled? Cigarettes are very small 
and easy to hide. How will the age of the buyer be ascertained? 
Will ID cards be required? How does the government intend to 
check the age of cigarette buyers? As we know, since old Bill 
C-111 became law, the legal age is 18. But you still have to 
check the ID card, the age of the buyer. Of course we are 
wondering about the number of people who will be assigned to 
enforce the law-the minister touched upon the subject-as 
well as the costs involved.
<P>
	It is very important to get an answer to these questions 
because it relates to a central aspect of this legislation, namely 
its enforcement. Incidentally, the minister did mention 
enforcement at the beginning of his speech.
<P>
	Also, we think that this legislation should be coupled with 
positive measures to warn young people of the dangers of 
tobacco use and encourage them not to smoke. We must beware 
of the possible boomerang effect of a repressive approach on the 
young in that area as in any other in fact. Several educational 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1654"> 1654 </A></B>
<P>
experts have said repeatedly that young people trying to grow up 
and assert themselves could be attracted by the ``forbidden'', in 
which they see a challenge.
<P>
	I have recently consulted a number of young people and I am 
convinced that, as far as stringent measures to restrict the use of 
cigarettes among young people are concerned, they could be 
construed as a form of provocation, thus inciting young people 
to go against this restriction.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	We must help our young people to become more responsible, 
not marginalize them even more by taking only traditional, 
repressive approaches to problems.
<P>
	This bill, which would restrict access by young persons to 
tobacco products, should not be a reason for us to forget that 
young people experience drug and alcohol problems on a daily 
basis. According to Statistics Canada, 12 per cent of our young 
people have serious drug addiction problems.
<P>
	The range of illegal substances available in high schools 
boggles the mind. On February 19 last, <I>La Presse</I> reported in an 
article that high school students can purchase chemical 
substances such as PCP for a mere five dollars per unit right on 
the school premises. Pushers offer to sell drugs to children often 
as young as 12 or 13 years of age, and the impact on their health 
and on society is devastating.
<P>
	As is the case with smoking, young persons who start to use 
drugs early in their teens are much more likely to still use drugs 
as adults. However, drugs are not the only products that are 
easily accessible to young people. Alcohol is also readily 
available to them.
<P>
	In another article which appeared in <I>La Presse</I> on February 20 
last, it was reported that teenagers can easily buy beer at the 
corner store. The article is based on the findings reported in a 
study involving high schools students aged 16 and 17 in 
Montreal, and 18-year-old students in Toronto. Students in this 
age bracket visited about one hundred convenience stores and in 
85 per cent of the cases, merchants sold them alcoholic 
beverages without asking for any identification. Mr. Speaker, 
this is terrible!
<P>
	Clearly, not everyone is complying with the legislation 
governing the sale of alcohol to minors. Must we wait until the 
same thing happens with the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons 
Act?
<P>
	We have said it before and we will say it again. We are not 
opposed to the passage of Bill C-11. What we are concerned 
about is how the legislation will be enforced.
<P>
	Moreover, we must not be seen as sending a negative message 
to our youth. Considering that in the speech from the throne, the 
government announced plans to amend the Young Offenders 
Act, young people could possibly see in this legislation a 
message that society views them as the cause of the problem. In 
my opinion, young people represent the future, indeed, our 
future. It is up to us to ensure that the proposed measures are 
viewed in a positive light.
<P>
	I have another question, this time pertaining to section 66 of 
the act respecting enforcement measures. As the minister 
mentioned earlier, this provision stipulates that police forces 
other than the RCMP can, if the minister deems it appropriate, 
seize tobacco, alcohol and vehicles used for illegal contraband 
activities. Does this mean that the police resources assigned to 
fight contraband activities will be increased significantly? If it 
does, how much will this increased presence cost?
<P>
	I would also be somewhat surprised if the government were 
able to obtain as easily as the minister claimed the co-operation 
of police forces that do not fall under its jurisdiction. Most 
provincial and municipal police forces have experienced staff 
cuts and most claim to be stretched to the limit. Refusal to 
co-operate is not always a sign of bad will. When police forces 
have trouble just getting their everyday work done, it is difficult 
for them to volunteer to do extra work for another level of 
government.
<P>
	It was also mentioned that seized property such as vehicles 
could be auctioned off. Will the proceeds from such sales be 
used to fight contraband activities and smoking?
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Section 112 of the old Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act, 
which relates to the immediate destruction of some of the 
articles seized, will allow the police to immediately destroy 
some of the articles seized, photos and videos liable to be used 
as evidence at trials. This could, of course, reduce storage costs 
significantly, but how do we make sure that these photos and 
videos are secure? That is a question that we should be asking 
ourselves.
<P>
	Sections 201 and 211 of the act concerning the stamping of 
individual cigarettes will amend the Excise Act to allow 
authorities and law-abiding citizens to better identify products 
that have been taxed and those that have not been taxed, but we 
are told that these new stamping requirements for cigarettes will 
be prescribed by regulations after Bill C-11 has been passed. We 
hope that these regulations will be adopted and implemented 
quickly, in any case faster than those related to last year's Bill 
C-111.
<P>
	Clause 7.1 of Bill C-11 will make it illegal to produce and sell 
packages containing less than 20 cigarettes. In our opinion, the 
effectiveness of this measure is reduced by the decline in 
cigarette prices. A pack of 25 now costs much less than a pack of 
15 before taxes and prices were slashed.
<P>
	Clause 7.3 of Bill C-11 is aimed at prohibiting the 
importation of tobacco products for and by people under 18. 
This measure is self-evident is we prohibit people under 18 
from buying these products within Canada's geographical 
bound-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1655"> 1655 </A></B>
<P>
aries, but how can we ensure effective customs controls so that 
this measure does not amount to wishful thinking?
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to remind the House that the 
Official Opposition supports Bill-11, but we want to emphasize 
once again that it is important to take measures to enforce it. 
First by adopting easy-to-implement regulations and then by 
putting in place a better awareness program aimed at convincing 
young people that tobacco is detrimental to their health and that 
it can impose important costs on tomorrow's society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour to be the first speaker for the Reform Party on 
this bill. As members know, I am new to the House and studying 
this bill has provided me with an important lesson in the 
legislative process of which all Canadians should be made 
aware.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister announced the government's 
national action plan to combat smuggling and Bill C-11 was 
introduced by the Minister of National Revenue, we assumed 
that Bill C-11 would contain all the measures announced in the 
national action plan to combat smuggling. Unfortunately it did 
not.
<P>
	In fact all the tax measures announced by the Prime Minister 
in the national action plan to combat smuggling have been 
implemented using ways and means motions.
<P>
	Ways and means motions require the government to bring a 
bill or bills before the House some time in the future. Ways and 
means motions cannot be debated. Therefore the tax reduction 
on cigarettes, the export tax on cigarettes and the health 
promotion surtax are not in Bill C-11. In effect they will not be 
seriously debated or subject to review and amendment by the 
Standing Committee on Finance until the government decides to 
bring in the other bills as required by the ways and means 
motions.
<P>
	As I said, it was an educational experience for me to see how 
the government does things. The government is able to put its 
agenda forward even though there may be very little debate on it 
from its own MPs.
<P>
	The measures introduced in Bill C-11 are fairly minor in 
comparison. The main amendments to the Excise Act and the 
Customs Act allow the government immediately to destroy 
certain seized property, even when there is an unresolved claim. 
It permits the government to give police forces the same seizure 
power as the RCMP.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Another amendment to the Excise Act requires cigarettes to 
be individually stamped if they are manufactured or imported 
into Canada in order to make sure that the duties have been paid. 
It is a very good control measure.
<P>
	Finally, the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act has been 
amended to prohibit sales of tobacco products to any person 
under the age of 18. It makes it illegal to manufacture, package 
or sell cigarettes in packages containing less than 20 cigarettes. 
This is also a good measure.
<P>
	On February 8 when the Prime Minister announced his 
national action plan to combat smuggling my constituency 
office received 52 calls, 43 of which opposed the reduction of 
taxes on cigarettes. Since the government made clear its 
intention to reduce the tax on cigarettes I have received letters 
from many different sources protesting the government's action.
<P>
	Here are some of them: Saskatchewan Medical Association; 
Canadian Medical Association; College of Family Physicians, 
Saskatchewan Chapter; Saskatchewan Provincial Health 
Council; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Saskatchewan; Heart 
and Stroke Foundation of Canada; and the Canadian Cancer 
Society.
<P>
	Also opposed is the Saskatchewan Interagency Council on 
Smoking and Health which includes all the following agencies: 
Allergy Foundation of Canada; City of Regina Health 
Department; Community Health and Epidemiology Department 
of the University of Saskatchewan, Continuing Medical 
Education, Continuing Nursing Education; Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan Conference of the Seventh Day Adventists; 
Saskatchewan Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission; 
Saskatchewan Education; Saskatchewan Health; Saskatchewan 
Health Care Association; Saskatchewan Institute on the 
Prevention of Handicaps; Saskatchewan Medical Association; 
Saskatchewan Pharmaceutical Association; Saskatchewan 
Public Health Association; Saskatchewan Registered Nurses 
Association; Saskatoon Community Health Clinic; University 
of Saskatchewan; Canadian Cancer Society, Saskatchewan 
division; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Saskatchewan Inc.; 
and Saskatchewan Lung Association.
<P>
	We also received representations from Saskatchewan 
Heart-Health which includes the following agencies and 
organizations: Canadian Cancer Society; Canadian Diabetes 
Association; Consumers Association of Canada; Coronary 
Artery Rehabilitation Group; Coteau Hills Heart Health 
Coalition; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Saskatchewan; 
Interagency Council on Smoking and Health; Regina Health 
District; Regina Heart Healthy Partners; Saskatchewan Council 
on Community Development; Saskatchewan Diabetic 
Association; Saskatchewan Health, Community Services 
Branch and Health Promotion Branch; Saskatchewan Lung 
Association; Saskatchewan Public Health Association; 
Saskatchewan Medical Association; Saskatchewan Physical 
Education Association; Saskatchewan Recreational 
Association; Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association; 
Saskatchewan Restaurant Association; Saskatoon Tri-Hospital 
Cardiac Rehabilitation Program; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1656"> 1656 </A></B>
<P>
SIAST-Wascana Institute; and  the University of Saskatchewan 
Heart and Stroke Epidemiology unit.
<P>
	This huge list represents many people. It shows the great 
concern and the broad base opposed to the measures the 
government is taking. All these organizations have expressed 
their concern.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	A letter opposing the tax reduction also came from the 
National Campaign for Action on Tobacco which includes the 
following agencies and organizations: Canadian Cancer 
Society; Canadian Chiropractic Association; Canadian Council 
on Smoking and Health; Canadian Dental Association; 
Canadian Home and School and Parent-Teacher Federation; 
Canadian Hospital Association; Canadian Lung Association; 
Canadian Medical Association; Canadian Pharmaceutical 
Association; Canadian Physiotherapy Association; Canadian 
Public Health Association; Canadian Society of Respiratory 
Therapists; Canadian Teachers Federation; Heart and Stroke 
Foundation of Canada; Non-Smokers' Rights Association; 
Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada; Canadian Association of 
Optometrists; College of Family Physicians of Canada; Royal 
College of Physicians and Surgeons; and the United Church of 
Canada.
<P>
	This represents a huge number of people who have objections 
and concerns regarding this measure. I will not mention any 
more but it gives an idea of how many people have concerns in 
this area.
<P>
	Seventy agencies and organizations have made 
representations to me, just one member of Parliament. These 70 
agencies and organizations are opposed to the tax reduction on 
cigarettes. In contrast, I have received just nine phone calls and 
one letter in favour of the measure announced by the 
government.
<P>
	At this time I would like to read some of the concerns 
expressed in these representations. One letter comes from the 
Saskatchewan Provincial Health Council. It is addressed to the 
Prime Minister and reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are puzzled and dismayed that your government is considering rolling 
back tobacco taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every province in Canada is involved to some degree in health reform and 
moving the emphasis from curing sick people to wellness initiatives and 
prevention of ill health. We have assumed that these initiatives were supported 
by our federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Instead, we hear of your intended action which will reduce constraints and 
ultimately encourage and facilitate people, particularly our young people, to 
beginning or continuing an addictive practice that results in disease and death.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Please remember the following facts:</BLOCKQUOTE>
In 1989, tobacco smoking caused Canadians 9.5 billion in health dollars in the 
workplace.
<P>
One-quarter of high school students who smoke had their first cigarette by grade 
6.
<P>
There are 43 known cancer producing substances in tobacco smoke.
<P>
Nicotine has similar drug and behavioural addictive effects as heroin and 
cocaine.
<P>
One hundred and seventy-five thousand teens will take up smoking if you roll 
taxes back.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Surely your government does not want to be remembered for contributing to 
the premature deaths of 250,000 people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another letter which is addressed to the Minister of Finance 
states: ``We are writing to express our strong opposition to any 
decrease in tobacco taxes''.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	Here is another excerpt from that letter: ``Tobacco is the only 
legal product available which when used as intended causes 
premature death and disability. Tobacco use is the largest single 
independent risk factor for heart disease, and heart disease is the 
leading cause of death in Canada. It accounts for 12 per cent of 
all hospital admissions, 20 per cent of patient days in hospital, 
20 per cent of disability pensions paid by the Canada pension 
plan and is responsible for 32 per cent of total future earnings 
lost due to premature death''.
<P>
	Where does this letter come from? It comes from the Heart 
and Stroke Foundation of Saskatchewan. It has a concern in this 
area.
<P>
	It goes on to say: ``To decrease tobacco taxes now would 
increase tobacco consumption by youth, decrease government 
revenue and reward one of the major causes of the tobacco 
smuggling problem, the actions of Canadian tobacco 
manufacturers''.
<P>
	I would like to read more excerpts from the Heart and Stroke 
Foundation of Canada. This is a letter addressed to myself: 
``Dear Mr. Breitkreuz: What you may not be aware of is that, 
motivated only by profit, the tobacco industry has 
misrepresented both the nature of the problem and the 
consequences of its proposal to reduce taxes. Health groups, in 
contrast, have nothing personal to gain from the position we 
adopt on this issue. Our only interest is safeguarding the health 
of Canadians by preserving the tremendous progress realized 
over the past decade in reducing tobacco consumption. What 
follows is a point by point rebuttal of the tobacco lobby's main 
argument in favour of a tax rollback''.
<P>
	I will not read the whole letter, but it addresses the myth that 
there is a tax rollback that would stop the revenue leakage 
caused by smuggling. It said that in fact governments would lose 
substantially more revenue by lowering taxes.
<P>
	Then it addresses another myth that tobacco tax increases 
have no impact on reducing smoking. The fact is that tobacco 
consumption has dropped dramatically in Canada over the past 
10 years largely because of tobacco tax increases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1657"> 1657 </A></B>
<P>
	The foundation goes on to say in this letter that tobacco 
consumption in Canada has dropped 40 per cent over the past 
decade, even with smuggled tobacco factored in, primarily as a 
result of tobacco tax increases which rendered cigarettes less 
affordable. Canada's 40 per reduction in per capita tobacco 
consumption is significantly greater than that of the United 
States at 27 per cent over the same period. We must take note of 
these facts when we have this discussion.
<P>
	Then it addresses another myth that tobacco is taxed at an 
unfairly high rate in Canada. In fact Canada tobacco tax levels 
are on par with most industrialized nations.
<P>
	I would like also to read a brief excerpt from the Canadian 
Cancer Society. It says: ``Dear Mr. Breitkreuz: We urge you to 
speak up in caucus meetings against tobacco tax rollbacks which 
would only benefit the tobacco industry and would be a public 
health disaster''.
<P>
	I have another letter here from the Saskatchewan Interagency 
Council on Smoking and Health. I will read an excerpt from it: 
``Very recently U.S. government researchers reported that while 
heart disease and cancer may be listed as the nation's leading 
killers, the biggest underlying cause of death is tobacco use. Let 
us not forget that tobacco is the greatest cause of preventable 
death in Canada''. Let me repeat that tobacco is the greatest 
cause of preventable death in Canada.
<P>
	Let us not forget that cigarettes cause health problems when 
used exactly as intended. Canada must continue with its 
combination of fiscal and health policies if we are to continue to 
reduce tobacco use.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	We support very much what the government is doing, what its 
intended use is, but we must question the things that have not 
been included in the bill, the tax reduction measures.
<P>
	Here is another news release from the National Campaign for 
Action on Tobacco. Again I will not read the whole release. I am 
just going to take an excerpt. David Sweanor, senior legal 
counsel with the Non-Smokers' Rights Association, stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reducing tobacco taxes would make tobacco products more affordable, 
which would result in enormous increases in consumption, especially among 
children and adolescents. The tobacco industry has lobbied itself into a win-win 
position. The industry profits from supplying tobacco products that end up 
smuggled back into Canada and, of course, the industry wins if governments 
bow to pressure to lower tobacco taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is one of the primary concerns that people expressed in 
those many phone calls we received. The government is bowing 
and the industry is bowing to pressure from certain groups to 
lower taxes.
<P>
	Here is another letter from Saskatchewan Heart Health:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are writing to urge you not to reduce taxes on tobacco products.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that reducing taxes would not solve the smuggling problem, would 
lead to greater consumption of tobacco products by Canadians, particularly by 
youth, and would send the wrong signal to the United States at a time when they 
are considering a tobacco tax increase.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have heard on the news recently that the U.S. was 
watching what we do in Canada and that it will encourage the 
U.S. not to increase taxes there. It continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada has witnessed an unprecedented decrease in tobacco consumption 
over the past decade, coinciding with significant increases in federal and 
provincial tobacco taxes. Because youth tend to have limited incomes, price 
increases have an even greater deterrent effect on them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At a time when other countries view Canada as progressive in its tobacco 
taxation policy and the resulting decreased consumption, it would seem to be a 
very backward step to now decrease taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This message comes from the Saskatchewan Lung 
Association and it is marked urgent. I will read three main points 
from its memo:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Reducing tobacco taxes would be an economic calamity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. Reducing tobacco taxes would escalate health problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. Reducing tobacco taxes would not eliminate smuggling.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have one more letter from a constituent in MacNutt, 
Saskatchewan. I will not read the whole letter. It is addressed to 
myself:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Sir:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are appalled at the decision that the federal government is planning to 
remove some of the taxes on tobacco products. Again, just like previous 
governments, they are trying to please Quebec. Why is there not more effort put 
into the policing of smugglers? Also, why should Indian Reserves be exempt 
from the laws and taxes of this country? Are we not all to be treated equally? 
How would the lost revenue from cigarettes be made up? Who would pay for the 
extra health costs incurred by the greater use of tobacco products?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is an opinion expressed by one of my constituents. We 
should be aware of what they are thinking.
<P>
	As a Reform MP I am bound by the constitution of the Reform 
Party of Canada to represent my constituents' wishes.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	It is easy to see how I will vote when the government 
introduces the bill on reducing taxes on cigarettes. While I am 
also in favour of lowering taxes I do not believe we should lower 
taxes until the budget is balanced.
<P>
	Let us first reduce government spending, balance the budget 
and then look at lowering taxes. Are Reform MPs the only 
members of this House receiving phone calls and letters 
opposed to the tax reduction on cigarettes? Am I the only one 
being inundated with this kind of information?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1658"> 1658 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder how many other MPs will be able to face their 
constituents if they vote in favour of the tax reduction whenever 
that bill is brought before the House. We have to listen to the 
people of Canada. We have to hear their concerns and respond.
<P>
	On February 8, after the Prime Minister announced the 
national action plan to combat smuggling, the leader of our 
party announced in the House that the Reform Party was in 
favour of some aspects of the action plan and opposed to others.
<P>
	Our leader said that we were in favour of stronger law 
enforcement, that the Reform Party supported the government's 
anti-smoking education campaign, that the Reform Party 
supported the export tax on cigarettes, and that the Reform Party 
was opposed to reducing taxes on cigarettes.
<P>
	We supported three of the government's initiatives but we 
were opposed to reducing taxes on cigarettes. Since the 
government's announcement our Ottawa hotline has received 
over 60 voice messages and faxes. The vast majority of those 
have been opposed to reducing taxes on cigarettes.
<P>
	I stand here today to announce to the House that I am 
generally in favour of the position announced by our leader on 
February 8, 1994 in the House and that this position is consistent 
with the wishes of my constituents.
<P>
	I am going to reserve judgment, however, on each of the 
specific measures of the action plan on smuggling until my 
colleagues have spoken and provided the government with their 
analysis and introduced their constructive alternatives to the 
government.
<P>
	While Bill C-11 does not contain all the measures announced 
in the government's national action plan to combat smuggling, 
we are convinced we cannot delay the debate of all the measures 
put forward by the government in its action plan.
<P>
	We cannot wait another week or another month to debate the 
tax related issues in the House and fully inform all Canadians of 
the full impact and consequences of the action plan on 
smuggling. We should be debating all of those things right now.
<P>
	The debate should start today on all the issues concerning the 
public and not just the few measures introduced into Bill C-11. 
How many people will become addicted to smoking before the 
real debate on tax reduction can begin?
<P>
	In their calls and letters, people and the organizations they 
belong to told me some very startling facts. They told me that 
840,000 more Canadians who will take up smoking as a result of 
the reduction of taxes this government announced.
<P>
	This includes 175,000 new teenage smokers. They told me 
that 250,000 of these Canadians would die as a direct result of 
their addiction to tobacco products. They told me that in Canada 
there are 40,000 tobacco related deaths every year. This is 
before the 840,000 new  smokers join the line-up at our 
hospitals and funeral homes. They told me that when the price of 
cigarettes goes up by 10 per cent, tobacco sales to adults drop by 
4 per cent to 9 per cent. Sales to teenagers drop between 10 per 
cent and 14 per cent. Therefore it comes as no surprise that 
smoking will increase as dramatically when taxes are reduced.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	They told me the extra health care costs associated with 
treating diseases in 840,000 new smokers could cost about $1.3 
billion a year. Has the government taken this into account?
<P>
	They told me they could not understand why a smuggling 
problem in Quebec should require the lowering of cigarette 
taxes across Canada. They told me they could not understand 
why the government has taken such broad action when the 
commissioner of the RCMP has confirmed that 70 per cent of 
smuggled cigarettes pass through the three Mohawk reserves 
between Cornwall and Montreal.
<P>
	They told me they were concerned about whether the 
government's increased enforcement would be applied equally, 
regardless if the criminals live on or off Indian reserves. These 
are all questions they are asking. They also told me they could 
not understand why the Minister of Health could support the tax 
reduction on cigarettes when so many health organizations and 
most of the provincial ministers of health are so opposed.
<P>
	That is from my own province where there is strong 
opposition. They told me they were concerned about the impact 
the government's measures would have on federal-provincial 
relations and relationships between the provinces, particularly 
Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	The Reform Party welcomes this debate so these issues can be 
brought before the House and before the Canadian public. As 
everyone can see we need answers to many questions. Will the 
government agree to answer these questions for us and for all 
Canadians?
<P>
	In conclusion I want to pose some questions that Canadians 
have. First, what are the cost revenue implications in the short 
and long term? Has the government done a study? Do we know 
what the cost revenue results of this action will be?
<P>
	Second, what will be the impact on the provincial health care 
programs and the federal government's share of these increased 
costs? Will we be able to afford the increased health care costs?
<P>
	Third, what will be the impact on our law enforcement, justice 
and legal systems? We need to investigate all of these things.
<P>
	Fourth, how many jobs will be affected in the tobacco 
industry? Has a study been done on this?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1659"> 1659 </A></B>
<P>
	Fifth, how many tobacco farmers will be affected by this?
<P>
	Sixth, if there are truly no ``no go'' zones in Canada, what 
impact will the stopping of smuggling on the Mohawk reserves 
have on self-government negotiations? Has anyone checked this 
out? Did government ministers and the Liberal caucus consult 
their own members from Ontario and across Canada before 
implementing these measures? Were all people asked? Were 
these MPs not receiving the same information that we as Reform 
MPs were receiving? Will we have answers to some of these 
important questions before we vote?
<P>
	I appreciate the fact that we have the opportunity to debate 
this bill. I commend the government on its openness. I am glad I 
am able to express some of the views of my constituents and my 
own personal concerns.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that the national action plan to 
combat smuggling could be improved. Our speakers will be 
proposing constructive alternatives the government might wish 
to consider and bring forward as amendments during the 
committee stage.
<P>
	I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to 
express my views on the government's anti-smoking measures 
in Bill C-11. I hope we have a good day as we debate these 
measures.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to remind all 
members present and others who are possibly following the 
debate that we are now entering the next stage of the debate 
where members will have their speeches limited to 20 minutes 
duration and subject to 10 minutes of questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to support second reading of Bill C-11.
<P>
	As the Minister of National Revenue said, this bill is an 
important component of the government's national action plan 
to combat smuggling, the plan announced by the Prime Minister 
in the House on February 8.
<P>
	In launching this initiative, we underlined our commitment to 
taking a comprehensive and decisive approach to deal with the 
smuggling problem. This bill is a further demonstration of that 
commitment. The Minister of National Revenue has described 
how the provisions of the bill will support the revenue aspects 
involving his department of our national strategy. The Minister 
of Health will describe its health aspects. However, as Solicitor 
General I want to discuss the provisions of the bill that support 
the law enforcement component of the government's national 
action plan.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In announcing the government's strategy, the Prime Minister 
made it clear that we were attacking a national problem 
affecting all Canadians. He also clearly indicated  that the rule 
of law had to be respected and enforced and that it had to apply 
equally to all citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Given the seriousness of the smuggling problem, we knew it 
was imperative that we give police and customs officers the 
resources and powers they need to do their jobs properly to 
dismantle the smuggling trade, especially as it involves tobacco 
and alcohol.
<P>
	For that purpose we doubled the number of RCMP and 
customs personnel dedicated to anti-smuggling operations. We 
knew that numbers alone would not solve the problem. We 
realized the increase in personnel had to be part of a greater law 
enforcement strategy, one that took into account the needs of the 
various police forces involved in the fight against smuggling.
<P>
	This bill answers those law enforcement needs in three ways. 
First, the bill will allow the government to designate on an as 
needed basis provincial and municipal police services to enforce 
certain provisions of the Excise Act that formerly were within 
the sole jurisdiction of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This means that when smuggled goods enter Canada, the 
RCMP is the only law enforcement agency legally authorized 
now to confiscate alcohol and tobacco under the present Excise 
Act. If there seems to be evasion of provincial taxes, this is an 
infraction against provincial law and the provincial and 
municipal police forces can intervene.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Given the seriousness of the smuggling problem, it is only 
common sense that we have the flexibility to allow not only the 
RCMP but also other designated provincial and municipal 
police services to seize contraband alcohol and tobacco 
wherever they may find it and also to seize the equipment used 
to manufacture them in Canada as well as the vehicles used to 
transport these products. This bill will make such action 
possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Quebec Minister of Public Security and the Solicitor 
General of Ontario asked me to have the members of their 
provincial police forces, namely the Sûreté du Québec and the 
Ontario Provincial Police, empowered to enforce the Excise Act 
as I have just described.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill responds positively to these requests. It will allow us 
to improve and expand on existing co-operation with provincial 
and local police and improve as well the efficiency of joint force 
operations. It will improve the efficiency of Ontario and Quebec 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1660"> 1660 </A></B>
<P>
provincial police and other designated municipal forces 
working on their own in anti-smuggling activities.
<P>
	We have emphasized our commitment to working with the 
provinces wherever we can to ensure that the fight against 
smuggling, especially of tobacco and alcohol, is as efficient as 
we can make it. This bill is a demonstration of that commitment.
<P>
	Another key element of the bill is that it will help law 
enforcement authorities mount a more cost effective campaign 
against smuggling. It will do this through amendments to the 
Customs Act and the Excise Act that will allow the Minister of 
National Revenue to authorize officials to destroy seized goods, 
primarily tobacco and alcohol, immediately after keeping 
samples to be used as evidence in court.
<P>
	This is being done to reduce the increasingly high costs of 
storing seized goods as seizures increase as they have done in 
recent months. This is particularly true in the case of tobacco 
products.
<P>
	I am told that in Ontario alone the current costs to the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police for storing alcohol and tobacco it has 
seized is close to $2 million annually. In British Columbia the 
RCMP has run out of existing warehouse space and has had to 
take over part of an underground parking lot to meet new storage 
needs. These increasing overhead costs as seizures of alcohol 
and tobacco increase are unnecessary and avoidable. The 
proposed amendments will help us to control and hopefully to 
reduce them.
<P>
	I do want to say that in cases where the courts ultimately 
decide-and that may happen from time to time-that goods 
were improperly seized and later destroyed, the bill will require 
full compensation to be paid to the original owner of those 
goods.
<P>
	Finally, the current provisions of the Excise Act authorize the 
marking of cigarette packaging but not the marking of cigarettes 
themselves. This is not satisfactory because we have seen that 
certain criminal elements have become adept at counterfeiting 
package markings to make contraband cigarettes appear 
legitimate. The bill would broaden regulatory authority to 
include requiring the marking of cigarettes if they are for legal 
use in Canada, thereby helping enforcement authorities to curb 
counterfeit and therefore illegal packaging operations. In 
addition, clearly marked cigarettes would make it easier for 
police to identify the use of contraband cigarettes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, these three provisions-increasing the 
jurisdiction of provincial and municipal police; authorizing 
officials to destroy seized goods immediately; and marking and 
packaging tobacco products made in Canada in a way that will 
help police recognize smuggled goods-will strengthen law 
enforcement in the fight against smuggled tobacco and also help 
fight liquor smuggling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Together with the proposals regarding the prohibition of the 
sale of kiddie packs of cigarettes and other related matters to be 
discussed by the Minister of Health, the bill will continue to 
further the government's national objectives of ensuring respect 
for the law, especially the law against smuggling, everywhere in 
Canada and also protecting the health of Canadians.
<P>
	We promised Canadians that our response to smuggling would 
be far reaching and comprehensive. Given the complexity of the 
contraband issue, it must be so. The bill provides valuable tools 
for us in the fight against smuggling, especially of tobacco and 
alcohol, and it supports our commitment to protect the health of 
Canadians, especially of young Canadians. This Bill C-11 is an 
important aspect of our overall effort and I ask members on all 
sides of the House to give this bill their support.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate very much what the hon. minister has to say and agree 
very much with the necessary measures that he has had to take.
<P>
	I wonder if he would be able to comment on a couple of the 
questions that I raised not directly related to Bill C-11. What 
would be the cost of the law enforcement and what would be the 
impact on our entire law enforcement, justice and legal system if 
these extra measures are put in place? Have there been any 
studies done on this? Do you know what the implications might 
be on this? What would be the cost revenue implications in the 
short and the long term of the tax reductions and export tax 
increases?
<P>
	That is not directly related to Bill C-11 and you may not be 
able to comment on the second-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I would 
just like to remind all members to direct their comments through 
the Chair and not directly to members opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> My apologies, Mr. 
Speaker. I will try to do better.
<P>
	I had those two questions. I was virtually finished. I would 
just like to know what the impact would be on our law 
enforcement, justice and legal system and also what the cost 
revenue implications in the short and long term would be on the 
tax adjustments that have been made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not have these figures with me. I 
will endeavour to speak from memory. My remarks will be 
subject to correction either later in this debate or more 
particularly when the bill is studied in detail in the appropriate 
parliamentary committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1661"> 1661 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the initial cost of the law enforcement measures, the 
additional customs officers, the additional RCMP officers, will 
be in the area of $100 million to $150 million a year.
<P>
	The revenue implications of the tax reductions in the first year 
I think are in excess, again I am speaking from memory, of $300 
million. We estimate that this revenue loss will drop sharply in 
subsequent years as the anti-smuggling program takes effect.
<P>
	I offer these figures subject to correction as we study this 
matter in committee, but I think this is something in the ballpark 
area for what we are talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the 
comments of the critic for the Reform Party and then the 
Solicitor General. The two are sort of connected because the 
critic for the Reform Party did quote from 70 agencies and 
organizations which are opposed to the tax reduction. I received 
similar representations and so on. He did not address, which I 
think the Solicitor General addressed, the concerns of the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police.
<P>
	On February 8 the Prime Minister did table in the House the 
letter from N. D. Inkster of February 3 wherein he states: ``We 
are at a point where existing RCMP law enforcement resources 
are virtually incapable of turning the tide in this rapidly 
expanding problem, given our responsibilities across Canada''.
<P>
	Seizures have increased. This is what everyone is calling for. 
Why do we not increase our seizures? He says: ``While seizures 
have increased dramatically the extent of the problem has been 
rising at a much faster rate with the involvement of organized 
crime groups and as otherwise law abiding citizens engage in the 
criminal activity through the open purchase of contraband. I am 
convinced that a comprehensive strategy is required to address 
the smuggling problem which goes beyond an enhanced 
enforcement initiative''.
<P>
	Now that we have been into this process where we are seeing 
the results of decreased prices and increased law enforcement, 
in the opinion of the Solicitor General and in talking to the 
RCMP and other police forces could this problem have been 
resolved without reducing the price of cigarettes?
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, the advice we received from the 
commissioner of the RCMP was that tougher enforcement 
measures alone would not have been sufficient to deal with the 
problem. We have to respect that advice, coming as it does from 
the head of one of the most respected law enforcement agencies 
in the world.
<P>
	It is understandable why this advice came because we are 
dealing with a problem national in scope. It is true that there is a 
certain focus in eastern Ontario and Quebec, but the information 
also was that some 40 per cent of tobacco consumed in the 
Atlantic provinces was  smuggled, some 35 per cent of the 
tobacco consumed across Ontario was smuggled, some 15 per 
cent of the tobacco consumed in the western provinces was 
smuggled and these numbers were rising sharply.
<P>
	The information was that thousands of people were involved 
across the country in distributing this contraband tobacco. Tens 
of thousands more were buying it and consuming it. This 
involved increasingly organized smuggling rings which were 
not only involved in tobacco but also alcohol, drugs and 
firearms.
<P>
	When the problem was of such scope we had to tighten up and 
hit the smuggling rings through tougher enforcement measures. 
We also had to get the profit out of the smuggling of tobacco as a 
means of reinforcing the tougher enforcement measures. This is 
why, even though we knew of all the problems and concerns and 
even though we knew this was not an easy decision, we knew 
there was no simple solution to a problem of this complexity. We 
knew that our national plan had to have in it a component 
involving the reduction of domestic taxes on tobacco in order to 
take the profit out of smuggling. Along with that we knew we 
had to impose an export tax on tobacco and an excess profits tax 
on the tobacco companies to further squeeze out the profit but 
also to generate funds for a major anti-smoking program. We 
knew all these things had to be done.
<P>
	We concluded, and it was not something I have to say we were 
happy about, it had to be done in the public interest, that the 
national plan to deal with smuggling could not depend on 
enforcement alone. It had to depend on tax measures which as I 
have said did not only involve the reduction of domestic taxes on 
tobacco but involved substantial tax increases on the tobacco 
companies, an export tax on the products they made here and 
sent abroad, because we knew that was a source of a lot of what 
was smuggled back, and also a substantial tax on these tobacco 
companies to fund a major anti-smoking program.
<P>
	I have the greatest respect for the organizations quoted by the 
hon. spokesman for the Reform Party, but I think most of their 
communications were published before our plan went into 
effect. They feared we would ignore the tobacco companies. 
They feared we would ignore the need for an anti-smoking 
program and of course we did not ignore those key necessities. 
They are parts of our national plan. I hope that these 
organizations will take another look at what we are doing. As I 
said, I respect their concerns about the implications of tax 
reductions but a lot of the other things we are doing involve 
measures that they themselves have called for for years and now 
we are proceeding to do them.
<P>
	To sum up, enforcement is a necessary part of our program but 
it was concluded reluctantly that enforcement alone would not 
do the job. This just says something about the complexity of 
governing in a country like Canada. Sometimes problems arise 
for which there are no simple or easy solutions. Whatever way 
you  go involves problems, but it still means that governments 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1662"> 1662 </A></B>
<P>
have to take decisions and operate in the best interests of the 
country. Then when the time comes they must submit 
themselves to the judgment of the public. We are happy to do so 
in this case and with respect to the other things we have done and 
will be doing with the intention of serving the best interests of 
all Canadians, of people in every part of this country.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to mention that the marking of individual 
cigarettes was a Guelph based idea. It came from a gentleman 
named David Kennedy who is not the city treasurer, I would 
note. He is an individual citizen who is working very hard along 
with my constituency to find positive solutions for our problems 
in government. I really want to thank him.
<P>
	I would also like to make mention of the anti-smoking 
program that we are talking about initiating. I would like to ask 
the hon. member if associations such as the lung association 
may be contacted to help us in this educational process. It may 
already have many good ideas or many educational components 
in place. In order not to have a duplication of services, perhaps 
organizations like this could help us in our anti-smoking 
campaign.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member if he would comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to get too much in the 
area of the Minister of Health. I know she is going to speak and I 
am sure she is going to confirm that she and the government 
want to work co-operatively with groups like the lung 
association.
<P>
	I am sure she will confirm that we want to take advantage of 
their ideas, programs and facilities. I look forward and I think 
the government looks forward to increasing close co-operation 
between the Minister of Health, her officials and groups like the 
lung association. This co-operation is necessary to make our 
program work.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to comment in the absence of the 
Minister of Health that in fact the Minister of Health has been 
meeting with the lung association, the Heart and Stroke 
Foundation, the Canadian Medical Association and all the 
anti-smoking groups to talk about new strategies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a few comments. One is to 
thank the hon. minister for the action taken and to review what 
happened that led to this.
<P>
	This was a genuine needs driven exercise. Society had been 
getting out of hand. We had models set up on street corners. We 
had big money being made. There were ostentatious homes 
being built, not just in specific areas. Money was being made 
illegally and it became a way of life. It had to be snuffed out if 
society was to preserve itself and its integrity.
<P>
	I was personally pleased to see such action taken, particularly 
the diagnosis by the government, patiently building its case 
involving all aspects of our society before it took action. Based 
on that diagnosis the prescription was laid before us in a four 
point plan which covered very thoroughly and very 
comprehensively all aspects that undertake to eradicate this 
disease in our society.
<P>
	Finally, we saw the true action in concrete form here. I hope 
that at some stage we will follow it up with a real evaluation and 
seeing that society is back on track with law and order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, with your permission I would like to 
make a brief response to the comments by the hon. member.
<P>
	We should remind ourselves that this problem did not begin in 
the three months or so that this government has been in office. 
We are talking about a problem that built up for years without 
this kind of needed action by the previous Conservative 
government.
<P>
	This government, along with its famous red book of plans for 
creating jobs and developing the economy, also has had to deal 
with problems that are surfacing that built up under the previous 
government. We should remember this in recognizing that this 
government has been willing to take action to deal with 
immediate needs and concerns like the smuggling problem.
<P>
	Furthermore, we want to make sure that we do this in a 
balanced way. I am glad that the hon. member has pointed out 
for society the dangers of this problem we are dealing with. That 
is why our program has all these components. Yes, it has a 
tougher enforcement component. Yes, it has a taxation 
component but it also has a very important health related and 
anti-smoking component.
<P>
	I look forward to the comments of the Minister of Health later 
in the debate to build on what this is all about. I also look 
forward to the committee study where we can provide further 
detailed information.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last February 10, the Minister of National Revenue 
tabled a bill to significantly amend three other acts of 
Parliament, namely: the Excise Act, the Customs Act and the 
Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1663"> 1663 </A></B>
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to more or less balance, through 
various pieces of legislation, the government strategy against 
smuggling, which was announced in this House by the Prime 
Minister, on February 8, 1994.
<P>
	Several people working in the health field expressed concern 
regarding this national plan to fight smuggling, because of the 
adverse effects it could have on the health of Canadians and 
Quebecers. These people, including practitioners and health 
care specialists, fear an upsurge in tobacco use in general, but 
more important increased consumption among young people.
<P>
	Even though the federal government's efforts to eliminate or 
at least better restrict access to tobacco products for young 
people may be commendable, the fact is that the situation is 
serious.
<P>
	The government is proposing amendments which, it says, will 
reinforce some provisions contained in Bill C-113, which was 
passed on March 25, 1993. As you know, this legislation 
prohibits the sale of cigarettes to persons under 18 years of age.
<P>
	Just what are those provisions? Part III of Bill C-11 contains 
three amendments to the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act. 
Under section 10 of the bill, the long title of the Tobacco Sales to 
Young Persons Act is replaced by the following: an act to restrict 
access to tobacco by young persons. According to the 
government, this new title implicitly expands the scope of the 
act and reflects much more accurately the new approach of 
restricting instead of prohibiting.
<P>
	Clause 11 adds three new elements to Bill C-111. Clause 7.1 
prohibits the sale of packages containing less than 20 cigarettes. 
As of May 1, 1994 producing or selling what are commonly 
called kiddie packages, that is packages containing 10 or 15 
cigarettes, will be prohibited. Those packages, which are 
usually sold at a good price, are extremely appealing for young 
people. Their relatively low cost is also an important incentive. 
It is easy to start smoking. You never know, it could be fun.
<P>
	Clause 7.3 prohibits the importation into Canada of any 
tobacco product by a person under the age of eighteen, whether 
for personal consumption or for someone else.
<P>
	In recent weeks, we have looked at the legal and tax aspects of 
the question, and particularly at the thorny issue of cigarette 
smuggling. In the process, we also put the health and well-being 
of Canadians and Quebecers on the back burner.
<P>
	According to Dr. Richard Lessard, who is the Director of 
Public Health for Health and Social Services, Montreal Centre 
branch, it would be a mistake to limit the debate to legal and tax 
considerations. A major issue takes precedence over tobacco 
smuggling, and that is the health of Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	Dr. Lessard himself said that tobacco consumption is 
currently linked to 40 per cent of deaths due to cardiovascular 
complications-to 87 per cent of deaths due to lung cancer, and 
to 80 per cent of respiratory diseases. Low birth weight is twice 
as common among babies whose mothers smoke than among 
those whose mothers do not smoke. And currently, the increase 
in smoking is higher among young women.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Young Canadians start smoking between the age of 11 and 15. 
At fifteen years of age, 22 per cent of males and almost 30 per 
cent of females are smoking. Also, 65 per cent of these teenagers 
are paying for their cigarettes out of their own pockets. Any 
public policy, whether it is non inaction in fighting smuggling or 
lowering taxes on tobacco, if not linked to aggressive preventive 
measures, does encourage these vulnerable teenagers to start 
smoking.
<P>
	According to Dr. Lessard, tobacco-related health problems 
cost $2.5 billion to Quebec and $9.5 billion to Canada, even 
though, before the current crisis, tobacco consumption had 
decreased by 40 per cent since
<P>
	Several health officials have criticized the decrease in sale 
prices of cigarettes following the tax reduction announced by 
the government. They think it will only encourage the most 
vulnerable groups, teenagers and young women, to start 
smoking.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Lévis, mentioned and 
rightly so the devastating effect of smoking among our young. 
We think educational measures must accompany the legislation 
which was announced. We must develop new programs and 
support the current ones by investing in mass advertising.
<P>
	We must also make businesspeople aware of their social 
responsibility. Bill C-111 goes ahead by implementing 
measures concerning tobacco sales. For example, the stamp 
prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors is a step in the 
right direction.
<P>
	We also need to make some long-term investments in an 
anti-smoking campaign. I am pleased to report that the Quebec 
government has undertaken a major anti-smoking campaign to 
urge young smokers to change attitudes. Several governments in 
Canada have decided to follow suit.
<P>
	Bill C-11 includes provisions concerning the Excise Act and 
the Customs Act which confer new powers on the minister and 
various police forces in Canada and in Quebec responsible for 
enforcing the law throughout the country. According to the 
government, these provisions will provide the new legal tools 
which are needed to achieve better enforcement of the law and to 
continue the fight against smuggling.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1664"> 1664 </A></B>
<P>
	One interesting provision of this bill is found in clause 9 
which says that the minister may authorize an officer to sell or 
destroy the seized goods.
<P>
	It goes without saying that the government will never 
proceed, I am convinced, with the sale of seized tobacco 
products. This is commonly done in some American States but it 
would be out of place in this country given the current situation. 
However, the equipment and facilities used to carry or stock 
these goods could, of course, be sold. This could become an 
interesting source of funds to be reinvested in anti-smuggling 
programs or in a public awareness campaign.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	In order to be successful in its fight against the harmful effect 
of tobacco, the government must maintain the National Strategy 
to Reduce Tobacco Use. As its title says, the main objective of 
this action plan, developed in co-operation with the provincial 
governments, is to reduce tobacco use.
<P>
	Every member of the House knows that this strategy has three 
objectives: to protect the health and rights of non-smokers, to 
prevent non-smokers from picking up the habit and to help 
smokers who want to quit smoking.
<P>
	In this context, in order to effectively reduce tobacco use, 
there has to be a concerted effort by all levels of government and 
by non-governmental organizations.
<P>
	We believe that the government must harmonize the various 
legislative measures in place to combat the use of tobacco and 
its effects. We believe that the measures proposed in Bill C-11 
respecting the sale of tobacco to young people must be 
accompanied by a genuine desire to eradicate smoking.
<P>
	The problem of tobacco use will not be solved simply by 
making it harder for young people to obtain tobacco products 
through more or less coercive measures aimed at merchants, 
producers and consumers.
<P>
	The government must not shirk its responsibilities. As Dr. 
Lessard said, our governments have already made a 
commitment to health and have understood that making a 
long-term investment in our collective health will help us, as a 
society, solve our serious economic problems. During the 
present budget cutting period affecting health care in Quebec, 
and probably in other provinces, how can we explain the 
omission of health considerations in the debate since the major 
consequence of this crisis is sickness?
<P>
	How can we fail to see that the only winners are tobacco 
companies? Should our society yield to an industry which takes 
our own health hostage and which economists say is steadily 
losing ground in our economy?
<P>
	We understand the important economic and legal issues 
involved in the revolt of some elements of our population 
against taxes, and the general outrage over smuggling and its 
corrupting effects. Prompted by the rumblings of public 
discontent, our ministers of justice  and finance laid out some 
very convincing arguments on that point.
<P>
	It seems urgent and critical to ask the premiers to listen also to 
the arguments of their health ministers and to renew their 
commitment to the well-being of the population.
<P>
	It is crucial to reintroduce social and human dimensions into 
the present debate. No government should be allowed to forget 
the health and well-being of its population for purely fiscal 
considerations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to speak to the section of Bill C-11 which will 
amend the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act. Action on the 
proposed amendment is one more important step in our ongoing 
efforts to address the problem of tobacco consumption, 
particularly among Canadian youth.
<P>
	The Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act was proclaimed into 
law Tuesday, February 8, as a component of the government's 
anti-smuggling initiative. It raises the legal age of purchase 
from 16 to 18. It restricts the location of cigarette vending 
machines to bars, taverns and similar beverage rooms. It also 
increases the penalties for selling tobacco to minors.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	A new range of fines has been established for any sale to 
persons under the age of 18 and includes sales through a vending 
machine. For a first offence the fine will be up to $1,000, for a 
second offence up to $2,000, up to $10,000 for a third offence, 
and for subsequent offences a fine of up to $50,000 can be 
levied.
<P>
	The amendment now before us relates to kiddie packs of 
cigarettes, as they are commonly known. Kiddie packs are 
packages that contain fewer than 20 cigarettes and are usually 
available in packs of 15 and 5. I have seen these kiddie packs. 
They often look like a chocolate bar. It is very surprising to see 
these packages of cigarettes that could be any kind of a 
chocolate bar being sold to young people with no questions 
asked. It is very important we ban them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Kiddie packs began to appear in Canadian stores in the late 
1980s. Producers of tobacco products said at the time that they 
had taken that approach to please adult smokers but, like 
Canadian health organizations, I believe that their availability 
increases the risk that young people start smoking.
<P>
	Those packages have a special appeal for young people 
because they look attractive and their price is lower than that of 
regular packages. They are more affordable for young people 
who do not have much money, and younger people find them 
easier to hide from parents and teachers. As I said, some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1665"> 1665 </A></B>
<P>
packages contain only five cigarettes, and look like a chocolate 
bar.
<P>
	A poll taken in Nova Scotia in 1990 indicated that the 
majority of teenagers who smoke buy kiddie packs. Among 
sixth grade smokers, in the 11 to 13 age group, almost half of 
them buy kiddie packs. That research was done four years ago, 
but the situation is probably the same today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-11 will prohibit the sale of packages containing fewer 
than 20 cigarettes. It will also prohibit tobacco manufacturers 
from producing packages that contain fewer than 20 cigarettes. 
For selling and for offering for sale kiddie packs, the legislation 
provides for a maximum sentence on summary conviction of a 
$2,000 fine or six months, or both. On conviction on indictment 
the maximum sentence is a fine of $100,000 or two years, or 
both. For producing kiddie packs the maximum sentence on a 
summary conviction is a $200,000 fine or six months, or both. 
On conviction on indictment the maximum sentence is a 
$500,000 fine or two years, or both.
<P>
	The government recognized that the action plan to combat 
smuggling and the tax measures associated with it would pose 
health risks. Let me assure members that we are just as 
determined to deal with tobacco use as we are with the 
smuggling problem. This amendment is just one more step in 
our efforts to eliminate tobacco consumption.
<P>
	The action plan included a very strong health component. One 
element of that was legislative. In this area we have taken 
immediate action through proclamation of the Tobacco Sales to 
Young Persons Act and introduction of the amendment 
concerning kiddie packs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are also moving to give more teeth to law enforcement. 
Some 300 Health Canada inspectors have already been 
designated under the law and, as an interim measure, they will 
be available to monitor law enforcement while carrying out 
other tasks. During the next two months, we will publish a 
training kit and new inspectors will be hired to take over and 
control the enforcement of the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons 
Act.
<P>
	Other ongoing enforcement activities include sending to all 
retailers in Canada explanatory letters and signs. Those signs 
must be posted in a prominent position in all places where 
tobacco products are found or sold. Any retailer who refuses to 
post those signs indicating that it is prohibited selling tobacco 
products to persons less than 18 years old will be liable to a fine 
up to $250.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	We will also put ads in newspapers to inform retailers of their 
obligations under the new act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As well we are looking at what action might be taken in such 
areas as plain packaging and product standards. Plain packaging 
contains no distinctive colouring, although it would permit the 
use of trademarks. Many health advocates feel that plain 
packaging, making products less distinct and promotion much 
more difficult would be an effective deterrent.
<P>
	In the area of products standards, we are looking forward to 
bringing new regulations requiring manufacturers to provide 
information on the packages about the chemical compounds 
contained in tobacco and tobacco smoke.
<P>
	A comprehensive educational campaign is also being 
mounted. It will be aimed at the general public and at key 
groups, such as young people and women, and will be developed 
in consultation with the provincial and territorial governments 
and the non-government health organization.
<P>
	Action has already begun on a number of 
promotional-educational activities. A national media campaign 
began last week directed primarily at young people through the 
radio and television stations they most often watch and listen to.
<P>
	We will also be working closely with our health group and 
provincial government partners to develop a system for 
monitoring tobacco consumption, particularly by young people. 
The acquisition of consumption information on a regular basis 
will be essential in measuring the success of our initiatives and 
planning the development of even more effective action in the 
future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Tobacco use among many groups which are hard to reach is 
alarming. Those groups do not usually respond to traditional 
anti-smoking ads. We will be making special efforts to reach 
them.
<P>
	We will also make more efforts to reach families, new parents, 
health care people and other people who are important role 
models for children. We will support education programs and 
community activities.
<P>
	A health surtax will be levied on profits of tobacco products 
makers for three years to finance special initiatives. We believe 
that tobacco companies are responsible and that they must pay 
the price.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are looking over the next three years at one of the most 
concerted efforts ever undertaken in the health education field. 
This is the toughest program that any jurisdiction has taken 
against tobacco products. During the past several years our 
co-operative initiatives have been very successful in reducing 
consumption among the population over age 15. I am confident 
these new resources will permit us to build on those successes. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1666"> 1666 </A></B>
<P>
To do so will require continued co-operation and close 
collaboration.
<P>
	I have had discussions during the past two weeks with 
representatives of health organizations and with provincial and 
territorial ministers of health. At my recent meeting with 
ministers of health I offered to work with them on the best way 
to use the resources provided in the new federal anti-smoking 
strategy.
<P>
	My officials and I are committed to seeking the advice and 
assistance of these groups as together we strive to reduce the 
demands for tobacco, the number one cause of preventable death 
in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the Minister of National Health and Welfare as I do 
every time she answers questions in the House about smoking.
<P>
	Here again, the minister means well with these measures to 
prevent smoking, but as I said during my speech, the Official 
Opposition is somewhat apprehensive about the enforcement of 
these measures. You referred to the cost of so-called kiddie 
packs-packages containing fewer than 20 cigarettes-which 
will now be prohibited. I think we should remember that because 
taxes have been cut, in Quebec at least, the price has gone down 
considerably, so that today, a pack of fewer than 20 cigarettes is 
much cheaper. In fact, a pack of more than 20 cigarettes is now 
cheaper than a pack of 15 cigarettes used to be. In other words, 
cost is an important factor.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I would appreciate it if the minister could give us her thoughts 
about this and whether she thinks this aspect was properly 
evaluated, because there has been a drop in the cost of a pack of 
cigarettes. We know that people who smoke more than 20 
cigarettes a day are considered to be heavy smokers, which is 
very dangerous to one's health.
<P>
	The minister mentioned new inspectors. I wish she would 
specify, if she is in a position to do so today, the number of new 
inspectors to which she is committed and what this will cost. As 
for the fines, I do not think they are all that severe. It all depends 
on the offence and the extent of the offence. I would like to tell 
you a story about the legislation to prohibits smoking in 
government buildings.
<P>
	At the CBC there was a massive operation to enforce the new 
legislation as soon as the rule came into effect. The amount that 
people were fined added up to a considerable amount of money, 
and when employees protested, it all ended without anyone 
paying fines.
<P>
	My point is that when the government decides to enforce this 
legislation, I hope it will do so fairly and squarely across Canada 
and will have the requisite number of inspectors to do so. We 
also have to provide for cases where one will not be able to count 
on the co-operation of provincial or other police forces. We will 
need a lot of inspectors to cover the territory involved. I  am not 
so sure they will be able to do that. There is also the risk of 
partial enforcement.
<P>
	I mentioned what happened at the CBC, but it could happen in 
any other company or community, when all of a sudden 
individuals are fined and notice that meanwhile, people 
somewhere else can continue to smoke with impunity, and I am 
thinking of young people particularly. This may produce a sense 
of injustice, of being picked on while other people can go on 
breaking the law without being penalized.
<P>
	I would appreciate the minister's views on the subject.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marleau: </B>Mr. Speaker, I should explain that the fines are 
imposed in the case of sales of cigarettes to young people. It is 
true we now have inspectors, but we had them before. Their 
mandate is to ensure that retailers do not sell to young people.
<P>
	However, the objective is to make all retailers be very careful 
about whom they are selling cigarettes to. As you know, some 
young people do not look very mature. They look more like 
10-year-olds when they come to the convenience store to buy 
cigarettes.
<P>
	Store owners should realize that these kids should not be 
buying cigarettes, that they should not have them, and that it is 
against the law. Of course we want the inspectors to do their job, 
but we are convinced that most retailers are or will be aware of 
the harmful effects of smoking. We want to ensure that young 
people do not have easy access to cigarettes. That is very 
important. So that is the other reason for removing kiddie packs.
<P>
	As you know, when these kids come home with a package of 
cigarettes, their parents notice. These kiddie packs are much 
easier to hide. When you see a kiddie pack, you know it is 
intended for kids. That is the whole purpose.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Selling cigarettes to kids is the opposite of what we want to 
do. We are sure we will get the co-operation of most retailers 
because this is essential to the well-being of Canadian society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the Minister of Health on her presentation. I 
appreciate what the government is trying to do in this area. It has 
taken a balanced approach and has tried to address all the issues 
involved in this very complex problem.
<P>
	My constituents have raised another health problem young 
people experience which relates directly to this issue. Some 
experts I have heard addressing this problem indicate that 
alcohol could also be one of the great problems we will be faced 
with. After all these measures are taken on tobacco, society's 
criminal elements will be looking for new ways to profit. There 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1667"> 1667 </A></B>
<P>
is a large market in alcohol and they would target young people. 
Smuggling could suddenly become very profitable.
<P>
	In light of the fact that this is a big problem among young 
people and is a potential smuggling problem, would the minister 
be willing to commit to take similar initiatives in the area of 
alcohol abuse and the smuggling which will take place as 
tobacco becomes controlled? Would she be willing to comment 
on or address this problem?
<P>
	Many constituents are wondering about the domino effect. 
Will the reduction of taxes on tobacco mean a reduction of taxes 
on alcohol and many other products that are susceptible to being 
smuggled?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are determined to end the 
smuggling network. That was the reason for bringing down the 
prices on cigarettes.
<P>
	While we realize some alcohol is coming through the same 
network it is certainly not the same size of a problem, although it 
is a problem. We are convinced we will win against the networks 
in the law and order problem we are addressing.
<P>
	When it comes to sales to young persons, liquor is not a 
product that can be sold to young people anywhere in the 
country. It is not legal now. In terms of sales of tobacco products 
to young people, we are trying to establish the same kind of 
limits. Then everyone knows it is just as illegal to sell tobacco to 
young people under the age of 18 as it is to sell alcohol to them. 
That is the basis of the changes we have brought forward. It is 
very important that all the people of Canada co-operate in this 
matter.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
appreciate very much the remarks of the Minister of Health.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister could respond to my question with 
respect to the briefing we had yesterday. This is not meant as a 
challenge in any way. It is for my clarification.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the manufacture of kiddie packs 
will continue until May 1, 1994. That means there are still two 
months of production left for this particular kind of package and 
I understand it was for the transition for the manufacture of this 
product.
<P>
	It seems somewhat unusual, almost to the point of ludicrous 
that we would have a package available in the marketplace for 
two months when we are looking to enforce a particular law.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Could the minister give her assurance that she will look into 
this and explain how she will ensure that the kiddie packs are not 
sold to minors from now until May 1, 1994?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I share the hon. member's 
concerns.
<P>
	One of the challenges we face is that we are now debating Bill 
C-11 and it is not yet law. The sooner this law can be passed the 
sooner we can end the sale of these kiddie packs. It is not 
unlawful to sell or to manufacture them until the law receives 
final approval. It is essential that the bill move on as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	The manufacturers are very much aware. The notice is out 
there that very quickly it will be unlawful to produce and sell 
them.
<P>
	It would be well and wise if we could get this piece of 
legislation through all stages very quickly including the Senate 
and royal assent stages.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as the elected representative of the constituents of Calgary 
Southeast and as such I speak for and with them.
<P>
	Having said that and anticipating this debate, I not only 
tracked the calls and letters that came to me, but I also 
conducted a poll in my riding. Of those polled, 58 per cent 
opposed the government's proposed tax rollback. I am pleased 
to bring their collective wisdom and opinions to the debate 
today.
<P>
	The motion before us has three components. I will speak in 
particular to the amendments to the Tobacco Sales to Young 
Persons Act. I do have some personal thoughts and insights I 
would like to bring to bear as well. Before doing that, it is 
critical to consider what this legislation is intended to 
accomplish.
<P>
	The government alleges it is concerned with the massive 
smuggling problem facing our country today. Therefore Bill 
C-11 has been put forward by the government as part of a 
national action plan to combat smuggling. This legislation and 
the accompanying plan to combat smuggling tell me four things.
<P>
	First, the legislation shows that the Government of Canada 
cannot enforce its own laws. Second, it shows that the influence 
of the tobacco industry is highly sophisticated and tremendously 
powerful. Third, Bill C-11 shows us that the deficit is not a 
concern of the federal government. Fourth, the legislation 
clearly shows that the federal government has little appreciation 
for the health and welfare of Canada's youth.
<P>
	I will deal with the first point, that the Government of Canada 
shows us it cannot enforce its own laws. The government admits 
there is a substantial problem with smuggling, that people are 
going outside the law to maximize their own personal profits. 
However instead of strictly enforcing the laws as they now exist, 
the government chooses to change them. This is a vain hope. 
This legislation may put an end to the high level of tobacco 
smuggling but it is a half measure and will not stop the 
smuggling.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1668"> 1668 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe in a good challenge to any debate. My first challenge 
to the government is this: Why was the law so poorly enforced 
that new measures are now required? Will these make the new 
law any easier to enforce?
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	My next challenge questions the influence of the tobacco 
industry. This highly sophisticated and powerful lobby has 
finally succeeded in getting the government to backtrack on the 
largest contributing factor to the decrease in tobacco sales. That 
was high taxes on tobacco products. The people of Canada are 
already cynical and have lost faith in the credibility of the 
government. How will the government restore that faith given 
that it appears to have bowed to the pressure of the tobacco 
industry's lobby efforts?
<P>
	The federal government in proposing Bill C-11 will forgo 
revenue in an attempt to stop smuggling. In so doing the federal 
government makes it clear that our deficit and our debt are not 
priorities.
<P>
	The Prime Minister admitted that in 1994-95 alone the 
government expects to lose $300 million in revenue because of 
the reduction in tobacco taxes. The Prime Minister goes on to 
suggest the health promotion surtax on profits of tobacco 
manufacturers will generate some $200 million over three years. 
The government release on the action plan to combat smuggling 
suggests this $200 million will fund a range of health promotion 
activities, including measures to reduce smoking. This sounds 
fine and good, but who will pay for it?
<P>
	The government estimates the tax revenue lost to be $300 
million in the first year alone. It then asserts it will generate 
$200 million from taxes on the tobacco industry. These numbers 
are questionable to me. At best there will be a shortfall of $100 
million, not including the further cost of the health promotion 
programs the government says are a priority. This immediate 
shortfall of $100 million is substantial but does not compare to 
the health costs to be incurred under the plan.
<P>
	By reducing taxes we are encouraging existing smokers to 
smoke more and we are making it easier for new smokers to get 
hooked on the habit. Smokers will add further strain to our 
health care system. They do not require care today, but 10 to 15 
years from now the government will regret the day of this 
decision.
<P>
	Studies and experience over the past few decades have proven 
there is a direct correlation between smoking and heart disease 
and smoking and cancers of the lung, the oesophagus, the 
mouth, the tongue and the larynx. It has also been shown that 
smoking has a detrimental effect on unborn children.
<P>
	What will be the eventual financial cost? The numbers just do 
not work for this program.
<P>
	The third challenge to the government is to decide how best to 
address the problem of the deficit without complex tax 
alternatives. This is not a solution to cigarette smuggling; quite 
frankly it is just blowing smoke.
<P>
	My fourth point is that Bill C-11 shows that the federal 
government really has very little concern for the health and 
welfare of the nation's youth. Taxes on cigarettes and tobacco 
products were high for a reason: they brought the government 
revenue. More than that statistics showed that high taxes 
directly correlated to a decrease in tobacco sales especially 
among our youth. Simply put, cigarettes became too expensive.
<P>
	Health and Welfare Canada states that when the price of 
tobacco products rises by 10 per cent, sales to adults drop by 4 to 
9 per cent. More significant, sales to teenagers drop by 10 per 
cent to 14 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	This legislation has some very serious implications for the 
health of our nation, particularly our youth. Dr. Robert Allen is 
the Canadian professor of economics who contends that if the 
tax cut to the price of tobacco in Quebec is implemented in the 
rest of Canada it will result in 840,000 more smokers and 
175,000 of them will be teenagers.
<P>
	The government contends that it has a plan that will keep our 
youth from smoking. The idea, as I see it, is to keep cheap 
cigarettes out of the hands of our young people. The 
government, however, chooses to change a plan that was 
working well. Smoking was on the decline in Canada and young 
people including my daughter were being discouraged from 
smoking.
<P>
	My daughter, despite objections and at first unknown to us, 
began smoking at the age of 12. She would smoke several 
packages a week and nothing we said or did made any 
difference. When we travelled in the United States she would 
buy cheap cartons of American cigarettes and smoke like a 
chimney until they were gone. However, back home again she 
was back to her usual habit of a couple of packs a week. She 
could not afford the high cost of cigarettes.
<P>
	As these costs have increased, her usage has decreased. It 
saddens me to think that a government action will now further 
encourage my daughter's smoking addiction.
<P>
	The government proposes another idea to reduce the number 
of young people smoking and that is banning the kiddie pack. I 
believe this idea to be ridiculous. As a young constituent 
working in a local gas station confided, mostly it is the older 
people who buy kiddie packs. The cool kids buy packs of 25 and 
not kiddie packs.
<P>
	There will always be a part of our population that tries to beat 
the rules, and undoubtedly the moral hazard will take its toll on 
this legislation. If young people want cigarettes, and thanks to 
Bill C-11 they will be able to afford them, they will be able to 
get them. They will lie in bed at night thinking about how. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1669"> 1669 </A></B>
<P>
government has  only increased the age of prohibition and even 
that becomes irrelevant when there is no commensurate will to 
enforce it.
<P>
	There has only been one measure that has worked in 
minimizing the access of our youth to tobacco products, high 
taxes. I challenge members opposite me and all my colleagues 
on this side of the House to recognize the wisdom of this 
measure. As a young adult recently said to me, the government 
should raise taxes on those things that are bad for us and lower 
taxes on those things that are good for us.
<P>
	Governments must recognize their social responsibility to our 
youth. When this happens, parents like me can say thanks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of questions. I was listening to the hon. member and her 
obvious genuine concern about the fact that smoking is an 
addiction. I speak as former chain smoker. I ended that practice 
about 25 years ago.
<P>
	There is a little mythology that has to be cleared up here. I 
wonder if the hon. member could tell us who she thinks is 
smoking the contraband cigarettes, who she thinks is smoking 
the cheap stuff.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	If you go into schools you will find that counterfeit cigarettes 
are being sold out of the trunks of cars.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I remind 
members once again of the wisdom of directing questions 
through the Chair as opposed to what may seem a more personal 
way of ``you in this'', ``you in that'' and ``un vous ici, un vous 
la''. Put me to work or keep me in my chair but, please, through 
the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for that correction. I will 
start again. Pardon the oversight.
<P>
	It is the young people who unfortunately have been buying 
these lower priced contraband cigarettes. As a result, more and 
more young people are being exposed to tobacco because of the 
smuggling. Therefore attempts had to be made to correct the 
problem.
<P>
	I advise the hon. member that the situation in which the tax 
has been dropped is considered a temporary situation and will be 
corrected as soon as the issue of tobacco smuggling is corrected.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his comments.
<P>
	I want the member to acknowledge that I was speaking from 
some personal experience and from the point that I wish to 
challenge the change to the law, why we are changing the way 
we have been performing our function and why the government 
feels that laws which were in place prior to this one were not 
good enough. I tried to make that point in my discussion.
<P>
	I must say I did not realize this change was only a temporary 
one. That really astonishes me. I thought we were debating a 
change that was for the long term. I will just leave it at that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I inform the hon. member 
with regard to a few of her earlier comments that she was 
incorrect in saying the government was not concerned with law 
enforcement. We are very concerned with law enforcement. 
That is one of the main reasons behind the bill.
<P>
	The RCMP commissioner has told the government that we 
needed to take action and that is what this plan is. It is action so 
that we can have law enforcement in the country.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that this problem started long ago. 
When we came upon the scene a short 100 days ago, this 
government was faced with a momentous problem. It was not a 
small problem and it was not something that just started. It is 
something that has been going on for years. We are taking 
action. We are addressing the problem.
<P>
	Second, I also remind the hon. member that we are concerned 
with the deficit and that is why we are taking action. We are 
losing over a billion dollars because of smuggled cigarettes. 
There are 75 million cartons being smuggled back into Canada. 
That is a serious problem that needs to be addressed and that is 
what the government is doing.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not believe that spending an additional 
$185 million in health is not a good idea, is not the idea behind 
education or is not an idea to promote the awareness of the 
problems with smoking? Is that not a concrete answer to some of 
the problems raised by the health groups? This government 
looked at the whole package.
<P>
	We looked at the effect of lowering the tax. We looked at the 
concern from the health groups. We put together a whole 
package. I would like the hon. member's comments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to ask 
clarification from the hon. member on a couple of things. I 
appreciate the comments from the other side. They very much 
enrich the kind of debate we are having here today.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe the Solicitor General earlier in the discussion this 
morning said tougher law enforcement would not have achieved 
the desired result to end smuggling. Therefore I have to ask why 
the hon. member suggested so strongly that my comments about 
law enforcement were not completely correct.
<P>
	I believe in my statement I gave a challenge to this debate 
concerning why we are changing our laws at this point. Enforce-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1670"> 1670 </A></B>
<P>
ment is a very important element of any law structure. It seemed 
to me that those who are there to  enforce the law have a 
responsibility to do that to the full extent. I was just asking the 
question about why we have to change the law. The Solicitor 
General said that tougher law enforcement would not have 
achieved the desired result. I am a little confused as to the point 
the member was trying to make.
<P>
	I concur with the hon. member that education is a very 
important facet of what we are trying to accomplish. I believe, 
however, that by opening the door to increased smoking we are 
looking at a huge health problem further down the road.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I address a few issues presented by my colleague. As a former 
producer of the product and a health care professional and now a 
politician, I can certainly look at this through many windows. 
Being a member representing tobacco growers in my riding, I 
felt I had to comment on some of the statements made earlier.
<P>
	As to the fact of the government not being concerned with the 
deficit, with the amount of contraband cigarettes we are not 
collecting revenue the way it stands now. Therefore the option 
given to us to roll back the taxes was an option that would help 
alleviate this problem and perhaps down the road reintroduce 
the taxes so that revenue would be regenerated.
<P>
	With regard to the government's lack of concern for health, I 
have always been a non-smoker. My husband was a smoker and 
I have two children who are non-smokers. It was their decision 
not to smoke. It was their choice. They were certainly exposed to 
the element. We all are and it is our choice to do so. The 
government has not legislated common sense.
<P>
	Therefore I speak on the issue from the respect that it is a legal 
product and we have to address it in that manner.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
nothing to say except that those comments are well received and 
well said. I thank the hon. member for them.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before recognizing the 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River, I wonder if he could 
indicate to the Chair if he will be sharing his time or using the 
full 20-minute complement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my understanding that members of the government side will 
be splitting their time from here into 10-minute segments.
<P>
	I am very happy to be able to speak to the issue involving the 
government's initiative to address the very serious problem of 
tobacco smuggling. It is my view the problem is not just a 
smoking problem, not just a revenue problem.
<P>
	In my remarks today I want to choose a perspective that would 
target organized crime as the problem. Those who are 
professional organized criminals would probably argue with me 
that they are not the problem but rather simply a manifestation 
or symptom of another part of the problem. I differ with them at 
this time given the size and volume of the smuggling. In other 
very obvious problems in our society, organized crime is very 
much a part of the problem and I believe it is integral to the 
solution to this program and integral to solutions to other 
criminal problems we have in our society, which I will refer to 
later in my speech.
<P>
	Bill C-11 has been adequately described here by the ministers 
and members from both sides of the House who have discussed 
it. It will facilitate police enforcement of the anti-smuggling 
measures. It will also permit authorities to begin or to continue 
or to redouble their efforts against the incentive to smoke.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	These are some new tools provided by Bill C-11 which I 
regard as relatively small in stature in dealing with the current 
problems of cigarette and other types of contraband smuggling. 
I think I agree with the previous speakers that enforcement is 
very much a part of the solution. However, it is not the only 
solution.
<P>
	The measures announced by the Prime Minister on February 8 
will hopefully permit us as a society in the short run and in the 
long run to deal with the problem of cigarette addiction. At the 
moment our initiative I believe deals with organized crime, 
revenue and interdiction, re-establishing an orderly Canadian 
market in the commodity of tobacco.
<P>
	What is the background here? I sat in the last Parliament for 
five years. Relatively early in that Parliament it became 
apparent that cigarette smoking was going to be a very serious 
problem. It grew and grew to the point where 40 per cent of the 
existing $12.4 billion Canadian tobacco industry was being 
controlled by smugglers. It was putting approximately $5 
billion per year into the pockets of smugglers.
<P>
	I point out that 95 per cent of the smuggling operation was 
controlled by organized crime. That type of smuggling, the 
volume of it, and the existence of organized crime was causing 
very obvious social and economic distortions at least regionally 
in our country and perhaps arguably across the whole country.
<P>
	If action had not been taken at this time, I suppose we would 
wish that action had been taken a year or two years ago. In any 
event, we are acting now. If action had not been taken, it is 
estimated that more than 50 per cent of the cigarette market 
would have been dominated by the so-called smugglers, 
organized crime, with a value to organized crime of $6.2 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1671"> 1671 </A></B>
<P>
	Illegal tobacco seizures by the RCMP increased from 303 in 
1990 to 5,044 in 1993, but even at that the RCMP told us that 
they were only seizing about 1 per cent of the illegal tobacco 
market.
<P>
	Trafficking in illegal tobacco products had become an 
extremely lucrative enterprise. The profits to be made were so 
high that individuals involved in the drug trafficking trade are 
now engaging in the smuggling of contraband tobacco products. 
Traditional organized crime groups are also very much 
involved.
<P>
	I want to cite a remark by the President of Colombia, a 
country that certainly knows organized crime very well, as I 
understand it, and is very much involved in the very unfortunate 
sequences that have befallen it in the drug trafficking trade. The 
President of Colombia said that the only law drug traffickers 
have not broken is the law of supply and demand. That is 
essential to my perspective in this particular intervention.
<P>
	With the profit potential from contraband cigarettes gone, the 
organized crime elements that cause cigarette smuggling to 
virtually explode in recent years in our view will likely 
withdraw from the activity of smuggling cigarettes. With this 
new initiative the problem of contraband cigarettes will be dealt 
an effective and decisive blow.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Cigarette smuggling is not the root of the problem. It is only a 
symptom, as I said before. The same applies to other problems 
of smuggling involving alcohol, firearms, pornography, 
prostitution, gun smuggling and gambling. The root of the 
problem is the opportunity for profit that each of these areas 
provides to organized crime.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister responded, he responded by first 
listening to the experts. The experts, the police authorities in the 
country, told the Prime Minister that they, by using existing 
enforcement methods, could not control the volume of 
smuggling and illegal activity being fostered by organized 
crime. The government's response therefore is one that is based 
on the advice of the experts. We could see no other way to deal 
with this.
<P>
	Our program is strategic and not based on a simple issue of 
profit or a simple issue of revenue or a simple issue of a person 
deciding or not deciding to smoke. We must look at the whole 
problem and I believe that is what we have done.
<P>
	Organized crime has more monetary resources than many 
police agencies. Crime organizations typically use sophisticated 
equipment to identify intrusive devices and employ 
countersurveillance methods to elude detection while they are 
conducting their illegal transactions. They employ computers, 
legal and financial experts and others to assist in the day to day 
operations of their illegal enterprises. They use sophisticated 
money laundering techniques to divert substantial portions of 
their profits into legitimate businesses.
<P>
	Organized criminals attracted by high income activities, and 
these are high income activities, seek out crimes which produce 
the highest profit with the lowest risk. Current illegal activities, 
I have mentioned some of them, include not just tobacco, but 
alcohol, guns, gambling, prostitution, alien smuggling and 
pornography.
<P>
	We could I believe literally fill our jails to overflowing with 
drug addicts, drug dealers and smugglers. As long as there is 
money to be made in the black market for any of these 
commodities, organized crime will have an incentive to recruit 
other people, other consumers and find other ways to carry on 
their illegal activity.
<P>
	Integral to our strategy is the need to disable organized crime, 
at least in this field of tobacco smuggling.
<P>
	Some examples of expert opinion are from Thomas O'Grady, 
Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. He states: ``Law 
enforcement communities, the public and appropriate levels of 
government'', that includes us, ``must continue to work together 
in developing laws and enforcement programs to make it both 
undesirable and unprofitable to organized crime groups to gain 
inroads in areas of gaming operations''. There are similar views 
from all around the world published in Canadian legislatures, 
the United States congressional records, the United Nations 
records, European records, all focusing on this serious problem 
of profit as an incentive to organized crime.
<P>
	I believe, much in the way we dealt with this particular 
problem of tobacco, we must also deal with drug addiction. We 
must be strategic. I would like to think that this government will 
have the ability, the opportunity and the support of Canadians to 
be able to deal with that other great evil of drug addiction by 
looking at the entire picture of taxation, of interdiction, of 
distribution of supply and demand, of all the laws when we 
address this serious problem of drug addiction.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to support Bill C-11.
<P>
	As members know, part of this bill deals with the Customs Act 
and the Excise Act and it therefore deals with issues such as 
seizure, enforcement, identifying smuggled goods and in fact 
with a lot of the law and order issues that pertain to smuggling.
<P>
	The other part of this bill deals with the effects on young 
people of the lowering of the tobacco prices. I want to say that as 
a physician, my expertise has always been in the matter of 
health. My expertise is also with regard to smoking and 
anti-smoking issues. I have been involved in this issue for many 
years.
<P>
	When I came to this House I was only aware of my one 
perspective. The issue to me was solely the effect of smoking on 
health. That issue has been well related by everyone here in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1672"> 1672 </A></B>
<P>
House today. It is no secret to anyone that smoking is the single 
most preventable cause of death and illness in the world.
<P>
	It is no secret to anyone that the World Health Organization 
has said that from the year 1990 to the year 2000 if smoking 
continues at the rate that it is going, the number of people dying 
in the world from smoking will be over 40 million people which 
will be greater than all of the people who have died in all of the 
wars in the 20th century. That tells members that smoking is in 
fact a deadly disease and a deadly issue.
<P>
	However, when I came to the House I was not aware of the 
other side of this issue, the issue of smuggling. It is well 
documented that in fact the increase in tobacco prices has had a 
significant effect and is perhaps the biggest gun in the whole 
strategy of anti-smoking legislation.
<P>
	Increasing tobacco prices in fact decreases the access to 
tobacco for young people. We know that between the ages of 13 
and 20 young people having access to tobacco have a great risk 
of addiction.
<P>
	I was very concerned that one of the ways of dealing with the 
smuggling of tobacco had to do with the lowering of tobacco 
prices. However I am aware now of another group of experts in 
law enforcement and smuggling. I am not an expert in that. I am 
only an expert in health. Many people will say I am not but I 
suppose I am. They have said in their advice to the government 
that if one merely increases the export tax and uses enforcement 
measures it will not in itself have an effect on smuggling.
<P>
	We have now reached a critical point in our increase in 
tobacco taxes. We had reached the point where we had almost 
come to the point where prohibition had reached with regard to 
alcohol when the United States had created a prohibition level. 
We have seen exactly what happened then begin to happen here 
with regard to tobacco smuggling.
<P>
	Forty per cent of all tobacco sales was smuggled tobacco. Two 
million Canadians were buying contraband tobacco and many of 
those same Canadians were young people. The same young 
people who had no access to tobacco as a result of the increased 
prices were now having access to tobacco because of the cheap 
smuggled tobacco. The whole strategy of high prices had been 
undermined.
<P>
	I support the bill because it deals with the issue of law and 
order on the one hand and with increasing the ability to seize, 
with increasing the ability to identify smuggled products and 
with increasing the enforcement of this smuggling activity of 
the RCMP and expanding this not only to RCMP and customs 
officials but I understand to local police.
<P>
	I also want to support the second part of the bill which deals 
specifically with the government's understanding of the 
complexity of this issue. The government understands that 
lowering tobacco prices will affect the accessibility of tobacco 
to young Canadians. It has taken steps to mitigate the lowering 
of tobacco taxes via the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act. 
The amendments to  this act, which increase the age from 16 to 
18, which decrease the ability of young people under 18 to bring 
tobacco into this country, which remove vending machines from 
everywhere else but bars, and which increase the enforcement 
and the penalties to anyone selling tobacco to minors, have put 
tobacco very clearly where it belongs and that is as a controlled 
product alongside alcohol. I would like to see the time when 
tobacco is treated like alcohol and sold only in liquor stores.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	The government has acted immediately and promptly to 
address a problem that has been allowed to sit for four years 
without any attention by the other government, so that it is now 
in the crisis position that we see it in. The government has dealt 
with a complex issue with sensitivity to both sides of the 
problem and with a clear commitment to the health of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I hope that everyone here will see not only that this bill is 
worth supporting, but that it is urgent we support it so that we 
can get on with so many of the strategies that are necessary to 
improve the health of Canadians and to prevent us from having 
our young people have access to this lethal drug.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today I am speaking as a representative of the Reform caucus 
regarding Bill C-11. The House has already heard speeches 
from Reform Party members on this important issue and I am 
pleased to add my comments to this discussion.
<P>
	The measures contained in Bill C-11 are secondary when 
compared to those in the government's action plan to combat 
smuggling. They allow the government to sell or destroy seized 
property even when there is an unresolved claim, and allow the 
government to give police forces the same seizure power as the 
RCMP. The bill also requires cigarettes to be stamped properly 
if they are manufactured or imported into Canada, to make sure 
duties have been paid.
<P>
	This bill makes it illegal to manufacture a package or sell 
cigarettes in packages containing less than 20 cigarettes, the 
so-called kiddie packs.
<P>
	I agree with my Reform colleagues that the exchange of ideas 
regarding all of the government's anti-smuggling measures and 
not just those contained in Bill C-11 cannot be delayed. It is of 
utmost importance to Canadians that they are studied in their 
full scope immediately.
<P>
	In the time I have been a member of Parliament this issue has 
far outweighed any other in terms of number of responses from 
my constituents, the vast majority of whom oppose the 
government's action. Such is the magnitude of the impact these 
changes promise to have on Canadians. These consequences will 
be felt in many areas; law enforcement, justice, interprovincial 
relations and of course health, particularly the health of young 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1673"> 1673 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also make note of the fact that in Ontario tobacco 
production in 1993 was 173 million pounds. This was 5.5 
million pounds over the tobacco marketing board's quota of 
167.5 million pounds.
<P>
	Is it not interesting that at the time when tobacco producers 
saw this large surplus, and this holds true also of the United 
States and some other foreign countries, the government 
introduced these measures which will undoubtedly increase 
tobacco sales? Indeed this is excellent news for tobacco 
companies.
<P>
	As a farmer, I can tell the House that whenever there is an over 
abundance of product, the price has to go down to compete on 
the market. Here the tobacco companies are buying their inputs 
at a low cost and selling more of their product because of 
reduced taxes. They benefit first from low production costs and 
second from lower taxation. They are the clear winners with 
these measures and taxpayers are the losers because of the lost 
revenue and higher health care costs. Not of less concern in all 
of this is the financial implication of these measures.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	On February 8, 1994 the leader of the Reform Party gave his 
initial response to the government's announcement. He pointed 
out that the root cause of all these serious issues was the problem 
of government overspending. This was what led to overtaxation 
in the first place and brought about these ramifications.
<P>
	While I recognize that financial implications are only one of 
the serious aspects brought to light by the government's 
anti-smuggling measures, I would like to focus on them today 
along with the broader issue of the federal government's tax 
policy. I believe the issues serve as an excellent example of how 
the government's priorities should be reviewed.
<P>
	Several questions have to be asked of the federal government 
regarding these measures. First, I am interested to know what 
will be the overall cost of these measures. I can see that they will 
change many aspects of federal finances. One of the most 
obvious questions that arises is: Where will the government 
make up for the lost revenues from the rollback of cigarette 
taxes? As we know there is no magic pot of money from which 
this will be regained. Any extra revenue that has to be made up 
will come in the form of new taxes. In fact, the tax burden 
promises to create new taxation problems.
<P>
	Another thing tax reduction promises is a public health 
disaster. This makes it very hard for Canadian smokers to quit an 
addictive habit and introduces the harmful habit to a whole new 
generation of smokers. Aside from the human costs that cannot 
be measured, what about the cost to the health care system?
<P>
	We have a situation where the federal government has 
decreased transfer payments to provinces for the past number of 
years. In some cases it is not enabling provinces to keep up with 
health care costs. Every Canadian knows that the health care 
system currently faces huge financial challenges. Health groups 
contend that extra health care costs associated with treating 
diseases in new smokers could be approximately $1.3 billion per 
year. I would like to know if the government has figured out 
exactly how it is to pay for these increased health care costs.
<P>
	All indications point to new taxes for Canadians. I wondered 
how much thought went into this bill when I noticed that the 
government was doing away with the so-called kiddie packs in 
an effort to reduce smoking among our country's youth and at 
the same time drastically reduce pack prices overall.
<P>
	Simply put, kids are not stupid. They will quickly realize that 
through the government's action they can buy a regular size 
package of cigarettes at a lower price than their kiddie packs 
cost. One statistic states that when the price of cigarettes goes up 
10 per cent, tobacco sales to adults drop by 4 per cent to 9 per 
cent and sales to teenagers drop by 10 per cent to 14 per cent. 
These similar statistics were made available to the government 
by health groups before its decision to reduce cigarette taxes.
<P>
	It should come as no surprise that smoking will increase just 
as dramatically when taxes are reduced. That the government 
was made aware of this and still chose to lower taxes makes me 
think that it either does not have an adequate grasp of the reality 
of the situation or it simply does not care. Eight out of ten 
provinces lobbied strongly for the government not to lower 
cigarette taxes.
<P>
	While on the subject of health care, I note that in my home 
province of Manitoba, 25 per cent of kids go to school hungry. 
Thousands of adults are forced to depend on food banks. Now we 
have a government that has not addressed these problems 
saying: ``We can afford to forgo a half billion dollars in revenue 
by reducing cigarette taxes''. Would it not make sense for a 
government to write off these losses by providing for lower food 
costs so more hungry people could be fed as opposed to 
providing cheap cigarettes to Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	It is a sad fact that governments in Canada have tried in vain to 
get their deficit problems under control by raising taxes instead 
of demanding better value from their spending. The notion that a 
deficit can be reduced from government revenue increases alone 
is a misguided one.
<P>
	Higher taxes federally have failed to reduce the deficit and 
have in fact stalled the economy by cutting the spending power 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1674"> 1674 </A></B>
<P>
of the consumer by dampening new investment and by diverting 
growth into a flourishing underground economy.
<P>
	Granted government measures are intended in part to address 
an aspect of the black market, but would it not make more sense 
to instead reduce taxes in an area that would spur Canada's 
economic growth? For example, agricultural producers in my 
riding have seen, with the rest of Canadians, a reduction in the 
country's international competitiveness on agricultural 
markets. This is not the result of low efficiency on the part of 
Canadian farmers, but rather because of the high input costs 
farmers face. This is directly attributed to tax policy.
<P>
	I can give the House an example. In Manitoba the taxes on 
clear gasoline that is not used in the agriculture industry are 11.5 
cents provincially and 8.5 cents federally. For diesel it is 9.9 
cents provincially and 4 cents federally. Fuel for farming use 
however has no provincial tax but still has the same federal taxes 
of 8.5 cents and 4 cents. There is no federal tax break at all. This 
is just one example of how taxes are driving up input costs. In 
the government's attempt to squeeze every dollar out of 
Canadians, it is squeezing the life out of our economy. Where we 
should see tax breaks, they appear and where we should tax 
breaks, there are none.
<P>
	An article in the <I>Financial Post</I> states this very clearly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Federal policies are forcing more than one in five firms polled by the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce to move or consider moving business out of 
Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have been told many times by entrepreneurs: ``Yes, I love 
Canada and I do not mind paying my personal income tax here, 
but my future and my profits, if government keeps on taxing 
them this way, are going to be somewhere else''.
<P>
	In the farming community many are forced to get 50 per cent 
of their income from off farm employment because the business 
of farming is no longer profitable. Farmers have to supplement 
their income just to get by. Think of the effect this has on 
unemployment levels. There is evidence across the country. 
University educated professionals leave Canada for nations 
where the income tax rate and the cost of living are lower, and 
this is after we have paid to educate them.
<P>
	What the government should be looking at is a tax break that 
would help farmers, or for that matter any Canadian business or 
industry, become more competitive and that would provide 
incentive for professionals to stay and make their careers in 
Canada.
<P>
	I was shocked to learn recently that since 1961 Canada's tax 
freedom day has advanced 73 days. It is of particular note that in 
1961 the tax freedom day fell on May 3. Last year it fell on July 
15. Very soon we will not have enough time to sit down and light 
up a cigarette if this trend continues.
<P>
	We are rapidly approaching a point where we will be working 
for governments full time just to pay for their debt creating 
policies and bad spending decisions. In the face of such serious 
conditions, when the country is crying out for a large scale tax 
reform, this is what the government offers: lower taxes on 
cigarettes. Surely this  cannot be what the government sees as 
most beneficial to Canadians at this time. Recently the revenue 
minister, vowing to kill the underground economy that costs the 
government billions of dollars, hired a shock troop of 500 
additional tax auditors. This really displays what is wrong with 
the government's tax policy. Rather than give a tax break that 
would help kickstart the economy, it has decided to spend the 
money on hopeless efforts to regain revenue lost in the 
underground market.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope I have managed to show how this bill 
and all its associated measures display how the government's 
taxation policy should be seriously reviewed.
<P>
	The problems caused by overspending cannot be solved by 
overtaxation. Overtaxation of cigarettes has created the 
underground market in the first place and this is just one 
example of how high tax levels are stifling the economy.
<P>
	By reducing the tax on cigarettes the government is opening 
itself up to costs of about half a billion dollars per year just for 
implementation. To this you can add billions more in increased 
health care costs. How will this be paid for? I am afraid that it 
can only be paid through increased taxes.
<P>
	The actions do nothing to break the damaging cycle of taxing 
to pay for spending. If we do not break the cycle soon and allow 
ourselves to implement useful carefully considered tax breaks, 
Canadians will see their income taxed out of existence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member opposite indicated that he feels the reduction of taxes 
would lead to a windfall in effect for the cigarette 
manufacturers. He neglected to mention there are other parts of 
the action plan such as the $8 a carton export tax and also the 
surtax on profits to the cigarette manufacturers.
<P>
	I would appreciate hearing the hon. member's comments on 
what effect those measures would have on the cigarette 
manufacturers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that question. It is a 
well founded question.
<P>
	What I was trying to point out is that after having 167 million 
pounds of production quota and another 5.5 million pounds over 
that, farmers are going to be forced to take a lower price for 
tobacco if it works the same as it does in other commodities.
<P>
	With this increased sale of tobacco of 173 million pounds, 
that little bit of taxation that is going to be put on them by the 
federal government will not nearly compensate for the gains 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1675"> 1675 </A></B>
<P>
they are going to make on the huge amount of sales in the 
tobacco industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
might I through you ask a question about the differential in price 
between the American commodity and the Canadian commodity 
before the imposition of this new bill.
<P>
	Does the member opposite feel that is contributing to an 
excessive amount of contraband smuggling?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that question also. 
As the hon. member will probably realize, Snowflake is one of 
the best known smuggling ports in Manitoba. I do not think that 
it is the price of the American product that really has caused this 
underground economy.
<P>
	It is the taxation on these products that has made it so 
lucrative. It is not just cigarettes in Manitoba. Liquor smuggling 
is twice as bad I would say as the cigarettes. If we look at the 
statistics which tell us that 90 per cent of liquor sold in hotels or 
restaurants could be smuggled, we start wondering what is next.
<P>
	Another issue that we are addressing right now is gasoline. As 
the hon. member will know the drive across the border to fill up 
your tank is very lucrative or has been. With regard to farm 
production costs, it would make a lot more sense to take the tax 
off of gasoline so we could import our gasoline that we exported 
out of the country at probably two-thirds of the cost of what we 
are paying today.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	This is what I have been trying to point out. I do not think the 
cost of the products is really the big issue here. It is the 
overtaxation of these products. A lot of these products we 
produce in Canada, export them to the United States and then 
smuggle them back in because of the taxation problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on the debate on Bill C-11. I rise wearing many 
hats.
<P>
	As a chartered accountant, I believe I have the ability to 
understand the financial implications of Bill C-11. As a former 
member of the Mississauga hospital board for nine years and 
serving as its vice-chairman, the health impacts certainly were 
of significant importance to the health care institution. As a 
member of Parliament representing my constituents and 
listening, as have many members, I have received numerous 
interventions from them asking questions and making 
suggestions on how we might further improve the legislation 
with regard to the health impacts and indeed with regard to 
smuggling.
<P>
	I also speak as a father of three. I have three children aged 12 
through 19. I am concerned of course about the implications to 
my children and whether or not they will make the right 
decisions for them. There is a choice for Canadians.
<P>
	I have been somewhat concerned about the confusion that 
may arise for the Canadian people as they listen to the debate 
from the context of an excise tax reduction alone. I want to 
clarify this. I think it is going to be very important for Canadians 
to understand that we have here a complex problem that is being 
addressed.
<P>
	In my experience, for every complex problem there is a 
simple solution and it is wrong. I would like to outline, as we 
have already heard from the Minister of National Revenue, from 
the Solicitor General and from the Minister of Health, that this is 
clearly not a regional problem. It is a national problem.
<P>
	Therefore the government on February 8 came forward with a 
four point program to deal with this complex problem. It 
understands that the cheap contraband tobacco has undermined 
Canada's health objective to reduce smoking, especially among 
young people. The issue is no longer how to keep prices high so 
that young people do not smoke. That is not the issue. The issue 
is how to keep contraband cigarettes out of the hands of young 
people.
<P>
	I would like to make sure that all members understand clearly 
the dimensions of the problem. The problem is very severe. To 
give an idea to all members in the House, between 1990 and 
1993 the number of seizures by the RCMP increased from 303 to 
5,044 over a four year period. With regard to the value of those 
seizures, the increase went from $4.1 million in 1990 up to $53.5 
million in 1993.
<P>
	What about exports? We all have heard that the major source 
of the contraband smuggling has been exports to the United 
States, 90 per cent of which are coming back into Canada. 
Exports in 1990 were 11.3 million cartons. Yet in 1993 the 
exports were 62.8 million cartons. Clearly the dimensions of 
this problem are immense and growing very rapidly.
<P>
	Finally, with regard to the number of charges that have been 
laid by the authorities with regard to smuggling, in 1990 there 
were only 414 charges laid whereas in 1993 there were 3,389.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	I am sure all members would agree we are not dealing with 
ordinary circumstances. We are dealing with a major problem. 
That must give members an idea of the magnitude of the 
disrespect that has been shown for the laws of Canada.
<P>
	As has been pointed out by many members, but it bears 
repeating, illegal tobacco now accounts for 40 per cent of the 
Canadian tobacco market. Organized crime controls up to 95 per 
cent of contraband tobacco entering Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1676"> 1676 </A></B>
<P>
	Furthermore, more than two million Canadians are buying 
this contraband. More than $1 billion of federal revenue and an 
additional $1 billion in provincial revenues has been lost as a 
result of this smuggling activity.
<P>
	Hon. members must ask themselves this. If we are losing to 
our one taxpayer $2 billion of revenue that could go to health 
care, social programs and employment initiatives, how can we 
ignore the problem?
<P>
	On February 8, the government did come down with a 
four-point plan: the enforcement crackdown, a reduction of 
consumer taxes, a special action on tobacco manufacturers and 
also an initiative of the largest anti-smoking campaign in 
Canadian history. That was the initiative of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	He spoke in the House eloquently, outlining to Canadians that 
having had full consultation with the provinces, having fully 
assessed the input from all sectors with regard to this complex 
problem, it was necessary for us to have a well rounded, 
comprehensive solution to deal with all aspects and not simply 
the health impacts as hon. members from the Reform Party seem 
to have been suggesting.
<P>
	Bill C-11 was introduced by the Minister of National 
Revenue and the Minister of Health, both of whom spoke today 
very well on the amendments that are being proposed to support 
this February 8 initiative. Those amendments to the Excise Act, 
the Customs Act and the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act are 
all important complements to that initiative announced by the 
Prime Minister on February 8.
<P>
	The amendments will provide Canada's law enforcement 
agencies with additional legal powers to end smuggling. It 
protects the health of young Canadians by banning the 
production of cigarette packages of less than 20 cigarettes, 
which we have referred to as kiddie packs, and the sale of 
tobacco products to persons under the age of 18. In addition, this 
legislation will require that each individual cigarette must bear a 
distinctive marking indicating that the duty has been paid.
<P>
	Smuggling is a criminal activity that hurts all law-abiding 
Canadians. As all members know, law and order in our society is 
a very important issue. We were told throughout the election 
campaign and we continue to be told that Canadians want our 
laws to be enforced. They remind our government that we have a 
duty and a responsibility to enforce law and order in Canada.
<P>
	That is why we need these amendments. It is to provide our 
police forces with the additional tools and flexibility that they 
are going to need to crack down on smuggling.
<P>
	Since the initiative of the Prime Minister on February 8 and as 
a result of all the dialogues that have gone on since that time, 
there have been a number of feedbacks from the community. I 
have a couple here of notable news to share with hon. members.
<P>
	The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has welcomed 
the government's action plan. It says that by taking the profit out 
of sale, organized crime will quickly lose interest. We also note 
in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> that it compliments the Prime Minister 
on his plan saying that the high tax, high price policy had been 
effective for a while in reducing smoking but it was no longer 
working. It was being gutted by something far uglier than legal, 
cheap tobacco, that is cheap tobacco from a large and violent 
criminal network.
<P>
	There are some key messages that we have received from the 
Canadian public since the introduction of these plans. First, 
criminal law applies to every person in Canada and enforcement 
officers must and have been cracking down on smuggling 
wherever it occurs. Second, the new legislation will strengthen 
the ability of our police to enforce the law. Finally, the concerted 
federal-provincial action is the best way to crack down on 
smuggling.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Health I would be 
remiss not to address the health issue. There is no question. This 
morning one Reform Party member in representing his party's 
interest said that they agree with the legislation of Bill C-11, 
except for the reduction in the excise taxes. I liken that to a table 
with each leg representing one of the four points of the Prime 
Minister's plan. The hon. member suggests that taking away one 
of those legs would still make the table a stable foundation for 
the activity to occur on it.
<P>
	The hon. member will agree that by not having the excise tax 
reduction in combination with the export tax which is being 
applied, we would not have eliminated the profit motive for 
smuggling. It was absolutely essential to make this gesture so 
that from a financial perspective we could break the back of 
smuggling and get a handle on this situation. Hopefully through 
that, as the Minister of Health has indicated, we can return to a 
process of making sure young people do not have the incentive 
to smoke simply because of the accessibility of cigarettes.
<P>
	I should acknowledge that the Canadian Medical Association 
wrote to all members. It complimented the government on three 
parts of the program but had concerns regarding the reduction of 
the excise tax. It is supportive and I know it is in consultation 
with the government and the Minister of Health. I know it 
supports the government in spirit.
<P>
	We must deal with this major problem so that Canada can 
enforce its laws. Then we can get back to the creation of jobs and 
economic growth in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member in his presentation indicated that a reduction in the 
excise tax would reduce the profit motive for smugglers. Does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1677"> 1677 </A></B>
<P>
he believe that a reduction in tax generally would improve the 
situation for small business?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is fair to say a reduction in the 
excise tax alone, disregarding anything else in lowering the 
price of a commodity would obviously make it more attractive 
to the marketplace. The hon. member's premise, however, is that 
having reduced the excise taxes it is hurting business. I do not 
imagine he considered that the contraband smuggling taking 
place had no impact on small business.
<P>
	The idea of the government's initiative is to deal with 
contraband smuggling because every Canadian and every 
business in Canada is losing as a result of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
has been a lot of conversation since the lowering of the taxes on 
cigarettes that the government is losing money. Taking into 
consideration the fact that 75 per cent of the cigarettes smoked 
in Quebec were contraband and 35 to 40 per cent in Ontario were 
contraband, could the hon. member explain something 
concerning the money we are supposed to lose out of taxes? 
Does that take into consideration the contraband cigarettes or 
just the cigarettes that are being sold? Obviously there is an 
increase in sales to the retail outlets in Quebec and Ontario. 
There might not be any tax loss at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no question in the estimates 
provided by ministry officials that in the near term there would 
be a net cost. However I have to applaud the minister and the 
Prime Minister for not anticipating some other benefits. One of 
the problems governments have had is anticipating revenues or 
benefits.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	As a clear example to the extent government introduces tough 
measures to deal with tobacco smuggling, that same framework 
and mechanism would also apply and create some benefits with 
regard to alcohol, drugs, arms smuggling, et cetera. None of 
these have been discounted or included in terms of the benefits 
that will accrue to the country as a result of these initiatives.
<P>
	I wish I could be more specific as to the economics of the plan. 
Suffice it to say in the short term there may be an argument as to 
net cost. Clearly however government officials, business, 
industry and all Canadians believe the program is the right one 
for the long term.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish at 
some time we might have an easy issue to debate in Parliament 
but this certainly is not one. What is the problem we are 
addressing? It is a major health problem and there is no question 
about that.
<P>
	I for one would be most happy if the federal and provincial 
governments never got one penny more in taxation from 
cigarettes. Many Canadians feel the way I do. The reality is 
however that there are people who smoke and will continue to do 
so. As a result that habit has created a problem. Looking at this 
rationally and  reasonably we have to deal with that health issue 
and this legislation is attempting to do that.
<P>
	The problem is not only a health issue, it is an enforcement 
issue. An underground economy, an illegal business or trade, is 
being carried out in this country in monumental proportions. 
There is absolutely no question when looking at the facts. In 
Quebec over the last four years this contraband trade has gone 
from 9 per cent to 60 per cent. In Ontario it has risen from 13 per 
cent to 35 per cent. In the Atlantic provinces it has risen from 12 
per cent to 40 per cent. Just last year in the west it increased from 
9 per cent to 15 per cent, which is a 60 per cent increase.
<P>
	There is an illegal trade going on which is very damaging to 
the country. It is also providing megadollars to those people who 
carry out many other illegal illicit trades.
<P>
	When we hear about millions of dollars being made overnight 
in illegal tobacco and the expansion of this across the country, I 
do not think there is anyone in Canada who does not want to see 
very strong measures brought against that trade to stop it from 
continuing. Therefore there are certain steps to be taken which 
everybody in the House can agree to.
<P>
	There are other problems involved in dealing with this trade. 
Number one is enforcement. How on earth do we stop this illegal 
trade and at what costs do we carry out that enforcement?
<P>
	This problem is certainly mixed up with many things. I have 
received letter after letter from the cancer society, the medical 
associations and different groups concerned about the health of 
Canadians. They are very concerned that the excise tax has been 
removed from cigarettes.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at what taxation has been put in place and the 
reason for it. The federal government in looking at the problem 
has thought the only way to stop the illegal trade in cigarettes is 
to cut the profits of those organizations carrying out this 
activity. The only way to cut the profits is to bring enforcement 
upon them so strongly they can no longer function and to take 
away their profit base.
<P>
	The cutting of taxes takes away the profit base of the 
contraband trade. Looking at the ability for them to function, 
when we remove from a carton of cigarettes $10 of provincial 
tax and $10 of federal tax taking the gross sale from $43 down to 
$23, we reduce their profits substantially.
<P>
	It is true that the Canadian government does not take in as 
much revenue. However as this contraband trade has been 
increasing the federal revenues have been declining 
dramatically. When we talk about the percentage of losses in 
Quebec and Ontario and other provinces, those are all losses in 
tax dollars. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1678"> 1678 </A></B>
<P>
In reducing the excise tax on cigarettes we are reducing the 
profits of those people who sell illegal cigarettes.
<P>
	When looking at the health problem we have to realize there 
are implications for all of our communities. Smoking cigarettes 
causes health problems in old and young people alike. Certainly 
the government has moved to correct some of that problem.
<P>
	Looking at the health problem in general stopping young 
people from smoking is a major goal of this government. In 
order to prevent young people from smoking, a regulation has 
been brought in increasing the age for purchasing cigarettes up 
to 18 years. That makes it impossible for young people to buy 
cigarettes legally.
<P>
	Members might say in some cases they can get cigarettes 
anyway. I would submit if contraband cigarettes are easily 
available, kids 11, 12, 13 and up will buy illegal cigarettes very 
easily. The resultant factor is as long as we allow the illegal 
trade to flourish and continue, more availability will be made 
for young people to purchase those cigarettes.
<P>
	Therefore continuing along the same line as in the past would 
be counterproductive to health. There is no question it would 
diminish our ability to control the commodity and therefore 
allow more and more young people to get cigarettes at a very low 
price and to purchase them at any age they wish. The two major 
attacks on health would be gone.
<P>
	The minister has also taken other steps to make certain there 
are more controls which brings me to the enforcement level. The 
RCMP has been given the power to work in larger numbers along 
with Revenue Canada customs officers. They will work against 
organized crime groups trying to stop the major suppliers of 
these cigarettes at any point. They will better patrol the borders 
by making certain there is 24-hour surveillance at many border 
crossings where there is only short-time surveillance now.
<P>
	There are steps to very carefully check the sale of cigarettes 
across the counter within our communities in order to make it 
more difficult for traffickers at the street level.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	There is no question that it has to be a strong policing action 
with the RCMP as well as strong policing action with Customs 
Canada to create better enforcement. At the same time the bill is 
trying to open up that enforcement to provincial scope as well.
<P>
	Provincial officers in the province of Ontario and in Quebec 
will be able to work hand in hand with the RCMP and customs 
officers to try to curb this growing illegal industry. I might 
remind people in this House as well that the profits of that illegal 
trade do go into organized crimes. There have been very strong 
suggestions that groups from Montreal and Toronto such as 
Mafia organizations and Hell's Angels bicycle groups have all 
been involved with the illegal trade of cigarettes.
<P>
	When it is stated that 95 per cent of the profits of illegal 
cigarettes goes into organized crime and works against 
Canadian society, we must take every measure we can to stop 
that from occurring.
<P>
	There is absolutely no question when we look at the health 
problem and solutions to the health problem, they are not easy 
but the plan that has been put forth by the government is very 
logical. It is not easy to suggest that we reduce taxes and look as 
if we are caving in to organized crime.
<P>
	At the same time it is taking the profits away from organized 
crime and creating an environment where their sales will not 
destroy more and more of the normal trade and therefore allow 
organized crime to totally control cigarette sales in this country.
<P>
	It is important to realize too that there has been a 
manufacturers' tax placed on exported cigarettes to control the 
flow of cigarettes out of this country which are being recycled 
back into the country. The extra $8 on export tax will cost 
anybody who is trying to buy those and bring them back into the 
country more money to operate that illegal trade.
<P>
	As we look at the whole picture, the government has tried to 
take into account health measures, enforcement measures and 
tax measures in order to resolve a problem, hopefully bringing 
us to a more prosperous future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would to start by 
making a comment. The hon. member mentioned that one of the 
provisions in this bill raises the legal age for purchasing 
cigarettes from 16 to 18 years of age. I simply want to point out 
that this measure was contained in Bill C-111 which was passed 
last year. However, the legislation only takes effect this year.
<P>
	The hon. member did, however, raise some interesting 
questions about enforcement measures to control the sale of 
tobacco products. At one point, he said did not know how we 
would stop this illegal trade going on and what it would cost to 
carry out that enforcement. Therefore, I would like to send the 
question back to him and ask him to explain a little more how far 
his government intends to go in enforcing these measures?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as the number of agents 
goes, Customs Canada is presently putting an additional 350 
people into increased enforcement. They are providing 24-hour 
service at 22 ports to handle more than 99 per cent of the 
commercial traffic in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1679"> 1679 </A></B>
<P>
	When we talk about increased police enforcement, the bill is 
to open the opportunity for provincial police forces to operate 
under the excise tax rules and regulations. Therefore without 
extra cost to the taxpayer, we are increasing the number of 
people who can effectively work in this area by hundreds of 
thousands when we consider the major police forces like the 
OPP in Ontario and la Sûreté du Québec in Quebec. Therefore 
policing has opened up very greatly as well.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	When it comes to the implementation of the age 16 to 18 law, 
it is very clear that there are different regulations in different 
provinces. However, in this case we are allowing or forcing the 
importation of cigarettes to be done only by people beyond their 
18th birthday. Therefore we have changed the regulations and 
forced that age up two years from what it previously was.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the hon. member's comments. He has pointed out 
very vividly that there are two big problems in this situation. 
One is overtaxation and the other is the law enforcement side.
<P>
	I am wondering if the hon. member could comment on how we 
should deal with the law enforcement issue. The overtaxation 
issue I think we have dealt with because we have made it 
unprofitable to smuggle cigarettes. These same people who have 
been doing that will now be unemployed. I do not think they paid 
into the unemployment insurance fund. Will they now take a job 
at the minimum wage or will these people go somewhere else 
and smuggle other products? Are we again going to lower those 
taxes to do away with that issue?
<P>
	Now we have lost revenue and probably created a health 
problem. When are we going to address the issue of law 
enforcement? That is the big problem that we have to look at 
because these people are not ordinary law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question.
<P>
	Without strong measures being taken, as this government is 
doing right now, we would be caving in to chaos, as far as I am 
concerned, and to a lawless society which openly-and we have 
seen it very openly in this country-sells contraband products. 
It has spread across this country very widely. We have to look at 
some of the root causes of that.
<P>
	I believe part of the root cause is the taxation structure. I 
believe part of the root cause is the dissension people feel 
toward taxes at this time in our history. I believe other parts of 
the root causes are suggestions by people in authority that law 
and order is not to be upheld or strongly adhered to.
<P>
	It is very important for all Canadians to be sure that this 
government will uphold the law and bring in whatever measures 
must be taken in order to make certain that the law is enforced.
<P>
	We do not worry about the people who would break the law. 
We punish them.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to debate Bill C-11.
<P>
	Most of the elements of this bill are minor and insignificant. 
There is very little in Bill C-11 that will combat smuggling. The 
government believes it has eliminated the incentive to smuggle 
with the initiatives that were implemented by ways and means 
motion No. 3.
<P>
	This may in fact be the case for cigarettes, but all it has done is 
change the contraband of choice. We already are hearing about 
increases in the smuggling of liquor. We know that guns, 
narcotics and illegal persons are also a part of smuggling 
organizations.
<P>
	If the government were to follow the precedent it set with 
tobacco smuggling, we can assume that taxes on alcohol 
products will soon be dropped and that the laws against guns and 
illegal persons will be changed to remove the monetary gains. 
This is not a national action plan to combat smuggling. This is 
capitulation.
<P>
	Do we solve the problem of smuggling cocaine and heroin by 
making them legal and selling them across the counter? It would 
certainly solve the problem of drug smuggling, but are we 
prepared to live with the social consequences of such actions?
<P>
	These laws against smuggling are there for a reason and they 
must be enforced. Taking the course of action that this 
government is taking sends the wrong message. It tells 
Canadians that if enough people engage in illegal activity, the 
government will give in and change the law.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	With regard to the elements of the bill they are for the most 
part insignificant. However there is one area of concern that I 
have with the bill. My concern is with the amendments to the 
Excise Act and the Customs Act that would allow seized 
property to be sold or destroyed even if the claim is still 
unresolved. We are told the reason for this is to reduce storage 
costs and will apply mainly to tobacco and alcohol seizures, but 
it will also apply to the seizures of the vehicles that brought in 
anything considered contraband.
<P>
	I am currently assisting a constituent who recently won a 
Federal Court decision against improper customs seizure. 
Unfortunately for this individual the court decision came 10 
years after the seizure. Unfortunately for the Canadian taxpayer 
a $200,000-plus award has grown to in excess of $400,000 with 
interest payments.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1680"> 1680 </A></B>
<P>
	Rather than providing the minister with the authority to 
dispose of seized goods, it may be in the best interest of both the 
accused and the Canadian taxpayer to develop a dispute 
mechanism which is made up of an independent assessment 
authority which could hear such disputes and avoid enormous 
court costs resulting from lengthy court challenges.
<P>
	As for other aspects of the bill the amendment to the Excise 
Act giving non-federal police forces the same seizure powers as 
the RCMP is probably long overdue. Removing bureaucratic 
barriers in enforcing the law is preferable to capitulation.
<P>
	However it is with the amendments to the Tobacco Sales to 
Young Persons Act that the government is operating at its 
hypocritical best. It is trying to convince us that by making it 
illegal to manufacture or package cigarettes in packages 
containing fewer than 20 cigarettes that smoking among young 
people will not increase. It is trying to convince us that by 
making it illegal to sell or offer for sale cigarettes in packages 
containing fewer than 20 cigarettes that smoking among young 
people will not increase. It is trying to tell us that by prohibiting 
the importation of tobacco products by or on behalf of persons 
under the age of 18 that smoking among young people will not 
increase.
<P>
	The government is not telling us about one important issue, 
that because it lowered the price of cigarettes that more young 
people are going to start smoking. We have all seen the graph 
and it clearly indicates that with a sharp increase in the price of 
cigarettes, there was a proportionate drop in the number of 
young people smoking.
<P>
	I imagine that we will soon see a graph that shows that with 
the dramatic decrease in the price of cigarettes there will be an 
increase in the number of young smokers.
<P>
	Will it be difficult to enforce these amendments to the 
Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act? I do not think so. Why 
would tobacco companies want to make packages of less than 20 
cigarettes today? Thanks to this government the price of a 
package of cigarettes is now about half of what it was last 
month. The amendment to prohibit the importation of tobacco 
products by anyone less than 18 years of age is redundant. Why 
would anyone go across the border to buy cheap smokes when 
they can buy them at the corner grocery store?
<P>
	If these amendments had been introduced prior to the 
government capitulating in the ways and means motion No. 3 
they may have had some meaning.
<P>
	It is ironic on one hand to see the Minister of National 
Revenue talk tough about eliminating smuggling and the 
underground economy while on the other hand being part of a 
government that is quick to capitulate. I wonder if the 
government will likewise be willing to surrender to the ever 
expanding underground economy. With more and more 
Canadians involving themselves in the multibillion 
underground economy, and probably many more will be ready to 
join them after the budget comes  down this afternoon, is this 
government prepared to reduce all of its taxes?
<P>
	Given the government's philosophy that lower taxes will take 
away the incentive for illegal behaviour, it seems natural that the 
government would reduce the tax burden to eliminate the 
financial incentives for participating in the underground 
economy. Of course it will not. Where would it get the money to 
make up for lost tax revenue? Where is the federal government 
and those provincial governments which are participating in this 
joint program going to get the lost revenue from the cigarette 
taxes?
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	Taxes on cigarettes were high but they were there for a reason. 
The toll that cigarette smoking has inflicted on the Canadian 
health system is even higher. Now all Canadians will have to 
subsidize the increased shortfall.
<P>
	I am afraid that what the government has done in this instance 
has sent a loud message that if enough people are ignoring the 
law, do not worry, we will change it. What the government 
should have done is enforce that law and enforce all the laws that 
were there. If a law has the support of Canadians it must be 
enforced. There was support from the community for higher 
taxes on cigarettes.
<P>
	Calls to my office were six to one against lowering the taxes 
on cigarettes. If my constituents oppose the lowering of any tax 
we have accomplished something. They do not like taxes. They 
want taxes lowered but they want them lowered in a sane and 
reasonable manner across the board. The government should 
have concentrated on enforcement, not on isolating tax cuts to 
contraband cigarettes.
<P>
	Unfortunately some Canadians need the occasional reminder 
that there are laws in the country and that they have to be 
enforced. There are laws against speeding in this country despite 
the fact that most of us speed. The mere sight of a police car on 
the side of the road is enough to slow must of us down.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by 
members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	Presently federal funding for post-secondary education is

	Due to the large number of out of province students studying

evolution of the city since it was founded in 1847.
<P>
	The authors, Luc Noppen and Lucie Morrisset of Laval 
University, mention the uniqueness of Arvida, home of Alcan 
and now part of the city of Jonquière. Arvida, which was built 
between 1926 and 1928, is distinguished by its innovative town 
planning and its original architecture.

Mr. Speaker, it was 35 years ago Sunday, February 20, 1959, that 
the Diefenbaker government cancelled the Canadian made Avro 
Arrow aircraft which was the sleekest and most advanced 
military plane of its day. Thus ended a second national dream for 
Canada.
<P>
	Janusz Zurakowski, who had a distinguished military career 
in Poland, Britain and Europe, arrived in Toronto in 1952 and 
became the first test pilot for the Avro Arrow. Jan and his wife 
Anna own Kartuzy Lodge near Barry's Bay in my constituency. 
When asked about flying so fast he said: ``It feels just like flying 
slowly, only faster''.
<P>
	The Arrow could fly at twice the speed of sound. It would still 
have been a modern aircraft in the early 1980s when we spent 
many times the cost to buy CF-18 aircraft from the United 
States.
<P>
	The Diefenbaker government ordered the six Arrows already 
built to be cut up for scrap. All records, all factory facilities, all 
plans of any kind were ordered destroyed. What a sad 
commentary on a fantastic Canadian achievement.
<P>

co-operative programs are an approach to technical and 
technological education which is flourishing in Canada. In this 
approach students go out from their base in school to gain 
experience in the workplace.
<P>
	However, another approach, apprenticeship programs, is 
doing very poorly here. In this case students are trained in the 
workplace, reaching out for school programs as required.
<P>
	The number of apprentices and the quality and relevance of 
apprenticeship programs in Canada have declined drastically.
<P>
	One industry in Peterborough which used to have hundreds of 
apprentices now has only four. One reason for this is that 
apprentices often receive qualifications which are restricted to

their province. Only 14 per cent of apprentices in Ontario earn

economy is slack.

forces in Sarajevo yesterday, but the UN expected to gain 
control over them some time today. All the while, Serb bombing 
continues over Bosnian enclaves like Tuzla and Bihac, while 
talks continue in Moscow and Washington in the hope of 
achieving a peaceful settlement and bringing lasting peace to 
Bosnia.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us whether his government 
supports the proposal to put Sarajevo under UN protection and, 
in that context, is he prepared to reconsider the decision made by 
the Government of Canada to withdraw Canadian peacekeepers 
from Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
no decision has been made concerning central Bosnia following 
France's proposal with regard to the status of the city of

through consulting with other countries before making a 
decision.

Speaker, I would also like to ask the Prime Minister whether he 
is considering issuing further ultimatums to bring hostilities to a 
stop in enclaves such as Tuzla and Bihac, or whether he trusts 
that current diplomatic initiatives in Washington and Moscow 
will be sufficient.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the decision made ten days or so ago respecting the ultimatum 
and the siege of Sarajevo produced the expected results. So, for 
the time being, should we pursue this course of action? I think 
that the actions taken so far have been successful and that the

good solution in one case not worth a try in other cases? That is 
the question and I think that the government will have to answer 
it very soon.

	Should the peace process require the build up of peacekeeping 
troops in Bosnia and throughout the former Yugoslavia, would 
the government be prepared to reconsider its decision not to 
detach additional Canadians peacekeepers?

contain information such as the immigrant's name, date of birth, 
nationality and photograph.
<P>
	Does the minister realize he is creating two classes of 
Canadians: those who have to carry this ID card and those who 
do not?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, the ID card is not new. It was made 
public last summer to NGOs and lawyers. The ID card simply 
replaces the large piece of paper all immigrants are given once 
they are landed.
<P>
	There are two reasons we are replacing the big piece of paper 
by the small card. First, the big piece of paper can be forged and 
is easily duplicated. It is being sold at high cost on the black 
market. The small card is a state of the art technique and will 
certainly minimize that kind of fraudulent activity.
<P>
	The second reason is that many landed residents have 
requested small cards for their wallets to be used as ID cards 
until they receive citizenship cards. Therefore it also has that 
practical application which was asked for by the very people 
who will be carrying them.
<P>
	There is nothing untoward. Nothing more can be accessed 
than what normally can from our normal passports. Is the 
member also suggesting we not have passports?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> It is not the same card. 
Immigrants did not ask for it.
<P>
	Considering the threat to privacy such a card constitutes, will 
the government agree to have a genuine debate before making a 
decision that restricts people's right to privacy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is making a silly 
argument. I just finished saying that all landed residents now 
receive a form.
<P>
	I am sure Canadians and immigrants understand we are trying 
to stop fraudulent duplication and to prevent those who so wish 
from illegally obtaining those cards. It also offers the 
prospective landed immigrant an ID card. We will not be able to 
access anybody's dirty laundry through this form. We are simply 
trying to make it better for those who use it and difficult for 
those who want to abuse it.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	As I mentioned last week, a recent segment of the TV program 
``Venture'' referred to a departmental study that says the current 
training programs under the human resources department are 
not only not helping but may actually be hindering those people 
who are trying to find work.
<P>
	Will the minister table this document in the House of 
Commons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said last week, that 
information has always been available if the hon. member would 
avail himself of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1687"> 1687 </A></B>
<P>
it. There is nothing secret or hidden. We would be glad to table 
any evaluation that has been given.
<P>
	I want to point out that the training programs are part of the 
general review we have undertaken in this Parliament. There is 
more than enough opportunity within the parliamentary 
committee and in discussions with the provinces to take a look at 
how we can apply training.
<P>
	I would only make this small caution to the hon. member. I do 
not think he should use a small segment of a media report to 
make a general condemnation of a training program that has 
provided opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question.
<P>
	If studies from his own department indicate that the current 
training programs which cost billions of dollars every year are 
not helping people get new jobs, why are taxpayers continuing 
to fund them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, frankly the hon. member asks 
the question out of ignorance. That is not what the report states.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	The report says that in key areas such as workplace training, 
skills training and literacy training this kind of expenditure 
provides enormous service and opportunity for many Canadians 
to upgrade their abilities. It provides a new investment in human 
resources to give this country the kind of hope for the 
productivity it needs.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. member that to make that kind of 
blanket criticism and condemnation without knowing what he is 
talking about is doing a disservice to the many people presently 
involved in the training programs.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
seems to be unanimous support in the dairy industry for 
demanding that the federal government prohibit sales of the 
BST hormone in Canada, since Canadians are worried about the 
effects of this growth hormone on human health.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of National Health and 
Welfare. Considering this unanimous position, could the 
minister guarantee that there will be at least a six-month 
moratorium on the sales of BST in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
explained before, BST is a biotechnological synthetic hormone. 
It matches what cows already produce naturally. When injected 
in cows it increases the volume of milk production.
<P>
	My officials are now reviewing the drug. They are doing some 
clinical studies on its effects. To date they have not issued a 
notice of compliance. Once all the clinical trials have been done 
and it is proven the milk is absolutely safe and there is 
absolutely no difference, we have very little recourse but to 
issue the notice of compliance at that time.

I was an immigrant and I am now a citizen of Canada.

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Now you want to lock the gate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> This question is in the name of Canadians 
concerned about the country's financial crisis. Next year Canada 
will admit 111,000 family reunification immigrants. Many of 
them will be persons of an age where they will be unable to 
contribute to Canada's social programs. These individuals are 
entitled to free medicare.
<P>
	Would the minister please tell the House what he expects the 
cost of the medicare services required by these immigrants will 
be?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, this party mentioned in its red 
book and Canadians accepted it democratically by the national 
election that one of the building blocks of immigration policy is 
the family class.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1688"> 1688 </A></B>
<P>
	There are two reasons. First, we believe Canadians do have a 
right toward family reunification. Second, the family is also the 
vehicle to more successfully integrate and settle the newcomer 
without burdening the state.
<P>
	The hon. member's party quite often talks about family 
values. If the hon. member wants to cut the immigration levels 
he cannot have it both ways. He cannot talk on family values on 
the one hand and then berate family class immigration on the 
other.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
may the people of Canada conclude from the minister's answer, 
or non-answer, that decisions about Canada's immigration 
levels are made without regard to the costs which the policies 
impose on the already strained social programs of the country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, we said no such thing. In fact in our 
levels announcement some days ago we said it was very 
important not only to do levels in isolation but to do levels and 
have a correlated two-year settlement and integration in dollars. 
That was a very important distinction the former government 
did not pay too much attention to.
<P>
	We are worried about the financial implications to our health 
system. However we are not prepared to conclude that family 
class members who are landed should not have access to medical 
services when independent skills applicants do. Is that what the 
member is advocating? When people come here and are landed 
residents we assume they contribute and through their 
contribution they have a contract with Canada. It is a two-way

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. We learned in <I>La 
Presse</I> that federal Liberal members forced 15 members of the 
European Parliament to cancel a series of meetings with Quebec 
organizations and replace these visits with an official trip to 
Ottawa and Vancouver, as part of the business of the 
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. member could rephrase his 
question, because it does not concern the government's 
administrative responsibility in that it relates to a 
non-governmental organization.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> My question is this: How does the minister 
explain that his ambassador in Brussels was also involved in 
convincing these European parliamentarians to act against their 
will?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that you were right to remind the hon. member 
that this kind of meeting of parliamentarians is organized by 
non-governmental organizations. From time to time, 
parliamentarians come to Canada under these exchange 
programs.
<P>
	As part of the visit which took place, it was planned that they 
would come to Ottawa and go to British Columbia to study the 
forestry issue which is now the subject of consultations at the 
highest level.
<P>
	So the parliamentarians who came here knew very well why 
they were coming and what their agenda would be. One of these 
parliamentarians, who probably has dealings with Quebec 
separatists, made a side trip to Montreal and denigrated this 
well-established parliamentary procedure of parliamentary 
exchanges which had been approved in advance. All the others 
were satisfied, except this black sheep who strayed in Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
several people, parliamentarians from over there, told us the 
same thing. Did other parliamentarians question the minister 
when they came to see him?
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no doubt there will be other exchanges between the 
European Parliament and the Parliament of Canada. No doubt 
these European parliamentarians are quite welcome in all the 
provinces of Canada, including Quebec.
<P>
	Those who came here met the Prime Minister and discussed 
Canadian issues and questions of interest for the European 
Parliament.
<P>
	Those who came here also had the opportunity to meet the 
Deputy Prime Minister, who invited them to accompany her 
since she was going to the province of Quebec herself. So those 
who wanted to take advantage of that offer could have done so.
<P>
	I repeat that only one parliamentarian found that procedure 
unacceptable. He should have stayed home, since he knew in 
advance that the trip would take them here, to Ottawa, and to 
Vancouver, and he should join us for another visit that will 
include a trip to the province of Quebec.

	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Over the past few months Canadians have seen several 
examples of judicial gag orders. These orders have either 
excluded the media and members of the public entirely from 
criminal trials or have allowed them to observe but not to report 
on the proceedings.
<P>
	Could the minister advise us of any steps which he has 
planned to review this situation in order to preserve the very 
important public right to know what is going on in the criminal 
justice system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Criminal Code provides 
and the general rule in law is that proceedings in court are held 
in open and the public may watch and see what is going on. The 
code also provides, and indeed the inherent jurisdiction of the 
court provides as well, that when the interests of a fair trial for 
the accused require it, there can be a ban on publication.
<P>
	As my hon. friend knows from her own many years of 
distinguished service as counsel in the courts, sometimes these 
media bans on publication for specific periods of time are very 
important in the interests of justice, for example in a 
preliminary inquiry where the evidence is not published, so that 
the trial itself is not prejudiced or where there is some quarrel 
about the admissibility of evidence. The court does not want it 
published so the jury will find out about it before the 
admissibility of  evidence is determined. Obviously there is a 
balance. The Supreme Court of Canada has two cases under 
advisement now in which it is considering the balance between 
the freedom of expression in the charter and media bans. We are 
going to await those decisions and read them with care. I can 
assure the hon. member that we will do all things necessary to 
ensure that the criminal law is administered fairly in this 
country.

kind whose director is elected by the board of directors rather 
than appointed by the government. This situation is unique and 
can explain many things.

that the government respects. However, the minister has some 
authority; he has the power to appoint people to the board of

<P>
	While the ports of Halifax and Saint John are ice free year

of the government indirectly subsidizing inland ports at the

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I think two questions in a question are 
okay, but when we get into three or four we have to draw the line. 
Would the Minister of Industry care to answer the question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the minister responsible for CDIC, let me indicate to 
the member that the government shares his concern.
<P>
	However, the obligation that CDIC had to sell 51 per cent of 
its interest in Ginn was one which had been made previously. 
Although a number of discussions have been held with potential 
Canadian purchasers, none of those discussions developed into a 
substantial indication of interest to the extent that an offer was 
made that was acceptable to CDIC.
<P>
	In the circumstances, the decision was taken to realize on 
CDIC's investment in Ginn in accordance with the previously 
made commitment by the previous government.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a question of privilege concerning some comments made 
during question period.
<P>
	I feel my personal integrity and credibility have been 
attacked. During my question I said that I was an immigrant and 
that now I was a Canadian citizen. The member for 
Carleton-Gloucester shouted: ``Now you want to lock the 
gate''.

recommend-

	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member may have a grievance that he 
could put forward. I wonder if the hon. member would agree to 
let me have a look at the ``blues'' and I will see just what was 
said in the exchange. I will have a look at it at that time.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-11, an act to amend the Excise Act, the Customs Act and the 
Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will try to refresh everybody's memory as to what 
happened prior to question period.
<P>
	I am afraid that what the government has done in this instance 
is to send a loud message that if enough people are ignoring the 
law, do not worry it will be changed. What the government 
should have done is enforce the laws that were there. If a law has 
the support of Canadians it must be enforced and there was 
support in the community for high taxes on cigarettes.
<P>
	Calls to my office were six to one against lowering the tax on 
cigarettes and if someone can get my constituents to oppose the 
lowering of any tax then he or she has accomplished something. 
They do not like taxes. They want taxes lowered but they want 
them lowered in a sane and reasonable manner across the board. 
The government should have concentrated on enforcement, not 
on isolating tax cuts on contraband cigarettes.
<P>
	Unfortunately some Canadians need the occasional reminder 
that there are laws that have to be enforced. There are laws 
against speeding despite the fact that most of us speed every now 
and then. The mere sight of a police car on the side of the road is 
enough to slow most drivers back to the speed limit. If the 
government had been in charge of the provincial motor vehicles 
act it would not have called for increased enforcement. It would 
have raised the speed limit and then boasted about how it got rid 
of the country's speeding problems.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Customs Act and Excise Act both provide 
for significant penalties for those breaking the law. The 
government should have given its law enforcement officers 
some manpower and resources to have carried out its mandate. 
The initiatives implemented by ways and means motion No. 3 
were short-sighted and in the long term this decision will be 
regretted.
<P>
	It is unfortunate the government did not have the courage to 
stand up and address the issue head on. I hope when the alcohol 
smuggling issue comes before the government it is prepared to 
stand firm and resist repeating the same mistake.
<P>
	My constituency runs along the Canada-U.S. border. My 
riding has two of the busiest border crossings in Canada, the 
Pacific crossing being one of them. I know there is smuggling of 
all sorts and I know that cigarette smuggling is not the main 
concern at the Pacific and Douglas crossing.
<P>
	Enforcement of Canada's laws is the only way to deal with 
this issue, not giving in to the lawbreakers.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
comment on an issue that has been coming hour by hour from the 
Reform Party throughout this debate and it has to be stopped.
<P>
	The argument being made is that the reduction of the excise 
tax on tobacco is a singular event and has no consequence on 
anything else the government did. The whole point of the 
initiatives brought in by the Prime Minister, the Minister of 
National Revenue and Minister of Health was to break the back 
of smuggling.
<P>
	To break the back of smuggling they had to eliminate the 
profit motive. The combination of the reduction of excise tax, 
the export tax that was levied and the surtax on manufacturing 
collectively represent the elimination of the profit in smuggling.
<P>
	If we eliminate the excise tax and apply the tax totally to 
export taxes, if we allow export taxes and that surtax to deal with 
it totally, all we are doing is shifting the burden from exports to 
the U.S coming back into Canada and forcing the creation of 
underground manufacturing facilities in Canada.
<P>
	Members really have to open up their minds to understand 
that there is a comprehensive approach to one of the most 
serious problems that the government has had to face in its first 
three or four months of operation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a feeling the hon. member 
forgot the first part of my speech which was over an hour ago.
<P>
	My concern is not that the government has just reduced taxes. 
My concern is that it did not enforce the laws that were there. If 
it had enforced the laws we would not have this problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> We weren't here.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> The member was here for at least 100-plus 
days.
<P>
	My concern is that this is only dealing with cigarette taxes and 
that the government is not stopping smuggling. It is going to 
have smuggling of alcohol. It is going to have smuggling of 
alien persons. It is going to have smuggling of heroine and hard 
drugs. We have it now.
<P>
	If the government is not going to enforce the laws, it will 
continue to have smuggling of these contraband items. 
Lowering the taxes of one item is not going to stop smuggling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend 
my colleague on her speech and her point of view. It was very 
well presented.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1693"> 1693 </A></B>
<P>
	However she said something in the first part of her speech, 
which was over an hour ago, about this bill doing very little to 
reduce smuggling.
<P>
	Does she believe that by taking the profit out of smuggling it 
will increase or decrease the activity?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to give the same 
lecture to my hon. friend and seatmate but it will reduce perhaps 
the incentive to smuggle cigarettes.
<P>
	It will not reduce the incentive to smuggle hard drugs, alcohol 
or illegal aliens. The problem of enforcement cannot be solved 
by reducing the incentive to do it. One has to enforce the laws of 
the land the same for all people. It is only through enforcement 
that smuggling will be stopped.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask the hon. member how she expects by zeroing in on 
enforcement alone she can enforce the laws on the world's 
longest undefended border and the world's longest sea coast.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I mentioned at one time that my 
constituency goes along the United States-Canadian border. I 
have two of the busiest border crossings in my constituency and 
this has not been identified as a major problem.
<P>
	Yes, there is cigarette smuggling. I do not deny that, but it has 
certainly not been a problem to the extent that it has been in 
Ontario and Quebec. I do not think that problems are solved by 
isolating a solution for one area and putting it over the whole 
country. If there is a problem in one area of the country, solve it 
if it is isolated to that area. Do not assume that this problem is all 
across the country.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	I know at my border crossings cigarette smuggling is 
certainly not at the limit it is in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member's speech and one 
thing I picked out of it was the fact that she was pointing out 
everything we have done wrong. I have yet to hear an alternative 
from the hon. member as to how she would solve the problem.
<P>
	We have watched contraband cigarettes grow from the late 
1980s into the early to mid-1990s, a 60 per cent growth in less 
than one year; 75 per cent contraband in Quebec, 35 per cent to 
40 per cent in Ontario, 15 per cent in the western provinces and 
growing. I stress the word growing. In on one box of cartons 
there is a $500 profit. In a truckload there is a $500,000 profit. 
We are creating a millionaire a day. All this money is seed 
money for what the hon. member is talking about which is the 
smuggling of alcohol, arms and drugs.
<P>
	What we have done is stop that seed money. I would ask the 
member regarding everything we have done wrong, how she 
would do it right.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, actually the hon. member has 
also forgotten the first part of my speech in which I did 
acknowledge that there are some things in this legislation that 
are positive. One is giving the same ability to peace officers as 
the RCMP in dealing with the problem.
<P>
	However that is where to deal with it, in giving manpower and 
support to the enforcement of Canadian laws, not giving in to 
criminals and reducing the laws. To give in to criminals and 
allow them to change Canadian law because of criminal activity 
is sending the wrong message. Give more enforcement, more 
support to the law enforcement people in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if 
the hon. member is suggesting that we not follow the advice of 
the commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who, 
as a professional law enforcement officer, the top one in the 
country, said that if we are going to get a handle on the problem 
then we have to narrow the gap between the price of cigarettes in 
Canada and in the United States.
<P>
	I wonder if the member does not recognize that our policies in 
the past have been an incubator for organized crime and we were 
actually growing the underground economy.
<P>
	Given the position of the hon. member's leader when he 
would say that there was a tax revolt brewing in the country, do 
the members of the Reform Party not recognize a tax revolt 
when it bites them in the derrière?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess my concern is that this 
reaction of lowering taxes on one contraband item is not going to 
solve the problem. I recognize that perhaps for the RCMP this 
was an easy way to deal with an issue. However, are they also 
going to suggest the same thing when we talk about the 
smuggling rings taking on hard drugs or alcohol?
<P>
	Are we also going to suggest that we should lower the taxes on 
alcohol and that we should legalize heroin and hard drugs just 
because it then makes the job easier?
<P>
	I do not think that is the issue here. The issue is we have 
Canadian laws for a reason and we should not be giving in to 
criminal activity and changing our laws just to make it easier for 
them to change products.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just wonder if the hon. 
member has had the opportunity to read the entire action plan 
which dealt with the very issue of enforcement. We have 
increased customs officers by 25 per cent to deal with the idea 
and with the problems of enforcement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1694"> 1694 </A></B>
<P>
	I also inform the hon. member that the problem is not unique 
to one part of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	The busiest border crossing last year was the Windsor-Detroit 
bridge which is just outside my riding. This problem is not 
unique to Quebec. It is not unique to one particular part. It is 
happening all across the country. We have a total plan to deal 
with it, a plan that deals with enforcement, a plan that deals with 
health. I hope the hon. member has a chance to read clause 3 of 
the bill particularly.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think I ever said that the 
problem was unique to one part of Canada. I said that the other 
parts of Canada have a similar problem but not to the same 
extent.
<P>
	There is smuggling in western Canada along our borders but 
not to the same extent and it can be handled by law enforcement. 
I am glad the border crossing staff is going to be increased. I 
think the concentration of the policy should be on law 
enforcement and not in relaxing the Canadian laws.
<P>
	I repeat, we do not solve problems by giving in to the criminal 
element. If we do it once we are going to end up doing it over and 
over again.
<P>
	There is a reason for laws and there is a reason to enforce 
laws. When we start giving in to the criminal element and 
changing the laws of the land we are in real trouble.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, in her back-pedalling the hon. 
member is really missing the boat. Let me quote for her from the 
letter that was tabled by the Prime Minister from the 
commissioner of the RCMP in which he very clearly stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Normally an enforcement only enhancement would work but, in this case, the 
smuggling problem has become so pervasive that the number of additional 
resources required to resolve the problem would be so intrusive as to be 
unacceptable-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I do not have time to finish reading it, but I refer the member 
to the letter from the commissioner that was tabled in the House. 
We are attacking this. We are attacking on all fronts as 
recommended by the RCMP and all the advice we have been 
given.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The question is clear. 
The hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
please be brief.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot say it any more than I 
have said it before. We have laws in our land. There are reasons 
for our laws. I do not think we solve anything by changing our 
laws to give in to criminal activity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say to the previous speaker from the Reform Party that 
we do not solve any problems either by sticking our head in the 
sand. We had a tough decision to make. That decision was made 
on the basis of all the best  information we had from the RCMP, 
from Revenue Canada, from the different provinces, from the 
different agencies involved. We had a tough decision to make 
and we made it. Unfortunately other provinces in the country 
have not seen fit to do it. I would suspect that in the very near 
future we will see a lot more come on board after recognizing the 
problem.
<P>
	I do want to stand in support of the piece of legislation in the 
House today. Mr. Speaker, you know from our previous time 
here together that I spent a lot of time in the House talking 
directly about this issue. I have studied it substantially because 
of the make-up of my riding.
<P>
	Haldimand-Norfolk has a number of tobacco farmers, 
probably over 800 tobacco farmers out of the 1,200 left in 
Canada. I also have the largest Indian reserve in the country, the 
Six Nations which includes a number of places that sell tobacco, 
over 200. It is a problem for me on both sides.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that when tobacco is smuggled my 
tobacco farmer constituents do not make the same amount of 
money because on that product they get less money for it being 
exported to the States. They actually get a dollar less a pound. It 
is a two-price system and so that product that actually is being 
smoked in Canada has actually been exported.
<P>
	I also have on the Six Nations reserve a large number of 
people. I want to say to all members who might not have had an 
opportunity to visit reserves in the country that the 
overwhelming majority of people, at least on the largest reserve 
in the country, want to get rid of the smuggling problem.
<P>
	I get more people on reserve than off in my constituency 
saying that we have to deal with that problem. It was very 
important for me to get that message out. I get a sense in the 
House from the other side that somehow this is just an Indian 
problem. It is in a sense, but it is a sense that they want to solve 
this problem.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	That is why I was happy to see the Solicitor General take our 
advice on this side, sit down with native communities and try to 
work out solutions to this problem.
<P>
	There was a time in this House when members across the way 
were essentially saying we have to enforce the law everywhere 
in the country. Let us go in shooting and we can solve this 
problem.
<P>
	I do not think that is the solution. It is a larger problem than 
just enforcement. Enforcement is very important and that is why 
in this bill we have gone a long way to deal with the enforcement 
issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1695"> 1695 </A></B>
<P>
	I have talked about taxation in the House as being really the 
only way to dramatically solve the problem, but there are other 
ways in which we can add to the solution. I want to go through 
some of the things that we have done.
<P>
	We have increased customs examinations of high risk 
travellers. I think that is going to get a lot more smuggling than 
just tobacco smuggling. I think it might even help us solve our 
problem with the smuggling of guns and cocaine or other drugs 
that come into the country. We have a large border. I would 
suggest that over the years this problem has been a lot bigger 
than even we in the House talk about.
<P>
	The whole question of alcohol being smuggled is only a small 
problem. We have guns. We have different products that are 
coming across our borders that need to be addressed. I think this 
goes a long way in helping to address those problems.
<P>
	We are providing 24 hour commercial traffic clearance at 22 
ports that handle 99 per cent of the commercial traffic. We are 
examining the service charges for off hour service at these 
locations. We are extending hours of service at a number of 
existing ports. We are conducting border blitzes that target high 
risk travellers and carriers.
<P>
	I believe that in the bill we have gone beyond the taxation 
question. We have put in very needed border restrictions to make 
sure that we in the country control what comes into the country 
and we know specifically what is coming in.
<P>
	The real problem we have in the country today is not as much 
with the smuggling but it is an acceptance by Canadians that 
somehow not paying their fair share of taxes, ripping off the 
government, is a good thing to do. Unfortunately when it starts 
in cigarettes it continues. Canadians have to be told that it is not 
only governments but their responsibility also to follow the law 
and make sure that they contribute to the solution to this 
problem.
<P>
	I have never argued with the reason Canadians have been 
buying smuggled cigarettes. If they can get cigarettes at a 
cheaper price and feel that the government is not listening in 
terms of the taxation questions, they are going to do it. It is a 
question of taxation. We have to get it out of people's minds that 
somehow it is easy and it is natural to rip off the government by 
not paying taxes.
<P>
	We have a $45 billion deficit. We have to attack that deficit if 
we are to go into the next century and compete. In order to do 
that people have to feel that the taxation system under which 
they live is a fair system.
<P>
	Canadians have not felt that excise taxes on cigarettes, 
gasoline and alcohol have been fair taxes. As a result they have 
been more than willing to go around the law and do this. I think 
this tells Canadians that we understand these systems have been 
unfair and we are ready and willing to work with them to come 
up with real solutions.
<P>
	Regarding the smuggling in the country, the only way to deal 
with it was to bring down the taxes. There was no other answer. 
In terms of the export tax on it, I have never supported an export 
tax. Quite frankly it is not workable. The export tax in this 
regard, because the provinces have come on board and because 
the taxes have been slashed enough, will be irrelevant. We will 
not be exporting that cigarette product to the United States.
<P>
	Also in the bill there are exemptions for traditional exports. 
Those real exports that go elsewhere outside the States or the 
traditional ones that go to the States and are sold for 
consumption in the States will be protected. Tobacco farmers in 
my area were very pleased with that idea.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	In order to solve this problem we needed to do two things. We 
needed to take a tough stand and we needed to bring down the 
taxes.
<P>
	There are those who argue that somehow lowering taxes and 
lowering prices will let young people buy more cigarettes. I 
have heard many young people on television say: ``Oh, good. 
Now I am going to have easier access to cigarettes''. However 
that is not the case. Right now they can get cigarettes as quickly 
as they can buy a pizza in downtown Toronto. Cigarettes are 
easily obtained in school yards.
<P>
	However if we put in the enforcement making sure the 
penalties are high for selling cigarettes to young Canadians and 
setting the age at a certain point, young Canadians will be 
protected. They will not have that access. That easy access now 
is through smuggled cigarettes and they get them in the school 
yard.
<P>
	We have a good balance here. It is the balance of protecting 
young people from smoking, the balance of dropping the taxes 
so Canadians feel their taxation system is fair. At the same time 
there is the balance in enforcement, making sure that those who 
would illegally profit from this are caught. This approach will 
go a long way toward solving this problem.
<P>
	At the same time we have taken the opportunity to sit down 
with Canada's first people to discuss this question with them, 
rather than just going in hocus-pocus with guns blazing. We are 
trying to work with Canadians and our aboriginal peoples to find 
solutions to their problems.
<P>
	At the same time we are throwing a lot of people, who have 
been selling cigarettes granted illegally, out of work. It might be 
incumbent upon the government to recognize that fact. Where 
will they go if they are not selling cigarettes illegally? Most of 
these people are not the normal law breakers. Most of them are 
people who just want to make a buck. They did not have a job 
and were looking for an opportunity to make some quick cash.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1696"> 1696 </A></B>
<P>
	This question must be raised. Not a lot of people are talking 
about it as it is not something that really pops up in people's 
minds. It is the question of making sure there is economic 
development on our reserves so that those people who might 
turn to crime because they do not have any other economic 
activities would have some other alternative.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, cigarettes are the only product that when used as 
directed kill.
<P>
	Is the member in favour of cigarettes being included under the 
hazardous products act?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows that 
question came up before. In fact I think our hon. Speaker was on 
a committee that actually looked at that question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> You cannot make them safe under the Hazardous 
Products Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> No, of course not. I think it was something an 
NDP member raised in that committee. It is just impossible to 
do.
<P>
	If the government wants to outlaw smoking, fine. Compensate 
my tobacco farmers for the value of their farms and for the value 
of their future livelihoods and do it.
<P>
	Governments are quite hypocritical in this area. On the one 
hand they want all that big cash and on the other they say to my 
tobacco farmers that they are doing a nasty and dirty thing. That 
is not the case. All governments have to get off the pot on this 
question and make a decision. If they want to outlaw smoking 
then compensate my farmers. Allow my farmers to get on with 
their livelihoods rather than slowly strangle them to death.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I start by congratulating the Solicitor General and the 
Minister of Health for addressing what was obviously a life and 
death issue in the constituency I have the honour and privilege to 
represent in the House. I do not believe I am exaggerating the 
point when I describe it that way. Over recent years literally 
dozens of constituents of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell have 
been murdered or have disappeared as a result of tobacco 
smuggling and associated crime.
<P>
	When we talk about the ill effects of tobacco on young people 
I wonder how many of us have stopped to think of how many 
times a teenager working in a cornerstore has had his brains 
blown out so that someone else could steal the cigarettes from 
the shelves of that store to resell on the contraband market. That 
is not just in my riding. Unfortunately it has happened several 
times in this country.
<P>
	I want to describe the extent of this problem. It was 
highlighted by another member earlier today. The commissioner 
of the RCMP said in a letter tabled before the House: ``This 
implies a need to reduce the tax on cigarettes significantly 
enough to approach parity, thereby eliminating the profit motive 
for smugglers''. In saying that he was telling us the time had 
arrived whereby we no longer had the choice and this is what we 
had to do.
<P>
	It was not always that way. I remember when smuggling was 
about one-tenth the amount it is now or that it was when these 
measures were introduced. I remember on November 22, 1991 
rising in the House and addressing a question to the previous 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is what the then Solicitor General, Hon. Doug Lewis, 
replied on the subject of smuggling: ``Obviously it still exists a 
certain extent. We are doing everything we can to eliminate it''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is what was said at that time. In other words. do not 
bother us. It is not very important. It is no big deal.
<P>
	The last day Parliament sat before the election again I asked a 
question. I had asked questions many times. I asked the 
following and members might think the question was a little 
dramatic or at least members thought so at the time. In 
retrospect it certainly was not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On that occasion, I said the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Almost every night machine gun fire is heard and speedboats are running 
the rivers at full speed in the dark with their lights turned off pursuing criminal 
activity. I am not describing life in Sarajevo or Mogadishu. I am describing the 
practice of tobacco smuggling on the St. Lawrence River near Glengarry in my 
riding.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I made that statement in the House on June 13, 1993. And I went on to say:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``I want to ask a question of the Solicitor General on the last day of this 
Parliament. What precisely does the government intend to do to stop this illegal 
activity which endangers the lives and safety on my constituents? What is he 
going to do to ensure that we stop losing billions of taxpayers' dollars in this 
terrible process that is going on right now 50 miles from Parliament Hill?''</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nothing was done. Yes, there was a time when we could have 
done other things, federal and provincial governments, and in 
Ontario Mr. Rae could have done something.
<P>
	For two years the Ontario Provincial Police detachment at 
Lancaster, a stone's throw from Lake St. Francis, was closed at 
night. Only after I raised it publicly was the police station 
reopened last November. Imagine that. The police station in the 
area where all the criminal activity is taking place shuts down at 
night, courtesy of Bob Rae's cutbacks. That is what happened. 
He self-righteously said before the media last week and the  
week before he did not know this was a problem in Ontario and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1697"> 1697 </A></B>
<P>
that it was a regional problem in Quebec, as he or Mr. Laughren 
put it. Those statements were a little less than totally honest. He 
knew of the problem.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	My colleagues from western Canada will know of the report 
on tobacco smuggling by the Mackenzie Institute. All of them 
have received copies of the report. It explains to what extent this 
criminal activity has gone on. If members have not received it I 
will gladly provide them with copies.
<P>
	Everything we hear today and have heard for the last weeks in 
this House the Mackenzie Institute has been telling us for 
months. However members were not listening. This government 
has listened. For three years I and others tried to get the previous 
government to act for the safety and security of Canadians and 
for the respect of the law and nothing was done. Within three 
months the new government did something and I am proud of it.
<P>
	Some people claim tobacco smuggling is a victimless crime. I 
want to read what Claude McIntosh, the associate editor of the 
<I>Standard Freeholder</I> of Cornwall, wrote on July 3, 1993. He was 
citing examples of victims of smuggling. He wrote the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Cornwall welfare recipient switched to a supplier selling cartons $1 
cheaper than his previous supplier. His old supplier, fearful of losing other 
``accounts'', paid him a visit. During the conversation he had his arm broken in 
an ``accident''. He went back to the previous supplier. Welfare recipients are 
soft because they are: 1) more willing to take the chance, and 2) available night 
and day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Listen to this one about young people. A teacher ordered a 
disruptive student out of the classroom. On his way out the 
student reached into his pocket, pulled out a wad of bills and 
sneered: ``I don't need your education''. The student works as a 
runner in one of the cigarette smuggling cartels with the 
potential to earn more in six months than the teacher does in a 
year.
<P>
	That is the reality of smuggling. For those who wish to put 
their heads in the sand and think that is not a reality, well they 
are wrong.
<P>
	What kind of message does it give to our young people when 
the one who is smuggling cigarettes and selling them in schools 
drives around in a corvette while the rest of the students walk 
home at night? We are concerned about young people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The social contract has crumbled. When 60 to 70 per cent of 
cigarettes are sold illegally, as it is the case in Quebec-35 per 
cent in Ontario, very close to 100 per cent in my riding and as 
much as 25 to 30 per cent in Western Canada-I tell you that the 
social contract has crumbled in that respect and that we have 
returned to the so-called hobbesean state of nature: Every man 
for himself.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Life is brutish and short, as Thomas Hobbes put it. That is not 
the kind of society we want. We have to restore that social 
contract. The way of doing that was to take every action 
necessary, all governments together in concert. The federal 
government and the Government of Quebec did it. The 
Government of Ontario was dragged in kicking and screaming in 
order to do that which it should have done in the beginning. 
Nevertheless it has done so now.
<P>
	There is another article from the <I>Standard Freeholder</I>. It was 
written by Claudia Peel on February 16, 1994 and is entitled: 
``Smuggling is down to a trickle'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The volume of black market cigarettes moving through this region has 
dropped significantly since the federal government's crackdown on smuggling 
began one week ago today.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>OPP Det. Insp. Chris Lewis said police have seized some smuggled smokes 
since the federal anti-smoking plan went into effect last Wednesday. But the 
volume of contraband seized in the past week has been ``quite a bit less'' than 
police have been accustomed to seizing in a seven-day period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, action was required. I do not 
even have time to get into the whole issue of contraband, which 
thrives on illegality and leads to smuggling not only cigarettes 
but also drugs, alcohol and the likes.
<P>
	Whether we come from western Canada, Ontario or 
elsewhere, whether we are separatists, sovereigntists or 
federalists, I think that we all have the same interests. In our 
society, we want laws to be obeyed. What was done had to be 
done. And to conclude, I congratulate the government, because 
that action was necessary and was taken. I hope that we will soon 
be able to say that we have managed to eliminate this evil that is 
preying upon our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know 
if the previous speaker managed to convince himself after the 
fact, as his government is now trying to do, but he would like to 
convince us that the decision that was made was the right one.
<P>
	I think that the government lowered taxes on cigarettes 
because it did not want to tackle the real problem and stop the 
distribution of contraband goods on the territory implicitly 
affected by this bill; instead of dealing with the smugglers 
themselves, they went after the product. Except that it will be 
easy to replace that product with another, like alcohol, drugs or 
cocaine. To justify themselves, they said that they asked the 
commissioner of the RCMP, who told them to cut taxes. It is not 
up to the commissioner of the RCMP to make the laws in this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1698"> 1698 </A></B>
<P>
government, and you also need the political will to enforce the 
laws. When there is no will to enforce the laws, we end up with a 
bill like this one.
<P>
	The government shot into its own net with this. There can be 
no solution to this problem as long as there is no political will to 
intervene and break up the distribution networks for cigarettes, 
drugs, popcorn or whatever. We must break up the distribution 
networks. That is what the government did not have the courage 
to do.
<P>
	I would now ask the hon. member who just spoke if he has a 
personal solution to suggest to his government to break up the 
distribution networks. That is where the problem lies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I noticed that some hon. members 
were applauding, but not the hon. member for 
Argenteuil-Papineau, who, I think, shares some of my feelings 
regarding the effects of smuggling. He can see these effects 
from up close in his constituency. Besides, the hon. member who 
just asked me a question also faces a similar situation.
<P>
	He talks about the distribution network. It would be very 
naive to think that this distribution network did not exist in all 
parts of society before! In my own riding or, without even going 
that far, how many parliamentarians know that illegal cigarettes 
were sold right here on Parliament Hill?
<P>
	In my riding, the day before the Prime Minister made his 
announcement, I received a phone call from a constituent 
complaining that the village's local smuggler had just made a 
delivery to the parish priest's house. It is a sad, very sad 
statement.
<P>
	We saw the same thing in another region with the MATRAC 
group, when similar statements were made by other people in 
society sharing similar positions. These people did not see 
themselves as criminals, yet they unknowingly were part of an 
organized crime network.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member talked about realities. I would like to 
talk about realities as well.
<P>
	Reality number one is that, yes, smuggling is against the law. 
Reality number two is that when people break the law, law 
enforcement should ensure that they are caught and punished. 
Reality number three is that in recent months it has been clearly 
identified that 70 per cent of the cigarette smuggling was 
occurring on the Mohawk reserves. Reality number four is that 
the previous government failed to act on this smuggling. Reality 
number five is that the current government has failed to enforce 
the law that would curtail this smuggling as well.
<P>
	The reality is that for whatever reason the government has 
tied the hands of our law enforcement agencies, for political 
correctness perhaps, maybe for other hidden political agendas. 
The fact is that the RCMP has not been allowed to enforce the 
law, which is what it is supposed to do.
<P>
	Another sad reality is that the government has failed to do the 
right thing: enforce the laws of the country. It has chosen instead 
to do something totally opposite, to disregard the fact that there 
are law breakers that have to be stopped. It has chosen to lower 
the price of cigarettes. That is a far cry from enforcing the law.
<P>
	In reality I can imagine criminals on seeing a precedent set 
like this, saying: ``Okay, let's look for the next one and see if we 
can get them to move away from law enforcement''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think there was a question 
there. Let me add a reality number six or seven to what the 
member has just said. The reality is that the laws that were there 
have ceased to be laws because of the negligence of others in the 
past.
<P>
	Law and order had to be restored. It was done because it was 
the right thing to do. Politically correct, my eye, I say this to all 
my colleagues. When my constituents were being shot at and 
when people were losing their lives over crummy packages of 
cigarettes, it was time for governments to do something, and I 
am proud of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the hon. member's comments. It almost astounds me 
that we fail to realize what really has caused this problem.
<P>
	In the 1970s when the government of that day allowed 24 per 
cent interest rates, allowed farmers and businessmen to be put 
out of business, I stood beside graves of people who committed 
suicide because of the overspending and overmanipulation of 
the political system. Today he makes a very emotional speech. I 
wonder what he is going to tell his future great-grandchildren 
when they have no food to put on the table and they shoot each 
other because of it. Who will they blame then?
<P>
	It is because the governments of the last 25 years have not 
been able to make a decent decision to enforce laws, where 
thousands of people died in two world wars, that is why we have 
this problem today. We had better realize it or we will go down 
in history as some of the worst decision makers ever in the 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I understood the 
analogy the member was trying to draw. If he is insinuating that 
our ancestors fought for freedom and for respect for law, that is 
exactly what I am advocating as well.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is just 
getting good. I hate to spoil the party by speaking in support of 
Bill C-11, an act to amend the Customs Act and the Excise Act 
and the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act.
<P>
	In my riding of Calgary Centre this issue has attracted some 
concern and some comment. It is basically split 50:50. The 
government's four point action plan on smuggling comes under 
criticism where it lowers the price of cigarettes and that it 
impacts upon the increase in health costs and such. That is a 
concern and I have expressed it. Nevertheless in evaluating this 
bill and the steps taken by the government I feel it is worth going 
forward with it.
<P>
	The federal government is currently losing a guestimate of 
$60 billion to $80 billion per year to the underground economy. 
This loss of revenue has a direct negative effect on the ability of 
small law-abiding businesses to compete in the private sector. 
In the end it is the Canadian taxpayers who end up paying for the 
loss of revenue and the increased cost associated with the 
lucrative practice of smuggling.
<P>
	This problem is rooted in the fact that Canadians pay too 
much tax and have lost faith in government's ability to manage 
money, manage resources and live within its means. We will 
find out this afternoon at five o'clock how much better the 
government is going to do in managing resources and doing 
something with the economy.
<P>
	Canadians are finding it more and more acceptable to 
purchase smuggled goods because of the taxes and surtaxes they 
have had to pay legally on items. This problem is not limited to 
just cigarettes. It is a problem related to clothing, alcohol, 
groceries, jewellery, guns and the list goes on.
<P>
	According to government statistics the average price of a 
carton of cigarettes was around $45 to $48. The same carton 
could be purchased in the United States for $15. This differential 
made the cigarette trade appealing to many Canadian smokers 
and to a large degree organized crime.
<P>
	A single case of cigarettes containing 50 cartons can produce 
at least $500 profit. A thousand cases per week could therefore 
mean a profit of half a million dollars for suppliers. With this 
kind of profit motive it is no wonder smuggling has become so 
desirable.
<P>
	Canadian cigarette companies were well aware of this new 
market and as a result increased exports of cigarettes at an 
incredible rate. In 1985, 3.5 million cartons were exported to the 
United States. The figure now is over 62.8 million cartons per 
year. This increase of over 1900 per cent in eight years is not due 
to the fact that Americans have begun to love our cigarettes. 
Having gone to California quite often I know most of them hate 
them.
<P>
	Cigarette companies knew there was a market for the product 
and they were using it as a means to sell more cigarettes here in 
Canada. It is estimated that between 85 per cent to 90 per cent of 
the tobacco products destined for exports find their way back 
here.
<P>
	For non-smoking Canadians who do not feel that the problem 
of smuggling affects them I ask them to think again. The number 
of people charged by RCMP customs and excise has increased 
from 414 in 1990 to 3,389 to date. The number of seizures within 
this same timeframe has increased from 303 in 1990 to 5,044 to 
date.
<P>
	Increased enforcement and prosecution combined with the 
loss of government revenues cost the government over a billion 
dollars a year. In the end it is every Canadian taxpayer, not just 
those who drink or smoke, who end up paying these costs in the 
form of higher taxes.
<P>
	My party strongly believes that the federal government has a 
spending problem and not a revenue problem. Spending cuts 
alone will not make the problem of smuggling go away. The only 
way to truly eliminate the problem is to reduce the profitability 
to smugglers. By reducing the cost differential between 
smuggled and retailed cigarettes, ordinary cigarette smokers 
will have less incentive to seek out and purchase illegal 
cigarettes and on a larger scale organized crime will no longer be 
able to profit from it.
<P>
	Only when the profit is removed will smuggling be reduced. 
Law enforcement alone, without the removal of the profit 
margin, would not be enough to solve this major problem. Bill 
C-11 is the first of many necessary steps toward the elimination 
of the problem.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	It is estimated that over 70 per cent of smuggled cigarettes 
come through native reserves in Ontario and Quebec. As we 
know, this has become a major political issue over the past few 
weeks in the House, in question period and in the country.
<P>
	The fact is, however, that people of all colours and walks of 
life are involved in the illegal cigarette trade. Also there has 
been a smuggling stigma created by a small group of native 
Indians who are breaking the law that is having a negative effect 
on the majority of native Indians who obey the law.
<P>
	As some of my colleagues have said earlier, law enforcement 
on or off native reserves should be adhered to and should be 
adhered to quickly.
<P>
	There have been many concerns expressed by health 
organizations and individual Canadians who believe that by 
reducing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1700"> 1700 </A></B>
<P>
cost of cigarettes more people, especially younger people, 
children, will begin to smoke. In my opinion by raising the legal 
age to smoke, eliminating kiddie packs and limiting vending 
machines to bars the government has taken a step in the right 
direction toward the reduction of smoking for young people. 
This fact in combination with increased fines for retailers who 
sell to  minors and fines for minors who are caught smoking will 
help mitigate the problem.
<P>
	We must not lose sight of the fact that this bill is primarily 
targeted at the multibillion dollar smuggling market. Federal 
and provincial governments tax cigarettes and liquor not just to 
reduce consumption but to generate extra revenue for other 
programs. These so-called sin taxes combined with health 
awareness campaigns will not eliminate in its entirety the use 
and abuse of these substances.
<P>
	If we go back to before this act, what were the facts? The facts 
were that people were smoking and that people were drinking, 
except that the purchase of cigarettes went into an underground 
economy. This is an attempt to bring it to the surface. It is up to 
all Canadians to deal with this problem at home, in schools and 
in their communities.
<P>
	If further measures need to be taken by the government then 
we should vigorously examine all of our options. The bill 
addresses organized crime, the tobacco companies and respect 
for the law.
<P>
	The critics of the bill, including some of my caucus members, 
have focused on health care costs rising, more young people 
smoking and the loss of revenues at a time when government can 
least afford it. There are other means available to deter smokers 
without relying on taxation only. For instance, we could have 
variable insurance premiums for smokers and non-smokers, the 
same with alcohol drinkers and non-alcohol drinkers, the same 
with automobiles in that the more accidents one has or the more 
risk one is the higher the premium.
<P>
	The issue with respect to children is being addressed because 
to combat the lower price it is prudent and wise of the 
government to raise the legal age, introduce fines, enforce them 
on the school yards and restrict the use of vending machines to 
those venues that must check the age of the customer. Also, as I 
mentioned earlier, by eliminating mini-packs and labelling 
cigarettes for export this will restrict the flow of illegal and 
legal cigarettes to the youth of the country.
<P>
	Furthermore, the advertising and education programs about 
the effects of smoking should be recognized as an influencing 
factor, although not an end in itself. Despite the many lectures of 
parents to their children, despite the many TV commercials, 
people still smoke.
<P>
	We must remember that at the end of the day, try as 
government might, it really cannot legislate through taxation 
totally a country's social behaviour. It can only have an 
influence.
<P>
	Through this bill organized crime will be neutralized by the 
removal of profit and greater law enforcement. The two go hand 
in hand. My colleague, my seatmate, has indicated that law 
enforcement is the cure and I agree with her. I also believe that 
we have to lower the price to take the profit out of it.
<P>
	The tobacco companies are also being addressed and in a way 
punished for their past behaviour by the introduction of an 
export tax of 8 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	The increase in their corporate tax rate from 21 per cent to 30 
per cent and a 3 per cent surtax on the tax paid portion, which 
according to the Department of National Revenue will generate 
$200 million more revenue to the government, are indications 
that the tobacco companies are not getting away scot-free on 
this.
<P>
	In conclusion, law enforcement and respect for the law are 
very imperative, despite what the hon. member from the Liberal 
Party said earlier that they are doing it. They are not doing it. We 
have not seen any evidence of it being done but the RCMP must 
move swiftly to those known major areas of smuggling activities 
to eliminate the perception of two sets of laws in Canada.
<P>
	If this is not done and not done swiftly then all the critics of 
this bill will prove to be right and the government will be totally 
embarrassed. I do not smoke but I might go out and have one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to that contribution from the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre.
<P>
	He has taken quite an enlightened approach to this problem 
and pointed out a problem that every member has in the House 
which is that his or her constituents are split on the issue of 
taxation and the impact of taxation.
<P>
	It should be reinforced that the only reason tax reduction was 
introduced was that simply to impose an export tax would only 
look after about half of the cigarette smuggling problem.
<P>
	Close to half of the product that has been coming across the 
border as we all know now is counterfeit. It is manufactured in 
the United States and it has very nice looking Canadian 
packages and Canadian labelling. It is very difficult to tell it 
from the real thing.
<P>
	That was obviously the reason why that tax reduction was 
introduced. One thing that we can do is convey to all the citizens 
of this country through our constituencies that there was a 
reason for it. It is not intended to knuckle under to the tobacco 
industry. As a matter of fact it will be reinstated as soon as this 
problem is brought to an end.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1701"> 1701 </A></B>
<P>
	It is also important to put on record that Mr. Clinton in the 
United States with the introduction of his medicare bill has 
made it clear that tax will be added to American tobacco. That 
effort should help us a great deal. It behooves us all to encourage 
Mr. Clinton to bring that new tax in in the United States sooner 
rather than later.
<P>
	This is where the member for Calgary Centre slipped. He had 
my attention until he said there is no law enforcement. He will 
find and we all will find very quickly that the law is being 
enforced and it is being enforced very well. The RCMP is doing 
its job.
<P>
	Already we have a news report that in one area particularly 
smuggling has been reduced to a trickle. The smugglers are 
beginning to be put out of business. In the next few months we 
will be standing in this House applauding the RCMP for the very 
fine work it has been doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's opinions 
and comments. We know where the lines of communication are. 
The RCMP knows where they are. Why is there not a headline? 
Why are the people who are doing it not captured?
<P>
	I disagree that it has enforced the law. For months we have 
heard the same thing from the Prime Minister. He said that there 
is no such thing as a no-go zone and that the law will be enforced 
across the land. We see on television time after time, as a lot of 
the Bloc members brought up, that it is not being done.
<P>
	I would like to see the law enforced. I would like to see the 
police visual. I would like to see the police rather than the 
politicians capturing the headlines. I would like to see these 
crooks put in jail. That is what I would like to see but it is not 
happening.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister said he had a great reluctance to lower the 
tax, fine. The person who talked him into it was the head of the 
RCMP. This is what he needed in order to do his job, take the 
profit out of it and then he will go and capture these guys. Fine, 
the great RCMP can go and capture them. Let me see them 
captured. I have not seen it yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can agree about 85 per cent with my colleague from 
Calgary Centre.
<P>
	First, I agree with him most emphatically that the law 
enforcement the government has talked about simply has not 
happened. I draw a comparison between what would happen in a 
neighbourhood in most communities in Canada if there were a 
suspicion for example that there was an illegal marijuana garden 
in the basement of a house.
<P>
	I can assure members that from seeing the results of such 
activities in the papers over many years the RCMP is over that 
residence like a swarm of bees. I suggest that growing marijuana 
is breaking the law the same as smuggling cigarettes. I have not 
seen the RCMP forces  over the known areas of smuggling like a 
swarm of bees like we would see in other communities. I suggest 
that although law enforcement has been spoken about by the 
government it has not been happening.
<P>
	I also agree that a combination of law enforcement and tax 
changes regarding cigarettes is necessary to solve this problem. 
However I suggest a different formula.
<P>
	I suggest that rather than reducing the taxes on cigarettes in 
Canada we should have doubled the export tax that we presently 
have to $16 a carton. With the extra $8 a carton we could use that 
money to pay for increased law enforcement to cut down on the 
smuggling. We could cover the areas where the smuggling is 
taking place with a larger and more effective police force, one 
that was being paid for by the export tax that should have been 
added to the cigarettes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member did not agree with me 
100 per cent so I cannot have him as a seatmate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rompkey:</B> Eighty per cent is not bad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> On his second point, as a constructive alternative I 
do not really disagree with that suggestion. However it is not 
within our power to makes those kinds of rules. I can say that by 
admitting that he has agreed to 85 per cent of what I said, we will 
have another Reformer voting for the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know if I should put my hon. colleague on the hot seat, but 
I would like to run this past him and see how he would respond.
<P>
	There are many honest citizens in this country who object to 
taxes but who do not break the law in order to make their point. 
Here we have a government that has responded to illegal activity 
and reduced taxes. There are many farmers who have supported 
the Reform Party who really want tax reduction. Why does the 
government not respond to them with the same urgency with 
which it responded to a certain element in society?
<P>
	I wonder what my hon. colleague would say if I said there are 
many honest citizens in the country who really want tax 
reduction but do not break the law in order to do that. How can 
we reconcile what we have done here? If we support tax 
reduction for this reason why do we not have that same urgency 
in supporting it for the many honest people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very difficult, tough 
question. I guess a way that I would try to answer that is that the 
number of smugglers is low. The people who are cheating the 
system and who are developing this market are few, whether 
native Indians, white Anglo-Saxons, Chinese or American. We 
are not focusing on capturing the criminals. Where they sell the 
smuggled cigarettes is into a marketplace that a lot of Canadians 
have been willing to go because of the overspending of 
government after government after government, Liberals, 
Conservatives and now back again to Liberals. Instead of  
people going to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1702"> 1702 </A></B>
<P>
the store and paying somebody $48 a carton they will buy it if 
somebody shows up at $22.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	To solve that problem, take the profit out of it and we have it 
cured. If there is a health problem, there are ways that we can 
solve the health problem. If alcohol becomes a problem, we can 
solve that problem. It is not the honest farmers who are causing 
the problem. It is the few and minor elements of society that are 
making the many in society look bad and they are holding up the 
many in society to ransom.
<P>
	I hope I have answered the question somewhat.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I applaud the hon. member for Calgary Centre and 
congratulate him on his excellent speech. It was certainly very 
intelligent and totally comprehensive of the entire package that 
has been brought forward in this bill.
<P>
	I would like to indicate to the member that he has convinced 
me as to how I should vote on this bill. In terms of his 
colleagues, I appreciate the point that he has brought out, that 
we cannot legislate social attitudes and social behaviour. We can 
do everything in our power in this House to look at each issue 
comprehensively and try to find the best solution that serves the 
majority of people who are law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	I congratulate the member on the broadness and intelligence 
of his approach. I hope that he can take this to his colleagues and 
convince them of the merits of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member in his remarks seemed to equate law 
enforcement with the arrest and conviction of criminal 
smugglers.
<P>
	I want to ask him whether he thinks it is a more effective type 
of enforcement where the measures taken deter or prevent the 
smuggling from occurring in the first place. It seems to me that 
is the type of enforcement that we have encouraged with the 
broad range of measures which he seems to support. In other 
words, through increased resources to the RCMP and to customs 
agents, increased by lowering the price of the cigarettes, by a 
wide range of measures that is in the program, we are deterring 
continued smuggling at the level that it was at.
<P>
	I want to ask the member if that is not a better type of 
enforcement than having the crime take place and then 
attempting to arrest the person after the fact?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
question. That philosophy and that argument is what is forcing a 
lot of my colleagues to argue that the government was afraid to 
enforce the law. The law was there. We knew where the 
smuggling was taking place and nothing was being done about 
it. Nobody was going there and arresting those people. They 
were staying away from those areas.
<P>
	The member's philosophy now is or he is suggesting that by 
eliminating the profit out of smuggling that the smuggling will 
not occur and therefore the arrest will not have to happen.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Plus increase police resources.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Plus increase the police resources and enforce it. 
That is a fine argument, but we have not captured the people who 
were responsible for the smuggling in the first place. They will 
just find something else to smuggle now. If they knew who was 
doing it, why did they not arrest them prior to the price 
reduction?
<P>
	Like the complete four point package, it is a package. I think it 
is a way to solve this problem. To shy away from enforcing the 
law-and the Minister of Justice is listening to us intently 
here-is backing away and shirking your responsibilities. I am 
not saying that the minister has shirked his responsibilities, but 
somehow, and I am just repeating what has been said to me by a 
lot of people, there is a perception that there are two sets of laws, 
one for native Indians and one for on reserve and off reserve 
natives. The RCMP has been reluctant-I am not saying it was 
ordered not to-to enforce the law where the law was being 
broken.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	This is a package to eliminate all that. With respect to the 
members of my party who spoke out in terms of law 
enforcement, this is the area where the government's action has 
been weak; the argument about if the speed limit is being 
broken, then raise the speed limit and the law is not being broken 
any more. Let us enforce the law.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> My side woke up, finally.
<P>
	I think it is imperative that the government not shy away from 
its law enforcement duties even though it changed the law so 
that the law will not be broken.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, as in past weeks we have 
learned a lot today about the smuggling issue and we will 
continue to discuss the matter, but discussion is not enough. To 
the government members of the House the bottom line remains 
that we have a responsibility to take action now against what has 
become a national epidemic of problems created by smuggling. 
That is why I am speaking today in support of Bill C-11.
<P>
	As the hon. Minister of National Revenue pointed out earlier 
today, smuggling has grown into a national problem requiring a 
national solution. No longer is the smuggling phenomenon 
restricted to specific regions of the country. It has been 
evidenced today by many members in the House that it is wide-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1703"> 1703 </A></B>
<P>
spread across Canada. It has spread to all parts of Canada and it 
affects all Canadians.
<P>
	History has shown us that if left unchecked, the problem can 
only get worse. History has also shown us that empty threats and 
promises are not effective against this phenomenon. It is time 
for action now.
<P>
	As well, we have learned over the past few months that the 
costs of smuggling are staggering. Tobacco smuggling alone has 
cost the federal government over a billion dollars in lost 
revenue. The provincial governments have also lost a billion 
dollars to tobacco smuggling.
<P>
	This is revenue that was to be used for programs such as 
health, social services and employment, revenue that has been 
taken away from government thus reducing its ability to help 
Canadians who need it the most, revenue that has been placed 
into the hands of criminals and organized crime to finance their 
elicit activities.
<P>
	These activities are not restricted to contraband tobacco 
products but also drugs, alcohol and weapons. Smuggling has 
also cost the legitimate business operators in Canada who 
cannot compete with the tobacco contraband market. These 
businesses are losing more sales and in more areas of the 
country as contraband sales steadily increase.
<P>
	The costs are not all monetary. Smuggling is no longer just an 
issue of tax avoidance by smokers. It has resulted in cheap 
tobacco products being easily accessible to young Canadians. I 
want all Canadians to know that the smuggling networks have 
penetrated our school yards. They are offering cheap tobacco 
products to young people. These same networks that used to sell 
drugs and other contraband are used to sell drugs and other 
contraband products to our youth.
<P>
	Past government inaction and intolerance of tobacco 
smuggling has resulted in a disregard for Canadian laws, 
disregard not only from criminals but from Canadians who 
would otherwise be law abiding citizens.
<P>
	Bill C-11 is an integral part of this government's four point 
anti-smuggling and anti-smoking initiative. The proposed 
amendments that Bill C-11 will make to the Excise Act, the 
Customs Act and the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act are 
evidence of this government's resolve to act to restore respect 
for our laws and to protect young Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to describe again for those members present in 
the House the basic elements of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	The first amendment would allow the government to 
designate provincial and municipal police forces as appropriate 
with authority to enforce provisions of the Excise Act, 
expanding the police resources to combat smuggling.
<P>
	This will assist in cutting off the flow and distribution of 
contraband products into the marketplace. These are the same 
cheap products that are reaching our young Canadians and the 
same cheap products that undermine anti-smoking initiatives 
and drain revenues from legitimate public programs.
<P>
	The second amendment, both to the Excise Act and Customs 
Act, would allow for the immediate disposal of certain seized 
products without hindering the successful prosecutions of the 
criminals involved. This measure will save taxpayers 
significant costs each year by reducing the cost of storage of 
these goods and the resources needed to protect and monitor 
them.
<P>
	The third amendment to the Excise Act will require that each 
individual cigarette that is to be sold in Canada be stamped to 
indicate that the federal taxes have been paid. This amendment 
will greatly assist enforcement agencies in identifying 
contraband cigarettes. In addition law-abiding citizens will be 
able to easily identify someone smoking contraband cigarettes. 
We will be able to know if anyone in the room or our neighbour 
has bought legal cigarettes.
<P>
	The last two proposed amendments to Bill C-11 are to the 
Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act. The first of the two 
amendments would prohibit the manufacture and the sale of 
so-called kiddie packs of tobacco products in Canada. These 
kiddie packs contain fewer than 20 cigarettes per package and 
are targeted specifically to the young people of Canada.
<P>
	The second of the two amendments will prohibit the 
importation of tobacco products into Canada by anyone under 
the age of 18. This will provide Canada Customs with the 
authority to prevent young persons from importing tobacco that 
they could otherwise not legally purchase in Canada.
<P>
	As the hon. minister has outlined for everyone today, action 
has to be taken to address the smuggling problem in this country. 
Bill C-11 specifically supports two key elements of the 
government's anti-smuggling initiative, enforcement and the 
health and safety of young Canadians.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Excise Act and Customs Act 
will provide additional tools to police forces to help them crack 
down on all facets of the smuggling trade. The proposed 
amendments to the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act will 
support the protection of the health and safety of young 
Canadians.
<P>
	This bill is an essential element of the government's overall 
strategy. We certainly do not pretend that these proposed 
amendments offer a complete solution to the problem. Rather, 
they support the broader anti-smuggling initiatives that this 
government has undertaken. Without these amendments the 
government's efforts to combat smuggling would be 
significantly undermined.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1704"> 1704 </A></B>
<P>
	The time to take action is now. As we can see from the debate 
today, this is a very controversial topic. But as we can also see 
from the debate today, there are many members on the opposite 
side of the House who would agree with this government's 
action. This action by the government reflects the responsibility 
of all parties that have interest in this debate.
<P>
	This government can no longer afford to allow the momentum 
of this phenomenon to continue to accelerate. It is for this reason 
that we ask all members to support the passage of Bill C-11.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I notice that 
the hon. member mentioned smuggling of alcohol. The price of a 
bottle of spirits in Canada is about $20 as opposed to about $10 
in the United States. Eighty-seven per cent of the price of a 
bottle of spirits in Canada is made up of taxes. An estimated four 
million cases of 12 bottles are smuggled into Canada every year 
from the U.S. and about 13 million cases are sold legally in 
Canada.
<P>
	Provincial governments and the federal government are 
losing billions of dollars in revenue as a result of this 
smuggling. I am wondering when the government is going to 
come up with a plan to reduce the taxes on alcohol because there 
is exactly the same scenario here. These cases are parallel in my 
mind.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member when she would 
recommend that taxes on alcohol be reduced.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, this government's action plan has 
addressed the issue of smuggling. We have addressed and 
acknowledged that smuggling is not limited to tobacco. This 
plan is set out with that focus in mind: to address all aspects of 
tobacco, alcohol, guns, whatever. We are increasing 
enforcement by 25 per cent. The bill allows certain sections of 
enforcement to be expanded and given to designated police 
forces to assist in combating smuggling, not just of tobacco but 
of alcohol and other items as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
to note that most of the comments and arguments in support of 
this bill are, as everyone will concede, quite logical. Sadly, these 
arguments should have been made one, maybe even two, years 
ago when the Government of Quebec requested Ottawa's help in 
halting the spread of contraband activities and in eradicating 
this problem.
<P>
	We were experiencing similar problems with our young 
people. They were dropping out of schools and joining 
smuggling rings. However, the problem was not viewed as too 
serious because it was occurring primarily in Quebec. Now that 
Quebec, through the presence of 54 Bloc Quebecois members in 
Ottawa, has forced the government's hand, forced it to take 
action and support Quebec's position, others are starting to get 
worried. It is  as if suddenly, it is morally right to abolish a law 
which had become punitive.
<P>
	People no longer obeyed the law, not because they had 
become thieves, but because they were no longer able to obey it, 
Mr. Speaker. That is what we are trying to denounce today.
<P>
	Steps should have been taken two years ago so that these 
situations could have been avoided altogether. In some cases, it 
is perhaps too late. Our young people have been drawn into these 
smuggling networks. Perhaps the future of these 15 or 16 year 
olds who make $1,000 a week through their involvement with 
smuggling has been ruined forever.
<P>
	The government should have admitted at the time that the 
problem existed, not just or primarily in Quebec, and that it 
represented a real danger for the rest of Canada. It should have 
intervened.
<P>
	If the government takes action that is too harsh, such as 
imposing ill-considered fines, it runs the risk that these fines 
will be paid under the table. If people start bribing officials, our 
jails will never be big enough and we will have another problem 
on our hands. That is what always happens. I hope that the 
government has learned its lesson and that in its budget speech 
this evening, it will not announce further ill-considered taxes 
which will push citizens to the breaking point.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the parliamentary secretary wish 
to comment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not agree with the hon. 
member more that if two years ago the government had taken 
action we would not find ourselves in the situation we are today.
<P>
	Unfortunately the government two years ago did not take 
action. There are members on this side of the House who have 
pressed this issue for the past five and six years. Unfortunately 
the past government did not take action. However that is what 
we are doing with our anti-smuggling and action plan. We are 
taking action.
<P>
	I would also like to inform the hon. member, in case he is not 
aware, that this government was aware of the problem as an 
opposition party. We took hold of the problem when we became 
the government. We began addressing the problem immediately 
after the October 25 election.
<P>
	If the hon. member would refer to newspaper articles he 
would see that before the House was recalled in January we had 
already begun discussions. We are dealing with the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
congratulate the member for Essex-Windsor on a very 
thoughtful presentation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1705"> 1705 </A></B>
<P>
	The speaker previous to her started a debate that got picked up 
by the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. It relates to 
enforcement. There are two ways of doing that. Looking at 
policing nowadays, there is proactive policing which is being 
promoted by all police forces versus reactive policing. The 
concept of proactive policing is that we try to prevent crimes 
from taking place versus reacting to a crime and trying to catch 
the criminals after the fact.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Has the member thought about the distinction between the 
two and which she might find more preferable?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, this government has addressed the 
criminal aspect and how we can prevent it from happening.
<P>
	As mentioned earlier, clause 3 of this bill allows for enhanced 
enforcement of other police officers and other police forces 
designated by the government. That will assist us in preventing 
future smuggling and will stop it before it accelerates any 
further.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see from 
the list I have been asked to speak on justice enforcement. I am 
pleased to do that because I believe justice is one word which is 
rapidly disappearing from Canadian society.
<P>
	Justice to me has always meant that the wrongdoer is caught, 
brought to accountability, prosecuted and when found guilty is 
punished. And the punishment is supposed to meet the crime. 
Seeing what is going on today with Bill C-11, we have really 
shown these smugglers a thing or two. We have lowered the 
taxes and has that not taught you a lesson, Mr. Smuggler? Boy, 
you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I bet that frightens you.
<P>
	I cannot for a moment believe we think this is justice. We have 
a country full of smugglers who are happy to carry on with 
smuggling cigarettes east and west as much as they can but will 
probably move into other areas, maybe alcohol. They may have 
to go to illegal drugs. Probably a lot of pornographic material 
could be worked on. Smuggling has become a thriving industry. 
But there is a tough government and if smugglers are caught it 
will compromise.
<P>
	We have become a country of compromisers. No longer do we 
punish for wrongdoing. We need only to look at first degree 
murderers. We have compromised to the point where a first 
degree murderer can be back on the street in 15 years. Through 
legislation we have compromised to that.
<P>
	We have compromised so successfully that in my riding when 
I tour around I see bars on the windows of the houses and stores. 
We do not need bars on jails any more; we need them on the 
doors of our homes and businesses so we can lock law abiding 
citizens in while the crooks run around on the streets.
<P>
	I really am concerned. What is wrong with the idea of justice?
<P>
	We have a new bill, Bill C-11. This bill was brought about 
because the government could not or was not willing to enforce 
the current laws. We have laws against smuggling and now we 
have a new bill. I am not sure whether this is a way of finding 
work for certain bureaucrats. It will keep them busy producing 
more paper for us to look at.
<P>
	We certainly did not need a new law to enforce smuggling. 
What we need is action from a government that has the political 
will to say it is time to stop compromising with the criminal 
element in the country and that justice will prevail regardless of 
race, colour, creed or who one is. Criminals in the country must 
pay the consequences.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister admitted that 70 per cent of the cigarette 
smuggling problem occurred in limited areas in Quebec and 
Ontario. If that was known, why did the government not do 
something about the law breaking under the existing law? ``Oh, 
but we did. We lowered the taxes''. I keep hearing that. ``We 
have stopped the smuggling cold. No, we did not want to go in 
there with guns blazing. We cannot do that. We have to take 
these other kinds of compromising positions''. It is going on and 
on and has been going on for many a year.
<P>
	The Prime Minister filled the House with sounds of fury the 
other day, blustering about getting tough with smugglers. I am 
waiting to see that happen. One moment the government 
concedes that smuggling occurs in limited areas in Ontario and 
Quebec. The next moment it is telling Canadians that smuggling 
is Canada wide. I do not doubt that for a moment.
<P>
	When are we going to address the fact that there are law 
breakers out there? Instead of sitting back in our closets trying 
to dream up some scheme that will cause them to quit, why not 
bring punishment forward? Justice is one thing the country has 
been proud of in the past and should be proud of in the future.
<P>
	I really became discouraged when I heard a member a while 
ago saying that enforcement was going to take place. Then he 
talked about the young person who would have a pack of 
cigarettes in his possession. Boy, we are really going to get that 
young person if we catch him with cigarettes.
<P>
	The other day we talked about a bill and how severe it was 
going to be if a person was caught using an illegal drug. I did not 
hear anything about what we were going to do to the suppliers, 
not a great number of people, who put those things in the hands 
of our youth. We never hear that.
<P>
	We hear stories about car bombings that are supposed to be the 
result of some organized crime associated with smuggling. Yet a 
Canadian journalist cannot find this car bombing, if it took 
place. I did not read anything in  media reports about a car being 
bombed because there was some kind of battle going on over 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1706"> 1706 </A></B>
<P>
smuggling territory. I did not read anything about it, but 
apparently that is what happened. Why are these things so hush, 
hush?
<P>
	The Prime Minister states there are no no-go zones. Yet a 
journalist reports of an RCMP officer having shots fired at him 
while observing smuggling. I did not see any report anywhere 
where the police had entered, searched or confiscated the 
weapons used to fire upon that police officer. Is it not the law 
that you do not fire upon police officers when they are trying to 
do their duty? If so, why was that law not enforced?
<P>
	The Prime Minister has stated that the warriors on the 
Mohawk reserve have paramilitary weapons. Mr. Speaker, you 
had better not have any paramilitary weapons up there in 
Edmonton because they are going to come after you. Why is this 
just being ignored?
<P>
	I inquired and discovered that aboriginal Canadians on 
reserves are bound by the same laws as all Canadians. When are 
we going to treat it that way? I did not hear that police had 
confiscated any restricted weapons that were documented as 
being used upon members of the RCMP.
<P>
	I have problems believing that any new law preventing 
smuggling is going to be any better than the old law. Until we get 
the political will in this House, until we get to the point where 
we say justice must prevail, we have got to stop compromising 
with criminals and start enforcing the law and making justice 
happen. It has to meet the crime.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Stopping the so-called kiddie packs is the one thing that is 
excellent about this bill. The only problem is that we will not 
have to worry about the kiddie packs any more because now they 
can afford the 25 packs. Nothing was solved but it was a good 
gesture just the same.
<P>
	I really do not understand why we could not put a high import 
tax on all Canadian manufactured tobacco products. If we would 
have done that, the price differential between domestic and 
smuggled cigarettes would have been so small that would have 
stopped it. However, that still does not for one moment indicate 
to me that is the answer. The smugglers can now carry on and 
find something else to smuggle. They have now been punished 
because we have made it impossible for them to smuggle 
cigarettes.
<P>
	I have looked at the whole issue. I am prepared to support Bill 
C-11 if it will cause the government to go out there and uphold 
the law and treat all laws with equality. Good for them, if that is 
what it takes. However, I do not see where it is going to make a 
lot of difference if it continues to have the same lack of will to go 
out into our communities and tell the law-abiding citizens that 
for once it is going to look after their needs and their best 
interests because the bad guys are the ones who need to  get 
caught and punished. When are we going to start doing it? The 
sooner the better.
<P>
	I can recall not too many years ago when I saw people sell 
booze to minors. Those people were arrested and put into jail for 
30, 40 or 60 days. It was at a point when people would say: 
``We'd best not do it because we can get into trouble''. There is 
no fear of the law. I use fear in terms of respect. There is no 
respect and it is bodies like this that cause that lack of respect. 
Put the respect back into the law by giving the police and those 
who are asked to enforce it the power that is necessary to support 
them and concentrate on the victims.
<P>
	I will support Bill C-11 simply because if that is what it takes 
for the government to do something then I will support it. Law 
enforcement and justice must prevail. I have not seen where it is 
going to do it. I am waiting for the big day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
appears that the gist of what the hon. member for Wild Rose has 
been saying is that reduced taxation results in too much 
disposable income in the hands of certain people and those 
people then go and buy cigarettes and alcohol.
<P>
	I wonder if it is the policy of the Reform Party that taxation 
should not be reduced in any area because it will leave too much 
disposable income in people's hands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I see they listen as well now as 
they do during Question Period. I never mentioned for one 
moment that reducing taxes was going to cause any problems.
<P>
	What I am saying is that reducing taxes is not what I call 
justice for the criminal element. We are going to reduce taxes 
and, boy, that will teach those guys a lesson. That is what is 
hogwash.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has been concentrating on law enforcement and talking 
about the criminal element. I would like to take this opportunity 
to make a comment and to remind the member that there is a 
distinction between civil legislation and criminal legislation 
and the enforcement of criminal provisions versus the 
enforcement of civil provisions. This proposed bill does not 
lessen or detract from the criminal law, nor does it detract from 
the enforcement provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada. It 
introduces a new authority to enforce the civil provisions of the 
Customs Act, the civil provisions of the Excise Act and the civil 
provisions of the Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1707"> 1707 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	No authority currently exists under the Excise Act to allow 
police forces other than the RCMP to enforce civil provisions of 
the act. What we are talking about today is the enforcement of 
civil provisions of these acts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry but I was distracted a 
little bit. I did not get all of the comment. As far as enforcement 
of the civil aspect, yes, we want that.
<P>
	I am talking about the criminals, the smugglers. That is 
criminal. That comes under the Criminal Code if I am not 
mistaken. If you get caught for smuggling you should pay the 
penalty. I have not seen that happen and it is high time it did.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member and in his speech he 
repeated several times that justice should prevail. Of course we 
all agree that justice should prevail, but I notice that the hon. 
member's definition of justice is to be as tough as we can on the 
criminal and then everything will be just fine and dandy.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> They all agree. It is my interpretation that the 
purpose of the criminal justice system is to prevent crime from 
taking place, to protect the public from crime.
<P>
	In the southern United States they do just what the Reform 
Party is suggesting, be tough and throw away the key. They have 
the highest rates of violent crime in the civilized world. That is 
what the hon. member is suggesting, be tough, but forget about 
protecting the public from the crime that takes place in the first 
place.
<P>
	What you have got to do if you are interested-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member for 
Wild Rose.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, if this member thinks for a 
moment that all we have to do is go out there and say: ``You're 
not going to be able to do this any more, you lawbreakers, 
because we are going to lower the taxes'', and they are not going 
to get engaged in some activity, then I do not know what he has 
been thinking about.
<P>
	It has always been in this country, as long as I can remember 
since I have been here, that if one breaks the law one will pay the 
price and the price of that lawbreaking must fit the crime. 
Letting the criminal go on the streets is not doing that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
not want to presume to mediate between the government and the 
Reform Party on this but the point that is trying to be made by 
the hon. member is that what the government has done has in 
some way subverted the rule of law by changing the tax structure 
in order to deal with a problem which is essentially criminal in 
nature and that is smuggling.
<P>
	If we believe in the rule of law, it is not a question of how hard 
we are on criminals, it is a question of whether we are hard on 
them at all. In fact what we have done here is simply changed the 
law in order to accommodate a circumstance that could have 
been dealt with in other ways.
<P>
	That is the point I certainly want to make and have the 
member comment on. There are times when people break the 
law and we change it because it reflects changing values and 
changing circumstances, but I am not aware of changing values 
and changing circumstances that say smuggling is all right and 
we should therefore not try to deal with that simply by changing 
taxes.
<P>
	There is the fundamental question here that the government 
has avoided. I can understand some of the reasons why it did 
what it did, but it is fair to say that the rule of law has been 
subverted by what the government has done. The government 
has chosen not to enforce law. It has chosen rather to change it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that is what I tried to 
say in my speech, but I do not want to leave out one factor. I will 
repeat it once again. Lowering taxes, as the hon. member was 
saying, as a method of stopping smuggling and then saying 
smuggling is okay is the thing I oppose. Smuggling is not okay. 
Smugglers must be caught, stopped and punished if we are going 
to put an end to it. They are going to find other things to smuggle 
and it will continue. You can mark my words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me pleasure to rise on this matter because again we continue to 
stray away from the fundamental thrust of the government's 
proposal and that is to break the back of smuggling now, not to 
deal with it after it has happened.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons why the government introduced the 
excise tax reduction, the export tax addition and the surtax on 
manufacturers. It was to ensure that the combination of those 
actions would eliminate the profit incentive to the smugglers 
and break the back of smuggling.
<P>
	The member has missed the point entirely and so has the 
entire Reform Party. I am absolutely astounded that after four or 
five hours' debate it continues to have such a narrow view of the 
world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not believe we did miss the 
point of the debate, not for one little bit.
<P>
	What the government is missing is that you do not 
compromise with criminals and say that they are free to go and 
do their thing again. Punishment has to come into play. I am 
calling for justice along with all the other moves that the 
government is making. That is only normal.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House approve in general the budgetary policy of the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Prime Minister, members of this 
House, I certainly hope you stand up at the end of this speech.
<P>
	I must say this is the fifth time that I have risen in this House 
to speak on a budget. It is the first time there has been anybody 
in the House when I spoke.
<P>
	I am rising to table the budget documents, including notices 
of ways and means motions. Details of the measures are 
included in the documents.
<P>
	Pursuant to an order of this House I will introduce a bill 
seeking borrowing authority for the 1994-95 fiscal year. I am 
asking that an order of the day be designated for consideration of 
these motions.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	This budget follows an unprecedented degree of consultation 
with Canadians. We have gained a great deal from this process, 
but one thing stands out above all others. Canadians seek 
fundamental change. They want their government to have a 
game plan and pursue it, a strategy for jobs and for growth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians know the kind of Canada they want.
<P>
	Our goal is a Canada where every Canadian able to work can 
find a meaningful job.
<P>
	A Canada where government facilitates change rather than 
blocking it.
<P>
	A Canada where our public finances are in order, not ruin.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The days of government simply nibbling at the edges are over. 
The practice of endless process without product is gone. Our 
task is to put an end to drift. We need a new architecture for 
government and for the economy. That will not happen by 
leaning on nostalgia.
<P>
	This budget sets in motion the most comprehensive reform of 
government policy in decades. We are putting in place an agenda 
for innovation in the new economy. We are responding to the 
needs of small business. We are launching a strategy through 
which government knows both when it can lend a helping hand 
and, as important, when it should stand aside.
<P>
	We are undertaking a major effort to build a responsible social 
security system that is fair, compassionate and affordable, and 
that means making fundamental changes to our unemployment 
insurance system. It means overhauling the structure of 
federal-provincial transfers for social programs. It means doing 
so in a co-operative way with predictability built in, setting 
aside the old tactics of stealth and surprise.
<P>
	The cold war is over. This budget sets out immediate actions 
attuned to the 1990s, actions that will be followed by a 
comprehensive review of Canada's defence policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To succeed we must get monetary and fiscal policy right. We 
have done the first. We are a low inflation country. We will stay 
that way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are and we will remain a low inflation country.
<P>
	It is now time for government to get its fiscal house in order. 
For years governments have been promising more than they can 
deliver and delivering more than they can afford. That has to end 
and we are ending it.
<P>
	The actions taken in this budget will reduce the deficit from 
$45.7 billion this year to $39.7 billion in 1994-95 and $32.7 
billion the year after.
<P>
	This is a two-stage budget. Therefore, detailed fiscal 
projections are presented to 1995-96 only. However, in terms of 
deficit reduction we are not waiting for the second stage. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1709"> 1709 </A></B>
<P>
decisions taken today by themselves set us on a clear path to 
achieving the government's deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP in 
three years.
<P>
	We will achieve this by using reasonable economic 
assumptions, not rosy forecasts. We believe that it is more 
important to meet a target than to declare an illusion and then 
fall short.
<P>
	Canadians have told us that they want the deficit brought 
down by reducing government spending, not by raising taxes, 
and we agree. The era of tax and spend government is gone.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Over the course of the next three years, for every $1 raised in 
new revenues, we are cutting $5 in government expenditures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But success does not lie in government shutting down and 
sitting on the sidelines. Success lies in careful and creative 
engagement in the economy. It is not the principle of industrial 
strategy that is wrong. It has been the practice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is a budget about jobs, jobs for today and jobs for 
tomorrow. It is about implementing a strategy and taking 
immediate action. This is a two-stage process, not a 20-stage 
process. There are due dates, there are deadlines and there are 
firm fiscal targets to guide our reform.
<P>
	We believe that there are three central challenges to be met. 
The first is to build a framework for economic renewal. The 
second is to construct responsible social programs. The third is 
to restore fiscal sanity to government so that it can devote its full 
energy to helping Canadian workers and Canadian families 
adjust to a world of change.
<P>
	Let me begin with the first challenge, jobs, training, 
innovation. We are keeping our word. The infrastructure 
program is in place. It accomplishes what has been proposed 
before but rarely done, getting Canada's three levels of 
government working together for jobs.
<P>
	We have restored full funding for literacy programs. To 
support apprenticeship training, the department of human 
resources is creating a youth internship program with the 
provinces and the private sector. Finally, the Youth Service 
Corps is being launched at up to 20 sites to give young 
Canadians meaningful work experience.
<P>
	The question, then, is once trained, where are these young 
people going to find employment? The answer for most is in 
small and medium size business. They are today's vital vehicle 
for jobs. What does small business need? I will tell you one 
thing, Mr. Speaker, it is not another massive government 
program. Small business needs lower taxes, it needs access to 
capital, it needs fewer regulations and less red tape.
<P>
	Payroll taxes are a barrier to jobs. They are a disincentive to 
go out and hire. In 1995, without action legislation it would 
require that unemployment insurance premiums shoot up to 
$3.30 from their current rate of $3.07. We will not let that 
happen.
<P>
	More important, after discussion with the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Human Resources Development, the government 
has decided to roll back the 1995 UI premium from $3.07 to 
$3.00. This will save industry almost $300 million a year, 
money to be reinvested in new jobs.
<P>
	Furthermore, as reform of the social security system kicks in 
and further significant savings are realized, more reductions in 
the UI premium rate will be possible and we as a government 
will see to their implementation.
<P>
	Small business must have access to adequate capital. New 
practices, new attitudes on the part of the lending community 
are essential. To that end, a joint industry-finance task force has 
been set up to work with the banks and with small business to 
address these issues. Their first task is to develop a code of 
conduct for small business lending. That code will ensure that 
the criteria for loan approvals are transparent and provide small 
business for the first time with an instrument to exercise 
complaints when loans are turned down.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	In addition, the Minister for International Trade and I will 
soon be convening a meeting of the heads of the Canadian banks 
and the Export Development Corporation to seek an enhanced 
means of furthering the capacity of small business to export.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This government is taking other steps to help small business 
grow.
<P>
	We will intensify and accelerate the effort to reform and 
remove regulations that create confusion and cost. We are 
putting in place a task force to provide, on a fast-track basis, a 
better regulatory regime that will improve the competitiveness 
of business.
<P>
	We have accelerated the process for GST reform.
<P>
	One-stop shopping for government services will be 
expanded, so that there will be a Canada Business Services 
Centre in every province of Canada by next year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This summer we will issue a declaration of quality service 
delivery standards for all government departments.
<P>
	Funding will be provided for a business networks strategy to 
help small firms achieve together what they cannot achieve in 
isolation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1710"> 1710 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Transport will implement needed 
improvements to the service freight transportation system with 
his provincial colleagues and stakeholders.
<P>
	Finally, the residential rehabilitation assistance program, a 
major contributor to the home renovation industry, is being 
reinstituted. Furthermore, in consultation with the Minister of 
Pubic Works and Government Services, we are replacing the 
existing temporary home buyers' plan with a permanent 
program that will allow first time buyers to use RRSP funds to 
purchase a home.
<P>
	These things are now underway. There remains much more to 
do. Therefore today with this budget the Minister of Industry 
and I, the government, are issuing a document that will serve as 
the basis of an intensive dialogue with small business to 
determine how we build from here. The 1995 budget will 
incorporate the results of these discussions.
<P>
	Innovation and ideas are essential for jobs today and in the 
future. They are our country's new natural resources. The 
federal government spends some $6 billion a year on science and 
technology. Yet there is a major research and development 
shortfall in Canada. Public and private sector performance must 
be improved. We need to do better at getting ideas to market.
<P>
	Therefore, after years of rhetoric and promises, the federal 
government will put in place a true strategy for R and D, one 
with real priorities, real direction and a real review of results.
<P>
	We will develop a new long term space plan over the course of 
the next 10 years, $800 million, that is both affordable and 
which offers the best possibility of commercialization and the 
creation of jobs. We will concentrate on areas of Canadian 
advantage, such as satellite technology.
<P>
	As part of the exercise, however, of putting in place new 
priorities and because of very tight fiscal circumstances, 
unfortunately we have had to make two decisions relating to 
current R and D programs.
<P>
	First, we are withdrawing federal support for the KAON 
particle accelerator project.
<P>
	Second, we have decided to negotiate an orderly reduction in 
current commitments to the international space station program.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	In today's circumstances we must focus our R and D spending 
on areas where Canada has an advantage, areas where jobs can 
be created and where a clear market exists.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To create jobs and to help small business get access to cutting 
edge technology, we will create a technology partnership 
program with universities and government labs, a Canada 
investment fund to provide needed capital and an engineers and 
scientists program.
<P>
	The councils and agencies that fund university research are 
being excluded from spending reductions contained in this 
budget.
<P>
	Funding for the National Research Council will be increased 
in 1994-95 after years of cuts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the weeks ahead, the Minister of Industry will be putting 
forward two papers; the first on the information highway, the 
second on the government's priorities in terms of science and 
technology. These papers will set the stage for an intense 
national dialogue on the challenge that is required to take 
existing resources and redirect them toward the creation of a 
national system of innovation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We believe that respect for the environment and economic 
renewal go hand in hand.
<P>
	In order to assist the establishment of mine reclamation 
funds, we are proposing changes to permit mining companies to 
deduct their contributions to these funds.
<P>
	We are also improving the tax treatment of certain types of 
energy conservation equipment and we are providing enhanced 
incentives for newer, clean technologies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This government is committed to sustainable development. 
Later this year the Ministers of Environment and Industry will 
put forward a strategy to encourage the growth of the 
environmental technology and services industry.
<P>
	Furthermore, we are establishing a task force involving 
government, industry and the environmental NGOs to identify 
barriers and disincentives to sound environmental practices and 
to find effective ways in which to use economic instruments to 
protect the environment. And this is but the beginning.
<P>
	As a country, we must never put aside our compassion and our 
obligation to help those who are in need. Our social programs 
must be made more responsible so that they build bridges to 
work, to independence, not dependence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the red book we proposed a prenatal nutrition program; an 
Aboriginal Head Start program; a centre of excellence for 
women's health; the restoration of the court challenges program 
and the Law Reform Commission and proclamation of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1711"> 1711 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian Race Relations Foundation. This budget, Mr. Speaker, 
keeps our word.
<P>
	Charities play an essential role in Canadian society. To 
encourage charitable donations, we are lowering the threshold 
for the 29 per cent credit rate from $250 to $200. We 
acknowledge this is a modest step, but we believe it goes in the 
right direction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As part of the strategic initiatives on social reform, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development will undertake a 
demonstration project in partnership with the Government of 
Prince Edward Island and the Canadian Association for 
Community Living. This pilot project will seek to achieve 
enhanced opportunities for persons who have an intellectual 
disability.
<P>
	It is often women who bear the brunt of social stress and 
economic dislocation. This budget begins to address existing 
disparities by ensuring that low income earners with 
dependants, most of whom are single mothers, are more fairly 
treated by the changes to the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the issue was raised of disparities that are 
perceived to exist in the tax treatment of child support payments 
as well as the issue of their levels and enforcement. A 
federal-provincial family law committee is examining that 
issue and will report this summer. We will respond immediately 
to its recommendations.
<P>
	In the months ahead, we will be releasing a paper that looks at 
what an aging society will need in terms of services and what 
changes are required to the public pension system to ensure that 
it is affordable. That paper will also look at the question of 
changes to the tax treatment currently in place for private saving 
for retirement.
<P>
	This will include the issue of pension plans and RRSPs and 
the use to which the funds invested are directed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Prime Minister will chair a National Forum on Health to 
foster a dialogue on the renewal of Canada's health system.
<P>
	The Minister of Health will work closely with her provincial 
colleagues. No further changes in respect fo EPF health 
transfers are contained in this budget, in order to set the stage for 
that discussion. Our commitment to maintain the principles of 
the Canada Health Act remains firm and unaltered.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government has announced its intention to renew and 
revitalize Canada's social security system within two years. A 
number of pilot projects will help pave the way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This budget provides $800 million so that innovative 
approaches can be tried in co-operation with the provinces and 
territories.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Good public policy requires predictability and planning. 
Beyond May of this year the previous government did not 
provide for any funding to assist those whose livelihood 
depended on the Atlantic groundfish industry.
<P>
	This budget provides a five-year program costing $1.7 billion 
in new funding and $200 million in reallocated funding for a 
total of $1.9 million for long-term adjustment. As part of that 
effort, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will with others 
develop innovative approaches for creating long-lasting jobs. 
The result of this effort will make an important contribution to 
the reform of the overall social security system in this country.
<P>
	Today as a government, as has already been indicated by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, we are advancing 
social security reform by taking specific actions relating to 
unemployment insurance and the federal transfers to the 
provinces that support social security.
<P>
	Earlier we announced a major rollback in unemployment 
insurance premium rates. This will require immediate steps to 
begin UI reform. These changes will reduce expenditures on UI 
by $725 million in 1994-95 and $2.4 billion per year thereafter. 
The maximum duration of UI claims will be reduced for new 
claimants with weak attachment to the labour force.
<P>
	The minimum entrance requirement will be increased from 10 
weeks to 12. The benefit rate will be reduced to 55 per cent 
except for individuals with modest incomes who support 
children, an aged parent or other dependants. For them the 
benefit rate will be increased to 60 per cent.
<P>
	Furthermore, to improve fairness there will be amendments to 
the provisions governing workers who quit their jobs voluntarily 
or who were fired for misconduct.
<P>
	Let it be clear. The focus of our changes to UI is unequivocal. 
Our goal is greater fairness, a system that reaches out to the most 
vulnerable in our society, one that is progressive and one that 
helps get Canadians back to work.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is essential that social security reform leads to programs 
that are more affordable and work better for  Canadians. To let 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1712"> 1712 </A></B>
<P>
us get on with the job of reform, all of us need to know what the 
limits on financial resources are.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For the federal government, transfers from the Canada 
assistance plan and the post-secondary education component of 
EPF must be no higher after reform than they are now. This will 
save the federal government at least $1.5 billion in 1996-97 
over and above the savings from UI reform.
<P>
	Our targets are firm. If reform fails to achieve at least these 
savings, then other measures will be taken to achieve them.
<P>
	We also intend to restore greater fairness in federal support 
for the whole transfer assistance system throughout Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want this reform process to be a co-operative one. We are 
providing a two-year period of predictability and modest 
growth in social security transfers to provinces while reform 
goes on. As promised by the Prime Minister, we will build 
towards a five-year period of stability in transfers.
<P>
	It is time to restor fiscal responsibility to the public finances 
of Canada. The debt and the deficit burden pose much more than 
an economic challenge. This is a moral issue too. What right do 
we have to steal opportunity away form our children, to demand 
that they solve problems that we are too timid to face?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Stronger growth will reduce the deficit. But growth alone will 
not bring it down enough. Direct budgetary action is required.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Following through on our platform, the government will be 
reducing the operating budgets of government departments by 
$400 million on 1994-95, increasing to $620 million per year in 
1995-96 and beyond. In addition we are looking at every 
government-appointed board, commission and agency. That 
review will focus on size, scope, composition and cost, 
including salaries paid to members. This review by the Minister 
responsible for Public Service Renewal will be completed in 
1994 and action will be taken immediately.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The solution to the fiscal challenge that is facing Canada must 
be shared by all of us. As part of our deficit reduction exercise 
we need to save an additional $1.5 billion from the operations of 
government over the next three years.
<P>
	We very much want to work with representatives of the public 
service in achieving these savings. Therefore, the President of 
the Treasury Board will immediately initiate discussions with 
the appropriate bargaining  agents of the public service. It is our 
sincere hope that these very difficult decisions can be taken 
collaboratively.
<P>
	It must be understood, however, that these savings are not a 
negotiating position; they are a bottom line fiscal requirement. 
To ensure that they are obtained the government is therefore 
announcing a two year legislative extension of the existing 
salary freeze and a two year suspension of pay increments 
within grade.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To the degree that those savings are secured through a review 
of government operations, leading to greater efficiency, the 
government will shorten or lift those freezes.
<P>
	Total savings in government operations during the next three 
years will exceed $3 billion, over and above savings previously 
planned.
<P>
	The Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal and the 
President of the Treasury Board will review all departmental 
spending to identify where greater savings are possible through 
the elimination or reduction of low priority programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During the election campaign we made clear the need to 
reduce defence spending. The Minister of National Defence has 
taken this mandate and has acted upon it decisively.
<P>
	In addition to cancelling the EH-101 helicopter program 
which was announced by the Prime Minister the day that we took 
office, defence spending will be cut by an additional $1.9 billion 
over the next three years. These savings, which include 
professional services, will be secured through major 
improvements in efficiency, productivity and cuts in defence 
infrastructure, including bases that have exceeded any probable 
defence need. A document attached to this budget provides 
greater detail.
<P>
	The results of these savings will be a more modern and 
effective armed forces. With the end of the cold war and the 
pressing demands being placed on the men and women of our 
armed forces in the new world order, the Minister of National 
Defence has ordered a review of our defence policy. The 
government will report on the results of that review this fall.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This government is committed to continuing our tradition of 
strong support for international development assistance. 
However, the fiscal challenge requires additional restraint in 
spending. Therefore, we will reduce spending on international 
development assistance by 2 per cent for 1994-95. Spending 
will be frozen at that level until 1996-97. International 
assistance spending will still amount to $2.6 billion annually.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This situation will be reviewed following the re-examination 
by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Together with reductions in tax breaks for business, this 
budget reduces subsidies to business in excess of the $225 
million target contained in the red book.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Fiscal reality requires that the government review its policy 
on funding interest groups. Our goal is to encourage greater 
reliance on funding from other sources. To provide a period of 
transition for these interest groups, notification will be provided 
in advance. The full effects of this review will be seen in the 
1995 budget.
<P>
	I now turn to the question of revenues and taxation. I must say 
to the Prime Minister that I have received a lot of advice in this 
area.
<P>
	The fundamental basis of a sound tax system is the reality and 
the perception that everybody pays their fair share. When an 
increasing minority avoid doing so, then the legitimacy of the 
tax system itself begins to suffer. We will be strengthening 
enforcement through special joint initiatives with the provinces 
and the business community to improve taxpayer compliance. 
As has been done in the past, specific measures will be 
announced by the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	One of the reasons for the growth of the underground 
economy is that Canadians believe that taxes are too high and we 
agree. We want Canadians to rejoin the legitimate economy, not 
leave it. Our objective is to get the deficit down so that in the 
years ahead taxes can be reduced. But we are not there yet.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is one reason why it is so essential to break the back of 
the deficit. The bulk of the effort involves significant cuts in 
government spending.
<P>
	But part of it must also involve looking at the tax system to 
ensure that all Canadians are paying their fair share. For that 
reason, we are acting today to eliminate a number of tax breaks 
that don't meet the standard of fairness that Canadians expect.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly, we are introducing today the following business 
tax measures:
<P>
	Large private corporations with capital of $15 million or more 
will no longer be entitled to the low small business tax rate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Deductions and credits for meal and entertainment expenses 
will be reduced from 80 to 50 per cent. This will bring federal 
treatment into line with that already in place in Ontario and 
Quebec, as well as in the United States.
<P>
	In addition, several regionally-based tax incentives have not 
proven cost effective. Therefore, they are being reduced or 
eliminated.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Certain Canadian corporations are not paying an appropriate 
level of tax. Accordingly, we are taking measures to prevent 
companies from using foreign affiliates to avoid paying 
Canadian taxes which are otherwise due. We are taking steps to 
ensure that the income of financial institutions is measured 
appropriately for tax purposes. We are taking other decisive 
measures to close loopholes in the current corporate tax system.
<P>
	To reduce the deficit in the fairest possible way we are 
announcing the following personal income tax measures:
<P>
	The $100,000 capital gains tax exemption is being abolished 
while allowing individuals to use their unused exemption for 
gains accrued up until today. The $500,000 exemption for small 
business shares and farm property will remain. The Minister of 
Agriculture wins again.
<P>
	We believe, however, that as circumstances permit, a general 
lowering of the capital gains tax rate for small business and 
farmers could provide a greater incentive to entrepreneurship. 
For that reason a special study of the taxation of capital gains as 
it applies to small business and farmers will be undertaken with 
their full participation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The age credit for persons 65 years and older will be income 
tested, as is the case for certain other benefits. This will not 
affect 75 per cent of seniors.
<P>
	The tax exemption for premiums related to the first $25,000 
of coverage under employer provided life insurance plans is 
being eliminated.
<P>
	Finally, many Canadians including members of this House, 
have expressed the view that the taxation of family trusts should 
be examined. This issue will be referred to the House of 
Commons finance committee for review, as requested by the 
Bloc Quebecois critic.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This budget is the result of the most open process of debate 
and consultation that has ever been attempted in Canada. People 
told us they want jobs. We have set the conditions for those jobs 
to be created.
<P>

<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	People told us we should freeze spending. With the spending 
cuts in this budget, program spending in 1996-97 should be 
lower than in any year since 1991.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	People have said: Reduce the deficit but do not do it with 
taxes. I repeat, in this budget for every dollar raised in revenues, 
$5 have been cut in spending. We have consulted and we have 
listened.
<P>
	Furthermore we are publishing a report today providing a 
response to the public consultations that have taken place and 
we will open the budget process up even more in the future. We 
believe that a free people will only support fundamental change 
if they feel part of the decision-making process that led to it.
<P>
	Next fall in a major departure from the past, the government 
will release a comprehensive statement that will clearly lay out 
changes in the economic and the fiscal outlook since this budget. 
The government's economic and fiscal goals and broad 
proposals and how they might be achieved in the next budget 
will be made public.
<P>
	Discussion papers on specific options for action will be 
released.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This new step in the budget process represents major 
progress. It will provide the basis for a serious, open, national 
dialogue between the government and Canadians.
<P>
	Following the publication of these new documents, I will 
meet with my provincial colleagues. That meeting will assist all 
governments in working towards common goals together, rather 
than at cross purposes and apart.
<P>
	The finance committee of this House will be asked to conduct 
public hearings involving Canadians to obtain their views on the 
direction for economic policy. The committee will report before 
the end of the year, in time for inclusion in next year's budget. 
As well, I will personally continue to openly consult with 
Canadians across the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to conclude this presentation by setting out 
the motivation that underlies this budget. The decisions outlined 
here are about much more than the bottom line. They are about 
facing fault lines and fixing them. The fault line that is caused 
when the poor become poorer while the rich become richer. The 
fault line that exists between this generation and the next. The 
fault line that exists in moving from the old economy toward the 
new. The fault line that is caused by the growing gap between 
one class of Canadians with modern skills and another group 
without. And finally, the fault line that exists when governments 
spend more than the country can afford.
<P>
	Fixing those fault lines is our challenge and fixing them is this 
government's commitment to Canadians. The path to renewal 
and to growth will not be easy. We cannot snap our fingers to 
erase the deficit, nor can we put in place a new framework for 
the Canadian economy, but neither can we delay with getting on 
with the job any longer.
<P>
	We are pursuing a balanced approach to fundamental reform, 
to create jobs, to continue to care for those who are in need and 
to get the deficit down. This requires a game plan, it requires 
fairness and it requires being forthright with Canadians.
<P>
	There will be those who will say we have not done enough and 
there will be those who will say that we have done too much. For 
those who would have us spend more, then Canadians deserve to 
know where the money would come from. For those who 
demand that we cut more, then Canadians deserve to be told the 
extent to which that would hurt growth, hurt jobs and hurt the 
less fortunate in our society.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	Tough times test our patience and our pocketbooks. They also 
test our values and our worth. Some believe that the success of 
Canada lies in leaving behind the values that have made us a 
great people. They would have us put aside sharing. They would 
have us put aside partnership. They would have us put aside the 
common sense and the compassion that define this country. Now 
is not the time to move away from our values. Now is the time to 
return to them.
<P>
	Despair has stalked this land too long. The time has come to 
bring back hope. We have not become what we are by sitting 
still. What has guided us as a country are the values we share and 
the vision we have chosen to pursue together. So it falls to us, 
this generation, in this House, in our time, to do what those who 
came before us did in theirs, and that is to assume our 
responsibilities to create opportunity today. And that in the end 
is the standard by which we will be judged by those who come 
after us.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not understand why is Liberal government is so pleased. I do 
not understand why the colleagues of the Minister of Finance are 
so pleased, because bringing down a budget that is practically 
meaningless is certainly nothing to be proud of. And there is 
certainly no reason to be proud of this year's deficit forecast of 
$39.7 billion, nearly $40 billion.
<P>
	Considering past experience, it would not be unusual, in the 
light of the quality of the forecasts produced by the Minister of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1715"> 1715 </A></B>
<P>
Finance and his department, for this deficit to go over $39.7 
billion. So there is nothing much to be proud to start with.
<P>
	If we look at the tax revenue estimates, it is clear the Minister 
of Finance is making the same mistakes as his predecessor. He is 
still living in the middle 1970s and early 1980s, when tax 
revenues were growing at the same rate as GDP.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	For instance, it is expected that every 1 per cent increase in 
GDP will result in an increase of more than 1 per cent of GDP, 
that is 1.2 per cent. The Conference Board of Canada has just 
released a study which says that every time there is a 1 per cent 
increase in GDP, tax revenues increase by only 0.5 per cent 
because of the growing impact of the underground economy. 
This is something the Department of Finance has completely 
blocked out, which tells me and my fellow members of the Bloc 
Quebecois that these estimates are off to a bad start.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I are also beginning to 
realize, what the Minister of Finance meant when he talked 
about broadening the tax base. The Minister of Finance and his 
government are broadening the tax base by slashing the incomes 
of the middle class. That is where he wants to broaden the tax 
base.
<P>
	A few examples: Over the next three years, by taxing 
employer contributions to various group life insurance plans, 
the Minister of Finance plans to get at least $520 million, one 
half billion out of middle income workers.
<P>
	Another instance is when he talks about reducing or 
altogether eliminating the age credit for retired taxpayers. The 
Minister of Finance is broadening the tax base at the expense of 
pensioners and, over the next three years, plans to get almost 
$500 million in the process. He says that 75 per cent of 
pensioners are not affected. But 25 per cent are affected. Do 
these people deserve this, after having worked all their lives?
<P>
	There is a third measure which shows the Minister of Finance 
and his government have no social conscience. Over the next 
three years, they want to get $740 million by reducing 
deductions for entertainment expenses, but according to a study 
released by Ernst and Young not long ago, about 80 per cent of 
the people that take advantage of this deduction are not rich 
taxpayers but middle income taxpayers, mostly self-employed, 
and even blue collar workers.
<P>
	I repeat, this government wants to get $740 million over the 
next three years, mostly out of the pockets of self-employed and 
blue collar workers, and that is a disgrace.
<P>
	These and many other measures are widening the already 
impressive gap between personal income tax paid by Canadians 
and Quebecers and taxes paid by Canadian corporations. Whe 
talk about corporations, we mean the big corporations.
<P>
	Did we know that individuals in Quebec and Canada are 
already paying seven times as much income tax as the big 
corporations? Did we know that 72.5 per cent of the federal tax 
base consists of revenues from private citizens and 27.5 per cent 
of revenues from corporations? Twenty-five years ago, it was 
already twice the tax revenue contributed by corporations. 
Today, the measures tabled by the Minister of Finance are 
further broadening this unfair gap between what is paid by 
private citizens and what is paid by corporations.
<P>
	With all the posturing on family trusts and tax shelters, why 
did the Minister of Finance fail to announce in his Budget that he 
was abolishing the disgraceful system of family trusts and the 
possibility for large corporations to shelter their money in tax 
havens like Barbados, for instance?
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	It is almost beyond comprehension that the Minister of 
Finance would immediately set out to attack middle-income 
earners through the imposition of specific measures over the 
next three years, while leaving unscathed wealthy taxpayers and 
large corporations that did not pay any taxes at all in the late 
1980s and that continue to rob the tax system today. This is 
really rich!
<P>
	The minister has not deviated from the path he initially 
embarked upon. Since October 26, his statements about 
restoring fiscal equity in Canada and in Quebec have been 
nothing but pious wishes. All he will commit to is consultation 
and more consultation. It has become his new mantra, almost as 
powerful as the one he adopted during the election campaign 
when he spoke of ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. The thing is, this budget 
contains no additional job creation measures. On the contrary, 
the government's tax grab over the next three years will hinder 
any chance for a lasting recovery and for job creation in Quebec 
and in Canada. This is unacceptable for a government that has 
been claiming from the beginning that it is concerned about job 
creation. I am completely baffled by this, as are my colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I would ask my colleagues opposite to show us 
a little respect, just as we show our respect for them every day.
<P>
	There is something even more shocking about this budget, and 
I will tell you what it is. With this budget, the Minister of 
Finance, who in reality controls human resources development 
in Canada, has just put a straightjacket on the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. He has accomplished this by 
committing him to save $7.5 billion through social program 
reform over the next three years. Various income security 
programs will be reformed and outrageous changes will be made 
to the unemployment insurance system, changes which he 
criticized the pre-
<P>

<B><A NAME="1716"> 1716 </A></B>
<P>
vious government for making. In other words, he is saying right 
from the start to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, even before the committee undertakes its work, 
that savings of $7.5  billion will have to be realized over the next 
three years. Is that what the government calls restoring fiscal 
equity?
<P>
	Is this what the government calls restoring social justice in 
Canada? In point of fact, it is attacking those who are most in 
need, namely the least fortunate, those who are, in large part, 
victims of the previous government and who are being further 
victimized by the current government.
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc Quebecois and Leader of the Official 
Opposition was right. When the government party speaks about 
reforming social programs and health care programs, what it is 
really talking about is making cuts. Today, we have irrefutable 
proof of this.
<P>
	Middle income taxpayers and senior citizens certainly 
deserved a tax break, but the Minister of Finance is not giving 
them one with this budget. What about those who are 
unemployed and the most disadvantaged? A total of 1.5 million 
Canadians are out of work. The 437,000 Quebecers who are out 
of work were expecting genuine job creation initiatives in this 
budget, not merely stopgap measures such as the infrastructure 
program which will create 45,000 part-time jobs. They were 
hoping for real job creation initiatives.
<P>
	This budget gives us no reason at all to hope. Aside from the 
nice speeches and nice smiles from the Minister of Finance and 
his colleagues, there is nothing in this budget to help the 1.2 
million Canadians who are currently waiting for social housing 
and who spend more than 50 per cent of their income on housing. 
Nice speeches are all well and good, but when the time came to 
restore $600 million in funding for social housing, an issue over 
which they tore a strip off the previous government, their nice 
words did not translate into concrete action. All we are left with 
are nice smiles and nice speeches about social justice in Canada. 
That is what Quebecers and Canadians hate in politicians. That 
is why Quebecers and Canadians are cynical towards politicians 
and political institutions. It is because of a lack of courage, a 
lack of long-term vision that Quebecers and Canadians are 
feeling alienated from politicians' promises.
<P>
	Not only does this budget not include anything that the 
government should have done, but its spending reduction targets 
are ridiculous. In the next three years, there will be no spending 
cuts in nominal terms.
<P>
	I have the feeling that this government is living on another 
planet, that it is not aware of Canada's excessive debt, which 
puts it in first place about everywhere in terms of poor 
performance. I get the impression that this poor performance 
and this government are two totally disembodied things.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance said that we would blame them for 
not going far enough. We will not blame him for not going far 
enough, but we will blame him for not doing what he should 
have done, and that is even more serious.
<P>
	We will blame him for sparing, once again, the government's 
rich friends. But Quebecers and Canadians are starting to grasp 
this government's vision.
<P>
	I therefore move:
<P>
