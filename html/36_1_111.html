<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have the pleasure to introduce a motion.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK15">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the bill, an act to change the name of certain electoral 
districts, on notice in the name of the member for Ottawa 
West—Nepean, and the bill, an act to amend the Canada Elections 
Act, on notice in the name of the member for Gander—Grand Falls, 
be now deemed to have been read a first time, ordered to have 
been printed, read a second time, referred to a committee of the 
whole and reported to the House without amendment, concurred in 
at the report stage and read the third time and passed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to provide for the assurance of the members 
involved the information that the act standing in my name has 
been amended editorially to reflect the incorrections identified 
by the member for Charlotte, the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, the member for Kent—Essex, the 
member for Bruce—Grey and the member for 
Charleswood—Assiniboine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. deputy government whip 
have the unanimous consent of the House to propose this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Perhaps for the benefit of the House 
the member might explain briefly the purpose of the bills, since 
we are not hearing that on first reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the first bill standing in the name of the member for 
Ottawa West—Nepean amends the names of certain ridings at the 
request of the members of parliament. In general it is to reflect 
more accurately certain community factors in terms of how the 
communities wish to be identified by name.  That bill deals with 
changes to the names of 19 federal electoral districts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second bill standing in the name of the member for 
Gander—Grand Falls amends the Canada Elections Act to allow the 
Chief Electoral Officer to administratively handle certain minor 
changes to candidates' expense returns that now need to be 
handled through the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill relates specifically to the fact that under the current 
provisions of the legislation, if a bill arrives in the hands of 
a member or a candidate following the election, if it was not 
received within the required time period in which a candidate or 
his or her official agent may pay the bill, the only process 
available now to the member to be able to pay that bill is to get 
a court order allowing that to happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly a cumbersome process currently affecting 172 
members of parliament, the majority of the House of Commons, 
simply because somebody failed to send in a bill to their 
campaign in the required time period.  It seems appropriate to 
allow the chief electoral officer to judge that this is an 
administrative problem that can be corrected with his approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for the 
explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to the motion just presented by the deputy 
House leader, we are wondering whether the 19 new electoral names 
will be read in this House for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I can answer the question.  The bills 
are not normally read.  First reading of the bill is announced 
and we have dispensed with all of that.  But even if that were 
the case, the provisions of the bill are not normally read out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are copies of the bill available at the table and the hon. 
member certainly can avail himself of the opportunity to browse 
through the draft bill which has now been adopted by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand that it has 
been adopted by the House, but I am wondering if I am now the 
hon. member for Thunder Bay—Superior North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member knows that 
bills require adoption in the other place and royal assent before 
they become law, so I am afraid the hon. member is stuck with 
Thunder Bay—Nipigon for the time being.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-29 
at report stage and to present, in a group, Motions Nos. 1, 3 
and 5 appearing in today's notice paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1.1) When implementing policies of the Government of Canada, 
the Agency's priority shall be the conservation and the 
ecological, historic and cultural integrity of national parks, 
national historic sites and other protected heritage areas, and 
it shall reconcile this priority with the development of tourism 
and commercial activities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several witnesses brought to our attention the fact that there 
could perhaps be a risk to parks if particular attention was not 
paid to the first part of this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, we are not opposed to there being a reasonable level 
of tourism and commercial activities within parks. However, we 
would not want to see a wish to realize large profits or make 
parks and historic sites cost effective result in so many people 
being admitted to parks and so many activities taking place that 
ecological integrity was compromised.  It was this point in 
particular that people raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither, of course, should the historic and cultural aspect be 
allowed to suffer and tourism and commercial activities given 
the upper hand solely out of a desire to make parks 
cost effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 addresses a very technical issue, suggesting that 
line 1 on page 7 be replaced with the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>9.(1) Notwithstanding section 9 of the Depart- 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then suggest that the following be added after line 8 on page 
7: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) When the Agency procures goods and services, it shall comply 
with guidelines or rules established by Treasury Board on calls 
for tender. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was another concern of several witnesses who appeared 
before the committee or contacted it. 
Given that Parks Canada will become separate from the Department 
of Canadian Heritage and its management autonomous, we fear that 
the agency will use the reorganization of personnel and the 
powers delegated to the chief executive officer to subcontract 
many activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make sure that, throughout Canada, Treasury Board 
rules are scrupulously followed, especially in calls for tender. 
Of course, under Treasury Board rules, certain minimum amounts 
do not require public calls for tender.  When we talk about 
abiding by Treasury Board rules, that is implicit.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards calls for tenders, we want to be sure that, even if a 
park is located in a sparsely populated area, which is the case 
of many of our parks, the rules of Treasury Board will be 
followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a number of the witnesses we heard during committee 
hearings, it appears important to add the amendment set out in 
Motion No. 5.  In a way, I am delighted to see that even the 
government is proposing an amendment, in Motion No. 2, which is 
quite similar to what I am proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we vote, if I have properly understood the Speaker's 
ruling, if Motion No. 2 is carried, my Motion No. 5 will 
automatically be lost. 
Members will understand that we will support Motion No. 2, 
because the minor difference with it concerns the time limit for 
the response.  The difference can be fairly significant, but 
sometimes a response can be a while coming.  We would have 
preferred a response within 90 days.  The minister proposes 180 
days for the response.  Maybe we thought he could respond 
faster, but it is better to allow the time than to have no 
response at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the problem raised by the forum or the consultations held 
were a matter of urgency, perhaps we should consider counting on 
the fact that the minister would recognize this and realize that 
a more urgent response is required.  We hope the time limit he 
sets will not be considered a minimum and that the 180 days will 
be considered the maximum. I think this is important. In any 
case, there has to be a response. 
This was what those who testified before us requested. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will attempt to 
address all five motions and deal with the various arguments put 
forward by my hon. colleague. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin with the first motion that was just proposed. We oppose 
this amendment, because we feel it is redundant. The proposed 
amendment reflects what is already contained in paragraph (1) 
and the new paragraph (m) in the preamble. More to the point, 
the intent behind the proposed amendment is already captured in 
clause 6.(1), which states, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>6.(1) The Agency is responsible for the implementation of 
policies of the Government of Canada that relate to national 
parks, national historic sites and other protected heritage 
areas and heritage protection programs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large, such policies are already addressed in Parks 
Canada's <I>Guiding Principles and Operational Policies</I>, a document 
that was tabled in Parliament and approved in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document addresses Parks Canada's key responsibilities in 
terms of respecting ecological and commemorative—not 
cultural—integrity, and how these are addressed at the park and site 
level in concert with accommodating visitor use, tourism and 
park development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also oppose Motion No. 3 because we find it redundant as 
well. The Parks Canada Agency is defined as a departmental 
corporation under the Financial Administration Act. As such, it 
must comply with Treasury Board's contracting policies and with 
the Government Contracts Regulations. Contracting limits and 
procedures are clearly set out in these regulations.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to be noted that clause 9 merely allows the agency to 
procure, with the approval of the Treasury Board and the 
governor in council, goods and services from organizations other 
than the government's common service organizations, such as 
PWGSC, when this is beneficial from an economic point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the agency's contracting activities, whether with common 
service organizations or with other bodies, will still be 
subject to the government contract regulations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second motion, we are proposing that Bill C-29 be 
amended to reflect better the concerns of various people who 
appeared as witnesses before us, that every two years the 
minister will convoke a round table of persons interested in 
matters for which the agency is responsible to advise the 
minister on the performance by the agency of its responsibilities 
under section 6 and that the minister must respond within 180 
days to the comments made by the round table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section replaces former subsection 12(4).  The change 
really means in ordinary language that this is no longer a forum 
convened by the chief executive officer of the new Parks Canada 
agency but by the minister.  It provides certainty that a round 
table will occur at least every two years.  It also says that the 
recommendations will be responded to in a timely fashion.  We 
chose 180 days because that is to be found in other responses to 
environmental proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That takes me to Motion No. 4 in which we are proposing: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-29, clause 12, be amended by replacing lines 37 to 43 
on page 7 and line 1 on page 8 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(4)  The Chief Executive Officer may dele-” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simply designed to delete subsection 12(4) in favour of 
the new clause which I just discussed in terms of convening round 
tables at least once every two years.  That simply makes it 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 is consistent with the two motions to which I have 
just spoken.  As I mentioned earlier it means that there is a 
report back within 180 days which is consistent with the way we 
do things, for example, under the environment assessment act.  I 
think that covers the group.

am used to.  I find it quite interesting so please bear with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support Motion No. 1 put forth by my hon. colleague from 
Rimouski—Mitis.  It is very important that we not just 
concentrate on the economic benefits that a national park brings 
but also on the ecological and environmental issues that are part 
of the whole system.  For this reason I support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 2 regarding consultation, many witnesses who came 
before the committee were adamant about the fact that it is 
important for consultations to take place.  Consultation is only 
one aspect of it.  Consultation and not taking action or 
recognizing that consultations took place amount to nothing other 
than grandstanding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 put forth by my hon. colleague for Rimouski—Mitis 
goes hand in hand with Motion No. 2.  If we have a round table 
and people have the chance to put their views forth, by having to 
report within 90 days will more or less put on public record that 
the discussions took place.  It will have a positive impact on 
the government taking some of those recommendations to heart. 
Therefore I support this motion as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to Motion No. 1, this motion is unnecessary because 
the priorities already set in the preamble of the bill can be 
found in subclauses (f) to (m). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 2 and 4 have been grouped together.  I stand in 
opposition to those motions because as currently written in the 
bill consultations would be undertaken by the agency and so it 
should be.  Changing that to consultations being undertaken by 
the minister will consolidate power further in the hands of 
cabinet.  That is not wise.  The direction the bill was taking in 
the first place was correct so the intent of Motions Nos. 2 and 4 
is wrong.  I oppose the motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remaining motion in Group No. 1 is Motion No. 3.  That 
motion is unnecessary because goods and services procured by the 
agency would already be on the recommendation of Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the intent of Motion No. 5.  The idea of trying to 
promote openness and transparency with respect to public 
consultations by the agency is a good one.  There is no existing 
requirement in the bill to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the House will have the wisdom to oppose Motions Nos. 
2 and 4 so that we may vote in favour of Motion No. 5.  Thereby 
public consultations will be done by the agency as they should be 
in an open and transparent fashion for the public.

</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-29, in 
Clause 23, be amended by adding after line 30 on page 13 the 
following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(3) When setting a fee under subsection (2), the Minister

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discussed at length, in committee, pointing out that we think 
it extremely important that local residents be allowed access to 
parks and historic sites for a reasonable fee.  We would 
therefore like the following added as a third paragraph: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) When setting a fee under subsection (2), the Minister shall 
ensure that local residents enjoy a preferential fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) The Governor in Council may, by regulation, define the 
expression “local residents”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of us are really very concerned.  The government, of 
course, does not share our concern, but we are extremely worried 
that the government will add all sorts of hidden taxes and adopt 
a business mentality toward parks and historic sites, 
eventually wanting the agency to be self-funding.  That way, it 
will receive more money for interfering in provincial 
jurisdictions, the way it has been doing so far with its budget 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want local residents to be taken into consideration, and to 
have access to their immediate environment.  They used to get in 
for free.  Since Parks Canada has invaded our environment, we 
are obliged to pay ever greater amounts to enjoy the beauty of 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want consideration to be given to a preferential fee for 
local residents, so that the price they are charged for 
admission to our parks and historic sites is always kept to a 
minimum. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are against this 
amendment. We are, of course, in favour of involving local 
communities as users of the parks and sites of great value to 
Parks Canada. We certainly have nothing against local 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Parks Canada already offers incentives such as annual 
passes and early bird specials at many parks and sites. Such 
incentives usually benefit local people the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach reflects the intent of the proposed change without 
legalizing a discriminatory clause that would treat one group of 
Canadians differently from another. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to speak today on these motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated on several occasions already, I am not a 
stranger to the parks issue. My first job was with Parks Canada. 
I was also working for Parks Canada in 1997 and had to quit 
after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in a good position to talk about entrance fees. My job at 
the Kouchibouguac National Park was at the park entrance. I was 
the person who collected the fees from both tourists and locals 
who came to visit the park. These people used to live in the 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look back at what was said to park residents who 
were expropriated to convince them to leave. We know it was not 
the money. 
My father was offered $6,600 to leave his 50 or so acres of land 
in Kouchibouguac park. Money clearly was not what would make 
people leave. We were told that it would create jobs, well paid 
jobs, protect this beautiful wilderness, this great land on 
which we lived, to ensure it would still be there hundreds of 
years from now for future generations to enjoy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are children today whose parents were expropriated from 
national parks across this country, including Kouchibouguac, 
from which I was expropriated.  Those children have no chance to 
go to the beautiful beaches they were promised in 1969, nor to 
visit the historic sites, or to use the hiking and biking paths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it costs a fortune to get into a park.  One must wonder 
for whom the parks were created.  The reason to have a park is 
to preserve and conserve nature.  It must be realized also, 
however, that many national parks have been created in areas of 
very high unemployment. 
People were promised good jobs, and now we see the work being 
contracted out and people being paid less so they are forced to 
leave and give up their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these people come to visit the parks, moreover, they have 
to turn around and go home.  I have seen people doing just that 
when I worked at the entrance.  Sometimes I paid their entrance 
fees out of my own pocket because I saw that there were little 
kids who were not going to be able to use the beach because 
their parents did not have enough money.  I am not making this 
up—that is what I saw between 1981 and 1996, and the fees keep 
going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say as well that our parks are not as well maintained as 
they used to be, because the desire seems to be to make parks 
into industries, to make them revenue generated.  Conservation 
is no longer the priority, making money is, because the 
government is cutting the funding allocated to the parks. 
Nature and conservation are therefore suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must step back and look at what is going on. Having an agency 
is not a bad idea, but what lies behind the idea of an agency is 
dangerous. Why are jobs guaranteed for only two years?  The work 
has to be done, whether it is an agency or a department that is 
in charge.  There is no reason to make our employees feel 
insecure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work has to be done. The park entry fees must not be raised 
any further and thought should be given to special fees for 
local residents.  People expropriated to make room for the parks 
can no longer afford to go there.  Others who were not 
expropriated when the park was created still live in the 
community and they have the same problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is all very well, it helps the economy, and I cannot 
dispute that.  Hundreds of thousands of people come to visit our 
parks. 
This helps the economy and we want it to continue, but we must 
also look at the reality. Who has access to parks these days? As 
with just about any other government policy, the wealthy are the 
ones who continue to have access to services, whether we are 
talking about health care, education or national parks. For 
those who have money, things are just fine. Everything is there 
for them. But for people who have less money, it is harder to 
have access to health care, education, services for the elderly 
and parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I definitely support a motion that would look at the real 
situation in the villages located close to national parks. It is 
important that local people have access to the parks, and one of 
the agency's priorities should be to be fair to those who live 
close to the parks and those who lost their land to these parks. 
We must give back to these people the access that they enjoyed 
before. 
The problem is one of lost access. We must give to the 
communities that live close to national parks the access they 
used to enjoy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is ironic that my riding name changed in 1997 because 
of changes to the electoral boundaries act.  Now that you and 
your colleagues are getting used to this name we just passed a 
bill today that will change it again.  We always like to keep a 
challenge for the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a real challenge before us today with this bill, 
with this motion and with the process through which this place 
works.  I believe there is some merit in this motion. I have some 
degree of sympathy for those neighbouring communities.  It could 
be argued that we should support it or that we should not because 
it is not clear enough and that it should have been better 
clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real irony and the real shame of this House is that the 
government has already stood up to say that it does not support 
this motion.  This is the way this place works.  The government 
makes that decree through one government member who represents 
the appropriate ministry.  Then all the rest of the sheep have to 
vote the same way. We have already seen this.  That is one of the 
ironies of debate in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can stand up and pontificate on the need to do good things 
for the citizens of this country but if the government has 
already made up its mind not to do anything good for the people 
then that is the way it will be.  That is really unfortunate.  It 
is unfortunate that we cannot discuss things openly and 
meaningfully where the government can listen and say that it does 
not support something because it truly does not make sense or 
that it does make sense and it should look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British parliamentary system on which our system is based 
has done away with the confidence convention.  We often see 
members from various parties voting across party lines because 
they truly want to support what is good for their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the specific amendment, until the riding name 
changed in 1997, part of my riding bordered one of our national 
parks.  If you live in the middle a province that does not have a 
national park within hundreds of miles of your place, then you 
come and go and that is part of your normal routine life.  If you 
live on the edge of a park, you are sometimes forced by your 
proximity to it to go frequently through that park.  It penalizes 
those people for the government to make them pay for freedom of 
movement because of their proximity to a national park and 
because they will have all kinds of tourists driving by their 
doorsteps which sometimes has economic benefits and sometimes has 
drawbacks, in particular in terms of highway traffic and 
congestion.  That is unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members were on the right track when they started 
talking about this issue.  They should have done a little more 
work on it although there may not have been sufficient time to do 
that.  There should have been more work that said these are the 
specific fees we are talking about, maybe they should pay for the 
use of a facility inside the park because they are getting the 
same benefit as people from elsewhere.  But in terms of access 
into and through, there should definitely be a preferential low 
rate for those people who are forced by nature of their proximity 
to pay these high fees. It is unfortunate that the Bloc has not 
defined in its motion what a local person is or what the ratio of 
fee should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know the government is going to defeat the motion, so 
it does not matter how good of an argument we make.  I believe 
there is some desire on the government side to be fair, so in the 
interest of fairness I hope government members listen to the 
arguments of the Bloc, to mine and those of others who speak to 
this motion, or of those who speak about the motion since I am 
not necessarily supporting it the way it is written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope they recognize the need to be fair to those people who 
are forced, not who choose, to make frequent access to the park 
by nature of their proximity to it.  I hope they try to recognize 
that something should be done.  They are going to defeat the 
motion, fine, but they should recognize that something needs to 
be done. I hope they will take that into account and that they 
will try to find a way to ensure fairness is brought to those 
local residents.

like to speak on Motion No. 6 put forth by my hon. colleague from 
Rimouski—Mitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National parks when established in a specific area might not 
take away but might prevent people who used the facilities 
without cost from going there. I think it is only fair that these 
people have access to the place.  The reason I say this is these 
people are good ambassadors for the park because they will tell 
other people what is available because they have lived there all 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have already stated they would vote against 
this motion. I think they should look at different options to 
help make it fair for those individuals who live in those areas, 
who benefited from those areas in the past and can still benefit 
without having undue cost put on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this motion but I would like to see included a 
definition as to who are local residents and what are the costs 
local residents will incur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking government members, even though they have indicated 
they would vote against it, to consider something of this nature, 
clarify it and put it into effect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Motion No. 6 which would do a couple of 
things which I do not think are positive development in whatever 
parks agency we may end up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of the idea of using preferential fees for local 
residents especially when the term local residents is not 
defined.  It is my belief that the national parks system is for 
the benefit of all Canadians and it does several things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It preserves ecologically diverse areas of the country, perhaps 
not always in pristine wilderness but at least it does preserve 
that area for future generations for all time. If there is human 
activity in the parks, and inevitably there will be more and more 
of that, at least the area has been identified and set aside for 
this and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although our national parks are a treasure for the world they 
are also a treasure for Canadians.  I do not believe we want to 
start differentiating between local residents and distant 
residents since I think all Canadians in a national institution 
like a park should be treated equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we are talking about something like transit fees through 
a park to get to a work site or something that is a very unique 
situation, fees associated with the parks system should be the 
same for all comers when they have a Canadian licence plate on 
their car and they are driving in.  That is good enough for me. I 
think we want to be very careful when we start differentiating 
fees in one area from another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think to have a fee structure based on local versus distant, 
administratively this could be very difficult for the people 
employed within the parks system.  To decide who is local and how 
local is local would be very difficult. It may be true that all 
politics is local, as the saying goes, but certainly for 
administration of a park we want to have all Canadians treated 
equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of national parks are located in western 
Canada and one of the tremendous legacies of the west has been 
the ability to establish these parks in different areas.

what these definitions were about local residents. I encourage 
others in the House to think twice before they pick differing fee

think that is an unwise motion and I would vote against it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I assure you that my hon. colleague is quite correct. We 
did arrange for me to speak first because I have to be in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly support Motion No. 7.  I want to take some time to 
explain to this House why.  In the first place it should be known 
that this motion came about after the committee was warned not to 
deal with this motion, clause 36.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the government side of the House in committee were 
warned by the justice minister and her officials.  However, it was 
put into the bill anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explain the situation as it relates to Saskatchewan's 
newest national park, Grasslands National Park. It is situated 
entirely within the constituency of my colleague, the hon. member 
for Cyprus Hills—Grasslands.  However, it is only about 30 miles 
outside of my constituency and I know the area well.  My daughter 
and her family ranch right up against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion relates to subcontracting and the use of the 
Official Languages Act.  I have often gone through state and 
national parks in the United States.  When we get to the lower 
part of the United States, into Arizona, into Texas, there is no 
mandatory use of language.  Wherever the second language is 
needed it is there.  If we go to the post office and the second 
language is needed, it is there.  If we go to the tendering 
process and the second language is needed, it is there.  There is 
no gouging, there is no arbitrary decisions to irritate people in 
that country over language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, at the western end of Grasslands National Park let 
us say we were going to tender and four sections of that park 
were to be fenced out with limited grazing for that period of 
time.  With the drought situation in that area right now, that 
may well become a factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To even tender in that part of Saskatchewan under the guise of 
the Official Languages Act, all that would do is irritate 
everybody within that whole area of Saskatchewan.  First we would 
not get a contractor to come that distance who would qualify 
under this motion.  We would eliminate all those people there who 
have all of the equipment, the post pounders, the wire stretchers 
and everything else. They would be eliminated because this has 
been injected into this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government is doing by putting this in the bill is 
taking a peaceful group of farmers and ranchers and gouging them 
a little deeper and then maybe saying the rednecks show up a 
little more.  Why do we do this?  It is absolute nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where it is necessary, let us follow the example.  No one on 
this side of the House, no one in the Reform Party, objects to 
the application of the Official Languages Act. But when it gets 
to an area which would eliminate the local population totally, 
all the government is doing is putting more fuel on the fire and 
it is not calming anything in Saskatchewan or in areas where the 
one language dominates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this park, and I am using it as an example again, there are 
certain roads that have to be built. 
Not many roads are being built anywhere in Saskatchewan right 
now.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine putting out a tender for a contractor to build so many 
kilometres of roads in that park but the contractor must have and 
make use of the stipulations under the Official Languages Act. 
They would not even get a contractor. Nobody would even apply 
because there are none there. What would they do?  I suppose they 
would import one.  I do not know where they would come from but 
in order to live up to this clause in the bill they might have to 
import a contractor from outside the province altogether. Why? 
This is why I strongly support my colleague's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government itself knows this is wrong.  Where it is 
necessary, use it.  Please do not let this motion die. Please 
support this for the sake of our national consciousness and for 
the sake of local people. I think there is enough common sense on 
both sides of the House to indeed support this motion.  I 
certainly look forward to supporting it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, why 
am I not surprised by my Reform colleague's opposition?  If my 
colleague is irritated by the requirement to provide services in 
both official languages, I hope he is not looking to me for an 
apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's opposition to the basic principles underlying 
the Official Languages Act is nothing new.  In the rather 
simplistic view of things we have all seen outlined in their 
program—and I am summarizing it, of course—Quebec would be 
entirely francophone and the rest of Canada totally anglophone. 
That would fix everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but this is not the way this country was built. 
There are one million francophones outside Quebec, and 
anglophones make up 15% of Quebec's population.  And they are 
just as Canadian as the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think talking about limiting the use of French in services 
provided by the Government of Canada or its representatives is 
entirely normal.  Clause 36.1 or Motion No. 8, which we are 
proposing, is an amendment intended to reaffirm the spirit and 
the letter of the Official Languages Act.  I think that 
questioning this is fanning the flames.

Speaker, I have to say for once I am on the same side as the 
government.  I was part of that debate when the amendment was put 
forward regarding the parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this really gives another opportunity to the 
Reform Party members to try to gain some political points. What 
they are coming out with and what that amendment is, is really 
not what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also sit on the official languages committee.  We had the 
official languages commissioner before us this week. We checked 
with him what we had passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it is really is where there is bilingual status for 
workers, if God forbid there was contracting out, it would stay 
the same. It is the same thing in an anglophone region where the 
jobs are anglophone.  Again God forbid if the government 
contracted out, it would stay anglophone.  It would stay 
francophone if it was a position in Quebec.  It is not changing 
that. It is making sure that the anglophone regions will keep 
their anglophone jobs.  That is what it means.  It means the same 
thing for the francophone and bilingual positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Reform Party members have decided to have 
another field day like they did with the flag.  They are trying 
to gain points with it. 
It is unfortunate that Reformers do that but they do.  Today it 
is on language.  I wish they would put as much effort into the 
unity of this country as they do in trying to divide it which is 
what they do on a daily basis.

committee did not pass anything that will complicate the lives 
of anglophones or francophones.  We simply made sure that the 
official language legislation would continue to apply.  That is 
all we did.  We can come up with other things if we like, but I 
personally have better things to do than to try to compound the 
country's problems.  We have enough problems already, we do not 
want to add to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
obviously, the Bloc Quebecois will not support Motion No. 7 
before us. This motion calls for the deletion of clause 36.1, 
which we discussed in committee, having examined the bill clause 
by clause, and which was added by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, we asked questions of the Department of Justice 
lawyer and departmental officials who came to explain the bill 
to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But some committee members disagreed with departmental 
officials, who claim that it is not required in the bill, 
because the law automatically applies, apparently.  If the 
Official Languages Act automatically applies, it does not cost a 
lot to include it in the bill.  Nothing is compromised by doing 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said that we thought it was very simple; clause 36.1, which 
had been added, stipulates that the Official Languages Act 
applies to the Agency and to its subcontractors. There was the 
situation with Air Canada, which claims that Air Alliance is not 
subject to the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Complaints were filed with the official languages commissioner 
on several occasions, not always politely, because the Official 
Languages Act was not applied in this very parliament. There was 
the example of the construction site workers. We even received a 
unilingual English document from the Department of Human 
Resources Development concerning members' insurance 
benefits—fortunately, the error was quickly corrected yesterday, 
and we were sent a letter in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was pointed out, for instance, that all the proceedings in 
Nagano were in English. 
Not that long ago, when we had the Commonwealth ceremonies in 
the Speaker's chambers, the whole thing was conducted in English 
only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since we got here, we have not stopped fighting to ensure 
that the Official Languages Act is complied with. A few years 
ago, I visited some parks in the maritime provinces during the 
month of July. Wherever I went, I was told “Mrs. Tremblay, 
unfortunately the last francophone who came before you took the 
last French document that we had”. I was told the same thing 
everywhere I went. It was probably thought that 10 French copies 
or so would do. I never even saw one. I do not even know whether 
they exist. I believed what I was told, and I concluded that so 
many francophones were visiting the maritimes and Newfoundland 
that they ran out of French leaflets. 
Quebeckers cannot be accused of not being open, since they visit 
our national parks in such large numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that, after consulting officials, probably from the 
Department of Justice, a compromise was reached and Motion No. 8 
was proposed. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>36.1 For greater certainty, the Official Languages Act applies 
to the Agency and the Agency has the duty, under section 25 of 
that Act, to ensure that, where services are provided or made 
available by another person or organization on its behalf, any 
member of the public in Canada or elsewhere can communicate with 
and obtain those services from that person or organization in 
either official language, in any case where those services, if 
provided by the Agency, would be required under Part IV of the 
Official Languages Act to be provided in either official 
language.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8, which seeks to replace clause 36.1 of the bill, is 
simply a reminder of what the Official Languages Act provides. 
With things being so clear, the agency can never claim not to 
know that it is subject to the Official Languages Act. This is 
merely a precaution. Like a double lock on the door of a hotel 
room, this motion provides added protection. We know that the 
Official Languages Act protects our rights, but we want to make 
sure the agency will never forget it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that, since the Reform Party expressed 
two different opinions on the previous motion, I would like to 
see at least one of its members tell us that francophones have a 
right to exist in this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, these are the simple facts of the matter.  When this 
came before committee, the Minister of Justice of the governing 
party sent a four and a half page letter to the committee telling 
them in no uncertain terms to not insert the clause which would 
subject the Official Languages Act to contractors and 
subcontractors in national parks.  There were four and a half 
pages explaining the reasons why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote a few parts of that letter.  “Wording of this 
amendment goes beyond the current application of the Official 
Languages Act.” If any member has stood up here and said that it 
does not do this or that, it does.  There is absolutely no 
question about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to say that because all parts of the Official 
Languages Act would apply to contractors and subcontractors of 
the agency as if they were federal institutions, this would have 
the effect of creating linguistic obligations for the contractors 
and subcontractors of the parks agency that do not currently 
exist under the Official Languages Act for contractors and 
subcontractors of other federal institutions.  How much more 
plain and simple can it be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was only an excerpt from one part of her letter, but the 
most significant part of the letter from the Minister of Justice 
to her own members of that committee appeared in the fourth last 
paragraph.  She makes about five points there. I will summarize 
the effect of what she is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, non-governmental organizations or private business 
and holders of commercial leases would no longer be exempt from 
section 25 of the Official Languages Act.  This means that 
someone holding a commercial lease or engaging in a private 
business that previously did not have to be subject to those 
obligations now would be.  It means that all workers must be 
fluently bilingual, not just the ones responsible for supplying 
services directly to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point was made in committee that why would painters and 
garbage collectors or other people who have no engagement with 
the public whatsoever have to comply with those requirements of 
being fluently bilingual?  It does not make any sense.  In fact, 
officials from the justice department were at the committee, 
telling the committee in no uncertain terms do not insert this 
clause because of the effects it will have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, contractors and subcontractors who would be under the 
application of the Official Languages Act that previously did not 
apply but now would, would not only have to have bilingual 
employees but that 50% of them would have to be French speaking, 
in other words French as their first language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to that, they would have to undertake a commitment to 
the promotion of both official languages.  I am not sure exactly 
what that would entail, but requiring fence painters to have a 
commitment to the promotion of both official languages in the 
conduct of their job which is painting the fence does not make 
any sense whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, non-compliance with these new requirements would be 
subject to court sanctions and orders of enforcement.  In other 
words, if someone did obtain a contract to paint a fence agreeing 
they would do all these things and then in some fashion did not 
uphold that, they would be subject to court intervention. 
Absolute stupidity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the recommendations of the justice minister to her own 
committee, in its infinite wisdom the committee put it in anyway. 
Now we expose it and we explain why this is a bad idea, why it 
goes far beyond the intention of the Official Languages Act and 
why it would cause a lot of problems in national parks across our 
country.  There is no arguing that and there is no denying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most sensible thing is to simply delete the clause because, 
as was previously stated by the justice minister—and the lawyers 
from the justice department who were in committee knew this—it 
should be common sense to anyone that the Official Languages Act 
already applies to that federal institution.  Subjecting 
contractors and subcontractors to it does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee members who voted in favour of it knew exactly 
what they were doing.  They wanted to subject people to the 
Official Languages Act who were not previously subject to it. 
Clearly the hammer from the justice minister came down.  She said 
that we were not going to go through with this.  Not only was it 
unwise based on common sense, but obviously there would be a lot 
of political repercussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did they do?  Instead of simply deleting the clause, which 
is my amendment and makes perfect sense because now the Official 
Languages Act would apply anyway, as it always would have, there 
is no problem, they put in this wordy amendment that begins by 
saying “For greater certainty” and then it just repeats what 
the Official Languages Act says anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need to say “Although the Official Languages Act 
applies”, it applies.  It is called trite law.  It is poor legal 
draftsmanship.  That is what we are getting from the Liberal 
government.  That is the type of leadership we are getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to have a bill with absolutely useless wording in 
it.  The Liberals are doing it because they are in a jam.  They 
want to save face for the hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier, who 
inserted the clause against the advice of all the justice 
officials and his own justice minister, and they want to save 
face for themselves, so they implemented this clause.  Rather 
than pass a poorly drafted bill, they should have just admitted 
their mistake.  But no, they are going to insert this wordy 
clause that means nothing and is, as I have said, trite law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain for the Liberal members what that really means. 
It means that if you do not have to say it, do not say it.  We do 
not have to be excessively redundant.  The Official Languages Act 
already applies.  Why write it in?  They are writing it in 
because they are trying to save face because their committee 
members made a mistake.  It is just political wrangling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve better than that.  If members opposite are 
going to form the governing party they should be at least 
obligated to draft legislation that is consistent with the laws 
and rules that apply to drafting legislation.  They cannot even 
accept that.  Instead, damage control tops their list and we are 
going to end up with a piece of legislation that is very poorly 
drafted.  But that is the manner in which the Liberal government 
tends to operate in all matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have sufficiently explained the circumstances that 
surrounded what happened and how the Liberals are trying to get 
out of this jam.  I certainly hope that Canadians see it for what 
it is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, at the risk of 
driving the last member a bit crazy, I am going to agree, at 
least in part, with what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a lack of clarity in the amendment, which we recognized 
and which we dealt with, but which does not seem to have been 
recognized by the members of the Reform Party who have spoken to 
it.  That is to say, we are simply in this modified amendment 
restating the principles of the Official Languages Act because we 
are concerned when we hear from others that Parks Canada may be 
perceived as not following through on all of its obligations.  We 
believe that Parks Canada is doing so, but for greater certainty 
we want to state that it is a commitment of the Government of 
Canada to provide services to its citizens, to the public, in 
both official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment concerns services which are involved in direct 
contact with the public.  It does not cover painters.  It does 
not cover garbage collectors.  It does not cover ranch men and 
ranch women in Saskatchewan.  It is simply those people who deal 
with the public who would be covered under the Officials 
Languages Act as employees of Parks Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an interesting debate.  It is not only interesting 
to hear the government's point of view, which I will get to in a 
few moments, but also to hear the views of the NDP and the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember bills going through the transport committee in the 
last parliament and any time we said anything that suggested we 
were in any way infringing on the full, unfettered rights of 
people of Quebec, even though it was not fact, Bloc members would 
go ballistic.  They do not seem to recognize what is practical 
and reasonable in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Souris—Moose Mountain talked about the idea 
of territorial bilingualism, of having services wherever they are 
necessary and practical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Bloc will listen to this.  In 1994 I invited a member 
of the Bloc Quebecois to be my guest in my riding, which was then 
Kootenay—West Revelstoke, to see what that side of the country 
was like and to meet the people from that side of the country. 
This was at a time when they were talking about taking us on and 
disconnecting those people.  I also invited him to explain to the 
constituents of my riding what the Bloc's movement was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the opportunity to tour the member of parliament for 
Portneuf around my riding to show him bilingualism in effect. I 
took him down to the hospital in Castlegar to show him how 
everything is bilingual in that hospital.  It is English and it 
is Russian.  We have a very large number of Russian Doukhobor 
people whose heritage we celebrate. It does not create division. 
It makes our area richer because we work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took him to the city park in Nelson to show him the bilingual 
signs, which are in English and in Japanese.  The second language 
institutions in Nelson have made quite a business teaching 
English as a second language, particularly with the Asian 
connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He saw that we do not try to quash people being served in their 
most appropriate language.  We go out of our way to celebrate, 
not kill the culture and heritage of others who can make us 
richer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the government member speaking to the intention of 
the amendment relating to parks.  Notwithstanding his statements, 
the intention of the amendment, as it has been put forward by the 
committee, would apply to fence painters and to garbage 
collectors.  It would apply to everybody.  He had better be 
careful when he says that it will not, because the minister has 
already said that it will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clause in the bill that is unacceptable.  It is 
unacceptable to us.  It is unacceptable to the government.  Now 
we have two amendments.  We have a Reform amendment which would 
take the offending clause out.  We have government amendment 
which would tinker with it a bit, push it a bit here and push it 
around there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read for the hon. member the government's motion.  Maybe 
he has not read it clearly enough. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater certainty—to ensure that, where services are 
provided or made available by another person or organization on 
its behalf, any member of the public in Canada or elsewhere can 
communicate with and obtain those services from that person or 
organization in either official language, in any case where those 
services, if provided by the Agency, would be required 
under—the Official Languages Act— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Official Languages Act is already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are getting down to that grey area.  We have somebody 
painting the fence.  Along comes a person who asks “Which way do 
I go to get to the park?”  Is that communication with the 
public? 
It is not part of their job, but the amendment says if they 
communicate with the public.  The fact is that it could be 
interpreted that way.  Maybe the member who is chuckling over 
there thinks that would not happen.  Maybe not, but it could.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to chastise insurance companies and other companies for 
writing contracts, agreements and policies in legalise which 
nobody could understand.  In fact, it gets down to a point where 
lawyers dealing with a claim start battling over the 
interpretation.  Some enlightened companies started putting out 
policies and contracts in plain language.  A minimal amount is 
said and it is in the plainest language possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clause that the minister instructed not be put in. It 
was put in anyway.  The government recognized it was not good. 
Realistically, how should it be dealt with?  If there is a clause 
that should not have been put in, should it be tinkered with and 
massaged so that it might be interpreted better, or should it 
simply be taken out?  The logical answer is to take it out. 
Otherwise the bill becomes bigger and bigger.  At some point 
there will be an amendment to clarify what the amendment meant. 
That amendment will impact on some other part of the bill, so 
another amendment will be brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keep it as simple as possible.  I know the government hates to 
do that because it likes everybody to think it is so important. 
It thinks people could not live without it and live without all 
the wild and wonderful interpretations in the great complex 
legislation it deals with.  The fact of the matter is, the 
simpler the government keeps it the more respect it will command 
because finally it will be putting out something that makes 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a clause which the minister says should not be in 
the bill, the solution is to take it out.  We support taking it 
out.  That is not knocking the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Bloc Quebecois who harangued Reform for its 
position on this should recognize that, as it stands now, in a 
national park in Quebec, if they want someone to put a fence 
around some part of a path so people do not hurt themselves, they 
cannot hire a local francophone to do it.  They can only hire a 
fully bilingual person to do it.  Maybe it is so when you curse 
that you are an equal opportunity curser.  I do not know.  It 
simply does not make sense that somebody fixing a fence or 
picking up the garbage in Quebec has to speak English any more 
than it makes sense for someone doing those same tasks in British 
Columbia has to speak French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying that they cannot speak French.  We are not 
saying that somebody who is a francophone should not be able to 
bid on the contract.  We are simply saying that for these jobs it 
should not be imperative that they be bilingual. It does not make 
sense.  It is bureaucratic.  Think of the costs.  Did the 
government even stop to think of what the costs would be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Souris—Moose Mountain mentioned that if a road 
has to be built, the local contractor should be able to do it at 
less expense than importing someone from Winnipeg where there is 
a large francophone population.  Perhaps there is a road builder 
there where many people speak French.  If not, I guess someone 
would have to be brought in from Quebec.  Think of the costs that 
would be involved if local contractors could not meet the 
requirements and someone had to be brought in from another area. 
They would have to move their equipment, their manpower, lodgings 
and all the rest of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to do what is sensible, do not tinker 
with it, remove it.  It should not have been in there in the 
first place.  The minister even said that.  Simply do what the 
minister said in the first place.  We do not always agree with 
the ministers, so when we finally come up with something we agree 
on we would hope that government would not turn around and 
disagree with the minister by not taking it out.

continue on the general trend, in fact it is worse than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke actually summarized it very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things I would like to point out to the 
government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what the government is trying to do, and we all know it, 
is to try to save the reputation of a Liberal member who did a 
royal botch-up in committee.  That is what we are debating today. 
There was a royal botch-up.  It should not have happened.  The 
minister came forward with four and a half pages saying 
“Whatever you do, don't do this”.  Now we are in the House at 
report stage trying to amend a royal botch-up in order to save 
the face of the member who brought the original amendment into 
committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment should never have been brought in.  The members 
opposite say for greater clarity they want to make sure the 
Official Languages Act applies to this agency.  Why did they not 
say for greater clarity in the case of first degree murder that 
might occur in this park area we had better have a clause saying 
the Criminal Code applies?  It would be greater clarity just to 
make sure everyone is not confused about that, so that people 
walking around do not say this is a new park, maybe they could 
murder somebody and get away with it.  It is just silly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses are not put in for greater clarity when the other 
legislation already encompasses agencies under the federal 
jurisdiction.  It is not needed.  It is redundant.  It is a waste 
of time.  It is a face saving measure to try to save the 
political reputation of someone who should never have brought it 
into committee to begin with.  That is what that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of a case that was as silly as this in the last 
parliament.  The chairman of the official languages committee, 
Patrick Gagnon, was defeated in the last election.  He brought 
forward the proposal that we have an investigation to see why 
there were not more French signs on Sparks Street in Ottawa.  It 
was an excellent job for a committee of the House of Commons to 
determine why there was not more French on Sparks Street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberals said to Mr. Gagnon in a not so roundabout way 
what kind of bonehead idea is this.  It is not the job of the 
committee to look at that.  That was another silly, frivolous 
type of investigation.  Are we going to bring the language police 
on to Sparks Street? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a silly thing and of course he lost his chairmanship of 
that committee, and he subsequently lost the election.  It was an 
example of a Liberal member's bringing something forward that 
their own colleagues said was unnecessary, overkill and should be 
deleted.  Unfortunately there was a big row about it until the 
Liberals killed the idea.  That is of course what they are trying 
to do with this amendment today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to respond a bit to Bloc members' assertion about 
Reform's language policy.  They do not like it but that can be 
taken for what it is worth.  There is an anomaly that points out 
a bit of hypocrisy on their part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has always advocated from the beginning of our 
party that where numbers warrant and where it makes obvious sense 
we should have bilingualism absolutely in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the places where we have always said this should be in 
place is in the House of Commons.  There is no doubt about it 
that both French and English are spoken here in large numbers. 
The staff, the researchers, the proximity to Quebec, for all 
those reasons this place needs to be bilingual.  That is why we 
have translators.  That is why we have interpreters.  That is why 
motions are put in both languages and so on.  It is necessary 
because this is a bilingual institution, as the Reform Party has 
always said it should be.  This is typical of a place that should 
be and is bilingual.  It is bilingual so let us treat it that way 
and make sure it is handled that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But a strange thing happened.  When the Reform Party became the 
official opposition a shuffling of offices took place within the 
centre block building.  We moved from the fifth floor to the 
fourth which are the offices occupied by the official opposition. 
When we did that we made some subtle and some not so subtle 
changes.  We put the Canadian flag outside the leader's office 
because it is the office of the leader of the official opposition 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were other changes, not least of which was an attitudinal 
change. An interesting thing structurally happened on the fifth 
floor where the Bloc Quebecois entrenched itself as the third 
party, our old suites upstairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform Party was there the signs on all our doors were 
bilingual.  This being a bilingual institution, we always made 
sure all the signs were in both official languages because that 
is the way we believe it should be.  But when the Bloc Quebecois 
took over, it took down the bilingual signs on the doors of the 
fifth floor and put up French only signs.  Why would it do that 
in a bilingual institution like parliament?  Why would the leader 
of the third party take down the bilingual signs and put up 
French only signs in a bilingual institution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been changed on the whole floor on which the Bloc 
Quebecois is currently ensconced.  I find that disappointing. 
Bloc members say in the House that we must have respect for both 
languages, which I also believe. It is disappointing when they 
get to a floor they call their own, although it is a part of this 
institution and we all must deal with things on that floor, that 
they take down the bilingual signs which the leader of the Reform 
Party had in place and put French only signs up.   Why did they 
do that?  Why would they try to put one language only?  I would 
not do that in this institution.  This is a bilingual 
institution.  But they did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members are in favour of this Liberal amendment. However, 
their complaints ring pretty hollow when they say that they would 
like to see more French in our national parks.  It is ironic that 
90% of our national parks are in western Canada.  I have seen 
that we provide services in many languages as need requires.  I 
have seen tour guides speaking Japanese and Chinese.  We host the 
nation in these parts.  But when it comes to our own national 
institution, the House of Commons, they put French only on the 
doors, the one structural thing they have control of. That is too 
bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad commentary when we should be promoting and 
encouraging bilingualism and celebrating that diversity in this 
institution.  It is a sad commentary where numbers warrant and 
where it is a national institution that they choose to go the 
other way.  That is unfortunate.  I hope they take the 
opportunity in the next few days to change that, to show that 
they respect the spirit of bilingualism in this kind of 
institution in their own offices.  I hope they will but I will 
not hold my breath.  Although they talk a good line for the 
national parks in my region, they will not practice what they 
preach even here in our national parliament, and that is too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an amendment to fix a botched up amendment which the 
justice minister gave a four and a half page tongue lashing 
about, saying that it should never have been there.  This tries 
to fix it in a poor management style in terms of legislation. 
Fixing bad amendments by amending them further is the worst way 
to create good legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am worried they are setting a precedent.  What are we going to 
have?  Is the Minister of National Revenue who is contemplating a 
national tax collection agency going to have to put this clause 
in his bill?  It should never have been there. What about all the 
bills that do not include it because the Official Languages Act 
already covers it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a bad amendment made worse, a precedent setting one 
at that, by including it in an agency development bill.  As the 
government goes to other agencies, this amendment will now have 
to be pushed through on every one of them.  That is too bad and 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would be wiser to cut its losses and to cut this 
clause.  It is unnecessary, vexatious and strictly a political 
statement that tries to cover up a very bad mistake made in 
committee.

second language given the circumstances in the location.  To 
expect that somehow we are going to be able to supply bilingual 
people for these positions on a regular basis is really hoping 
for too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position that we have taken on this bill is one which has 
been supported by the Minister of Justice.  I would like to read 
a letter into the record which she sent to the Secretary of State 
for Parks.  It very clearly expresses the concerns that we have 
on this issue.  The fact that it is a letter written by the 
Minister of Justice should add some substance and credibility to 
our position: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that, during review of Bill C-29 (<I>Canada Parks 
Agency Act</I>) in the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, 
questions have been raised about the application of the 
<I>Official Languages Act (OLA)</I> to the proposed Agency and to 
its contractors and subcontractors. I am writing to confirm the 
position of the Department of Justice on this matter, namely 
that: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1.  Assuming that Bill C-29 is enacted in its current form, 
the Agency would be a “federal institution” under the 
<I>Official Languages Act</I> and, consequently, would be subject 
to all linguistic obligations set out in that Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-29, the agency would be considered as an agent of 
Her Majesty in right of Canada.  Section 3 of Bill C-29 states 
that “there is hereby established a body corporate to be called 
the Canada Parks Agency, that may exercise powers and perform 
duties and functions only as <I>an agent of Her Majesty in right 
of Canada</I>” [we underline]. In view of s. 3(1)(h) of the 
<I>OLA</I> which states that “any other body that is specified by 
an Act of Parliament to be an agent of Her Majesty in right of 
Canada (—)” is a federal institution, the Agency would clearly 
be considered as a federal institution and consequently, the 
<I>OLA</I> would fully apply to the Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Bill C-29 also states in s. 4(1), that the 
“Minister is responsible for and has the overall direction of 
the Agency” and, at s. 4(2), that “the Agency shall comply with 
any general or special <I>direction given by the Minister</I>” 
[we underline]. This requirement is also referred to in the 
second part of s. 3(1)(h) of the <I>OLA</I> where it is stated 
that a federal institution is also “any other body that is (—) 
to be subject to the direction of (—) a Minister of Crown”. As 
a consequence, the Agency would also meet this other criteria 
and, therefore, be clearly contemplated as a federal institution 
under the <I>OLA</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, section 50 of the Bill C-29 states that “Schedule 
II of the <I>Federal Administrative Act</I>, <I>[FAA]</I> is 
amended by adding the following in alphabetical order: (—) 
Canadian Parks Agency”. This schedule identifies the 
“departmental corporations” under the <I>FAA</I>, and under s. 2 
of the <I>FAA</I>, the departmental corporations are considered to 
be “<I>department</I>[s]” (we underline). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under s. 3 of the <I>OLA</I>, the definition of “federal 
institution” includes “department[s] of the Government of 
Canada”. The Agency would thus be considered a “department” 
under s. 3 of the <I>OLA</I> and s. 2 of the <I>FAA</I>, and would 
consequently also be subject to the obligations and duties of the 
<I>OLA</I> because of that status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, in view of the definition of federal institutions as 
described in s. 3(1)(f) and (h) of the <I>OLA</I>, our position is 
that the Agency would be a federal institution under that Act 
because it is (i) an agent of Her Majesty, (ii) under the 
direction of a Minister of the Crown, and (iii) a department of 
the Government of Canada.  As a result, it would be subject to 
the full linguistic duties and obligations of the <I>OLA</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>II. If the Agency were to contract-out services to the public 
which, under the <I>Official Languages Act</I>, have to be 
provided in both official languages, section 25 of that Act would 
require the Agency to ensure that the services provided on its 
behalf continue to be offered in both official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 25 of the OLA was enacted to ensure that federal 
institutions would not circumvent their duties under Part IV of 
the OLA (and <I>a fortiori</I>, under s. 20 of the <I>Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms</I>) when contracting out their 
services to third parties.  S. 25 can only apply if we conclude 
that, in a given circumstance, the third party providing services 
to the public is acting on behalf of a federal institution.  In 
every situation, the issue of whether a third party is acting on 
behalf of a federal institution must be determined on a 
case-by-case approach, on the basis of the circumstances and 
particularities of the arrangement between the federal 
institution and the third party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their usual meaning, the words “on behalf of” refer to the 
idea that one party is undertaking to do something for the 
benefit and as a representative of another party, generally at 
the request of the latter:  “Behalf:  1 in the interest of (a 
person, principle, etc.). 2 as representative of (acting on 
behalf of my client”, in <I>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</I>, 
8th ed., p. 99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view some types of arrangements will clearly fall under 
the purview of s. 25, for instance if a federal institution is 
legally responsible—i.e., on the basis of an Act of Parliament, 
a contract or any rule of law—for the administration or 
undertaking of a particular activity or for the provision of 
services or communications to the public.  In the event that the 
federal institution decides to contract out these services to a 
third party, the latter would be acting on behalf of the federal 
institution.  As a consequence, s. 25 would apply and the federal 
institution would have to ensure that the third party providing 
the services and communications does so in compliance with the 
linguistic requirements of Part IV of the OLA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another type of arrangement which, in our view, would also be 
covered by s. 25 is the contract of <I>mandat</I> (or mandate) in 
civil law and of “agency” at common law.  The rules of the 
<I>mandat</I> are based on the idea of representation: “[l]e 
mandataire [—] n'agit—” At common law, the power, vested in 
the hands of the agent, “is a power to affect his principal's 
position by doing acts on his behalf” (<I>Chitty on 
Contracts</I>, Volume II, p. 22—we underline).  Agency normally 
requires that the agent represent the principal.  Indeed, the 
purpose and effect of the agency relationship are to transfer to 
the agent the authority of the principal to act, thereby enabling 
the agent to affect the principal's legal relations with third 
parties (C.E.D.(Ont.) 3rd ed., p. 49).  As a consequence, in 
cases where the contract between the federal institution and the 
third party is considered to be a <I>mandat</I> or an agency 
relationship, the third party would be acting on behalf of the 
federal institution and s. 25 would require that its services and 
communications to the public be available in both official 
languages, in compliance with Part IV of the OLA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the term “on behalf” should not necessarily 
be limited only to the types of arrangements described above, as 
a too narrow interpretation of s. 25—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the question of how these bills are drafted, how they 
come before the House, their intent, what the Canadian public 
perceives as the correct way to do our business and the final 
result of that business has a lot to do with the credibility of 
our final product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reviewing what we are doing here today, talking about these 
motions with regard to the National Parks Act, the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier in committee apparently put forward the idea that 
subcontractors are required to provide bilingual services to get 
a contract for work in our national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole question of bilingualism in my province of Manitoba 
has been debated over the years in many aspects from schooling to 
services, to government services and to courts.  I personally 
think that is a very important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the province of Manitoba and its bilingual policies. 
The whole Reform Party supports those policies and our laws, 
including educating our children in both languages as they so 
wish.  However the province of Manitoba in its wisdom has not 
seen fit to have bilingualism in every little aspect of an 
individual's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence what was attempted here was to have official 
bilingualism used for a purpose that was never intended by 
parliament.  As a result I am certainly here today to speak in 
favour of Motion No. 7 of the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt to 
delete the amendment that came out of committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of admitting to the Canadian public that what was done 
in committee was not right and standing up on the other side and 
voting in favour of our motion to correct the error made in 
committee, the Liberal government tells the Canadian public about 
how it has to bring in another motion and that the Official 
Languages Act still applies and will be interpreted properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want straightforward discussions.  They want 
straightforward action from parliament.  Straightforward action 
would be simply to vote yes to Motion No. 7 and delete it. 
Instead there is subterfuge, confusion and an attempt to deceive 
the public about what is going on here.  It should admit what it 
is wrong and correct it in the easiest manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In wrapping up, we should vote yea to the motion of the member 
for Saskatoon—Humboldt and do the common sense thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is the House ready

<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to address the House today on Bill C-39, an act to amend 
the Nunavut Act and the Constitution Act, 1867. I have the 
privilege of starting the third and final reading debate on this 
bill following a comprehensive review by the Standing Committee 
on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I want to thank the standing committee for reviewing 
Bill C-39 carefully. Our government believes, and so do I, that 
members on both sides of the House have seen two very clear 
messages emerge from the committee proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there was overwhelming support for the proposed 
legislation in the North. Virtually everyone commended the bill 
for being balanced and thorough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, time is of essence. Each day that goes by brings us 
closer to April 1, 1999, when the division will take place and 
Nunavut will be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed now, the amendments contained in Bill C-39 will 
provide for a climate of greater certainty in the early days of 
Nunavut. Elected leaders will be in office from the start, and 
the funding of essential services and programs will be secured. 
These amendments will also prevent any mix-up in the judicial 
system and administrative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a situation is unacceptable to this government, the people 
of Nunavut and all Canadians. By supporting Bill C-39 at third 
reading, this House can take the necessary steps to ensure that 
the early days of Nunavut will be characterized by a spirit of 
trust and celebration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating Nunavut is a constitutional obligation of this 
government as the result of the Nunavut land claims agreement. 
For this reason alone, the bill warrants the support of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, honouring past commitments is only a small part of the 
importance of the creation of Nunavut to the Inuit of the 
eastern Arctic.  Nunavut draws not on the past but on the 
future.  Its creation is an expression of Canadians' recognition 
of the Inuit's right to self-government on their ancestral lands 
as true partners within the Canadian federation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut will have a form of public government similar to those 
in Yukon and the Northwest Territories.  Yet this government will 
be elected by a population that is 85% Inuit.  In that sense, it 
will be a government unlike any other in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who had the opportunity to attend the standing committee 
hearings on April 29 will recall Alex Campbell's impassioned 
comments to the committee.  Mr. Campbell is the executive 
director of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, a non-profit 
corporation established to represent the Inuit under the land 
claims agreement. He had this to say about his vision of Nunavut: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a mere 336 days, the most recent corner piece of the puzzle 
called Canada will be snugly set in place.  Nunavut will have a 
long awaited representative government.  Nunavut will have a 
growing representative workforce conducting territorial 
government business through a decentralized government across 11 
of the Nunavut communities.  Nunavut will promote, protect and 
preserve the language and culture in the workplace, in our laws 
and amongst our citizenship through the delivery of programs and 
services.  As always, Nunavut will draw from previous lessons to 
make Nunavut a better place to live.  That is the will and the 
desire of Inuit in Nunavut. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making Nunavut a better place to live is a goal that can be 
shared by hon. members on both sides of the House.  It is 
certainly a goal of this government, as stated very clearly in 
“Gathering Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”, our 
response to the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Gathering Strength” reaffirmed our commitment to establish an 
effective decentralized government in Nunavut and to have Inuit 
fill 50% of the positions at all levels of Nunavut's public 
service. This will contribute to the government's broad goals of 
building strong northern communities, people and economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main vehicle for establishing the new territory is the 
Nunavut Act which became law in June 1993. 
However, the task of creating a new territory is more complex 
than anyone imagined five years ago.  As a result we are now 
faced with several transitional issues that need to be addressed 
through amendments to the Nunavut Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost is the need for an early election in Nunavut 
so that a duly elected territorial government can convene on 
April 1, 1999.  This amendment was requested by political leaders 
in Nunavut.  If a vote is to be held in early 1999, planning must 
begin in earnest within the next few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 also clarifies some existing provisions of the Nunavut 
Act.  For example, it will provide greater legal certainty 
regarding the grandfathering of Northwest Territories laws and 
public institutions in Nunavut.  It also ensures the creation of 
a court system that is similar to that of the Northwest 
Territories and clarifies how pending administrative and judicial 
actions will be dealt with. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interim commissioner has to play a prominent role in the 
creation of Nunavut, but the powers conferred on him must be 
clear and strengthened.  Bill C-39 accomplishes this.  For 
example, the amendments in this bill will clarify the powers of 
the interim commissioner to negotiate agreements with the 
government of the Northwest Territories on the distribution of 
assets and liabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This distribution of assets is a vital matter, because the 
government of Nunavut will have to have immediate access to 
financing and will soon have to acquire vehicles, office 
furniture, computers and other administrative equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the interim commissioner does not manage to negotiate 
agreements by April 1, 1999, Bill C-39 will give the Governor in 
Council the powers necessary to guarantee the new territorial 
government the assets it requires to carry on business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 also introduces consequential amendments to other acts. 
The most important is an amendment to the Constitution Act, 
1867, to give Nunavut representation in the House of Commons and 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar amendment was passed in 1975 to give Yukon and the 
Northwest Territories seats in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned at the start, Bill C-39 enjoys huge support. 
Everyone agrees that it must achieve the objectives set for it 
and that we must act quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 enjoys such support because it is the result of a 
process of consultation involving all the stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the governments of Canada and the Northwest 
Territories, of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, of the Nunavut 
Implementation Commission and the office of the interim 
commissioner met more than 20 times to discuss the bill.  The 
spirit of the discussions was conciliatory and one of mutual 
respect, and I would congratulate all the participants. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe John Amagoalik, chief commissioner of the Nunavut 
Implementation Commission expressed it best when he described the 
bill as “a workable and sensible compromise of competing 
interests”. In his appearance before the standing committee, Mr. 
Amagoalik praised what he called the spirit of frank disclosure 
and fulsome discussion that shaped Bill C-39.  “The commission 
believes that this process of consultation has been a very useful 
one,” said Mr. Amagoalik, “and has contributed in no small way 
to the strength of the bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alex Campbell, who as I mentioned earlier is executive director 
of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, has expressed his 
organization's unqualified support for the amendments. “We must 
ensure that the amendments are supported and passed as quickly as 
possible,” Mr. Campbell told the standing committee. “Nunavut's 
interim commissioner requires the direction and confirmation to 
proceed.  This must happen for Nunavut to succeed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The executive director of the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada has also 
spoken in favour of the proposed amendments.  Alan Braidek 
reminded the standing committee that the establishment of the 
territory of Nunavut was one of his organization's original 
goals. 
Again, I am quoting directly from his remarks to the committee. 
“We are very satisfied with the process and with the 
establishment of the territory, and we see it as a very positive 
thing for all Inuit of Canada to see the recognition of the Inuit 
of Nunavut in an appropriate place within Confederation”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deputy Premier Arlooktoo of the Northwest Territories also 
appeared before the standing committee.  Mr. Arlooktoo 
acknowledged that the federal government had made many changes to 
Bill C-39 to address the concerns of the Northwest Territories 
government and expressed a willingness to move forward with the 
proposed amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These comments to the standing committee serve to underline the 
strong support for this bill and the need for quick action.  It 
now falls to this House to respond accordingly.  The creation of 
a new territory in the eastern Arctic has been a goal of the 
Inuit for more than two decades.  Division has also been endorsed 
by other residents of the current Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 is the final piece of the legislative framework needed 
to achieve this goal.  I urge hon. members to join me in 
supporting this legislation so that it can be sent quickly to the 
other place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am honoured to rise in the House today and address Bill C-39, the 
amendments to the Nunavut Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to addressing the proposed legislation, I want to again 
extend my best wishes to the residents of Nunavut.  I just 
returned from a trip to Iqaluit with other members of the 
standing committee for the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. I enjoyed the hospitality of the people and 
listened to their proposals for increasing their economic 
self-reliance.  I saw their pride in their new creation, the 
territory of Nunavut. There was much talk about improving their 
government and the delivery of services.  We certainly wish them 
well in their endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the legislation, before my speech is over I hope to 
show why the members opposite should have adopted a reasonable 
and democratic amendment to this bill which was proposed by the 
Reform Party, the purpose of which was to improve the Nunavut 
Act. Certainly the purpose of the act as proposed is to improve 
the previous legislation.  By adopting the Reform Party's 
amendments that legislation could have been improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that sending this legislation now to the non-elected, 
unaccountable and therefore ineffective Senate will simply add 
the meaningless seal of approval to a bill that will not aid in 
the cause of democracy.  I will be proposing an amendment at the 
end of my speech which I do not like putting forward but it is 
necessary given the government's stand on the whole issue of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original legislation creating Nunavut territory was 
introduced and rushed through parliament by the Progressive 
Conservative government with little time for comprehensive study 
by members of parliament at that time.  It contained numerous 
flaws such as this act is proposing to amend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were errors in the description even of the boundaries.  I 
was interested as a land surveyor to read the errors that the 
description of the boundaries contained.  There were gores and 
overlaps all along the boundaries.  There are unanswered 
questions with the James Bay Cree as to the status of the islands 
off the shore of James Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deficiencies and errors in the act are meant to be corrected 
by the legislation before the House.  There is one glaring 
oversight which the Leader of the Official Opposition spoke 
about.  That is the matter of how the senator for the territory 
is to be selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House together with many Canadians 
realize that when the legislation was drafted for many years 
there had not been any innovative thinking in this House on how 
government should be constructed or how it should be delivered. 
It was only after the Reform Party came to parliament that anyone 
even spoke about how democracy in this country might be enhanced 
by having the taxpaying public have a say in the selection of 
their senators.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The election of Senator Stan Waters, a Reformer, was the 
people's choice in the only Senate election ever held in the 
history this nation.  Depriving the Liberal Prime Minister of his 
number one patronage plum signals the end of civilization in the 
eyes of this government, but the election of Senator Stan Waters 
by ordinary Canadians did not bring about the apocalypse 
predicted by the government.  Instead, Canadians for once had the 
person they chose for the Senate.  This one senator, and only 
this one, was accountable only to the people who put him there 
rather than to the Prime Minister of the day and his political 
machine.  His independence meant that he was free to promote and 
protect the interests of the people who put him there. Is that 
not the way it should be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members of the Senate who have been there through 
seven or eight governments and five prime ministers.  We realize 
we need a sense of history in this House but we do not need to 
bring the artefacts right into government at the Prime Minister's 
wish and then leave them there until they have long forgotten the 
current issues of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a new territory was a perfect opportunity for 
this government to give the gift of fuller democracy both to the 
territory itself and to the rest of this country.  An elected 
senator would have been a generous gesture to the people of 
Nunavut that would signal the government's commitment to reducing 
the member's list for club Chrétien.  Failure to adopt that 
measure means a continuation of stale and outdated policies 
regarding the Senate and appointments to it and its increasingly 
ineffective role in defending regional interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate as currently constituted is anathema to many 
Canadians, and calls for its democratization or outright 
abolition will only grow more strident as time goes on.  Is it 
not about time the government listened to the voices of those who 
are calling for democratic reform?  It is not as if there were no 
interest in the matter, as the Liberals would have us believe. 
Alberta is planning to push ahead with elections for the people's 
choice for candidates to be appointed to the Senate.  This type 
of thing will only increase in frequency and will spread to other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Prime Minister and the government really have only 
two options.  The first is really twofold.  They could have been 
at the front of the parade and shown some real leadership on this 
issue by first allowing the people of Nunavut to democratically 
elect their first senator and they could have made a commitment 
to the rest of Canada that the Prime Minister is willing to 
appoint the provincially elected candidates for senators in 
accordance with voter wishes.   By rejecting this reasonable 
option, the Liberals risk being in the history books as the party 
that denied Canadians a democratic voice in the selection of 
those they desire to govern them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hope springs eternal in the human heart.  It is spring now and 
as life and colour return to the earth there is the promise of a 
new crop as seeds are planted.  The seeds of some new and 
democratic ideas have been planted here today, seeds of hope for 
Canadians weary of paying taxes to support an outmoded and 
deficient arm of government.  It has long fallen behind the needs 
and expectations of the people of Canada and the purposes for 
which it was created.  In its present form it is an anachronism, 
a fossil remnant of the important institution it was meant to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had hoped the government of the day would act on the 
amendment which was previously proposed.  However, I now propose 
on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition and other Reform 
members the following amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK78">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after 
the word “That” and substituting the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“this House declines to give third reading to Bill C-39, an act 
to amend the Nunavut Act and the Constitution Act, 1867, since 
the principle of the bill does not guarantee that the government 
will select senators who have been lawfully elected in a 
territorial Senate election”.

never the twain shall meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On occasion there are bills that mention the Senate, in this 
case the appointment of a senator and the process that should 
apply.  This bill gives us an opportunity to point out to 
Canadians that the way senators are appointed does not have to be 
done as it is done now.  This amendment says that the appointment 
process has so discredited the other place over the years because 
of friends of the Prime Minister being appointed ad nauseam who 
are expected to be loyal to him until death do us part or age 75, 
whichever comes first.  That process has been going on now for 
the life of the nation, far too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that a recent poll indicates that some 43% of 
Canadians think the Senate should be elected.  A further 41% say 
it should be abolished.  They have given up on the place. I 
understand where they are coming from when they say the place is 
a boondoggle.  The place is a waste of money, a patronage 
infested place based on protocol, geritol and alcohol and they do 
not want to have anything to do with it.  So 41% of the people 
say they do not want anything to do with it. They would like to 
abolish the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unwise and I hope to talk to the 41% during these brief 
remarks.  A Senate that was elected and is accountable to the 
electorate and not to the Prime Minister who sent him or her into 
that exalted office would be able to represent the concerns of 
their region or province in a regional manner that the House of 
Commons does not reflect.  The House of Commons is by necessity 
and must remain by and large representation by population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept the principle that the larger provinces have the larger 
sway in this place.  There are 103 members from Ontario.  That is 
as it should be. There is a big population in Ontario that will 
for the foreseeable future dominate the House of Commons in 
representation, not necessarily in the quality of presentations 
but at least in numbers, as it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the more sparsely populated regions of the country? 
Who looks after their interests in this place?  You can do your 
best as a representative of a smaller province population wise, a 
province like Prince Edward Island or Saskatchewan, provinces 
that do not have a burgeoning population or any prospects of that 
happening soon.  But three or four or half a dozen voices in a 
sea of three hundred and one seats are almost voices in the 
wilderness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Senate accountable to the voters of Saskatchewan or of P.E.I., 
not the Prime Minister, would allow those senators to have a 
strengthened role in the upper place to review legislation and to 
have a serious sober second thought on legislation.  They would 
be able to represent regional interests and disparities that this 
place does not do a perfect job of.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They could be given enhanced roles on everything from the 
selection of supreme court justices to the review of that sort of 
thing and review of other government appointments.  They could 
serve an excellent role being a check and balance on the ever 
increasing powers of the Prime Minister and his office. That 
would be a wonderful thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Nunavut bill we have a provision that says the old system 
is the good system.  It says the senator should be appointed and 
he should come from among the cadre of the Prime Minister's 
friends, answerable to him and his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the Prime Minister say in this House that he would 
appoint a senator into that other place and he will do the work 
of the Liberal Party.  That is his or her job.  What a sad thing 
as we approach the 21st century that we are still living in the 
days of the House of Lords where depending on who you knew rather 
than on the confidence of the people, you got a position in an 
exalted place.  It used to be an exalted place.  That is really 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the perfect time to initiate change.  The amendment says 
let us give the people of Nunavut an opportunity to elect their 
senator into the other place.  Nunavut by and large is inhabited 
by aboriginal people.  I do not know the percentage but they 
populate a very high proportion of the Nunavut region.  I think 
they have an opportunity to send someone they have confidence in, 
someone they are friends with, associated with or have respect 
for at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That person may or may not be of any political stripe, they may 
be Liberal, Tory, NDP, Reform. I do not really even care because 
if they had the confidence of the people of Nunavut what an 
opportunity for those people to lead the way for the nation. They 
would be able to say they are electing a representative to the 
upper house who would represent the Nunavut region, not the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time an issue comes up dealing with the Arctic, dealing 
with aboriginal issues, an Arctic conference which now takes 
place from time to time, every time there are land claims or 
anything happening in the region, a mine, a caribou herd, 
whatever it might be they will be there to represent their 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a concept.  The senator would not be there to represent the 
Prime Minister, not to ensure anything going speedily through the 
Senate, if anything can be done speedily in the Senate, but to 
ensure the people of that region are properly represented.  Would 
that not be a good and healthy step toward democratizing the 
other place?  I think it would be a grand and wonderful step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a wonderful thing to give that ability to this area 
north of 60 that is in a fledgling manner feeling its way toward 
a democratic system under which it is to be governed.  It is 
actually building the structures there right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What an opportunity for those people to say during the fledgling 
and expanding part of their democracy that they are going to be 
the pace setters and lead the way.  That would be a wonderful 
thing for the people up north to be able to say, that they are 
leading the way in Senate reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty-four per cent of people say either elect the senators or 
get rid of them, one or the other.  This would allow those people 
to say let us see if it makes a difference.  Here is a tiny first 
step.  There is only one but there is one.  One person can make a 
difference not only in setting a trend but in just showing that 
it can work better.  It did happen before in the Senate selection 
process in Alberta a few years ago.  Senator Stan Waters became 
the first person elected in a provincial senatorial selection.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister of the day said that while it is his 
privilege under our constitution to appoint senators, recognizing 
the wisdom of placing into the Senate the person who was duly 
elected, Mr. Mulroney said that makes democratic sense.  He said 
that it made sense and he appointed Stan Waters even though Stan 
Waters was a Reformer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Waters went to the Senate.  Those of us in the Reform Party 
often remember his call to arms about keep on marching.  He was a 
very self-disciplined man.  He gave the keep on marching orders 
as he went into the Senate.  Unfortunately he passed away all too 
soon.  Perhaps the long term impact of his presence was not felt 
as it could have been had he been there longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would do more than any other single thing to 
restore the faith of those 84% who have given up on the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other things can be done with the Senate.  For example, there is 
a person on Parliament Hill in one of the parliamentary buildings 
who is no longer a senator but who still gets accommodations. He 
has a suite of offices.  He has access to the phones.  He has 
facilities paid for by the taxpayer and he is not even a senator. 
He is a retired senator.  He has been out of office for a couple 
of years already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When senators have finished their job, when they are 75 years 
old, it is time to get out and write their memoirs, smoke their 
pipes at the beach, gaze out over the ocean and start writing. 
There is a maximum age in the other place. It is the rule.  The 
rule on retirement at 75 seems to be a reasonable one.  The 
ex-senator, past senator or whatever he is should move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to elect a senator from Nunavut, perhaps he could 
even use that same suite of offices.  He could move right in and 
say that this was the way it used to be where the senator kind of 
moved in.  If they were the friend of the prime minister they got 
the seat and not only that, they got the offices even after their 
job was finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do something very symbolic and say he moves in and 
takes either that office or Senator Thompson's old digs.  That of 
course is an option as well, since Senator Thompson is as they 
say in the funeral parlour business, no longer with us.  His 
offices are available.  Either one of those offices would be very 
symbolic in saying that is what is wrong with the Senate and this 
fresh new face, this elected person is what is right with the new 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt we would hear the cheering in Ottawa from the 
people of Nunavut who would say “Ah, my senator, my guy, my 
woman is down there right now holding to the fire the feet of the 
Liberal government and the opposition. In fact, they are doing 
their job representing my region”. That is what those people are 
going to say, if and only if the person is elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the person is appointed, unfortunately there will be 41% 
saying to abolish the Senate and 43% saying to elect it.  And 
there will be another .5% saying “Look at that, another 
boondoggle.  The prime minister picked somebody who raised money 
for him, who campaigned for him, who golfs with him, who helped 
him with his investments or who knows what all.  He or she gets 
an appointment in the Senate. Thanks for nothing”.  That is what 
they are going to say. “I thought I was sending somebody down 
there and paying his or her wages to represent me and my area, my 
region. Instead I hear from the prime minister that he or she is 
there to represent the prime minister and the Liberal Party”. 
That is just not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the people of Nunavut, I suggest it could be done in a dozen 
different ways.  A poll could be done. There could be a 
questionnaire but that is not even necessary.  Eighty-five per 
cent of them will say “Let me send the senator from among us, 
not from among the Liberal Party”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a glorious opportunity we have in this House to change the 
course of Canadian history. 
Maybe it has to be one at a time.  Alberta is going to hold a 
similar election this fall to select people.  It will then ask 
the prime minister to appoint them to the other place as a 
halfway step to reforming the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the people of Nunavut could lead the way it would be a great 
opportunity for them to say they championed a cause and were in 
the forefront of positive change in the House of Commons.  That 
would be a wonderful thing for them and this institution.  It 
would be a wonderful thing for the Senate which I think is 
clamouring for some direction and a positive role.  It needs 
something positive in that place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would set a precedent.  Alberta could be next and then B.C. 
which also has a Senate electoral act in place.  Maybe even 
Saskatchewan would follow because it is now considering a Senate 
electoral act.  And so on and so on until the other place is 
elected and effective. Then we could work toward the third goal 
of rejigging the numbers in the other place, but at least with 
people who are standing up on a public podium telling the people 
what they stand for and what they will do for their region if 
they are elected.  Their responsibility would then be to the 
people and not to the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they say in other circles, what a glorious day it will be 
when we have an elected Senate instead of the patronage trough 
that the other place unfortunately has become.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-39 at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all the more pleased because of the seven native 
communities that are located in my riding of Manicouagan.  The 
act to create the territory of Nunavut and to organize its 
government became law on June 10, 1993.  It sealed the land 
claims agreement and set out the legal and political framework 
for the new territory of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, when Bill C-39 comes into effect, it will modify the 
map of the Canadian north by creating the territory of Nunavut, 
which is scheduled to come into being on April 1, 1999. 
This will be the first time the borders of Canada have been 
changed since Newfoundland joined the federation in 1949.  I 
know that the Inuit, who make up 80% of the population of 
Nunavut, 17,500 out of a total 22,000, see this legislation as 
highly significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will allow them, along with the 20% non-aboriginal population, 
to administer the 1.9 million square kilometres of  their land 
via a legislative assembly duly elected by universal suffrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut means “our land” in Inuktitut, the language of the 
Inuit.  Their land is immense, representing one-fifth of the 
continental mass of Canada's 9,970,610 square kilometres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The territory of Nunavut is made up of three regions and 
includes 28 Inuit communities. 
From a geographical point of view, Nunavut is situated in the 
centre and east of the Northwest Territories, in the far north 
of Canada, that is north of the 60th parallel.  Labrador borders 
it on the extreme southeast.  It is also bordered by various 
bodies of water: the Arctic Ocean to the north, Baffin Bay to 
the east, separating it from Greenland, and Hudson's Bay and 
Ungava Bay to the south.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 establishing Nunavut will divide the Northwest 
Territories into two distinct entities, Nunavut and the 
Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides for a harmonious devolution of powers from 
the federal and territorial governments to Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It refers to the 1993 legislation, which was amended to include 
the recommendations of the Nunavut commission. The commission 
was set up in 1993 with the mandate to advise the governments of 
Canada and the Northwest Territories, as well as Nunavut 
Tunngavik Inc., the three parties concerned by the establishment 
of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Made up of nine members representing the federal and territorial 
governments as well as Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the commission 
considered the administrative and political issues relating to 
the establishment of Nunavut. 
These issues are: the transfer of services from the Government 
of Northwest Territories to that of Nunavut, as well as the 
timeframe; the funding and development of training programs 
needed to create a public service for Nunavut made up mostly of 
Inuit; the planning of the first election of a Nunavut 
government, and the needs in terms of infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1993 Nunavut Act stipulated that a general election to 
choose the members of the new Nunavut Assembly would be held 
after the new territory was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-39, the first general election for the legislative 
assembly of Nunavut will be held before the new territory is 
established on April 1, 1999 to allow the legislature to be 
operational as soon as the establishment occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative assembly will include 19 members, which means 
that the territory will be divided into 19 electoral districts. 
This first general election in Nunavut will be based on the 
current electoral legislation of the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 also amends the Northwest Territories Act to adjust the 
number of seats required in the Northwest Territories 
legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill C-39 amends the Constitution Act, 1867, to provide 
for Senate and House of Commons representation for Nunavut. This 
representation will be similar to that of Yukon and the 
Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also worth mentioning that, when Nunavut is officially 
established on April 1, 1999, the laws and ordinances of the 
Northwest Territories will become the laws of Nunavut. The 
powers of the new government of Nunavut will be equivalent to 
those of the existing territorial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer of culture, public housing and health programs 
should be completed by the year 2009. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the transfer of certain jurisdictions from the 
territorial and federal governments to the new government of 
Nunavut is somewhat complex. It requires a lot of preparation 
and, I would say, negotiation. However, it must also be said 
that the history of the Northwest Territories is complex. The 
origin of that part of the country and the history of its 
division into distinct territories go back a long way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the time Rupert's Land was divided up, first to form the 
province of Manitoba in 1870, then to establish the Yukon in 
1898, then to carve out the provinces of Alberta and 
Saskatchewan in 1905, and finally to establish the present 
boundaries of the Northwest Territories in 1912, there were 
different types of administrations and a lot of negotiations 
between the people and the leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the aboriginal side, since 1976, Inuit Tapirisat, the Inuit 
organization, has been suggesting to the territorial and federal 
leaders to delimit their territory to allow for the settlement 
of land claims made by the Inuit of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took two referendums, in 1982 and 1992, for both sides to 
agree on the new boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill establishing Nunavut, and its amendments, is the 
result of more than 25 years of efforts by the Inuit, who fought 
tirelessly to regain control over their land and their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the Bloc Quebecois cannot object to a piece of 
legislation which crowns so many years of negotiations and 
allows the Inuit to finally take their place on this continent 
by taking charge of their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to Bill C-39 establishing Nunavut, the Inuit will be in 
control and they will have all the necessary economic, 
political, social and cultural levers to look after their 
development and government on their own. This way, they will be 
able to act in their own best interest, for the good of their 
community, ensuring the harmonious development of their 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my party, speaking through the critic for aboriginal 
affairs, the hon. member for Saint-Jean, expressed a serious 
concern at second reading. The Bloc Quebecois remains concerned 
about the representation of Nunavut in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have nothing against the representation of Nunavut per se. 
However, representations have been made by our members in the 
last parliament to abolish the Senate of Canada, that obsolete 
and ineffective institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This institution, which costs Quebeckers and Canadians 
needlessly, belongs to a different century and operates on 
patronage. Such patronage appointments deprive our legislative 
process of the required credibility and objectivity, which is a 
rather serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, another concern expressed by my colleague, the hon. 
member for Saint-Jean and critic for aboriginal affairs, relates 
to the islands east of James Bay, south of Hudson Bay and north 
of Nunavik, in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of this House to the fact that the James 
Bay Cree and the Nunavik Inuit have been trying to negotiate 
since 1977 with the Department of Indian Affairs, so that we 
recognize their rights over the waters, the sea ice and the 
surrounding waters, as well as resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations were effectively suspended very soon after they 
began, in 1977, because of a dispute over compensation and the 
status of the regions involved. Since measures were undertaken 
to create Nunavut, the Cree and the Inuit have been wanting to 
begin a dialogue on this issue with the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials from the Grand Council of the Crees of Quebec appeared 
before the aboriginal affairs committee and expressed their 
concerns about this bill, as it relates to their claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They hope this bill will move the minister of Indian affairs to 
resume negotiations on the recognition of their rights. They say 
that they support the creation of Nunavut, but they reaffirm the 
importance of the negotiations on their rights within the 
boundaries of Nunavut, and the need to resume these 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly hope that the minister of Indian affairs and her 
officials will reply favourably to that call. Otherwise, my 
party will make it its duty to hound them about this important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the creation of Nunavut will bring harmony and 
prosperity to Inuit and aboriginal communities in that part of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my speech, I mentioned that there are 
aboriginal communities in my riding. Among them are Washat and 
Maliothenam.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I demand the government keep its word.  On the subject of the 
Inuit, during the election campaign, there was a promise of 
money for a cultural centre.  The Montagnais in Washat and 
Maliothenam have undertaken the major project of building a 
cultural centre to promote their culture.  Through their 
initiative they have undertaken a project worth over $3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec, which promised $700,000, contributed 
$700,000.  The federal government, through the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development solemnly promised $700,000 during 
the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask this government whether it is going to contribute the 
$700,000 or not?  Will it honour its commitment?  Since we are 
on the subject of aboriginal peoples, I will take the 
opportunity to ask the government to honour its commitment and 
contribute the $700,000, because the construction of the 
Montagnais cultural centre in Maliothenam and Washat, in 
Sept-Îles, is just about complete.  The centre will be 
inaugurated on June 22, and they do not yet have the promised 
$700,000.  So, I say to the government “You promised things. 
Honour your promise.  Give them the $700,000”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured today to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-39 to 
facilitate the creation of Nunavut.  On behalf of my colleagues 
in the New Democratic Party I would like to indicate at the 
outset our strong and unequivocal support for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In less than one year Canada's third territory will come into 
being, thanks to the passage of the Nunavut Act on June 10, 1993. 
This legislation would pave the way for Nunavut's first general 
election.  The creation of Nunavut and the unfolding of 
aboriginal self-government through public government in this new 
territory will be watched closely throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the Reform Party earlier in discussion of 
the bill opted for using the creation of Nunavut as an 
inappropriate political opportunity to deal with other issues and 
is even today continuing in its failure to support the bill.  It 
is yet another example of the Reform Party putting its own 
selfish political interests ahead of the interests of the 
aboriginal peoples and the people of the north who themselves 
want to move ahead with the creation of Nunavut and the concept 
of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, which my colleagues and I hope soon becomes law, is 
not primarily the result of the efforts of members of the 
Chamber.  It merely represents a short segment in the long 
process reflecting the hopes, dreams, plans and tireless effort 
of many Inuit and others in the momentous task of giving birth to 
the new territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud their efforts with all sincerity.  Not only have they 
made history in the soon to be Nunavut but throughout Canada and 
indeed throughout the world.  Central to the success thus far, 
the historic effort that is the creation of Nunavut, has been the 
careful negotiations among Inuit negotiators, government and 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all Inuit who have worked on and participated in 
this effort over the last 22 years and even before.  The tireless 
efforts of the Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., formerly the Tunngavik 
Federation of Nunavut, deserve recognition at this stage of 
dealing with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for the bill will be an important part of the effort to 
move ahead with aboriginal self-government in this region.  This 
will allow for province type powers essential to the development 
of the social, cultural, economic and political well-being of 
Inuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut comprises 1.9 million square kilometres, roughly 
one-fifth of the entire Canadian land mass or almost the size of 
Greenland.  This clearly represents a tremendous opportunity for 
Inuit to manage wildlife and resources in a formal fashion in 
government, having already managed them for so many thousands of 
years before Canada came into being. 
This will seek to formalize inherent Inuit rights to fish, 
wildlife and land that have been their right since time 
immemorial.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With a population of roughly 24,600, Inuit will comprise over 
four out of every five people in the territory to be.  The 
representatives elected to bring this new territory into being 
would be accountable to a largely aboriginal electorate.  The 
land claims agreement already passed recognizes Inuit title to 
350,000 square kilometres of land and includes provisions for 
joint management and resource revenue sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the minority population of Nunavut currently pervades the 
territorial administration, the challenge in part will be to see 
how the majority culture of Nunavut can be knit together with the 
culture of the minority population as the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I commend the Inuit involved in all aspects of the 
negotiations which led to the bill and to the development of 
Nunavut as a whole.  This extends not only to the chief 
negotiators but also to all those involved at every level and 
their families who so often had to endure long absences during 
the varied steps of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well I recognize the efforts of the standing committee, the 
committee clerk, the staff and those within the ministry who have 
worked in a positive way to assist with bringing this new 
territory into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week I had the opportunity of travelling north and 
visiting some of the aboriginal communities in northern Quebec as 
well as Iqaluit, the capital of the newly created territory of 
Nunavut.  This trip to the north was quite an eye opener for me. 
It was very interesting to see the beautiful yet rugged terrain 
of the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also brought to light many of the very serious problems that 
people in the north face in their day to day living: the very 
high cost of living because everything has to be transported in 
by either ship or air; the housing situation of the people in the 
north quite often involving a lot of overcrowding and inadequate 
housing; and the employment opportunities, or perhaps I should 
say the lack of employment opportunities, in many cases.  There 
are many challenges to be faced by the people in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also saw a number of very positive things happening.  We were 
able to visit the Arctic college to see the steps that were being 
taken for Inuit people to maintain their language and to move 
ahead with courses that will be relevant to their way of life and 
to their existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of excitement around the creation of Nunavut. 
There is a lot of expectation in the air.  The people who have 
worked long and hard to create this territory and to become a 
part of the Canadian society in a meaningful way deserve our 
support.  They deserve much better than haggling over the bill 
around the point of a senate and a senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should move ahead with the support of every member of 
the House.  As we support this initiative we are supporting the 
right of a people to determine their destiny, to take part in 
shaping their lives and to lead meaningful lives within the 
context of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am very pleased to be able to support the bill. 
I urge every member of the House to support it at third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to make a few comments on this bill. I make my 
comments on behalf of the member for South Shore, our Indian 
affairs critic, who was unable to be here today because of 
pressing public business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a new territory in the northeastern and central 
region of Canada on April 1, 1999 is a very historic occasion. It 
will create Nunavut as a separate territory from within what is 
currently the Northwest Territories.  It is quite appropriate 
that I should be making a few comments today on the bill, given 
the fact that it will happen 50 years to the day that 
Newfoundland entered Confederation, quite an appropriate date for 
such an occurrence I might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with a brief history of the events leading up to 
this momentous occasion. 
The creation of the new territory in the north to be called 
Nunavut has been a long time coming.  It has been a long time in 
reaching fruition.  The journey has not been an easy one.  It has 
had many hurdles along the way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first attempt to divide the Northwest Territories into two 
regions was back in 1960, as I am sure you are well aware, Mr. 
Speaker, and was initiated by the western region of the Northwest 
Territories.  As we are all aware the legislation died on the 
Order Paper when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next event of significance was the release of the Carrothers 
report in 1966 and its recommendation that a division of the 
Northwest Territories would not be beneficial at that time to the 
Inuit living primarily in the eastern region.  Instead the report 
made a number of recommendations including the creation of 
electoral constituencies in the eastern and central Arctic. As 
well, it suggested the appointment of a commissioner who resided 
in the Northwest Territories.  At that time of course the 
commissioner of the Northwest Territories was based out of 
Ottawa.  Finally, the report recommended the transfer of federal 
programs to the territorial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously these recommendations were to set the stage for 
division of the Northwest Territories at a later point in time 
when the region would be in a better position to assume control 
of its administration and of its governance as well.  These 
recommendations were acted upon in the following years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1976 there was another bid for division of the territory, 
this time by the Inuit, or the ITC, an organization representing 
Inuit in Canada.  A plebiscite on the issue of division followed 
in 1982 and it garnered a 56% rate of approval which was 
particularly strong among the people in the eastern Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That year also saw the formation of a constitutional alliance 
consisting of members of the legislative assembly in the 
Northwest Territories and representatives from aboriginal groups. 
Its objective of course was to develop an agreement on dividing 
up all of this territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although an agreement was reached in 1987 it was not ratified by 
the Dene Nation and the Metis association who had a land claim 
settlement in the western area and objected to the proposed 
boundary.  The agreement, as we are all aware, failed and the 
many groups who were involved with that agreement at that time of 
course dissolved as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next step in the process was in 1990 when the PC government 
asked John Parker to determine the boundary between the two land 
claim settlement areas, one belonging to the Dene-Metis Nation in 
the western area and the Inuit in the eastern region. This was 
taken to a plebiscite in May 1992 and it received a 54% approval 
rating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very important piece of information I have not mentioned is 
that the Inuit land claim agreement that was finalized in April 
1990 called for the creation of the new territory.  The Inuit 
ratified the agreement with a vote in November 1992 with 85% of 
the people voting in favour of the settlement. The land claims 
settlement area will become the Nunavut territory on April 1, 
1999.  This was the largest aboriginal land claim settlement 
agreement in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut means “our land” in Inuktitut and represents almost 
two million, or 1.9 million square kilometres, roughly one-fifth 
of Canada's land mass which is quite a large piece of territory 
in anyone's interpretation.  The capital of this new region will 
be Iqaluit on Baffin Island.  I always have problems with that 
particular word, but it will be Iqaluit on Baffin Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of challenges that must be overcome before 
the creation of Nunavut in April 1999.  This legislation 
addresses some of those concerns.  It confers great powers 
incidentally to the interim commissioner, Jack Anawak, to enable 
him to enter into leases on behalf of the new territory. 
It ensures that employees hired for the new government positions 
are in permanent rather than temporary positions.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, this amendment to the Nunavut Act provides for 
an election before the date that the new territory comes into 
existence.  This is of critical importance to ensure that a 
government will be in place to begin work immediately without 
having to go through the process of an election in what is 
obviously going to be a critical and a very dynamic time for the 
people in this new territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue of concern to the western region was the number of 
elected representatives required for governing after this 
particular division or split occurs.  Since the western region 
will be left with 14 members but the regulations require 15 
members, the amendment to this legislation which reduces the 
number down to 14 is going to be welcomed by the Nunavut people. 
This will ensure the western region is in a position to offer a 
continuation of services for that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the legislation amends the Constitution Act, 1867, to 
create another seat in the Senate to recognize this new 
territory.  Currently there is only one seat for the NWT.  The 
senator representing the NWT resides in what will become Nunavut. 
This amendment will eliminate any uncertainty in that area as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest concerns expressed by the Inuit and others 
affected by the change was the need for continuation of services. 
This legislation helps to ensure that this will occur. At the 
same time there are still concerns for those people living in the 
eastern and central Arctic as well.  There are concerns as to 
whether the infrastructure is going to be in place.  Will 
financial assistance be provided?  Will there be enough of it? 
Are there going to be enough people to fill the expected 600 new 
positions that will be created in Nunavut? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new territory will consist of approximately 24,000 people. 
Eighty-five per cent or 18,000 of them will be Inuit.  Inuktitut 
will be the working language for them.  The hope is to have 85% 
of the staffing positions filled by Inuit in the long term, 45% 
in the short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has provided about $40 million for 
training and education to prepare the people living in the 
eastern and central Arctic for positions in this new government. 
With the settlement of land claims in this area however a number 
of new positions are available for the Inuit.  It may be 
difficult to find people to staff all of these new positions. 
With Nunavut's plan to have government offices spread out over 11 
different communities, it might be difficult to attract workers 
to the outlying areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nunavut Implementation Commission has reported that Nunavut 
will have to obtain 50% of the people for these new positions 
from outside its region.  At the same time a report by the 
Government of the Northwest Territories suggests that only 10% to 
15% of its staff will move to Nunavut.  That means Nunavut will 
not have a large corporate knowledge base upon which to build. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is questionable whether the infrastructure will 
be in place at that time.  This is a great concern.  Arctic 
conditions make it difficult not only to ensure adequate supplies 
but also decrease the amount of time available for construction. 
Moreover there is little or no private sector space available 
since everything is typically built on an as needed basis. 
Although the entire infrastructure is not required immediately 
and the timetable factors in a delay of two years for some of it, 
a continuation of services will not be possible without adequate 
infrastructure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut will have a public government with Inuit and non-Inuit 
representatives.  Although Nunavut was created as part of the 
land claim agreement, the Inuit chose a public government format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land claim agreement raises another interesting point 
however and that is what constitutional rights the Nunavut people 
will have.  Although one would assume that its powers would be 
equivalent to those of the Yukon Territory and the western 
region, Nunavut will be created as part of a land claims 
settlement agreement under section 35 of the constitution. This 
is another area that is not clarified for the new territory and 
has the potential to create some uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary let me say that the PC government initiated this 
process culminating in the creation of Nunavut in April 1999 when 
the Nunavut land claims settlement agreement was signed in May 
1993. The creation of this territory is a positive move for the 
eastern region. The PC party supports self-government for 
aboriginal peoples as a means of improving their economic 
development and conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I agree in principle with this legislation as it attempts 
to rectify some omissions in the Nunavut Act, there are still a 
number of challenges facing a new territory as it counts down to 
April 1, 1999.  Let us hope that these issues will be addressed 
quickly as the clock is ticking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before taking my seat, I just want to make one final comment on 
the amendment that the Reform Party has introduced.  I believe 
this is an amendment the Nunavut people have not asked for.  It 
is a feeble attempt to delay this particular piece of 
legislation. The issue of bringing the Senate in on this 
particular bill as to whether or not it should be elected is a 
separate issue quite apart from this bill and should not be 
entertained.  It should be seen for what it really is which is 
one more attempt by the Reform Party to draw attention to its 
main preoccupation which is the Senate.  It does nothing for the 
Nunavut people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree in principle with this legislation.  It attempts to 
rectify some omissions in the Nunavut Act.  There are quite a 
number of challenges facing these people.  We will be watching 
with interest because the clocking is ticking away.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA GRAIN ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK85">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib)</B> moved that Bill C-26, an act to amend the Canada 
Grain Act and the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative 
Monetary Penalties Act and to repeal the Grain Futures Act, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to third reading of Bill C-26. When I addressed 
this House on the occasion of the second reading of this bill, I 
discussed how this initiative should be viewed in the context of 
the government's priorities. I will do this again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grain industry is currently faced with significant 
challenges and opportunities.  Global competitive and natural 
forces are leading to and accelerating change and challenges. The 
grain industry is changing rapidly in order to respond. 
Legislation must also evolve to assist that industry's efforts to 
meet those challenges and opportunities. This initiative reflects 
our government's willingness to meet the express needs of the 
grain industry and to co-operate in its efforts. The main 
objective of this government is to build a competitive and 
innovative economy that will grow to create even more jobs and 
improve the well-being of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture and agri-food is a key sector of the Canadian 
economy.  It continues to contribute very significantly to the 
building of our economy.  This industry is growing tremendously. 
Producers and processors are optimistic about the future as they 
invest in and diversify their operations in order to benefit from 
new opportunities.  I share their enthusiasm.  I want to work 
with them in creating those opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the ways to accomplish the objective of continuing 
vigorous growth is to work closely with stakeholders.  Our 
government intends to be the catalyst for partnerships with 
industry stakeholders.  Our government is committed to a policy 
of full consultation with both the agri-food industry and the 
provinces.  I believe we are succeeding in our goal. We recently 
announced the rural impact test and we want to build stronger 
rural communities by doing our share in supporting community 
development.  We recognize the tremendous value of rural citizens 
and communities in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 is proof of our commitment to rural Canada.  It would 
allow easier access into the special crops processing industry 
and it would have a very positive impact on rural employment 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our federal rural policy we want to increase the 
participation of rural Canadians in the development of federal 
programs and services.  The main elements of the bill satisfy 
this goal, especially those provisions that relate to special 
crops. Special crops producers and processors were involved in 
every stage of the process leading up to consideration of the 
bill by this House.  They would continue to play a role during 
and after the implementation of its provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special crops industry has undergone impressive growth over 
the last 10 years.  Crops that were once considered marginal to 
western Canada's agri-food economy are now being produced in 
significant volumes.  More producers are planting special crops 
and a greater number of people want to become special crops 
dealers.  There has been a call by stakeholders for more current 
legislation to establish a fair and effective licensing system 
for dealers and an efficient voluntary insurance plan for 
producers, legislation that recognizes the unique requirements of 
the special crops industry. 
With the growth of the industry a need was identified for changes 
to the regulatory system as well.  Current regulations are seen 
to be unnecessarily punitive, offering minimal deterrent value. 
The Agriculture and Agri-food Administrative Monetary Penalties 
Act is proven legislation that provides a broad range of 
enforcement options.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grains futures industry has also undergone significant 
changes recently.  The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange plans to 
develop non-grain contracts.  When this happens the Grain Futures 
Act, legislation used since 1939 to regulate grain futures and 
options trading, will become obsolete.  Repealing the act would 
allow the Manitoba government to regulate all aspects of a modern 
commodity futures and options trading industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 was developed by the Canadian Grain Commission in 
co-operation with stakeholders representing special crops 
producers and dealers, and stakeholders representing the grain 
futures industry.  The proposed amendments contained in the bill 
would accomplish five main objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would establish an affordable licensing plan for special 
crops dealers in western Canada. They would introduce a producer 
funded insurance plan. They would create a special crops advisory 
committee that would report to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-food. They would provide a fair and effective mechanism for 
enforcing the Canada Grain Act and regulations. They would 
transfer regulatory responsibility for grain futures to the 
province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus my comments on the first three objectives proposed 
in Bill C-26, the licensing and insurance plans and the advisory 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new special crops licence for dealers in western Canada would 
be created under the proposed legislation.  The licence would 
give companies the right to buy and sell special crops and to use 
official grade names when doing so.  The plan would eliminate the 
security requirement for processors which has been identified as 
a major financial barrier to becoming licensed to deal in special 
crops.  Instead of providing security the dealers would collect 
levies from producers from whom they buy special crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levies would be remitted to the administrator of the program 
initially proposed to be the Canadian Grain Commission.  After 
deducting an administration fee the commission would forward the 
premiums to the insurer.  The Canadian Export Development 
Corporation has agreed to act as the initial insurer for the 
plan.  The insurer and the agent can be changed in the future if 
the special crops advisory committee recommends it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of the levy is proposed to be 38 cents per $100 of 
sales.  The levy would be the sum of the insurance premium and 
administrative charges.  Initially it is proposed that the 
insurance premium would be 20 cents per $100 of sales and the 
commission's administrative fee would be 18 cents per $100 of 
sales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently security requirements are designed for high volume 
standard crops handled by large grain companies.  The 
requirements were not designed for the much lower volume specials 
crops which are mainly handled by small seed cleaning plants, 
special crops dealers and processors.  The result is that 
companies that could otherwise be licensed stay on the sidelines. 
Unfortunately some others buy grain without a licence, exposing 
producers to the risk of loss.  The special crops industry 
currently operates under a system that was established for the 
standard crops, wheat, barley, oats, flax, rye and canola.  The 
government through Bill C-26 is responding to the special crop 
industry's expressed concerns and recommendations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Removal of the security requirement which is a financial barrier 
to small dealers and processors would allow companies that had 
previously been on the sidelines to become involved.  It would 
also encourage companies currently operating without a licence to 
apply for one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While licensing would be easier, this does not mean that 
everyone would be granted a licence.  Prospective licencees would 
be required to demonstrate that they are financially able to deal 
in special crops before a licence was issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A consulting firm retained by the Canadian Grain Commission, 
Kelly and Associates, estimated an additional 125 firms in 
western Canada could become licensed under the proposed 
legislation.  The changes could significantly expand the number 
of marketing outlets available to producers and promote healthy 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the proposed voluntary producer 
funded insurance plan.  Protection would still be available for 
special crop producers despite the elimination of the current 
security requirements for licencees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new insurance program proposed for special crops producers 
would replace the current security system which makes the real 
cost of security transparent to producers.  Membership in the new 
plan would be voluntary and available to those producers who 
choose to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a licensed company defaults on payment obligations for 
special crops that it has bought or if that company becomes 
insolvent, participating producers would be able to make a claim 
to the insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers could choose to opt out of the insurance program.  In 
that case, they would not be eligible for security in case of 
default by licensed grain dealers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers who choose not to participate would still be required 
to pay the levy but would then receive a refund from the 
administrator of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed plan originally required producers who opted out to 
apply for a refund.  Witnesses before the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food expressed concern about this aspect of 
the plan, placing an administrative burden on producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee agreed and, taking a proactive approach, approved 
an amendment to make the refund process automatic.  A proactive 
approach was also taken with regard to the clause that provides 
for special crops to be added or removed from the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was concern that standard crops such as wheat, oats, 
barley, rye, flax and canola might also be included.  Although 
this was never the intent of the legislation, the committee 
approved changes that specifically exclude the six standard crops 
from the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandatory deduction from all producers, whether they are in 
or out of the plan, was an issue studied at some length by the 
interim special crops advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee, which included representatives from a number of 
stakeholder groups, decided a mandatory refundable model was 
needed to ensure the viability of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main factors which led to this decision were as follows. The 
plan has to be administratively efficient to keep costs down for 
producers.  It is far more efficient and cost effective to deduct 
the levy from all producers and later reimburse those who have 
opted out.  This is a significant benefit to the industry as it 
keeps paperwork to a minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the interim special crops advisory committee were 
concerned that a plan that required producers to opt in might 
leave some producers, unknowingly, without coverage and open to 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandatory refundable model has already successfully been 
used by other plans.  It is similar to some provincial pulse crop 
levies and the Saskatchewan canola levy.  For these reasons, the 
advisory committee felt it should be applied to the insurance 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Operating costs of the program are expected to be recovered 
through fees collected for services provided.  The proposed fees 
are based on estimates of variables such as participation levels 
and deliveries.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the plan is operational the program administrator would be 
in a position to better evaluate the true costs that would be 
incurred and make the necessary adjustments.  If the 
administrative portion of the levy is found to be too high, 
adjustments would be made to reflect actual costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the consultation stage stakeholders called for the 
establishment of a formal mechanism to ensure continued input 
into the program.  They wanted to ensure that concerns regarding 
licensing and security would be heard by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments to the Canada Grain Act address this 
issue by creating a special crops advisory committee.  The nine 
member committee will be appointed by the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food.  Special crops producers and dealers from each of 
the western provinces would be identified to sit on the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee will advise the minister on the licensing and 
security operations of the special crops program.  They can 
recommend to the minister that the administrator of the insurance 
plan or the insurer be replaced.  The committee would also be 
able to make recommendations on the designation of new crops or 
removal of crops and on other issues related to special crops 
referred to the committee by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A majority of the members of the committee would be producers 
rather than dealers.  This reflects the fact that the cost of the 
insurance plan would be borne by producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close my speech by talking about the potential impact the bill 
would have.  Special crops processors are important employers in 
the towns where they are located.  For example, Sedley, 
Saskatchewan, with a population of only 342 people, is bordered 
by the rural municipalities of Francis and Lajord.  Sedley Seeds, 
located seven miles out of town, employs eight people on a 
permanent basis, four of whom are town residents.  It employs 
approximately fifteen people during the pre-seeding and 
post-harvesting rush.  Vigro Seed & Supply, located right in 
Sedley, permanently employs twelve people, seven of whom are town 
residents.  It employs approximately thirty people during peak 
periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the two companies do not seem big by Toronto, Montreal 
or Ottawa standards, they are important local employers.  They 
provide valuable services to the local rural community.  As the 
regular elevator system is rationalizing and closing facilities, 
special crops processors like Sedley Seeds or Vigro Seed & Supply 
located throughout western Canada would be in a position to 
provide alternative delivery options and services to producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is good for the special crops industry and for rural 
Canada.  I encourage all members of the House to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to stand today to speak to Bill C-26, the legislation to 
amend the Canadian Grain Act, the Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Administration Monetary Penalties Act, and to repeal the Grain 
Futures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food noted, the bill applies to special crops including 
peas, lentils, corn, fava beans, soybeans, sunflowers and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 would allow for the creation of an insurance plan for 
western Canadian special crops producers to protect them against 
losses if dealers or buyers go bankrupt with unpaid bills.  The 
bill would also make provision for the minister of agriculture to 
establish a special crops advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, if enacted, would repeal the Grain Futures Act 
allowing responsibility for regulating the Winnipeg Commodity 
Exchange to revert to the Manitoba Securities Commission.  The 
exchange is now regulated by the Canadian Grains Commission but 
it would be more appropriate to have it regulated by a provincial 
government agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special crops are of growing importance in western Canada.  Mr. 
Garry Meier, chair of the board of Saskatchewan Pulse Growers 
Association, appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food last month and told us that Canada is 
the world's leading exporter of lentils and peas. 
Mr. Meier reported that Saskatchewan actually produces 96% of the 
Canadian lentil crop and 66% of dried peas.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this caucus support any measures that will improve the 
ability of farmers to prosper from growing and marketing special 
crops like peas and lentils.  We also support measures that would 
put the entire special crops industry on a firmer financial 
footing.  For this reason we are generally in favour of Bill 
C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that we are generally in favour, however, we feel 
that the bill could have been improved if only the government had 
accepted some suggestions made by the representatives of producer 
organizations such as Mr. Meier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, Bill C-26 will allow for the creation of an 
insurance plan for western Canadian special crops producers. 
Producers would pay a levy of 38 cents on each $100 worth of 
crops delivered to buyers and dealers.  In other words, producers 
themselves without a contribution from any level of government 
will finance the insurance program.  It is here that there could 
have been an improvement to the piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee on agriculture heard from organizations 
that represent special crops growers.  The Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba pulse growers associations both recommended a 
full-fledged board of directors instead of an advisory committee. 
A motion later proposed by the opposition parties also 
recommended that the directors of the board be chosen by the 
minister from a list of officially registered special crops 
commodity groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both these recommendations make good sense to our caucus.  After 
all, farmers will pay for this insurance program without any 
contribution whatsoever from government.  It only makes sense 
that they should call the shots.  For example, it is they who 
should decide who should act as the agent for their insurance 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had these suggestions been incorporated, it would have improved 
the legislation and overall its acceptance by western Canadian 
special crops producers and farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special crops insurance program will be financed by 
producers from a levy or check off on all crops delivered to the 
buyers and the dealers.  The nature of these check offs has been 
a controversial aspect of the bill.  The government prefers to 
say that the insurance program is “voluntarily”, but that is 
not really true.  Farmers have to pay a levy up front and then at 
the end of the crop year they can apply for a refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saskatchewan Pulse Growers Association does not refer to it 
as voluntary but as a mandatory recoverable, which I think is a 
far better description.  Another way of describing it is a form 
of negative option billing where they get a service unless they 
indicate in writing that they do not want said service, and if 
they do not want it they ask to have themselves removed.  Cable 
television companies tried this a couple of years ago and 
experienced a considerable consumer revolt as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party caucus criticized this mandatory 
insurance provision of Bill C-26 in the debate at second reading 
and argued that the insurance plan should be voluntary.  Later 
when Bill C-26 was discussed at the agriculture committee, 
producer groups also asked that the insurance plan be made 
voluntary.  They said that farmers would not appreciate another 
check off and would not appreciate the paperwork necessary to get 
their money back at the end of the crop year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following this recommendation by producer groups there was a 
motion at the standing committee on agriculture that the plan be 
voluntary, but again unwisely in our opinion government members 
voted it down.  Government members had no solid explanation as to 
why the plan required mandatory features.  I am disappointed they 
did not see fit to do what commodity organizations had requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commodity organizations do not like the mandatory aspect of the 
insurance plan any more than we in this caucus do, but the 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan pulse growers associations consulted 
their members who told them to support the legislation despite 
the apparent flaws.  Our caucus took this message to heart and 
despite its shortcomings we have decided to support Bill C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have expressed the fear that the insurance program might 
one day be made to apply to other crops including wheat, oats and 
barley.  That concern now has been laid to rest by an amendment 
proposed on the government side in the agriculture committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this amendment the legislation applies only to 
special crops and clearly not to standard grains such as wheat 
and barley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26, despite its shortcomings, is by and large a good 
piece of legislation.  Both the Saskatchewan and Manitoba pulse 
growers associations support the bill although they have made 
some suggestions for improvements which unfortunately the 
government has chosen to ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance, it is worthwhile legislation.  The major commodity 
groups support it and our caucus will be supporting it as well.

restructuring of Canada employment centres by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, several centres in less populated 
areas were closed so that centres in larger towns could stay 
open.

promised the community that was affected by this closing and 
that was at a disadvantage because of a lack of public transit, 
that an acceptable level of activity would be maintained.  The 
Saint-Jérôme CEC therefore gave the contract for checking and 
forwarding EI applications to the Argenteuil literacy centre. 
But this service was recently cut, supposedly because of the 
potential savings to the Saint-Jérôme CEC.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier 
today the health minister suggested that safety concerns over 
imported albumin were just a matter of paperwork, but the court 
order specifically raised concerns over both the quality and the 
purity of Alpha's blood products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company was ordered to discontinue immediately “all 
manufacturing and distribution of products using reworked, 
reprocessed, returned or rejected lots”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of these facts how can the minister continue to dismiss 
concerns as just a matter of paperwork? 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
how can the member continue to leave the impression that these 
products are unsafe when they have been approved for use in both 
the United States, which has an exacting standard, and here in 
Canada which has its own standard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The product in question has received approval from the 
authorities who have made the appropriate inquiries, the 
appropriate inspections, and have come to the conclusion that 
this product is safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member to say otherwise day after day in the House is 
very unfair to those who rely upon this product for health 
purposes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister was doing his job he would know that the imported 
albumin being used on Canadians was made before Alpha was ordered 
to clean up its practices, before Alpha was ordered to stop using 
reworked and rejected products, and before Alpha was ordered by 
the courts to improve purity and quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of these facts the minister should have Canadians 
inspect the site, trace the lot and test the product now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the minister waiting for?

we all know people in life who take a little knowledge and then 
judiciously select some of the facts and combine them in quick 
statements leaving a misimpression. In fact it is the NDP policy. 
That is what it is.  The leader is making an example for the 
House of exactly that approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality and the bottom line is of importance to Canadians. 
This product has been approved by those responsible in both the 
United States and Canada.  The people who take it can take it 
with confidence for that reason.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.  It is reported that the 
government is deeming certain individuals to be “national 
treasures” because they are “invaluable” to the institutions 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Prime Minister please tell this chamber of parliament 
who is making these decisions and who is paying for these 
decisions?  Finally, when will the government account to the 
taxpayers of Canada for these expenses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is a pretty general question.  The hon. 
House leader. 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, even though the words of the 
question are changed, it is still quite obvious that any 
reference in this House to how the other house functions and how 
it chooses to allocate its office space is strictly the 
jurisdiction of the other house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the hon. member opposite that similar things have 
been done for other senators, for individuals like Jack Marshall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I am not sure where the 
questions are going.  We will have to keep it to the 
administrative responsibility of the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
to say so much for transparency and accountability in spending 
our taxpayers' dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again would ask the Prime Minister how this government is 
accounting to Canadians for these actions and expenditures. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

that the administration of one house through its board of 
internal economy or in the case of the other place, the committee 
of internal economy is strictly of the confidence of the other 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that once members have left the house in question, in 
that case the other place although it has happened here too, they 
have been allowed some office space. A case was raised now 
without mentioning it.  Other members of other parties including 
her own were accorded the same kind of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, here is the dilemma that I 
have.  I have a question that is very general about a subject we 
cannot discuss yet I have an answer being given about a subject 
we are not supposed to discuss. I think I am going to rule both 
of you out of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will shift gears here for a minute.  The finance 
minister is under increasing fire first from Mike Harris of 
Ontario and now his Liberal cousins in New Brunswick for allowing 
the surplus in the EI fund to become a cash cow instead of the 
insurance program it was intended to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister assure this House today that he will make real 
cuts to the premiums and return the EI fund to its original 
purpose? 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would simply point out to the hon. member that last 
year we cut the premiums by $1.4 billion.  That is a real cut. 
It is real money. In fact since we have taken office the 
premiums, which were to go to $3.30, have been cut by $4.5 
billion a year.  In my opinion that is real money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the real money is in a surplus.  It is growing toward 
$20 billion and looking more like $25 billion next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about the choices his government has had to 
make and now he is faced with a tough one.  He is being called 
out by his friends as well as by his opponents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think that the choices are tough at all.  In 
fact last year we had the second largest reduction in the EI 
premiums in the history of the country, tax cuts for 83% of 
Canadians, $1.5 billion going back into the CHST and the 
elimination of the deficit.

Alaskans and their failure to abide by the Pacific salmon treaty 
is a matter of concern that has been raised by my colleague the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs with his counterpart, by myself with 
my American counterpart as well as governors of the states of 
Washington, Oregon and Alaska, and in addition by the Prime 
Minister with the President of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member forgets is that the United States is bound 
by a constitution whereby states have certain rights and the 
federal government in some areas cannot intervene any more than 
we in this House can tell a province what to put into their

that.  They cannot interfere in a state jurisdiction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

as just a concern and keeping it on the backbenches is the reason 
this is such a problem today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask once again.  The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans may 
be the minister of oceans in the near future.  He has the 
Strangway report.  He has the facts.  Will he today put the

instead of the back burner?

We have had it on the front burner in discussions between the 
United States federal government, the Canadian federal 
government, the Prime Minister and the President.  If the hon. 
member insists upon forgetting or overlooking that the Americans 
are bound by a constitution and that that constitution gives 
certain powers to the states, he will continue to misunderstand 
the difficulties we face on this file.

for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned that Pakistan has just detonated five nuclear

has a long-range missile, equipped with a nuclear warhead.

<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are attempting through every possible diplomatic channel to

</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, the conflict in Kashmir is a very longstanding one 
and apparently very difficult to resolve.  We are using all 
possible means to persuade them not to go to war.  It is very 
regrettable that, in their mutual posturing, they have decided 
to develop nuclear weapons.  This is completely regrettable.  We 
said so in Birmingham and we are saying it again in the House

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the sanctions

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this failure and, setting aside the fact that the 
situation is to be regretted as the Prime Minister says, I would

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that Canada has set a good example.  We were among the 
first countries to withdraw our support in certain areas, to 
recall our ambassadors, to take other concrete measures to show 
these two countries that embarking on this course was not only 
completely disastrous for them, but that, from an economic

this government says it wants to help students find summer 
employment but it seems this commitment depends on which riding 
the students live in.  For instance, students living in the

much funding as students living in my riding. Students living in 
the riding of the solicitor general receive three times as much

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA GRAIN ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK231">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-26, an 
act to amend the Canada Grain Act and the Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act and to repeal the 
Grain Futures Act, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak at third reading of Bill 
C-26.  This government has defeated a number of amendments to 
Bill C-26 that would have made it much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments which were put forward by the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris took into account an important aspect of the bill 
that is clearly absent.  The majority of the stakeholders who 
appeared before the standing committee on agriculture wanted the 
specialty crops insurance program to be voluntary.  The 
amendments that my party put forward spoke to this aspect and the 
government did not address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A resolution was passed at the Saskatchewan Canola Growers 
Association annual meeting and similar motions were passed at the 
Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association convention, the 
Western Canadian Barley Growers Association convention and by the 
Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Development Board.  The motion reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the majority of Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association 
members also are growers of specialty crops, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the proposed Special Crops Rural Initiative Program 
would appear to favour the Canadian Grain Commission and not 
necessarily special crop growers, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Special Crops Rural Initiative Program is promoted 
as being voluntary, it is in reality a form of negative billing 
which all consumers reject—, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the scheme has questionable support at the farm level, 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association rejects the 
compulsory nature of the Special Crops Rural Initiative Program, 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the special crops Industry has flourished without such a 
program, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore be it resolved that the Saskatchewan Canola Growers 
Association inform the federal and western provincial ministers 
of agriculture of their concerns and at the very least that the 
Special Crops Rural Initiative Program be truly voluntary at both 
the growers and the special crops dealers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution aptly describes what Bill C-26 has failed to do. 
It fails to give farmers a choice, not unlike what the government 
did with Bill C-4, which failed to give farmers a choice in how 
they would sell their wheat.  The compulsory nature of special 
crops insurance is a form of negative option billing. Today's 
producers run large operations and should not have to apply to 
opt out and then receive their money back if they do not wish to 
participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farming businesses should have the right to decide themselves if 
they want to be bonded or licensed and, if so, to pay the bills 
themselves.  Producers should have the choice to decide for 
themselves that there is too much risk selling to unlicensed 
buyers.  Special crops producers would be better off having a 
choice between selling to large licensed grain dealers and small 
unlicensed grain dealers.  That would make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I must also mention the constructive work that 
was done at the committee level on this legislation.  The 
committee looked at several issues of concern and the government 
introduced several amendments to make this legislation better for 
western Canadian farmers.  The committee members from all parties 
actually supported some of the government amendments.  To the 
surprise of many members on this side of the House, the 
government actually provided some reasonably sound amendments. 
However, Bill C-26 would have been much better for western 
Canadian farmers if government members had voted in favour of the 
PC Party's amendments at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is composed of three parts.  It would first repeal the 
Grain Futures Act. 
In essence, the Grain Futures Act allows for the province of 
Manitoba, through the Manitoba Securities Commission, to regulate 
the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange instead of the federal government 
through its Canadian Grains Commission.  This is related to the 
Manitoba Commodities Futures Act which was enacted by the 
Manitoba government.  This was an idea suggested by the Winnipeg 
Commodity Exchange.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WCE wants to access the hog industry.  Instead of working 
with two separate regulators, the WCE will conduct all of its 
business through the Manitoba Securities Commission.  This is a 
positive change for the agriculture industry and the PC party 
supports this aspect of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it would amend the Canada Grain Act to allow specialty 
crops, for example soybeans, to fall under crop insurance plans. 
This would also permit the separation of licensing and security 
provisions for specialty crops dealers.  This government believes 
that the inability to separate these two activities has been the 
primary problem in developing an insurance plan for the special 
crops industry of western Canada.  By forcing such a separation 
in law and by putting the administration of a voluntary insurance 
plan under the Canada Grain Commission, Bill C-26 would remove 
the onus on special crops dealers to post costly security against 
the possibility of their default in payment to special crops 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Export Development Corporation, CEDC, would be the 
insurer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the government would lead people to believe that the 
insurance plan is voluntary.  There are many people in the 
farming community who are sceptical that this insurance plan is 
voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill would incorporate the Canada Grain Act within 
the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties 
Act, thereby allowing the Canadian Grain Commission to impose 
fines for most violations of the Canada Grain Act and its 
regulations.  This is a positive legislative measure because it 
enables the Canadian Grain Commission to be more flexible and 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that the PC party supports this bill. But 
we could have made this a much better piece of legislation if the 
government had supported the amendments put forward by our party. 
It is our job as legislators to work together in a non-partisan 
way, for the benefit of all Canadians, to try to do what is best 
for all Canadians and, in this instance, what is best for western 
Canadian farmers.  I hope that in the future, and at all times in 
our deliberations in this Chamber and in the committee rooms, we 
try to work together, not against each other, to help all 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, climate change is probably the most 
complex and difficult issue of our times because it requires the 
application of social, economic and environmental policies.  This 
is a classical sustainable development issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our geography, sparse population, climate and distances make for 
a high per capita production of greenhouse gases, second only to 
the United States of America.  However, current federal policies 
require attention because they encourage increased production of 
greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time innovative thinking and policies in Canada have 
come forward mainly from municipalities.  For example, members of 
the 20% club are municipalities that have committed to reduce 
their 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emission by the year 2000. 
Members of this club include the cities of Ottawa, Toronto, 
Vancouver, Regina, Edmonton and 32 other municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be stressed that the issue is not new to us in Canada. A 
delegation of the Canadian government participated in climate 
change conferences in 1991 in Geneva, in 1995 in Berlin and long 
before Kyoto.  It might be useful to remember also that in 
Toronto the 1986 conference on energy and climate produced a 
resolution by the scientific community at that time to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new issue and the political commitments to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions soon followed.  The Liberal Party made a 
commitment in the 1988 election platform and again in the 1993 
election platform to reduce emissions by 20% by the year 2005 
based on 1988 emissions at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, having committed at Kyoto to reductions of 60% below 
current levels by the year 2010 when we are already 13% above 
those levels, we must honestly recognize that we are five years 
and 19% behind in terms of having to catch up.  Nevertheless, as 
if nothing had been said so far, we seem to be blissfully 
continuing with policies which compound rather than resolve the 
problem.  I will provide some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Minister of Finance introduced a special tax 
concession for the oil sands industry, an industry which produces 
several times the amount of greenhouse gases produced from 
conventional oil extraction.  This tax concession, in addition to 
making the task of reducing emissions more difficult, may cost 
Canadian taxpayers up to $800 million in forgone revenue.  How 
can we successfully achieve the Kyoto goals with this kind of 
perverse tax incentive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is that Canadians who use urban transit 
regularly need recognition.  The Minister of Finance seems 
unaware of the importance of making employer provided monthly 
transit passes a tax free benefit.  On the other hand a tax free 
status is provided to those who provide their employees with 
monthly parking permits.  On this subject the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities has asked for this concession every year 
since 1990 without result so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the embarrassing sight of landfills producing 
methane and other gases at present being flared off into the 
atmosphere and increasing greenhouse gas emissions rather than 
their being captured and converted to energy.  The municipalities 
need assistance from federal and provincial governments to 
capture these gases, to redirect them to district heating systems 
and at the same time to lower these emissions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it easier for Canada to achieve the Kyoto objective, we 
therefore need something that could be called a Canadian 
atmospheric fund.  It would be patterned on the Toronto 
atmospheric fund established in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian atmospheric fund needs start-up capital.  In the 
case of Canada, it could easily require $300 million, which would 
be used for loans to projects such as landfill gas initiatives. 
The interest earned on loans and other investments can then be 
recirculated to other worthy projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Toronto the fund has grown by over 100% since 1992, making it 
almost certain that Toronto will meet its 20% goal by the year 
2000.  This is a remarkable achievement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of railways, the Minister of Transport is currently 
presiding over the closure of railway lines all over the 
prairies.  Grain elevators are being served more and more by 
diesel trucks emitting four times as many greenhouse gases as 
trains do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally it must be also noted that in Canada the use of 
diesel trucks increased by 30% between 1990 and 1995.  Obviously 
the policy of closing railway lines ought to be reversed if we 
are serious about Kyoto.  This will certainly cause a major and 
difficult problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, fleet performance is a low priority in the 
Department of Transport.  There seems to be no visible action yet 
to provide impetus and incentives to the automotive industry to 
produce lower consumption vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no progressive taxation of gas guzzlers in order to 
register a clear message with consumers.  There are no mandatory 
fuel economy standards.  In short, there is very little to write 
home about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years it has become evident that natural gas will be 
the answer.  We have plenty of it and we need a gradual 
conversion to natural gas and away from the other fossil fuels 
which produce much more greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in the light of this, Alberta could be the great 
winner in the race toward reduction of greenhouse gases, provided 
of course that Alberta legislators take a leadership role rather 
than wait as it seems to be doing now for the electorate to give 
it the green light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may recall that at the time of the oil shock we 
discovered something we have since forgotten.  Let me cover this 
aspect for a moment, namely the value of conservation and 
efficiency through building insulation and through retrofitting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successful programs were launched in the late 1970s and early 
1980s to encourage Canadians to insulate their homes, to switch 
from gasoline to propane powered engines and to engage in all 
forms of energy conservation.  These programs unfortunately were 
discontinued during the Mulroney years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we come to the never ending saga of renewable energy 
sources, the poor cousins of non-renewable sources.  Since 1985 
the proponents of renewable energies have asked successive 
finance ministers that a level playing field treatment be given 
to them, that they be given the same preferential treatment given 
to petroleum and other fossil fuel industries. This area requires 
particular attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A word or two now about the recently created climate change 
secretariat, which is definitely a step in the right direction 
and a good measure.  It is supposed to deliver the Kyoto 
commitment through the combined efforts of two departments, 
natural resources and environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important as they are, these two departments alone cannot 
deliver the required results.  The secretariat has to pull in 
other key departments:  finance, transport, public works, 
agriculture and industry.  The secretariat needs to develop an 
integrated effort with all these departments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is because the transport sector alone is responsible 
for almost one-third of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.  Why 
again?  It is because the Department of Finance is responsible 
for the perverse and, if it is willing, beneficial tax subsidies 
it can introduce.  In other words, the scope and authority of the 
proposed and now in place secretariat need to be expanded and 
reinforced if it is to accomplish its difficult task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding I will say a few words about being seduced by 
promises of reductions through emissions trading or joint 
implementations and other clever mechanisms meant to make Canada 
and other countries look good on paper without delivering real 
substantive reductions; in other words hot air as some people 
call it in the climate change world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are at least four requirements that I submit would be 
meaningful and useful in connection with emission trading. First, 
an emission trading system must be accompanied by a cap on total 
emissions.  Trading without a cap does not produce the desired 
results.  If we are to reduce greenhouse gases the cap must be 
moved downward as time progresses.  Second, reductions must be 
real and not merely reductions on paper.  Third, reduction must 
be quantifiable and verifiable.  Fourth, the system must be 
enforceable.  If reductions are not met then there must be 
meaningful sanctions such as progressive fines that increase for 
every tonne of emissions above the agreed upon level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joint implementation—and I hate to use this technical word but 
it is inevitable in the climate change business—is usually 
understood to mean claiming credit in one country for reductions 
achieved abroad.  There are limits to its value.  Taking credit 
for reductions in other countries is not a substitute for 
reductions in Canada, for instance.  The use of Canadian 
technology and innovations to achieve reductions in developing 
countries is a very useful endeavour.  I do not deny that at all. 
However taking credit for reductions abroad should not prevent us 
from taking substantive action in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context it is important to note that when questioned 
about the merits of joint implementation in the emissions credit 
the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development 
said this week that it will take a long time before credits and 
joint implementation can be part of an overall plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we have already waited a long time. That is why 
we will likely fail to meet our commitments made before Kyoto and 
if we are to meet our Kyoto commitments we must act very soon. 
There are reasons why at present we produce such a high quantity 
of greenhouse gases.  I indicated them at the beginning of this 
intervention, but now we have to change our ways and our 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto commitment could benefit our economy to a considerable 
extent because it would force us to use energy in a judicious and 
more efficient manner, removing unnecessary and costly tax 
concessions.  It will also force us to concentrate efforts on the 
production of energy via renewable resources in the long term and 
a shift to natural gas, of which we have plenty.  In the process 
I am sure we will become more competitive in our economy and we 
will earn the respect of the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to pull our weight.  We have agreed to do that. 
Therefore we have to come to grips with the root causes of 
climate change and launch probably one of the most exciting and 
difficult plans that the Government of Canada has ever come 
across since its inception.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the motion put forward by the member for Davenport 
proposes that the government should, as part of a global effort 
to minimize climate change, develop a strategy for reducing 
carbon dioxide emissions in Canada possibly by 20% based on 1988 
levels by the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This target is far more ambitious than the target agreed to by 
this government last December in Kyoto when an internationally 
binding agreement was signed to reduce Canada's emission levels 
by 19% by the year 2012. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that we in the House are debating this motion in 
the same week that the standing committee on environment, which 
the member for Davenport chairs, has tabled a damning report on 
the environment department's enforcement of its Environmental 
Protection Act.  It is also the same week that the commissioner 
on the environment has tabled his report on the environment that 
essentially gives this government an <I>F</I> on its ability to 
manage our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The target set by this motion is highly unrealistic given that 
the commissioner on the environment just reported that he does 
not believe it is possible for Canada to reach the goals 
established at Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timeline for this motion, approximately 20% emission 
reduction by the year 2000, is clearly unrealistic.  The 
environment minister probably will not have a strategy in place 
by the end of 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly a lot of work needs to be done before this government 
is capable of sorting out the details that must be considered 
before it can get close to devising any sort of strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my serious concerns that this government fails to 
recognize and which is missing in this motion is the other 
players, the provinces, industry and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government cannot unilaterally establish a target.  It must work 
with the provinces.  It is not enough to just consult with 
Canadians.  It is absolutely essential that government work in 
co-operation with the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has clearly taken the position, before and during the 
negotiations at Kyoto, that the federal government work with the 
provinces to set a mutually agreed on target.  That was the 
purpose of the Regina accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November federal and provincial governments met and 
established a joint position on emissions and reductions.  They 
agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the 
year 2010.  Yet a month later the government singlehandedly 
overturned the Regina position when the Prime Minister announced 
his own target of 3% below 1990 levels by 2010. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was more concerned with beating the Americans 
than with setting realistic, acceptable standards for Canada. 
Surely Canada's interests deserve more consideration than this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appeared there was no other rationale behind these randomly 
chosen targets.  No wonder the provinces were up in arms. These 
targets clearly placed Canada in a bad negotiating position when 
it went to the table in Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, this government came out of Kyoto with a 
deal that was even worse.  Without the support of the provinces, 
the Liberals agreed in Kyoto to a reduction of 6% below 1990 
levels, which means a 19% reduction in only 10 years.  This was 
not a national position but a federal government initiative. That 
is why to date the Liberals have failed to gain the co-operation 
of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Liberals fail to recognize is that responding to 
climate change is an area of shared jurisdiction.  Under the 
Constitution Act of 1867 there is no explicit mention of the 
environment and the division of federal and provincial powers. 
The provinces have jurisdiction over their natural resources, 
including energy production.  They have control over power 
generation, building codes and transportation. The federal 
government has jurisdiction over transboundary air pollution. 
Therefore responsibilities for taking action and for developing 
public policies to address issues such as climate change are 
shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as we noted in the House time and time again and 
as the commissioner of the environment pointed out again this 
week in his report, the Liberal government refuses to work with 
the provinces.  There are no clear and transparent agreements 
between governments that specifically define their respective 
roles and responsibilities in achieving the stabilization goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, federal roles and responsibilities have not 
been made clear.  Leadership has been split between the natural 
resources and environment departments but nobody seems to know 
who is in charge.  On one hand, the Liberals want to have the 
lead role in climate change but on the other hand, they refuse to 
hold themselves accountable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the environment commissioner, the federal 
government has failed to devise an acceptable means by which it 
can be held accountable for its leadership on the climate change 
issue and for federal participation in implementing Canada's 
national action program on climate change, the NAPCC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is there an absolute lack of accountability with this 
government, there is also a vacuum of information.  According to 
the environment commissioner, there is no written plan to 
implement the strategic direction of the national action program 
on climate change.  The national action program on climate change 
is silent on the regime to measure and monitor results.  There is 
no information on the results achieved from government actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clear and concrete performance expectations have generally not 
been established.  Implementation milestones and interim targets 
have not been defined. Before we devise a strategy as proposed by 
Motion 38, we must understand the implications and costs of the 
deal.  This should have been done before Canada signed the Kyoto 
agreement.  Yet six months after Canada has committed itself to 
legally binding emissions reductions, this government is still 
unable to give Canadians an estimate on the cost of living up to 
these obligations.  The only studies that have been available are 
from external sources.  These are the only studies that 
department officials have been able to refer to and they show the 
cost would be enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a study prepared by the Business Council on 
National Issues, achieving the Kyoto target levels would require 
one of the following measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have to remove all Canadian cars and light trucks from 
the road or we would have to remove 90% of commercial trucks and 
air, railway and marine transportation, or Canada would have to 
eliminate heating of all homes, all commercial buildings and all 
national gas distribution, or Canada would have to shut down 
three quarters of its fossil fuel power generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are examples of the magnitude of the deal signed at Kyoto. 
The Kyoto agreement could cost billions to Canadians.  Clearly 
governments need additional information on the costs and benefits 
of inaction as well as the costs and benefits of action.  Such 
information is needed to make a sound cost-benefit decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet a 1996 review of the NAPCC reported that little or no work 
was under way in Canada to assess the economic implications of 
inaction.  Canada must be a leader in setting high environmental 
standards while maintaining a global competitive position and 
good economic performance.  In addressing emissions reductions 
nationally, the needs of both industry and the environment must 
be balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's economic interests must be protected.  Yet the only way 
to protect Canada's economic interests is to ensure that 
internationally we have a level playing field.  Developing 
nations must be an integral part of the solution.  Canada has 
already achieved 80% of its goals in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.  Most of the growth in greenhouse gas emissions is 
expected to come from developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries such as China and India will be the world's largest 
emitters of greenhouse gases by early next century.  However, 
developing countries do not have to participate in reductions and 
they did not sign the agreement in Kyoto.  The possibility of 
climate change is a global issue and it must be addressed 
collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing countries are responsible for 40% of the world's 
emissions.  Canada is only responsible for 2%.  In the next 15 
years it is estimated developing countries will be responsible 
for 60% of the world's emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American government is taking the position that it will not 
participate in an agreement unless the developing countries sign 
on.  The provinces have agreed Canada should not sign unless 75% 
of the countries responsible for greenhouse gas emissions sign 
on.  If developing countries are not part of the discussion about 
climate change and rising greenhouse gas emissions, there will 
not be a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any proposed goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions will not 
be achieved without their participation.  Before Canada ratifies 
any agreement, both developed and developing countries must 
participate equally in the protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that any commitments made are in Canada's 
interests and recognize Canada's unique circumstances.  A 
national consensus should be gained before international 
commitments are made.  Any greenhouse gas emission targets must 
be realistic, achievable and based on sound scientific evidence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak today on an issue of paramount importance. The 
hon. member for Davenport is giving us an opportunity to address 
the important issue of climate change and this government's 
inability to develop a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall take a moment to read this very interesting motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, as 
part of a global effort to minimize climate change, develop a 
strategy for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in Canada 
possibly by 20%, based on 1998 levels, by the year 2005. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go over the key elements of this motion: global effort, 
strategy and 20% reduction. These are the elements I will 
address today in the time allocated to me to speak on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall focus first on the global reduction effort referred to 
in today's motion. 
This is an important point because Canada has traditionally been 
a world leader in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
but that was before the Liberals took office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a look back at the 1992 conference in Rio, we can see 
that Canada was then actively involved in safeguarding our 
environment. Canada was in fact the first of more than 150 
nations to sign the framework agreement. It worked hard on 
bringing these nations to join forces in fighting greenhouse 
gases. In those days, Canada took a leadership role on the 
international scene, encouraging other nations to act 
responsibly and take positive measures to counter climatic 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, one year later, the world lost a key player after 
the Liberal Party came to power in Canada. 
That party made Canada go from the position of world leader on 
the environment to that of a burden for the international 
community, and this is no exaggeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Canada is the world's second largest per capita polluter, 
in terms of greenhouse gases. As such, it cannot act as if it is 
not concerned by the issue. The Liberals came to office in 1993, 
one year after the signing of the international agreement in 
Rio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the situation now, after five years of Liberal 
government? We produce 9% more greenhouse gases than we did in 
1990. If the pattern is maintained, the Liberal Party will lead 
us to a 13% increase by the year 2000, while the Rio accord 
provided that emissions should be stabilized, which means a 0% 
increase. The Liberal Party has totally ignored Canada's 
international commitment to reduce greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is more. The list of this government's environmental 
failures at the international level continues. As we know, the 
all important Kyoto negotiations took place last year. Once 
again, countries from all over the world got together to agree 
on targets for reducing greenhouse gases. The issue was very 
important, because this time the parties were trying to agree on 
objectives that would include legal obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at Canada's role in these negotiations. 
First, while the governments of most developed countries were 
holding national debates on the issue of climatic changes in the 
year preceding the Kyoto summit, the federal government merely 
watched the train go by without worrying about anything. After 
discussing these issues internally, the G-7 members began to 
adopt a position on the international scene. 
In other words, these countries were already beginning to 
negotiate at the international level a position with which they 
would be comfortable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the Government of Canada? What was the position of the 
country that played a leading role in 1992? No one could tell. 
In fact, the Canadian government dragged its feet to the point 
of being the last G-7 member to present a bargaining position. 
While other countries were openly negotiating at the 
international level, the Liberal cabinet kept wondering what 
position to adopt. Some leadership.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has, of course, done everything in its 
power to cover up the amateur and incompetent way it has handled 
this.  It has, for example, tried to justify its immobility by 
invoking the need to consult the provinces.  Who could be 
opposed to consultation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem here is that the federal government woke up a month 
before the Kyoto deadline, when it finally got around to calling 
together the provincial ministers of environment and natural 
resources at Regina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not point out that these negotiations had been so well 
prepared by this government that they ended up in a disagreement 
between Quebec and the Canadian provinces.  The provinces did, 
however, manage to reach agreement on a minimum position for 
reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A month later, the very day they were leaving for Kyoto, the 
Canadian ministers of the environment and natural resources 
finally made public a negotiating position, a 3% reduction. 
Because they were the last to do so on the international scene, 
one would assume that this position was at least the object of 
consensus within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this was not the case.  The Canadian position was 
denounced immediately by the provinces, which had agreed to a 
different objective just the month before. In short, the federal 
government did not play a leadership role on either the national 
or the international level.  In both cases it failed miserably 
at getting its vision across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the reference to the world-wide effort in the motion 
of the hon. member for Davenport is so important here. 
While it did not commit to reduce gas emissions to the same 
extent as the United States, France, Germany or England, Canada 
must at least take steps to honour its commitment. To this end, 
the government must implement a strategy, and this is the second 
topic I want to address today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strategy is too strong a word to describe the Liberal 
government's action in connection with climate change. In fact, 
unless the Liberals had actually planned for their reduction 
effort to fail, it would be more appropriate to talk about 
Liberal ad-libbing. I am not the only one to say this, as the 
sponsor of today's motion knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development tabled a report in which it makes 
caustic comments on the current government. 
It explains clearly why the federal Department of the 
Environment is presently unable to protect public health and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, two serious problems are undermining the 
department's very credibility as far as meeting any 
environmental challenge is concerned:  the chronic lack of 
resources and the possibility of unacceptable interference by 
senior management in the decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were astonished to learn, for instance, that only half of the 
regulations for which the federal government is responsible in 
Quebec will be implemented in 1998-99, for lack of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, employees told of several cases of undue 
interference on the part of senior management in the past. 
During the standing committee's hearings, one manager even 
refused to answer our questions on this issue, for fear of 
reprisals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has been aware of this situation since at 
least 1995. 
Why did it not change the decision structure which continues to 
favour such interference? In this case, as in the case of 
climactic change, there is a flagrant lack of political will on 
the part of the Liberal government to protect the environment 
and honour international commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to paralysing the Department of the Environment 
through draconian cuts, the Liberal government has not 
established who would be directing federal efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gases.  I refer to the report by the Commissioner of 
the Environment and Sustainable Development.  He pointed clearly 
to federal improvisation in the reduction of toxic gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I support the motion of the member for Davenport 
and I wish that his government would read it and take note as 
soon as possible. 
I have my doubts, however, because the motion repeats verbatim a 
promise in the 1993 red book.  Up to now, the Liberal Party has 
forgotten anything in the red book more often than not, now that 
it is in power.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am speaking on Motion No. M-38 submitted by the hon. member for 
Davenport, that in the opinion of the House the government should 
as part of a global effort to minimize climate change, develop a 
strategy in reducing carbon dioxide emissions in Canada possibly 
by 20% based on 1988 levels by the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my hon. colleague for his efforts to bring this debate 
to the House.  It is very timely.  Next week delegations from 
Canada and throughout the world will be gathering in Bonn, 
Germany in preparation for the Argentina talks that will take 
place in Buenos Aries in November.  COP-4, as it will be deemed 
in Argentina, will decide on many of the major initiatives the 
nation states of this world can make toward reducing greenhouse 
gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the New Democratic Party representative on the standing 
committee, it has been an honour for me to participate with the 
hon. member who serves as chair in the dialogue on greenhouse 
gases.  The committee set out directions for our negotiators in 
Kyoto to emphasize a solid foundation for long term emissions 
reduction and to initiate public education and engagement in 
activities by the public, research and development, science and 
technology, and to make sure there is cost efficiency when 
dealing with emissions trading or joint implementation, that it 
is not just window dressing for greenhouse gases for industries 
to buy their way out of trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major issue is that we need quick start initiatives 
immediately.  That was also a contention of the environment 
commissioner.  Those have not started at all.  There could be 
cost shared basis projects, pilot projects for communities and 
municipalities, major research projects with industries and 
institutions of higher learning and engaging with developing 
countries on joint implementation issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two major topics were a challenge and a major test for 
this government.  My hon. colleague mentioned that his party 
platform was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%.  I 
believe the Progressive Conservatives took that position.  The 
Bloc advocates major reduction targets of up to 20%.  The New 
Democratic Party advocates a 20% reduction target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only party that still will not take this test is the Reform 
Party.  It will still not admit that greenhouse gases will have a 
major impact on our society, our world and our way of life. Its 
bottom line is still dollars, what it will cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have to acknowledge that there will be costs. 
There will be a cost for the impacts associated with addressing 
the greenhouse gas emissions issue.  But the issue is one of 
transitional measures. The provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Ontario and Nova Scotia have been dragging their feet in coming 
alongside this because an industrial transition is involved here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians and as citizens of the world we should take this 
challenge.  In the test we have gone through this week, the 
environment department is a battered department.  It should be 
taking the lead.  A secretariat for dealing with climate change 
was recently established and two ministers were appointed as its 
co-leaders.  Only one minister should take the lead on this issue 
for Canada.  It is a sad fact that we should take on ourselves 
collectively as Canadians and as a government.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we target to 2005 the 20% reduction, that is a major 
reduction within seven years.  In seven years there is a 
measurable target we can take.  In that measurable time we should 
be bringing on our youth, our children, the future generations, 
the people of the new millennium, the people we are going to 
leave our state of the nation with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have our young people out there, empower them to be a 
conscience to our way of life.  Why are they not knocking on the 
Bank of Canada's door every night when the Bank of Canada leaves 
its lights on 24 hours?  Why are they not knocking on government 
department doors to be a conscience? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the headlines we read of language officers in the province of 
Quebec being conscious about protecting their language in 
businesses, advertising and with the people of Quebec.  Why could 
we not do that and empower our youth right now who are in dire 
need of employment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do it this summer as a quick start initiative.  We 
could send our youth to senior citizens homes. They could install 
R-40 or R-60 insulation in ceilings, put second and third panes 
on house windows to keep the temperature cool inside in the 
summer and the warm air inside in the winter. Let us do it now. 
Let us empower our children now.  Let us empower our youth.  Let 
us challenge ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us challenge ourselves as the hon. member mentioned and not 
abandon our railroads.  Our railroads are the cleanest form of 
transporting goods in this country.  The railroads were designed 
to unite this country from coast to coast.  There is no northern 
railroad that connects the third coast or along the midportion of 
Canada. It only connects the southern portion. We cannot be 
selfish in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk of the whole issue of sinks in the equation of 
emissions trading, deciding how much our country has created in 
emissions.  We deduct the sinks so our land use policies, our 
reforestation policies have to come into play. We must reforest 
immediately the vast tracts of land which have been left bare. If 
man can cut the trees down, man can grow the trees.  Let us do 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers and our agricultural community do not know the 
impact of what greenhouse gases and the future of the Kyoto 
agreement could have on their industry.  Let us be fair, honest 
and forward and talk in a language that is not beyond anyone's 
terminology. Let us be open with the media.  There should be 
public dialogue. There should be a public exchange.  A 
secretariat should be formed immediately and be open to the 
public. I do not even know where they are on Parliament Hill. 
They have to be active now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made an agreement in Rio de Janeiro that should have been 
started, enacted and completed by the year 2000.  Nothing is 
going to be done about it.  We know we have failed on that 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the Kyoto agreement and take the challenges as the 
hon. member for Davenport has done.  Let us raise the height of 
the bars and improve ourselves and look at the impact.  I 
challenge the Reform members, I challenge the provinces, I 
challenge anyone who questions this issue to look at the impacts 
to the permafrost in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the permafrost falls and the heat rises in the northern 
regions of this country, the permafrost will no longer hold and 
bind the biomass and the soft soils will erode.  As the heat 
rises in the glacial areas in the northern regions, heat deflects 
off of white and when the white glacier melts the heat will be 
attracted to the darker ground and the vegetation under that 
glacial melt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national action program on climate change has to be 
invigorated with a multi-department initiative not only by NRC 
the odd time when it is politically correct. We need the power of 
the Prime Minister behind this whole initiative. As leader of 
this country we need the Prime Minister's office to take a lead 
on this most drastic issue that is going to have an effect 100 to 
150 years from now. We are going to generate a huge impact on our 
grandchildren in a higher climate and a higher economic travesty 
we will not even know.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there is no time to continue and I am only half 
way through my speech.  I put my weight behind the challenge that 
the member for Davenport has stated and and the Kyoto deal that 
this government and all the nations of the world have signed. Let 
us take on the challenge, the transportation challenge, our 
lifestyle challenge and let us empower our youth and create jobs 
by doing it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a privilege to join the dialogue on this motion.  This motion has 
been tabled before the House in the most constructive way in 
order to raise further attention to a very critical issue that 
challenges our country, our economy and the world community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only a few months ago that a number of individuals who 
spoke participated in a take note debate leading up to the 
climate change conference in Kyoto.  During that debate we had 
the honour to listen a number of individuals who have a very 
sincere interest in protecting our environment.  I was very 
pleased to have had the opportunity to listen to a former 
environment minister, the hon. Jean Charest, who participated in 
that debate.  He contributed to the world community with respect 
to climate change and played a role in Rio.  I was very honoured 
to be a member of his team during that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also very honoured to listen to other individuals, in 
particular the member for Davenport.  He is definitely a well 
respected environmental crusader.  Ultimately he deserves a fair 
amount of credit with respect to initiatives on the environment 
that may come to fruition and an increase in budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of why this creates so much topic these days, when we 
look at it from our country's perspective, is that perhaps no 
country lives off its environment or natural resources more than 
we do.  Whether it be our industries of pulp and paper, mining 
and other resource industries, a fair amount of our economy 
relies on living off our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that drives our economy is export.  A high 
proportion of our gross domestic product is exported.  We 
currently export over $210 billion each year to the United 
States. Later on I will explain how that comes into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we are talking about is why is climate change an issue 
in the first place. I would like to read the second paragraph of 
a press release tabled by the commissioner for the environment 
earlier this week: “Climate change is perhaps the most difficult 
of all environmental problems facing governments around the 
world.  Possible long term affects such as drier summers in the 
prairies, increases in forest fires and insect infestations, 
coastal flooding and more frequent extreme weather events could 
be devastating for Canada and all Canadians”. These are some of 
the effects of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I am very sad to point out, reading from section 3.28 
of the auditor general's report, is that there is still one 
political party in this House that denounces the signs on climate 
change.  It is too bad the member for Calgary Southwest is not 
here to listen to this debate.  I can assure members he has an 
awful lot to learn when it comes to scientific evidence with 
respect to this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read from the IPCC report issued in 1995.  The international 
community of esteemed scientists throughout the world clearly 
stated that the balance and evidence suggests that there is a 
discernible human influence on global climate change.  The 
science on climate change is from a practical perspective beyond 
dispute.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as parliamentarians have really failed in the last number of 
months with respect to this issue. We focused a lot on targets 
and timelines.  To some degree this motion focuses on 
that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe Canadians, we owe the environmental community, we owe the 
global community more of a contribution on how we get the job 
done as opposed to focusing more on mere targets and timelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Targets and timelines are necessary from the standpoint of what 
gets measured gets done.  We need to start addressing some of the 
issues that are most important.  Any decision made by government 
with respect to the environment I believe should follow three 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be based on science.  In this case it is.  It is the 
government's role to actually enhance it.  Therefore it must be 
enhanced by government and it must be anchored in society's will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada and the governments of the provinces 
and industry have a moral obligation to ensure the Canadian 
population is engaged in this very serious and real issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should focus immediately on true quick start initiatives in 
terms of providing industry with aggressive tax incentives with 
respect to research and development on energy efficiency 
initiatives, with aggressive tax incentives for industry and for 
private citizens for the use of renewable energies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have research and development of an aggressive nature 
with respect to energy efficiency initiatives.  Those three 
things we should really focus on right from the start. We should 
move in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at some of these no regrets philosophies in terms of what 
we should be doing ultimately.  For other reasons from a 
transportation perspective, and the member for Davenport talked 
about this, why would we not want to provide tax incentives for 
the use of public transportation passes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many gains in terms of what would benefit our 
economy.  I clearly support that initiative and I assure members 
I will be talking to our finance critic on that issue to make 
sure he is on side as well.  I am sure the member for 
Davenport will be working on his finance minister on that topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this becomes a very important issue for us as a country is 
that we trade $200 billion to $210 billion each year with the 
Americans.  Our ability to compete on the world stage relies on 
our ability to actually trade and compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have pledged to spend as much as $7.4 billion U.S. 
on energy efficiency initiatives, on the use of renewable energy 
sources.  When Americans do something they usually do it quite 
well. If they are to engage in making their industries that much 
more energy efficient, that much more cost competitive, if Canada 
does not have similar initiatives within our economy led by the 
Minister of Finance that will have very negative implications on 
our country's competitiveness because our industries simply will 
not be able to compete in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this requires is prime ministerial leadership like we saw 
with respect to the earth summit with former Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney and former environment minister Jean Charest.  We need 
that kind of involvement as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we know this is a very daunting task, we have been 
challenged like this before.  I refer to the issue of acid rain. 
Initially industry said it would be economic armageddon if we had 
to change the way we operate our industries.  The bottom line was 
that a lot of those industries were actually able to be that much 
more energy efficient and that much more cost effective by 
actually changing the processes in terms of how they operate. 
Acid rain is an example that we can look at and say this issue 
can actually be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance loves to talk about our record. I love 
to talk about our environmental record. 
I am sad that the Minister of Finance does not have the 
opportunity to actually listen to these comments.

when they brought in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of things I like to look back on at our 
environmental record.  I want to work in the most non-partisan 
fashion possible so we can address this very serious issue of 
climate change.  I applaud the member for Davenport for 
continuing to add to this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, let 
me very quickly thank all the participants in this debate for 
their comments and in some cases their suggestions. I thank the 
members for Rosemont, Churchill River and Fundy—Royal for their 
intense and active co-operation in committee where we work 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saskatoon—Humboldt made an interesting point 
which I agree with that there has to be in achieving the Kyoto 
goal very a intensive form of co-operation with the provinces, 
the municipalities and the private sector.  He found the motion 
before us today ambitious or a bit too strong, but it was written 
three months before Kyoto.  As it stands now, six months later it 
is only 1% of the mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to aim high in order to achieve the Kyoto commitment 
five years after the year 2005.  As to his reference to the BCNI 
paper one can only say that it is shortsighted and ill informed, 
bordering on lunacy, intent only on fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with him when he emphasized that a national commitment 
is needed.  We now have a national commitment. As indicated by 
the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of National 
Resources, it has been achieved well after the meeting in Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately during his 10 minutes the member for Rosemont 
engaged in partisan politics at great length.  He gave us an 
historic overview as seen from the opposition benches month by 
month in very precise chronology.  It was basically a partisan 
attack on federalism intended to prove that federalism does not 
work, which of course is something that we do not and cannot 
agree with. There are faults and shortcomings, that is true, but 
on the whole for a country of the size of Canada if we did not 
have federalism we would have to invent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to another debate when the member for Rosemont 
will give us the benefit of his ideas on how to tackle climate 
change and the ideas of his party.  I am sure he has some very 
valuable and interesting ideas to put forward which we have been 
deprived of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Churchill River made a very constructive 
intervention.  He referred to the Bonn meeting, which is a good 
reminder.  He spoke about transitional measures, a very 
interesting concept.  He spoke about the new millennium people 
which I find a very interesting aspect of this issue because it 
is a long term intergenerational issue.  There is a lot of 
potential in what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also made an interesting reference to buildings which are lit 
up all night, which is a luxury that we should do without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by thanking the member for Fundy—Royal.  He spoke 
about the three principles, which are very good, and the 
importance of becoming more effective in energy production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to achieve the Kyoto goals we have to have a very 
strong secretariat and very strong political leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired 
and the order is dropped from the order paper.
