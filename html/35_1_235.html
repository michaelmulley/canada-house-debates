	The House resumed from June 6 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-277, an act to amend the Criminal Code (genital mutilation 
of female persons), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-277 is technically an amendment to the 
Criminal Code of Canada dealing with the subject of female genital 
mutilation. This issue raises a wide variety of concerns: legal, 
medical, immigration and multicultural. All of these issues must be 
addressed when dealing with Bill C-277.
<P>
	The most important issue the bill raises is that of clashing 
cultural values. How tolerant is a multicultural country like Canada 
supposed to be in accepting the cultural values of immigrants? As a 
general rule, Canada has been one of the most tolerant nations in 
accepting and encouraging differing value systems.
<P>
	However, this acceptance has not and cannot be absolute. For 
example, Canada has not accepted polygamy as an acceptable way 
of life, even though it is common practice in many nations. Some 
might argue our refusal to accept polygamy is discriminatory. My 
response to such criticism is simple. If you do not like the rules we 
play by in Canada, do not come to our country.
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of immigrants and refugees come to our 
nation every year to start a new and better life, but when they come 
to our country they agree to play by our rules. Our rules say one 
cannot have more than one spouse and, more important, that one 
does not mutilate little girls. Female circumcision is just that, 
mutilation.
<P>
	There is no religion in the world that prescribes female 
circumcision as part of its doctrine. It is rather a cultural tradition 
in some countries in northern and eastern Africa. Because Canada 
accepts immigrants from all over  the world, it is an issue that now 
is a concern for Canadian law makers.
<P>
	During the first hour of debate on this bill, members from all 
parties provided examples of why this is an issue in Canada. While 
I will not repeat the examples, suffice it to say there appears to be a 
body of evidence that female genital mutilation is taking place in 
Canada today. While there appears to be a fairly substantial body of 
evidence that female genital mutilation is occurring in Canada, 
there has never been a prosecution of anyone involved in such a 
procedure. Why?
<P>
	The bill presented to the House by my colleague from Quebec 
would make anyone who commits genital mutilation guilty of an 
indictable offence. As well, anyone who aids, abets, counsels or 
procures the performance of female genital mutilation would be 
similarly guilty of an indictable offence.
<P>
	The members from the government who spoke on the bill believe 
more counselling is needed and if criminal charges are necessary 
they can be covered by existing legislation.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	What better way of counselling anyone who comes from a 
culture that practises female genital mutilation than by having a 
section in the Criminal Code by which if anyone commits female 
genital mutilation or even aids, abets, counsels or procures such an 
act he or she is guilty of a serious crime?
<P>
	If we are serious about eliminating this practice that is the 
message we should be sending to these communities. I ask the 
government members who say current legislation already covers 
this act why there has never been a prosecution of such an act in 
Canada. If there ever is a prosecution under the assault causing 
bodily harm provisions of the Criminal Code, the defence would be 
arguing there never was any criminal intent to cause bodily harm.
<P>
	By making this a specific offence, as laid out in Bill C-277, all 
the crown would have to prove is that those charged knowingly 
participated in female genital mutilation.
<P>
	I have to agree with the members for Calgary Southeast and 
Bellechasse who called for an increased maximum sentence. If, as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15074"> 15074 </A></B>
<P>
Liberal members suggest, charges could be laid under the assault 
causing bodily harm provisions of the code, the maximum penalty 
for  committing this specific crime of female genital mutilation 
should be the same as the 10-year maximum that exists for assault 
causing bodily harm.
<P>
	Let us not make any bones about it, female genital mutilation is a 
serious offence committed against young girls in the 10 to 12-year 
range. It is, in effect, extreme child abuse.
<P>
	While I am generally reluctant to give the provincial legislatures 
any advice on how to run their affairs, I will make an exception 
here. I strongly believe that once Parliament passes Bill C-277 or 
similar legislation the provinces should make amendments to their 
child protection acts. These amendments should make the reporting 
of female genital mutilation mandatory for those employed in 
health, education and social service professions.
<P>
	It is important the House send a clear and strong message to 
everyone in Canada that anyone involved in the practice of female 
genital mutilation is committing a serious crime. However, I 
believe that before we get to that stage, Bill C-277 should be given 
a complete hearing at the committee stage. I would like someone to 
appear before the justice committee and explain why female 
genital mutilation should not be criminalized. I would like to be 
there and hear somebody attempt to defend this practice. I would 
like to hear someone explain to Canadian parliamentarians why 
such acts should be allowed to continue in Canada.
<P>
	However, I have a sneaking suspicion the committee would be 
unable to find anyone who would publicly justify female genital 
mutilation. How does one possibly defend the indefensible?
<P>
	While I believe the issue should be reviewed by the committee, I 
will not even attempt to give the pretence that my mind can be 
changed. Female genital mutilation is a violent sexual assault 
committed against young children under the pretence of a cultural 
value.
<P>
	Whether it is a traditional culture value is irrelevant. Can anyone 
imagine if descendants of the Aztec or Mayan cultures came to 
Canada and wanted to revive the old cultural tradition of human 
sacrifice? How about the old tradition of 17th century North 
Americans of burning women suspected of being witches at the 
stake? Of course Canadians would never support such things. It is 
outrageous to even think about it, as is the ritualistic, violent sexual 
assault of little girls. Some cultural traditions deserve to be 
extinguished. This is one of them.
<P>
	Bill C-277 is a good step in making sure this practice never gains 
a foothold in our country. By supporting Bill C-277 we send a 
message to those communities that still practise this terrible 
tradition that such acts will not be tolerated in Canada.
<P>
	I am happy I do not share the guilt members opposite seem to be 
racked with when dealing with cross-cultural conflicts. I take pride 
in having this opportunity to  denounce the barbaric act of female 
genital mutilation and I will stand with those members who support 
this legislation at second and third reading.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin by congratulating my colleague, the hon. member for 
Québec, for her courage and tenacity. Courage because she rose to 
demand new legislation on the practice of genital mutilation. 
Tenacity, because she continued to push for her bill despite a 
negative response from the Minister of Justice, since she was 
convinced that it was both appropriate and necessary.
<P>
	I am therefore pleased to speak in this debate in support of Bill 
C-277, since I share the belief of my colleague and the large 
majority of women and men across Canada and in Quebec that the 
current legislation must be clarified and reinforced in order to 
protect women from these barbaric acts.
<P>
	I share her conviction that the Minister of Justice's great sense of 
responsibility will lead him to concur that such a modification to 
the Criminal Code will be beneficial and to revise the decision he 
reached in April 1994.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice's decision not to criminalize excision 
was based on two arguments: charges may be laid against those 
practicing excision under the present provisions of the legislation, 
and the intent is to focus on prevention.
<P>
	I feel that those two arguments are too weak to justify the 
decision not to make any changes to the Criminal Code. I have 
nothing against prevention and information, far from it; one cannot 
be against what is right, but as Machiavelli said many, many years 
ago, virtue alone has no effect on man unless it is reinforced by a 
degree of deterrence.
<P>
	Prevention is fine, but above all specific legislation needs to be 
passed to prohibit the practice of mutilating the genitals of women 
and girls. After all, what is there to prevent after the harm has been 
done?
<P>
	At present, the Criminal Code prohibits anyone from assaulting, 
causing bodily harm to or killing another human being. The 
minister contends that these provisions are enough to prohibit all 
kinds of genital mutilations. I think not, because this legislation is 
too vague and does not deal specifically enough with excision. A 
person who performs or causes this kind of mutilation to be 
performed could use religious and particularly cultural arguments 
to justify this practice. Legislation such as the Canadian 
Multiculturalism Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms require that the various cultures be recognized and 
promoted.
<P>
	It so happens that genital mutilation is a standard in many 
cultures, including Africa and Asia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15075"> 15075 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think we all have to be lawyers to understand that the 
existing legislation is not as efficient as the minister would have 
us believe. Several provisions are likely to discourage a crown 
prosecutor from preferring charges or a judge from convicting to 
the full extent of the law in such instances, however few they may 
be.
<P>
	Education and prevention are fine, but that is just not enough. 
Monitoring needs to be instituted to find, denounce and, more 
importantly, punish offenders for real.
<P>
	Action is required. Existing provisions do not prevent such acts 
from being committed. Also, one can seriously question the 
effectiveness of a prevention policy consisting merely in 
information. The only choice left is for the legislator to make a 
special law to unequivocally criminalize the practice of such 
mutilations.
<P>
	Bill C-277 is not that complex. It does not call for a complete 
overhaul of the system. It is just a few lines long. And let me quote 
the proposed amendment to be added after section 244. It reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A person who:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) excises or otherwise mutilates, in whole or in part, the labia majora, labia 
minora or clitoris of a female person; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) aids, abets, counsels or procures the performance by another person of any 
of the acts described in paragraph (<I>a</I>) is guilty of an indictable offence andliable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	That is all. Two small paragraphs. That is all we need to settle 
this matter once and for all. I do not understand why the minister is 
reluctant to pass a bill that is so short but that would reinforce the 
current Criminal Code and make it much more of a deterrent.
<P>
	Allow me to speak of this issue in a little more detail. According 
to studies published in 1993-94, between 85 million and 114 
million of the women alive at that time had undergone genital 
mutilation.
<P>
	According to some figures, the number of genital mutilation 
cases has increased by 2 million a year in nearly 40 countries in 
Africa, Asia and the Middle East. These procedures are performed 
on girls aged 4 to 10 on average. That is appalling.
<P>
	Although impressive, these figures do not say anything about the 
trauma experienced by these girls, most of whom are quite young. 
They do not say anything about the pain suffered both during and 
after these mutilations or on the health problems many of the 
victims will face for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	Often performed in unsanitary conditions by people without any 
real medical knowledge, these mutilations can have many adverse 
consequences, including haemorrhages, incontinence, abscesses, 
infections, traumas, shock and infertility.
<P>
	Those who perform these procedures use improperly sterilized 
tools, if not plain kitchen knives. According to a document from 
the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women, sugar, 
eggs, thorns and palm ribs are also used.
<P>
	Very painful and often performed without anaesthesia, these 
irreversible procedures often result in traumas as well as sexual and 
psychological complications for the victims.
<P>
	I do not think I need to continue describing this practice to give 
members a good understanding of what we are dealing with.
<P>
	This practice is clearly unacceptable and should never be 
condoned. We must also ensure that those who perform these 
procedures are severely punished. Unfortunately, as I pointed out 
earlier, current legal provisions do not have enough teeth to be 100 
per cent effective. We must ensure that this practice is no longer 
used in our society. The current legislation does not achieve that 
goal; prevention alone is not enough. However, Bill C-277 would 
certainly do it.
<P>
	We could talk for a long time about the benefits and the merits of 
such a bill. But what is important is to understand that, in a country 
that claims to be democratic, these religious, cultural or other 
traditions are indefensible and reprehensible. As a self respecting 
society claiming to protect its individual members, it is immoral to 
condone such shameful atrocities.
<P>
	Yet, and unfortunately so, this is what the Minister of Justice did 
by rejecting the suggestion to amend the Criminal Code so as to 
explicitly prohibit excision.
<P>
	Bill C-277, which was introduced by the hon. member for 
Québec, provides an opportunity to correct the situation, once and 
for all, in a simple and efficient manner. France, Great Britain and 
Sweden have already outlawed that practice, while Norway and 
several American states have strengthened their legislation to that 
effect. The time has come for us to take concrete action. It must be 
made clear to Canadians and those who come to our country that 
genital mutilation is not only unacceptable as a matter of principle, 
but also not accepted and severely punished, since it is in fact a 
crime.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to address the House regarding Bill 
C-277, an act to amend the Criminal Code as it pertains to the 
genital mutilation of female persons, proposed by the hon. member 
for Québec.
<P>
	The bill aims to make persons who perform female genital 
mutilation or who aid, abet, counsel or procure the performance by 
another person of female genital mutilation guilty of an indictable 
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five 
years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15076"> 15076 </A></B>
<P>
	I state from the outset my personal repulsion of this practice. 
It is without a doubt a practice which causes great harm. However, 
we must not allow our disgust with the practice to cloud our 
reasoning about the member's proposed bill as an effective means 
of addressing this problem.
<P>
	As for the cultural practices in other lands it is out of our scope 
to dictate what should or should not be included in their criminal 
codes. Societies practising female genital mutilation will change 
their behaviour only on understanding that the intent behind their 
action can be achieved by other less harmful means.
<P>
	Female genital mutilation is a practice which inflicts harm on an 
estimated 85 million to 115 million girls and women, with about 
two million girls being subjected to this ritual annually worldwide.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the practice can prove very harmful to the 
health of a baby girl and eventually of the woman. There is an 
indisputable medical link between female genital mutilation and a 
myriad of short and long term health consequences. Some have 
already been mentioned such as severe haemorrhaging, shock, 
infections, infertility, urine retention, sexual dysfunction, 
difficulties with child birth and even death.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, this well intentioned bill poses certain 
problems. The Minister of Justice indicated in March he was of the 
opinion that an amendment to the Criminal Code was not necessary 
at this time. The minister informed members of the House that 
there are those who are knowledgeably involved who believe 
amending the Criminal Code at this time could inadvertently drive 
the practice even further underground, and the government agrees. 
Instead the government prefers to engage in a comprehensive 
educational campaign which outlines the health risk of the 
procedure and the criminality of the practice.
<P>
	All hon. members should be made aware the Criminal Code of 
Canada does have a provision which could cover those who 
practice female genital mutilation. Presently sections of the code 
which apply include assault causing bodily harm, section 267, 
unlawfully causing bodily harm, section 269, and aggravated 
assault, section 268, all of which are indictable offences with 
maximum sentences of between 10 and 14 years. Section 268 refers 
to the situation in which a person wounds, maims, disfigures or 
endangers the life of the complainant.
<P>
	There are other sections of the Criminal Code which could be 
used to prosecute either the person performing the procedure or the 
parents for their part in arranging for it to be carried out. Also, a 
recent amendment to the code aims to address situations in which a 
Canadian resident is taken from the country with the purpose of 
committing an act against him or her which would ordinarily be an 
offence if committed in Canada. This section of the code provides 
for a maximum sentence of five years for an indictable offence.
<P>
	Over and above existing Criminal Code provisions, the hon. 
member should know Ontario and Quebec have child protection 
laws which allow for a child to be taken into the custody of the 
province should reasonable suspicion exist that she may be 
subjected to female genital mutilation either in Canada or abroad. 
It is apparent that the Canadian Criminal Code already provides for 
the necessary measures to prosecute those persons perpetrating 
female genital mutilation.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Instead we must concentrate on educating the public but we must 
also educate the police, crown attorneys and the medical 
professions by informing them that female genital mutilation 
constitutes criminal behaviour and as such must be dealt with 
accordingly. We will work together and we must work together 
with the above stakeholders in order to ensure existing laws are 
enforced in this respect.
<P>
	On the practice of female genital mutilation from a global 
perspective, I firmly believe we must not lose sight of the fact that 
denouncing the practice can make some of us feel better and 
self-righteous but certainly does not solve the problem worldwide.
<P>
	The director general to the World Health Organization's global 
commission on women's health indicates that the purpose of the 
organization should not be to criticize and condemn; however, nor 
should we remain passive.
<P>
	We know female genital mutilation is painful and can have dire 
health consequences. However, we must also take into account that 
human behaviours and cultural values, no matter how senseless or 
harmful they appear in light of our personal and cultural 
perspectives, do have a meaning for those who practice them.
<P>
	The key is to convince people they can give up a certain practice 
without compromising the important ideals cherished by their 
cultures. Also instrumental is the need to impart on adherence of 
the practice the great health risk that can result from this diabolical 
practice.
<P>
	Parents across the globe are similar in that ultimately they want 
what is in the best interests of their children. If they are presented 
with credible options, an alternative to female genital mutilation in 
a way that takes into account their own social, cultural and 
economic environments, we will then be able to find a global 
solution.
<P>
	I thank the member for Quebec for bringing this crucial issue to 
the attention of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
ask you this question: If the justice minister were a woman, do you 
not think that we would already have a bill amending the Criminal 
Code and explicitly prohibiting the genital mutilation of female 
persons?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15077"> 15077 </A></B>
<P>
	Were it not for the initiative of the hon. member for Québec, 
women would still be waiting for a bill to protect the victims of 
such a barbaric and cruel practice. Genital mutilation of female 
persons is one of the most harmful forms of violence against 
young girls and it is a terrible violation of their fundamental right 
to physical integrity.
<P>
	Just thinking of such an atrocity totally overwhelms me with 
horror and disgust and I must warn the Minister of Justice that he is 
likely to find the description I am about to give extremely 
disturbing. Perhaps after hearing it he will better understand the 
kind of butchery being practiced throughout the world, including 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	There are three forms of mutilation carried out. I will present 
them in order of degree. The first, removal of the prepuce of the 
clitoris; the second, excision, which involves removing the entire 
clitoris and often the adjacent portions of the labia minora; the 
third, infibulation, which involves excising the entire clitoris, the 
labia minora and a portion of the labia majora.
<P>
	When infibulation is performed, both sides of the vulva are 
closed over the vagina, leaving a small opening for the passage of 
urine and menstrual blood. In infibulation, the vaginal orifice is 
closed either with thorns or catgut sutures. The gaping raw edges of 
the labia majora are held together until scar tissue forms, thus 
closing up the vagina except for a narrow orifice which is kept open 
with a small piece of wood or reed.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The child's legs are then bound together. The little girl is 
immobilized for several weeks or until the tissues have healed. To 
enable infibulated women to have sexual relations, it is necessary 
to open the orifice with an incision which is further enlarged when 
they give birth. Often they are sewn up again afterwards, at the 
husband's request.
<P>
	There is none so deaf as those who will not hear. The Minister of 
Justice was definitely not listening when in December 1994, on the 
tragic anniversary of the massacre at the École Polytechnique, I 
and several of my colleagues emphatically condemned this odious 
practice.
<P>
	This barbaric procedure has now been imported to Canada and 
Quebec. Our doctors are seeing an increasing number of young 
girls with health problems related to genital mutilation. It will soon 
be one year since we last discussed this in the House, and so far the 
Minister of Justice has done nothing to stop this practice. I hope 
that he will at least support the representations of my colleague, the 
hon. member for Québec, who has taken the trouble to table a bill 
prohibiting genital mutilation.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice lately mentioned a series of bills tabled 
by his government to help victims, and the list goes: C-37, C-41, 
C-42 and C-45, and so forth. An  impressive body of legislation, 
whose effectiveness remains to be seen.
<P>
	The agenda of the Department of Justice is quite full. But I warn 
the minister that: ``Grasp all, lose all''. Some of the legislative 
measures are so far off the goal set by the government that we 
might be led to believe that the Minister of Justice has undertaken a 
Sisyphean task.
<P>
	In November 1994, the Quebec Minister of Justice, Paul Bégin, 
demanded that his federal counterpart prohibit genital mutilation 
and amend the Criminal Code accordingly. Sweden, Belgium, 
Norway, the United Kingdom and some American States have 
already passed legislation prohibiting genital mutilation.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice had the gall to answer that the sections of 
the Criminal Code dealing with assault were sufficient to condemn 
a person guilty of practising excision. Genital mutilation is much 
more than just assault, it is torture, butchery and an unqualifiable 
violation of a human person.
<P>
	The House managed to pass on the double a bill to protect 
victims and facilitate the arrest of the guilty parties. Thanks to the 
support of the official opposition, Bill C-104 on DNA passed 
through all stages on the same day, June 22 of this year. The 
Minister of Justice is always willing to play Lancelot when he 
knows that a bill will get unanimous support. It is easy to preach for 
virtue. It is something else to make political hay out of it.
<P>
	Where is the fearless Lancelot in today's debate? He is dragging 
his feet, he is consulting. Last summer our Don Quixote of public 
security thought that it would be useful to organize an information 
session on mutilation of women's genital organs for interested 
members. Guests of the Minister of Justice were Eunadie Johnson 
and Fadumo Dirie, cochairpersons of the Ontario task force on the 
prevention of genital mutilation of female persons.
<P>
	The minister expected that Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Dirie would 
concur with his views on the risk of unilateral legislation dealing 
specifically with genital mutilation. He was reluctant to introduce a 
bill because he thought such an action would push that practice 
further underground.
<P>
	But, lo and behold, both guests answered yes to the question of 
whether a specific piece of legislation would send a clear message 
to communities which practice mutilation. A criminal code 
amendment would demonstrate that our society considers that 
practice unacceptable and that if it is deemed acceptable in other 
countries, it is not so in Canada or in Quebec.
<P>
	After the meeting, the Minister of Justice admitted he was not so 
sure any more about his position. Today, the bill before the House 
is not a government bill, but a bill introduced by one of my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues. That speaks for itself. On this side of the 
House, we dare to  act according to our beliefs. I urged the Minister 
of Justice to at least support the bill presented by the hon. member

for Québec, if he did not have the courage to introduce an 
amendment to the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I request the same thing from all members. We should rise above 
partisanship and indeed do as we say, as we began to do some time 
ago with private members' bills.

<BLOCKQUOTE>June 20, 1995-The Minister of Transport-Second reading and reference to 
the Standing Committee on Transport of Bill C-101, An Act to continue the 
National Transportation Agency as the Canadian Transportation Agency, to 
consolidate and revise the National Transportation Act, 1987 and the Railway 
Act and to amend or repeal other Acts as a consequence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-101, An Act to continue the National Transportation Agency as 
the Canadian Transportation Agency, to consolidate and revise the National 
Transportation Act, 1987 and the Railway Act and to amend or repeal other Acts 
as a consequence, be referred forthwith to the Standing Committee on 
Transport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I recognize the hon. 
Minister of Transport to begin this debate I remind the House that 
under this standing order, members, including the minister, will 
have 10 minutes to make their interventions without questions or 
comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government's vision for the future 
of transportation is clear and attainable. Our commitment is to take 
Canadian transportation into the 21st century on a more viable, 
integrated and competitive footing.
<P>
	We are commercializing federal airports, the air navigation 
system, Canadian National Railways, Marine Atlantic and the 
department's Motor Vehicle Test Centre.
<P>
	We have introduced a new international air transportation policy 
and concluded a landmark Canada/U.S. bilateral air services 
agreement opening up the skies with our biggest trading partner.
<P>
	The government will unveil this fall details of the new national 
marine and ports policy. This policy will set the stage for a more 
efficient, competitive and fiscally prudent marine transportation 
and port system and eliminate subsidies except where 
constitutional obligations require us to continues to pay for 
services.
<P>
	We have already eliminated most transportation subsidies and 
greatly reduced the financial burden of Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	On June 20, we introduced Bill C-101, to enact a new Canada 
Transportation Act. The reason for introducing this legislation last 
spring was to encourage meaningful dialogue between industry and 
the government. We have had extensive consultation with CN and 
CP, other railway companies, shippers, and representatives of other 
transportation modes.
<P>
	We have considered reports by the Standing Committee on 
Transport and, most recently, the recommandations of Task Force 
on Commercialization led by Mr. Nault, the member for 
Kenora-Rainy River, now the Parliamentary Secretary for the 
Minister of Labour.
<P>
	The rail elements of the legislative package complement our 
strategy to commercialize CN, but they are far broader than that 
initiative. They are about enhancing the long term viability of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15079"> 15079 </A></B>
<P>
entire Canadian rail industry. This bill will affect the operations of 
CN, CP and some 30 other railways that currently operate in 
Canada, and it will also benefit shippers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some shippers expect levels of rail service to be dictated by law 
rather than by the significant negotiating leverage they have in the 
market. They talk about competition but they insist on regulatory 
protection.
<P>
	The extraordinary rights shippers had won through the National 
Transportation Act of 1987, the so-called competitive access 
rights, are retained. The NTA 1987 included the right to have rail 
rates regulated under certain conditions. It also included the right 
to final offer arbitration for a wide variety of disputes between 
shippers and the railways. This protectionism has benefited 
Canadian shippers and there has been a reduction in rail freight 
prices but there has also been a substantial erosion of CN and CP 
revenues.
<P>
	Bill C-101 takes aim at regulatory red tape by shortening the 
length of the arbitration process by one-third, from 90 to 60 days. 
The bill extends competitive access rights to shippers located on 
any federally regulated rail line sold to a provincially based rail 
operator. U.S. shippers in the United States do not enjoy similar 
provisions.
<P>
	While we have protected shipper rights we have made 
amendments to give more precise direction to the regulatory 
agency in its decision making process. The government's view is 
that regulated solutions should only be a last resort.
<P>
	A shipper demand with which we did not agree was for the 
provision of mandatory running rights for provincially regulated 
railways. Unlimited running rights would undermine a major 
objective of the bill which is to foster the growth of a vigorous 
short line industry across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Every short line operator in Canada stated that unrestricted 
running rights were undesirable with the exception of one operator. 
In the United States, where unrestricted running rights are not 
available, a thriving short line industry has developed based solely 
on commercial agreements. There are hundreds of voluntary 
running right agreements now in effect in Canada, letting the 
marketplace decide.
<P>
	The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, the Western Canadian 
Shippers Coalition, the Canadian Industrial Transportation League 
and the Canadian Manufacturers Association have all been 
lobbying hard against certain elements of Bill C-101. Apparently 
they believe in competition based on protectionism, an interesting 
approach for the CMA which in the past aggressively supported 
open, competitive free markets.
<P>
	Bill C-101 will modernize and streamline rail regulation to 
enhance the viability of our major carriers and thereby attempt to 
ensure rail freight service from coast to coast. Both CN and CP will 
benefit from a new, transparent, well-defined rationalization 
process that focuses on the sale of underused lines to other 
operators. The process will be free of archaic, adversarial and 
lengthy regulatory proceedings and government interference.
<P>
	Shippers should benefit from more efficient, lower cost rail 
service and the entry of new participants in the railroad industry. 
The legislative package will clean up outdated regulations. It will 
reduce the number of matters which need to be brought to the 
agency by the railways by about 200 to some 40. For example, 
10,000 confidential contracts per year will no longer need to be 
filed with the agency. This should reduce railways' administrative 
costs. It will help attract capital back to an industry that has 
suffered during the economic downturn by shippers to other 
transportation modes, particularly trucks.
<P>
	Some provincial legislatures, B.C. and Nova Scotia among 
others, have recently passed legislation which significantly reduces 
provincial taxation on railways. The New Brunswick government 
has put in place a very simple mechanism for the establishment of a 
provincial short line requiring only an agreement between the 
transportation minister and the perspective railway.
<P>
	The Ontario government has indicated its willingness to 
encourage the creation of short lines by repealing current statutory 
provisions that have so far discouraged short line operators setting 
up in that province.
<P>
	Bill C-101 also removes unnecessary regulation of other 
transport modes. In future applicants to operate Canadian air 
services will have to meet minimum financial requirements as well 
as our stringent safety requirements before they can obtain a 
licence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the wake of deregulation of other modes, access to final offer 
arbitration has been extended to our northern marine shippers and 
operators of rail passenger and commuter rail services who must 
negotiate with mainline carriers for track usage and other services.
<P>
	The new legislation will put in place a policy that is consistent, 
transparent and fair and will enhance competition. Canada's 
transportation system must be modern, dynamic and as unrestricted 
as possible while maintaining the world class safety record we have 
earned over the years.
<P>
	I ask members of all parties to join with me and support the 
motion to refer Bill C-101 to the Standing Committee on Transport 
before second reading. This will give the committee an early 
opportunity to study the bill with its usual care and diligence.
<P>
	The proposed Canada Transportation Act is one more step this 
government is taking towards modernizing this Canada's trans-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15080"> 15080 </A></B>
<P>
portation sector. It will enable Canada and  Canadian businesses to 
compete worldwide in the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-101, whose 
primary objective is to modernize rail transportation legislation, 
redefine the mandate of the National Transportation Agency and 
further deregulate air transportation.
<P>
	As we estimate that nearly 75 per cent of this bill concerns rail 
transportation, you will understand this important subject will be 
the focus of our intervention.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	For that reason, as far as the Bloc Quebecois is concerned, Bill 
C-101 will need definite improvements. I can assure the minister 
that it will be possible to work much more effectively if there is 
some kind of openness on the part of his colleagues on the Standing 
Committee on Transport-and I am talking here about his 
colleagues representing the Liberal majority.
<P>
	One of the first points that has to be criticized is clause 89, which 
says that the bill applies to any railway, whether or not constructed 
under the authority of an Act of Parliament, that is ``owned, 
controlled, leased or operated by a company wholly or partly 
within legislative authority of Parliament''.
<P>
	This means that Bill C-101 applies to any SLR, which stands for 
short line railway, owned or controlled by a national railway, 
whether it be CN or CP. We recently saw an example of a short line 
controlled by CN in the La Tuque, Abitibi and 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area.
<P>
	Moreover, these railways are declared to be works for the 
general advantage of Canada. You will understand that, in the 
current referendum debate, our party will want to change that 
all-encompassing approach which includes everything that can be 
for the general advantage of Canada.
<P>
	We will also ask clarifications about clause 90, which authorizes 
Parliament to pass legislation declaring any railway owned by a 
company registered under a federal or provincial statute to be a 
work for the general advantage of Canada. In these circumstances, 
provincial railway acts, like the one we have in Quebec, no longer 
apply and the company is regulated by the federal government. I 
am sure you realize this is totally unacceptable to us.
<P>
	Moreover, in clause 99, the agency is not required to conduct an 
environmental study before authorizing the construction of a 
railway line. Again, Quebec is on the leading edge as far as the 
environment is concerned. Therefore, we will have to obtain 
amendments to clause 99.
<P>
	Clause 104 of the bill says that if an owner's land is divided as a 
result of the construction of a railway line, the owner must pay for 
the construction and  maintenance of a crossing. We think this is 
ridiculous. Why would the owner of the land have to pay when it is 
the railway company that is using the land? The railway company 
should pay.
<P>
	Clause 113 provides that rates and conditions of service 
established by the agency must be commercially fair and 
reasonable. We think that this provision is there to please railway 
companies which often have had to buy equipment to service a 
client without benefitting from a contract that was long enough to 
allow the company to write off the cost of such equipment.
<P>
	The list could go on but, since this is only a ten-minute speech, I 
would not have enough time to say all I want to say in this, my first 
speech since the House reconvened in September.
<P>
	Bill C-101 will have an effect on Quebec with regard to the new 
process for transferring or discontinuing the operation of a railway 
line. I have had the opportunity before to say in this House that the 
abandonment of railway lines used to be almost automatically 
approved by the National Transportation Agency. Now, the 
company will have to demonstrate that it took all the necessary 
measures to offer the railway line on the market and if nobody is 
interested-We see the beginning of a solution, but it will have to 
be improved on.
<P>
	Of course, we received from many shippers requests for 
clarification of this legislation or for changes to it, specially in 
relation with the introduction of running rights for short line 
railways, provided that reciprocity not be given to main railway 
carriers.
<P>
	I therefore open the door to shippers for an alliance with our 
party, the Bloc Quebecois. They will have an opportunity to defend 
their views in the Standing Committee on Transport.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I would like, of course, to conclude my remarks by referring to 
the referendum. It goes without saying that when Quebec has full 
power, it will not have to rely on a national transportation agency 
filled with friends of the party in power. Even though the 
composition of the National Transportation Agency has been 
reduced from nine members to three, we are still caught in the same 
vicious circle of having to deal with friends of the government.
<P>
	I do not want to be disrespectful to Mr. Rivard, a very competent 
lawyer from Quebec City who was appointed by the Conservatives, 
but I can predict today, October 2, that Mr. Rivard's mandate on the 
National Transportation Agency will probably not be renewed and 
that we will see, as was the case with the members of the Port of 
Quebec's board of directors, some good friends of the government, 
some Liberals of good standing, appointed to head the National 
Transportation Agency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15081"> 15081 </A></B>
<P>
	So this is just shifting the problem. Our party will of course 
keep on denouncing such partisan appointments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Patronage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Such patronage. I thank my hon. colleague for 
Bourassa for suggesting the word patronage. So, the only way out 
is sovereignty, otherwise Quebec will remain a rebellious minority 
within the Canadian federation, constantly waiting with the no side 
for a no which would mean a yes, and vice versa. I do not know 
what, nor when nor where. If not Quebec, finally in touch with its 
identity and its potential, will become a country.
<P>
	There are in fact two countries: yours, Canada, and ours, 
Quebec. There really are two countries north of the 45th parallel: 
one which is frantically searching for its identity-Canada-and 
the other, which can and should no longer deny itself-Quebec. 
Yes, in order to reach its full potential, Quebec must be sovereign. 
Quebec deserves to be sovereign because it is made up of a people 
that must not only survive, but grow.
<P>
	Saying no means denying us the means to develop in the way we 
want to. It means continuing to mortgage what we have, and 
continuing to complain. By saying yes, we will make others respect 
us and we will stop being crushed. Just like so many other Quebec 
ridings, Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans will say: ``Yes, we are 
ready and we will win''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when Bill C-89 was in committee I was told by the 
government's underwriters, Nesbitt Burns, Scotia McLeod and 
Goldman Sachs, that CN Rail had an accumulated debt of 
approximately $2.5 billion and that in order for CN to achieve an 
investment grade bond rating of BBB it would have to reduce its 
debt load to $1.5 billion.
<P>
	They then went on to explain that CN had excess cash reserves of 
$300 million to $400 million as a result of recent subsidiary 
company sales and actual cash reserves, plus $400 million to $600 
million in non-rail real estate assets. At the upper end of these 
figures was the amount by which the underwriters were telling us 
the debt had to be reduced. The lower value of these figures 
indicated that the government might be faced with a cost of up to 
$300 million in order to reach the debt reduction target that was 
stable.
<P>
	It was the stated plan of the government to purchase CN's 
non-rail real estate assets. In response to my question on how the 
value would be set, government officials who also appeared before 
the committee testified that a full appraisal would be completed 
and that would set the price the taxpayers had to pay to purchase 
the assets from the company which they already owned.
<P>
	The wording of the debt reduction clause in Bill C-89 concerned 
me in that it allowed the Minister of Transport to reduce CN's debt 
by any amount he chose. I attempted to have the legislation 
amended to tighten this arbitrary power of the minister but the 
amendment was defeated.
<P>
	On May 17, 1995 I wrote to the minister requesting answers to a 
number of questions which were not clearly answered by the 
minister in committee. One of the most important questions was 
the amount of money the minister was going to give to CN to 
reduce its debt. In his response the minister stated: ``The 
government will undertake only the minimum, if any, debt 
reduction necessary to facilitate an investment grade rating of CN's 
debt''.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	My concerns about the minister's real debt reduction plans were 
well founded. On August 28, 1995 the government announced that 
it would be injecting $1.4 billion into CN Rail to reduce its debt. 
This amount includes a $500 million payment for real estate assets 
with a book value of $235 million and no appraisals to the contrary 
forthcoming.
<P>
	The government pushed Bill C-89 through the House and into 
committee after first reading. I supported this with the 
understanding this was meant to make it easier to examine and 
amend the bill in committee where it is theoretically less partisan. 
This turned out not to be the case.
<P>
	I presented many amendments, none of which were accepted in 
spite of little argument against them. One of my amendments 
dealing with Atlantic Canada did have the support of one Liberal 
on the committee but was defeated by a tie breaking vote by the 
committee chairman.
<P>
	Given the lack of co-operation that we were led to believe this 
procedure of sending legislation to committee after first reading 
would provide, coupled with the deception that took place on the 
debt reduction, I would be very reluctant to trust Liberal intentions 
on transport issues in the future.
<P>
	When Bill C-101 was first proposed I was approached by the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister seeking my co-operation in 
not only sending it to committee after first reading, but reducing 
the first reading debate time to one hour. At that point I had not yet 
received a copy of the bill nor was I aware of its contents. He 
informed me that it was not available yet but it was fairly 
straightforward and simple, essentially nothing more than enabling 
legislation allowing necessary changes to occur on an as needed 
basis. We now all know that Bill C-101 is a massive piece of 
legislation with major ramifications for both the rail and shipping 
industries.
<P>
	It seems that this deception also continued into the summer. In a 
telephone conversation with the chair of  the Standing Committee 
on Transport, I agreed to request submissions from interested 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15082"> 15082 </A></B>
<P>
parties over the summer as long as it did not restrict anyone's 
access to testifying before the committee in the fall. I was assured 
it would not and that the intent was only to allow us to obtain some 
of the material during the summer instead of having it all bunched 
together when we returned in September.
<P>
	Subsequent to this, several affected groups complained to me 
about the tight timetable for getting their submissions to the 
committee. I obtained a copy of the notice sent out from the 
transport committee under the signature of the chair advising that if 
they wished to appear before the standing committee regarding Bill 
C-101 they must send in 25 copies of their submissions to the 
committee not later than August 31.
<P>
	At the end of August I sent the following fax to the committee 
chair:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has recently been brought to my attention that the notice sent out to 
interested parties regarding Bill C-101 is written in such a way that has caused 
many of them to believe that August 31 is a cut off after which we will not accept 
any submissions. It also implies that if they do not submit a written submission 
within that time frame, they will not be allowed to appear before the standing 
committee on this issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Neither of these positions were agreed to by myself either as a regular 
committee member representing the Reform Party or as a member of the 
transport steering committee. You and I discussed early submissions by 
telephone and I agreed that it was not a bad idea to request early submissions to 
be made so that we might be able to review some of them during the summer. As 
it has turned out, if any such submissions were made, I have not received a copy 
of them. When I gave my agreement to this early start, it was with the clear 
understanding that this early submission request would not impede any party's 
right to appear before the committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I trust that this is a misunderstanding on the part of concerned parties and 
anyone wishing to appear before the committee and/or provide written 
submission may still do so. After all, we are attempting to determine all the facts 
and concerns available. Surely, we will not do anything to impede this 
information gathering process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The reaction I received from the chair's office is interesting. 
Through follow up inquiries my office was informed by an 
assistant in the chair's office that they were preparing a response to 
my letter which I finally received on September 26.
<P>
	Verbally and later in writing we have been informed that there 
has been a tremendous response which makes me curious why 
these were not forwarded to me as a committee member. I did 
receive a huge stack of submissions when Parliament reconvened, 
the very situation summer submissions were meant to avoid.
<P>
	We have also been told that all stakeholders interested in 
appearing before the committee are welcome and not subject to a 
deadline. They advised that 800 letters were sent out, too many for 
a second letter to retract the false  message that had been received 
and it was up to us to notify any parties concerned with the 
previously stated deadline and tell them it was not in effect.
<P>
	As far as the bill is concerned it is long past the time that 
Canada's archaic rail legislation was revisited. To continue with the 
existing legislation is simply to ensure economic failure which will 
affect rail companies and shippers alike. We must move quickly to 
a market driven competitive system able to compete with the U.S. 
companies unencumbered by restrictive and uneconomical 
government regulations.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	In the late 1970s the American rail industry was suffering from 
many of the same problems currently faced by the Canadian rail 
companies. In 1980 the U.S. Congress passed the Staggers act 
which deregulated the industry. Since that time the American rail 
industry has prospered.
<P>
	Bill C-101 is a half Staggers bill which addresses some parts of 
the need to simplify rail line abandonment but does not address 
many of the other necessary components for rail industry 
prosperity with proper consideration for shipper needs.
<P>
	The rail industry is quick to point out that we cannot compare 
ourselves directly to the United States because of differing taxation 
and labour laws. While that is not incorrect, our approach would be 
to harmonize these differences instead of bowing to them as 
unsolvable and tinkering with our problems instead of dealing with 
them head on.
<P>
	Rail transportation is essential to get Canadian goods to their 
markets and to get supplies and materials to Canadian companies. 
Likewise, economic survival of these same Canadian companies is 
essential to the rail companies.
<P>
	Many years ago I remember seeing a cartoon dealing with 
nuclear war. A single picture showed the president of Russia and 
the president of the United States both with their heads in 
guillotines each holding the release rope of the other. If either of 
them released the rope the blade would fall which would cause the 
other to release his rope in the ultimate no win situation. That is 
similar to what would happen in Bill C-101 if the legislation does 
not consider both sides fairly and pushes them into hard adversarial 
roles.
<P>
	Shippers' products must be able to compete internationally with 
those of their competitors from the United States. A significant 
component in their cost structure is transportation. If their cost 
component for transportation is substantially higher than that of 
their American competitors, shippers are operating under a severe 
handicap. The potential is that these shippers will use the American 
shipping system affecting the Canadian economy through job 
losses not only in the rail sector but at Canadian ports as well, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15083"> 15083 </A></B>
<P>
moving their operations to the United States, or folding their 
operations if they are unable to market their products at a profit.
<P>
	The first thing the bill should examine is the reduction or 
removal of unreasonable cost factors to rail companies. This 
includes such items as federal fuel taxes, lengthy capital cost 
allowance terms, application and renewal fees and cabinet 
authority on rail line abandonment.
<P>
	We must also address problems at the provincial level. 
Provincial fuel and property taxation as well as labour legislation 
impact on the competitiveness of federal rail lines and their ability 
to divest themselves of low density lines without loss of that rail 
infrastructure. This issue will not be resolved by ignoring it.
<P>
	The other main problem with the bill is the lack of a clear sense 
of direction. The ultimate goal of rail deregulation is to establish a 
market driven and market regulated industry which can compete 
with the United States. I recognize this may be a huge single step 
but Bill C-101 not only fails to allow the market to be the final 
arbiter over price decisions, it also attempts to block access to the 
present arbiter through clauses like 27(2) and 34(1).
<P>
	I could provide much more detail on the deficiencies of this bill 
and solutions for the problems faced by both the rail industry and 
Canadian shippers, but the action of the Liberal government to 
eliminate second reading debate severely restricts the amount of 
time available.
<P>
	Be assured I will deal with these solutions in detail at committee 
hearings and I will ensure that all interested parties have the 
opportunity to bring their concerns before their elected 
representatives. I call on the Liberal members to co-operate with 
this process and agree to deal with the needs of the Canadian 
transportation industry instead of their own partisan agenda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me assure the hon. Reform 
Party critic that it is the intention of the government and the 
committee to get some positive and constructive comments from 
the Reform members who seem to always criticize and have 
absolutely nothing good to say about anything.
<P>
	I rise today to lend my support for Bill C-101 and the Minister of 
Transport's motion to refer Bill C-101 to the Standing Committee 
on Transport before second reading.
<P>
	This is an important bill. Transportation touches all our daily 
lives and has far reaching ramifications in today's business world. 
The government is advancing a comprehensive program and a 
vision to overhaul the large unwieldy framework of regulations, 
outright ownership and specific involvement in transportation 
particularly as it pertains to rail. While the bill deals with all 
modes, there is no doubt that the most talked about provisions deal 
with the rail industry, so I will address myself to that aspect in 
particular in these remarks.
<P>
	In this regard I see the 30 or so railways now operating in this 
country as being at a critical juncture. CN and CP are two mainline 
carriers that dominate the rail freight sector and have, as have other 
railways, managed to weather the recent economic downturn.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	CN and CP have done this by introducing new marketing 
initiatives and operations more closely tailored to the 25,000 
shippers they serve. They have also expanded intermodal links with 
the trucking industry and have implemented new technology and 
operating methods.
<P>
	Stringent cost cutting measures have been taken and since 1983 
CN and CP have abandoned 20 per cent of their rail lines. Total 
employment has decreased by 40 per cent.
<P>
	To move into the 21st century, however, I believe CN and CP 
must further adjust to changing trends, increased competition and 
the need to reduce costs. CN and CP cost cutting efforts have been 
stifled by the regulatory hurdles they must jump in order to tailor 
their rail line networks to their core markets. While the Minister of 
Transport has made reference to the proposed rail line 
rationalization process, I will build on his comments.
<P>
	Like shippers' rights, rail line rationalization can be 
controversial. I will first set the issue in the context of the current 
rail environment. The main line rail network is vastly over built. 
Even after efforts by both railways in recent years to reduce 
trackage, 84 per cent of CN and CP traffic travels on one-third of 
the network.
<P>
	The adversarial nature and the length of the process can deter the 
sale of underutilized lines to short lines and some say can lead to 
the downgrading of a marginal line on purpose. A line must be 
uneconomic or near so for abandonment to proceed. It is the 
creation of short lines that we wish to foster in the legislation now 
before us.
<P>
	The process for sale of a rail line under current legislation can be 
long and drawn out. In one instance the owner and the potential 
purchaser had agreed to the sale, in other words the continuance of 
a line, but under the existing NTA process with its convoluted 
regulatory approvals the prerequisite abandonment proceedings 
took two years with a cost of $10 million per year to CP before the 
sale could be finalized.
<P>
	In the U.S. the sale of a line, not an abandonment, to another 
operator can be accomplished in as little as seven days. Purchasers 
are required only to prove public need and that they have the 
financial capability to purchase and operate the line.
<P>
	The most important means by which the federal government can 
help our rail carriers to reduce their cost is through regulatory 
reform, and that is what we intend to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15084"> 15084 </A></B>
<P>
	The new proposed Bill C-101 will do this and will focus on the 
encouraging of the sale of rail lines to other rail operators. The 
process will require a railway to set out for all interested parties 
its intention for its network in a three-year rolling plan.
<P>
	The owner railway will not be allowed to abandon a line unless it 
has made every effort to negotiate the sale of the line for rail 
purposes. The negotiating phase has a finite limit of seven months. 
This phase could take as little as two months if there is clearly no 
buyer interest.
<P>
	If no private sector buyer comes forward, governments at each 
level will in turn have 15 days to exercise an option to buy for 
public purposes. They will have had ample notice of the possibility 
through the plan at the start of the whole process.
<P>
	No abandonment of a rail line will take place unless no one, 
neither the private sector nor governments, is interested in 
acquiring that line.
<P>
	The process advanced in Bill C-101 is not as radical as that 
adopted in the United States but is instead a made in Canada 
approach that gives every interested party ample opportunity to 
acquire the line. It allows CN and CP to rationalize their track 
within a specified time frame. It allows for a more planned 
approach to the future of the Canadian rail system, which will be a 
benefit to the railways, shippers and communities alike. It also 
promotes the creation of a short line industry which will benefit all 
and which is key to keeping the most extensive network possible.
<P>
	The experience in the United States under its deregulated 
environment has shown the high potential for rail lines to be 
acquired by short lines, providing hundreds of jobs.
<P>
	Today there are over 500 short lines in the U.S., of which 263 
were created since 1980. Conversely, there are only 12 Canadian 
short lines in operation. I believe under our proposed new 
regulatory process many more will emerge. Short line railways 
typically operate under a less burdensome cost structure than the 
main line railways and pass much of the savings on to their 
customers.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	In addition, through more focused marketing and closer tailoring 
of services to customer needs, short lines can both recover traffic 
previously lost by the main line railway and generate traffic that 
was not previously present.
<P>
	It is in the interest of main line carriers to sell to other railways 
rather than to abandon. The main lines get both the proceeds from 
the sale and a new partner that can act as both a generator and a 
feeder of traffic.
<P>
	The proposed legislation not only eases exit but makes getting 
into the railway business less onerous. In future all railways under 
federal jurisdiction will simply require a certificate of fitness to 
either operate or perhaps even  to construct a railway. Shippers and 
railways agree this is a significant improvement over the process 
now in place.
<P>
	While no one can guarantee continued rail service in every 
corner of the country, the law will create the right environment so 
that wherever possible service should be maintained it will be 
maintained.
<P>
	Rail is the only mode of transportation in Canada whose business 
decisions can be easily and often delayed, varied and sometimes 
even reversed by public authorities. Everything from sales to 
bookkeeping is subject to regulatory permission, sanction or 
appeal, with some regulations dating back to the turn of the 
century.
<P>
	Under the proposed legislation, treatment of the rail freight 
industry will be brought more in line with other Canadian 
transportation businesses and U.S. rail counterparts, thereby 
enhancing competitiveness.
<P>
	Transportation has historically been highly and intricately 
regulated. I was amazed at the mass of the build up on the 
economic side. For rail alone it filled over 1,000 pages of statutes 
spread over eight different acts.
<P>
	With the passage of Bill C-101 we have the opportunity to help 
our railways, large and small, and ultimately their customers in 
their efforts to improve competitiveness.
<P>
	Under the proposed amendment to the Transport Act, regulation 
of non-safety matters will be condensed into just over 100 pages. 
This reduction in volume alone will make the regulatory burden 
less onerous and costly, fostering a more commercially oriented 
basis for the provision of rail service. It will also make the 
legislation governing transportation much more logical and 
understandable.
<P>
	I hope I have not given the impression that the bill is good only 
for the railways. On reflection I believe listeners will recognize 
that what I have outlined for the railways can easily be seen to 
benefit shippers as well. Once the railways have their house in 
order, the benefits will surely flow to their customers.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport has made it clear that the bill 
preserves key rights now enjoyed by the shippers. A balance 
between the needs of shippers and railways must be found or our 
railways will continue to suffer. That outcome ultimately will not 
serve their customers either.
<P>
	The sweeping nature of the regulatory housecleaning for all 
transportation modes will necessarily have an effect on the 
National Transportation Agency. The proposed legislation defines 
a streamlined and more focused regulatory body and renames it the 
Canadian Transportation Agency. Its role and powers will be 
clarified and brought into line with the reform of rail regulation and 
changes to the other transportation modes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15085"> 15085 </A></B>
<P>
	In future the agency will concentrate on core quasi-judicial and 
administrative functions such as the issuing of licences and the 
setting of regulated rail rates. Regulation is always a poor 
substitute for market discipline. We need regulation only when 
there are no practical transportation alternatives.
<P>
	The federal government is aggressively examining the way it 
does business on all fronts. It is regulating only where needed and 
leaving the private sector to activities it can do better and at less 
cost to taxpayers. Regulatory reform in the transportation sector is 
one very important part of all these efforts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is said that the road to Hell is paved with good 
intentions, and the same goes for Bill C-101, which revises the 
National Transportation Act, especially with regard to rail 
transport. It is this issue that I will address.
<P>
	The intention announced by the government in this bill is a good 
one. In a nutshell, its purpose is to modernize, streamline and 
deregulate. No one can criticize this, as no one is against virtue. 
Unfortunately, as is its habit, the government could not resist its 
usual temptation, which is to encroach on provincial jurisdiction, 
with an added bonus in that this bill significantly increases its 
opportunities to engage in patronage.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Plain common sense and efficiency concerns should have led 
lawmakers to split the rail network clearly and willingly without 
exception between national railways under federal jurisdiction and 
intraprovincial railways under provincial jurisdiction. But this 
would have been too simple, too logical. And how could they resist 
grabbing a few more powers that should normally come under 
provincial jurisdiction? That is just unthinkable.
<P>
	Under this bill, intraprovincial and other short line railways in 
which national railways have an interest will come under federal 
jurisdiction. In addition, Ottawa will still have the right to place 
any short line railway under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Therefore, depending on where their capital comes from and on 
Ottawa's wishes, intraprovincial short lines will come under two 
different jurisdictions. How logical can you get?
<P>
	Clauses 140 through 146 dealing with the abandonment and sale 
of railway lines could, in return for some improvements, facilitate 
the establishment of more short line railways, which should revive 
our dying rail network. From now on-and this is great-, rail 
companies will have to prepare three year plans specifying which 
lines they intend to continue operating, which they intend to sell, 
and which they wish to abandon. When this provision will be fully 
in effect, short  line railway companies will be able to determine 
which lines they are interested in and to plan accordingly. It seems, 
however, unrealistic to hope that these plans will be of any use for 
1996.
<P>
	Another thing: some of the deadlines set for potential buyers to 
make up their minds are surprisingly short. If no private buyer is 
interested, the company must offer the railway line to the 
governments. Do you know how many days public authorities will 
have to make a decision? Exactly fifteen days. This is totally 
unrealistic.
<P>
	Finally, it means no more public hearings, where people could 
explain why a specific line should be kept in service for the benefit 
of the public, and should therefore be bought by a government, 
when there is no interested private buyer, given the market 
conditions. Indeed, how will public authorities have the time to 
hold hearings and consult the public before making a decision, if 
they only have 15 days, not to mention the fact that people will also 
not have time to prepare submissions?
<P>
	Obviously, the federal government could not care less about the 
development of those regions which could be affected by the 
foreseeable reduction in railway services.
<P>
	I said at the beginning that Bill C-101 provides interesting 
opportunities for lobbyists and those who rely on patronage. The 
National Transportation Agency, which will now be called the 
Canadian Transportation Agency, currently includes nine 
permanent members and must provide national representation. 
Under Bill C-101, the agency will only consist of three members 
and will not have to ensure national representation. The reduction 
in the number of members will obviously make it easier to lobby 
and to exert political pressure. I am not making accusations, I am 
just stating the obvious.
<P>
	Let me summarize my position. I criticize Bill C-101 for a 
number of reasons. One is the fact that intraprovincial short line 
railways are not clearly and unhesitatingly left under provincial 
jurisdiction. There is also the lack of provisions to truly promote 
the establishment of regional railways and thus help put the rail 
transport industry back on track. Another flaw is the fact that, for 
all intents and purposes, public hearings are excluded, since the 
unrealistic short time frame given to public authorities to decide 
whether or not to buy does not allow them to hold such hearings. 
Finally, there is the composition of the new Canadian 
Transportation Agency.
<P>
	These are the four aspects which we will try to improve on 
through our amendments in committee.
<P>
	In conclusion, the time had certainly come to streamline the 
railway legislation and to reduce the responsibilities of the agency. 
However, the priority given to unstated political motives, over the 
rational objectives stated, once again results in the government 
partly missing the target. My colleague, the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, and myself will  propose, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15086"> 15086 </A></B>
<P>
committee, amendments designed to put this exceedingly political 
legislation back on track.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I am most willing, however, to admit that I should be thanking 
the Minister of Transport instead of criticizing him. Thanking him, 
yes, for providing new evidence that under the federal system 
Quebec has no hope whatsoever of one day seeing an end to the 
subordination of the logic of public interest to political interests. 
This will be possible only in a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is an honour and a privilege to be able to enter the debate on Bill 
C-101, a rather large omnibus bill.
<P>
	I was interested to hear the hon. parliamentary secretary suggest 
that it was a straightforward, simple and small bill. This is not a 
small bill. It has at least 120 pages and it is a rather far reaching and 
overarching bill that covers the three modes of transportation in 
Canada.
<P>
	The bill makes some progress toward levelling the playing field, 
especially in the railway sector with the United States. It makes it 
easier to abandon some short rail lines, which is an important issue. 
It also makes it easier to establish short lines under provincial 
control.
<P>
	There are some positive developments taking place in the 
legislation that we need to recognize. However it seems the chief 
purpose of the bill is not so much to enhance the investor interest in 
the particular railways but rather to facilitate the selling of CN Rail 
or the privatization of the Canadian National Railway.
<P>
	The bill continues to treat railways as a service rather than as a 
business. The bill is clearly not about rail renewal. Canada remains 
15 years behind the American system. Instead of levelling the 
playing field for the U.S., the federal government has chosen to 
deregulate in a piecemeal fashion rather than in a consistent, 
logical pattern.
<P>
	Bill C-101 fails to ensure true competition between the railways. 
The competitive line rates and final offer arbitration provisions 
only highlight an artificial competition that benefits neither 
shippers nor the railways in the long run. Under both these options 
the ultimate arbiter of freight prices is the National Transportation 
Agency rather than the marketplace.
<P>
	In other words, competitive line rates and final offer arbitration 
are actually a hidden form of price regulation or managed 
competition. The bill has no guaranteed access provision or even 
study regarding the rail infrastructure in terms of further 
development and competitiveness in the industry.
<P>
	In spite of these sorts of statements the whole business of 
transportation and shippers needs to recognize they need each other 
to sustain the economy that is there. The  railway business exists to 
support shippers and shippers need the railway to send their 
materials and products to market. Each needs the other to be 
successful.
<P>
	Let me list a couple of the major shippers that use the railway 
system rather extensively. I refer in particular to the Western 
Canadian Shippers' Coalition, which includes companies like 
Agrium Inc., Alberta Forest Products Association, the Canadian 
Oilseed Processsors Association, Canpotex Limited, the Council of 
Forest Industries, Luscar Ltd., Manalta Coal Ltd., Novacor 
Chemicals Ltd., Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Sherrit Inc. 
and Sultran Limited. These companies are significant customers of 
the Canadian railroad system. The products shipped tend to be bulk 
in nature and must travel substantial distances to distant markets.
<P>
	For many products highway transport does not present an 
effective, competitive alternative to rail transportation and water 
transport is not a practical alternative. Hence for the majority of the 
transportation requirements of industries like the ones named the 
only economical way of accessing the markets is through the 
railway.
<P>
	There is a need for the railroad system to be reformed. There is 
excess track. There are impediments to the productivity 
improvements and there are too many threats to the profitability 
and long term viability of the railroads.
<P>
	We must admit there have been improvements in the last couple 
of years in the productivity of railways and the net revenues of both 
CN Rail and CP have increased. These rationalizations, however, 
should not jeopardize the benefits of competition in the railway 
industry. I will refer to that in just a moment.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	In the meantime we need to indicate as well that the Canadian 
railway system is not like the American system. The American 
system has many more railroads, to begin with. The distances to 
market are shorter. They have an extensively developed highway 
system and inland water routes. Therefore it is not valid to argue 
that Canada should have a regulatory system directly comparable 
to that of the United States.
<P>
	We should recognize that rails are not like the trucking industry. 
Trucking regulations restrict vehicles by the availability of 
trucking services and limit shippers' freedom of choice. 
Accordingly the deregulation of major carriers has a 
pro-competitive result. We should also recognize that the 
capitalization required in that area is not nearly as great as it is in 
the railway business.
<P>
	Railway regulation protects captive shippers against the 
excessive monopoly power of the railway. Herein lies the crux of 
the issue. The imposition of statutory provisions which limit or 
deter 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15087"> 15087 </A></B>
<P>
accessibility to the competitive access provision will be 
anti-competitive by  permitting the railroads to more rapidly and 
more extensively exploit their monopoly power.
<P>
	We come back to the business of competitiveness. Are the 
railroads competitive? The conclusion of the group of industries we 
referred to before is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has become apparent to railway customers during the past eight years that 
Canada's railways have refused to compete for rail traffic which would become 
available by virtue of a customer's utilization of the competitive line rate 
provisions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Page 131 of the National Transportation Act Review 
Commission report states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CN and CP Rail have effectively declined to compete with each other through 
CLRs and as a result the provision is largely inoperative in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is suggested that the failure of railways to compete through 
CLRs should now be shifted and, rather than be treated under the 
Transport Act, should now become subject to the provisions of the 
Competition Act.
<P>
	There is a provision in Bill C-101 that there be an appeal to the 
National Transportation Agency. However shippers will have to 
prove that they suffer from significant prejudice. It is interesting 
that significant prejudice is not defined. Neither is suffering.
<P>
	If this phrase is not defined in the bill it lends itself to all kinds of 
problems. First, it is difficult for shippers to be able to prove what 
is happening. Second, because that is difficult there will be a 
defence and the result will be extensive litigation proceedings that 
mitigate against the expeditious and objective determination of 
relief. That is precisely what is needed to get this business going 
and to get the economy rolling along smoothly.
<P>
	Those terms are not defined in the bill. They have never been 
used in transportation legislation before. Consequently there would 
be very little, if anything, to go on in the way of precedent. The 
agency serves as a price regulator.
<P>
	Another part the agency deals with is that the rates shall be 
commercially fair and reasonable. These words are used in the bill 
but are not defined. Hence they are likely to result in uncertainty, 
delay and contention which reduce the effectiveness of the level of 
service and competitive access provisions.
<P>
	A further provision in the bill states that the clarification of these 
kinds of terms would come from the governor in council and does 
not help at all. It will introduce into the decision facing the council 
the politics of the day in preference to the economic considerations 
existing in the marketplace.
<P>
	A further development is that a complaint, if one is issued by a 
shipper against the transportation agency, should not be vexatious 
or frivolous. These terms are not defined.
<P>
	It is a very difficult situation. It is all very well to talk about the 
agency as being able to act as the final arbiter  and to get 
agreements in place, but the result will be that litigation of one kind 
or another will come into play and the courts will become the 
arbiter.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	There are two other parts of the bill that also need to be looked 
at: the idea of the interchange and the interswitch. These words 
have to be defined as well as the words limited running rights.
<P>
	While the provisions of the bill go far they do not go far enough. 
Neither do they create a regulatory system which will provide an 
economic system that will look after the interests of transportation 
and shippers, so that together they can both meet their needs and 
we as Canadians will benefit from sound transportation and 
manufacturing systems that can deliver their products easily to the 
marketplace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to enter into the debate on the Bill C-101, 
amendments to the National Transportation Act, now called the 
Canada Transportation Act.
<P>
	The bill is to be referred to committee after first reading. I 
believe opposition members as well as the public in general will 
have ample opportunity for input into how the bill could possibly 
be amended in other ways. This shows the dedication the 
government has toward making the system of government more 
open and more visible by allowing people to be directly involved in 
legislation that affects them.
<P>
	This is basically another bill that realizes that governments 
should be steerers and not rowers of the economy. What do I mean 
by that? Basically most people have come to the conclusion that the 
government should act as a referee, a regulatory agency, but not be 
directly involved in the actual operation of businesses.
<P>
	The Oshawa Municipal Airport is in my riding. I am constantly 
reminded the airport is operated by the city of Oshawa and why that 
is not the best interest of the local economy.
<P>
	I will deal with two aspects of the legislation, both of which deal 
with air travel. It is surprising that previous speakers thought this 
was entirely a railway bill. In fact it involves all sectors of 
transportation in Canada, not the least of which is air 
transportation.
<P>
	I cannot underestimate the value of the whole transportation 
sector to Canada. Canada is the third largest country in the world 
geographically and yet we have one of the smallest population 
bases. It does not take long to realize that transportation has a 
major impact on how we develop our country.
<P>
	I should like to talk about the north which we seem to have 
ignored. We have mostly spoken about transportation systems that 
occur in the southern parts of our country. In a recent study the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15088"> 15088 </A></B>
<P>
Royal Bank discovered  that Canadians were the second wealthiest 
people in the world if we take into account natural resources.
<P>
	I do not have to tell members or other Canadians that we cannot 
quite see where that fits into our bank account at the end of the 
week. Very few of us feel that we have been able to access those 
resources so that we spread the wealth across the country. The 
transportation sector is one major aspect of why in some ways 
Canada has not been able to access all its natural resources to the 
benefit of all its people.
<P>
	Industries such as tourism, metal extraction and forestry are big 
factions that use the transportation networks. Due to the regulatory 
burdens that often occur in this area, northerners often feel 
victimized by the transportation sector. Let me illustrate this by a 
very simple analogy.
<P>
	Last summer I visited Kenora which some people do not 
consider as being north. Certainly it is in northern Ontario. I was 
surprised to discover that the cost of air fare to and from Kenora 
was twice as much as it would have cost me to go to London, 
England, and back. When I saw the bill come up for debate, I was 
very interested in why such things occur.
<P>
	I discovered a very interesting aspect of the old National 
Transportation Act. Basically it divided Canada in half and not 
consistently in half either. It took the 50th parallel from 
Newfoundland to the Ontario-Manitoba border, then took the 53rd 
parallel in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and the 55th parallel in 
Alberta and British Columbia and created a designated area. What 
did that mean? It means we treated businesses in the northern part 
of our country differently than we did in the southern part.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Here are some of the aspects of competition that occurred in the 
airline areas in northern Canada. A test was used called reverse 
onus. Basically it allowed interested parties such as air carriers and 
communities to argue that the licensing of new services could lead 
to a significant decrease or instability in domestic service already 
provided.
<P>
	Basically this meant a barrier to new carriers that wanted to 
compete with existing airlines. It also created in my mind artificial 
monopolies. Many people in the north suspect that these artificial 
monopolies acted as impediments to transportation in northern 
regions.
<P>
	Bill C-101 serves to do away with that aspect. It allows the 
competition that exists in the southern parts of the country to apply 
in the north. Hopefully this will eventually result in lowering air 
fares to some of our northern communities.
<P>
	Every once in a while we feel there is inappropriate business 
activity in the area of monopoly. This act also provides for a review 
of the fair pricing schedules of  some of the airlines in the north, 
such that we could even affect a rollback if it were thought the 
monopoly that sometimes occurred due to the small number of 
users and smaller communities could be rolled back if gouging and 
price fixing et cetera had occurred.
<P>
	Another aspect of the act which has not been mentioned to date 
is consumer protection. I am sure members are aware of the horror 
stories of people who travel south or even within our country. They 
buy airline tickets and show up at the airport on the day of 
reckoning and suddenly discover the airline has gone out of 
business. There has been no real mechanism for some of these 
people to get their money back. I am sure members are aware of 
horror stories of retired people who have saved for the trip of their 
lifetime to travel around the world and who discover they were 
jilted by the airline system for whatever reason and lost their 
money.
<P>
	This legislation provides for a system whereby new carriers will 
have to be approved not only from a technical point of view as to 
whether they can fly planes but also from a financial one. These 
airlines will have to submit financial statements, et cetera, to show 
their fiscal ability to conduct their business. This can be nothing 
but good for consumers.
<P>
	These two aspects as they affect air transportation in Canada are 
nothing but positive. It is one more step in the government's 
agenda of realizing we can do things better by making our 
regulatory framework simpler and more easily understood and, 
similarly, allowing small and medium size businesses to do what 
businesses do best, to compete in an open and fair market.
<P>
	At the same time, the government realizes there is a need to 
protect consumers from possible unwarranted business activity and 
has put that in this legislation as well. There is an underpinning 
protection for the consumer and an ability to allow the industry to 
fully compete. Hopefully the benefits to this will be transportation 
at no financial risk to the general public. More important, hopefully 
it will reduce the cost of air fare in northern communities.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part today in the debate on Bill 
C-101, known as the Canada Transportation Act.
<P>
	This long awaited bill is the outcome of numerous independent 
and government studies concluding that the Canadian government 
must take steps to restore the viability of Canada's railway 
industry. The most recent of these studies was conducted by the 
National Transportation Act Review Commission. In 1993 it wrote: 
If Canada is not prepared to pay the price of serious deterioration in 
the rail sector as the decade  progresses, it is indispensable that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15089"> 15089 </A></B>
<P>
carriers be authorized and encouraged to make the changes 
necessary to becoming competitive.
<P>
	The Commission also said that Canadian railways will be unable 
to contribute to making the national economy more competitive 
without major changes to their cost structures.
<P>
	The Bill the government is proposing to us today was therefore 
very much expected. Essentially, its objectives are to modernize 
railway legislation, to redefine the mandate of the National 
Transportation Agency and to rename it the Canadian 
Transportation Agency, and to further deregulate the airline 
industry.
<P>
	Although some of the proposed changes had been requested for 
some time, other proposals miss their target because of these 
measures are incomplete.
<P>
	For instance, one of the main provisions of this bill is to allow 
large national corporations like Canadian National and Canadian 
Pacific to get rid of rail lines that are no longer viable. Potential 
buyers would create so-called short line railways.
<P>
	This has been very successful in the United States. In fact, like 
us, the Americans have had to revamp their legislation and 
regulations on railway transportation. They did so in 1980, when 
they passed the Staggers Act. One of the measures included in the 
bill was the development of short line railways. Since the Staggers 
Act was passed, more than 250 short line railways have started 
operating in the United States. This proliferation of regional 
railway companies made it possible to recycle more than half of the 
surplus rail lines abandoned by the large railway companies. 
According to information provided by Canadian Pacific, these 
short line railways, and I quote: ``co-operate with the main rail 
carriers to provide efficient transportation for shippers located 
along lines with a lower traffic density''.
<P>
	In Canada, railway overcapacity is a major problem. In fact, 
according to CP Rail and I quote: ``more than half-53 per cent, to 
be exact-of the 20,000 kilometres of CP Rail tracks in Canada 
carry only 5 per cent of railway traffic. The situation is similar at 
CN''.
<P>
	The railway company adds: ``As far as CP's system is concerned, 
we are looking at more than 10,000 kilometres of rail that bring in 
insufficient revenue and on which millions of dollars in land taxes 
must be paid. -Establishing short line railways is one way of 
resolving the excess capacity problem. With their smaller cost 
structures, these railways are able to provide services that are not 
viable for larger railways''.
<P>
	The government claims to want to foster the establishment of 
short lines. In the background paper on this bill, the Canada 
Transportation Act, the government states that the new process was 
designed to encourage the sale or lease of rail lines to short line 
railways.
<P>
	To this end, the government suggests that major railway 
companies develop a three-year plan in which they will identify 
how they intend to dispose of their railway lines. CN and CP will 
be required to put up for sale those lines they no longer want to 
operate before they can abandon them.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Interested short line railways will have five months to come to 
an agreement with the national company, after which time, if no 
short line railway has come forward and no agreement was reached 
by the parties, the government, whether municipal, provincial or 
federal, will be entitled to exercise the option of operating the line. 
And, if no interest is expressed by any government, the company 
will then be allowed to just abandon the line.
<P>
	This is a simpler procedure than the one in place until now. It has 
the advantage of fostering the establishment of local and regional 
rail transport companies. However, the government went only 
halfway, failing to stimulate the development of these short line 
railways which could become major players in regional 
development. Moreover, the process provided in the bill to allow 
national railway companies to dispose of their railway lines is 
flawed in a number of ways.
<P>
	For instance, the establishment of short line railways will require 
huge capital investments on the part of those interested in such a 
venture. However, the federal government does not include any 
measure to facilitate the funding of these new ventures, unlike what 
the Americans did with the Staggers Act. For example, the 
government could have included loan protection measures to help 
establish these short lines.
<P>
	Also, it appears that, between the time when this bill is 
proclaimed and the time when CN and CP's three-year plans are 
available, there will be a gap during which railway companies will 
be able to divest themselves of part of their surplus lines, without 
any interested party having time to review the potential of these 
lines, or find the required capital to buy or rent them.
<P>
	Finally, the bill provides that, if no company is interested in 
operating a line declared to be surplus, or if no agreement is 
reached between the potential buyer and the railway company, 
governments will only have 15 days to decide whether or not to 
acquire that line. Such a deadline is definitely not reasonable, in 
my opinion. In imposing such a short time frame, the federal 
government adversely affects the regions, since they will simply 
not have time to inform their officials of the situation that will then 
prevail. These three flaws in the bill could jeopardize the 
establishment of short line railways. The government must make 
appropriate changes before the bill is passed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15090"> 15090 </A></B>
<P>
	As for airline transportation, the government is proposing a 
measure which gives me great concern. I am referring to clause 
70(2), which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister may, in writing to the Agency, designate any Canadian as 
eligible to hold a scheduled international licence and, while the designation 
remains in force, that Canadian remains so eligible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That clause must be repealed. Indeed, it is common knowledge 
that this government favours Canadian Airlines, at the expense of 
Air Canada, which is based in Montreal. To grant the Minister of 
Transport the discretionary power to decide who can hold an 
international licence when a transportation agency was established 
for that purpose is just plain unthinkable.
<P>
	Air service licensing should be open and impartial. The licensing 
process must not be subject to pressure from lobbyists, like it was 
last winter, when the Liberal government granted Air Canada only 
partial access to Hong Kong, while Canadian was granted 
unlimited access to the U.S., designated secondary carrier for 
Frankfurt as well as licensed to service Vietnam, the Philippines 
and Malaysia.
<P>
	As the official opposition's critic for Canadian heritage, I am 
baffled by the fact that this bill gives such discretionary power to 
the Minister of Transport. I am afraid that this could create a 
dangerous precedent and become standard practice in all federal 
departments.
<P>
	It worries me to think that such power could be given to, say, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage or the Minister of Industry 
regarding the CRTC. Imagine for a moment what could happen in 
Canada if, just by sending a memo to the CRTC, either of these 
ministers could make people eligible to hold a telecommunications 
or broadcasting licence. One can easily infer that, given such 
power, the government would not have had to issue an order in 
council to favour Power DirecTv.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Consequently, the Prime Minister's son-in-law would not have 
had to appear before the CRTC and American T.V. would have 
flooded the Canadian airwaves.
<P>
	Giving discretionary power to a minister jeopardizes collective 
good and interests. That is why I ask the government again to 
delete clause 70(2) from Bill C-101.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the 
motion to refer Bill C-101 to committee prior to second reading.
<P>
	This massive document is supposed to be the first step in moving 
toward a rail system that will survive into the 21st century. It falls a 
little short. The rail transportation system has undergone major 
changes in the past decades but nothing compared to what is 
needed to ensure its future contributions to Canada's transportation 
needs.
<P>
	The end of the Crow signalled the end of federal government 
subsidization of the railway companies. The rail companies must 
now be wholly dependent upon consumers paying for their services 
which is a novel idea in a country that has historically fostered 
government dependency.
<P>
	We commend the Liberal government for realizing that changes 
must take place in the rail industry, however there must be more 
than just a realization that changes must be made. Tinkering with 
the rail system will not get to the route of the problem.
<P>
	In the spring session we saw a number of bills rammed through 
the House without proper analysis.
<P>
	Bill C-89, the commercialization of CN Rail, was sent to 
committee directly following first reading. In theory this should 
have allowed the committee to seriously examine the legislation 
and make amendments prior to second reading. In practice, this 
was smoke and mirrors and referral to committee was a ploy to 
allow rapid passage of the bill by short circuiting debate.
<P>
	There should have been an opportunity to analyse the bill in 
detail but that never happened. The Liberal majority had no interest 
in even debating proposed amendments, much less giving them 
serious consideration. It now appears that Bill C-101 may be 
following the same fast track taken by Bill C-89.
<P>
	Other bills that followed a similar process in the spring session 
were Bill C-64 on employment equity and Bill C-69 on electoral 
boundaries. There were some amendments on that one but they 
were only Liberal amendments and then it was fast tracked 
through. Another was Bill C-91, reorganization of the Federal 
Business Development Bank, and on and on.
<P>
	The Reform Party will not be conned again into supporting this 
devious strategy. Bill C-101 has enormous implications for rail 
transportation in this country and it deserves serious assessment 
which it will not get if the government spirits it away to one of its 
neutered committees where the Liberals and the Bloc can, as usual, 
collude. They do not have to take seriously or even consider the 
smallest changes which we in the real opposition might propose.
<P>
	The Reform Party has categorically stated numerous times that 
distortions in the marketplace caused by subsidies and regulations 
must be removed. Although subsidies to the rail companies ended 
with the death of the Crow, many of the regulations will remain in 
place.
<P>
	I am going to briefly outline a number of concerns that Reform 
has with Bill C-101 with regard specifically to the agricultural 
sector. The legislation as it now stands calls for statutory review of 
the freight rate cap four years after the act comes into force. It will 
then be determined by the minister whether or not to repeal the cap 
and move toward a more market oriented system. It has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15091"> 15091 </A></B>
<P>
suggested that because a cap is a double edged  sword, rail 
companies will automatically charge the maximum freight allowed 
for as long as they can.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the move away from a regulated 
system toward a system where freight rates are freely negotiated 
between shippers and carriers. Having a maximum rate does little 
in the way of promoting efficiencies in the industry.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	We accept the need for a transition period between regulated 
rates and those determined through competition. This should be 
accomplished in the shortest possible time. Four years as originally 
proposed is ample, more than ample.
<P>
	A less regulated system will allow for more efficient rail 
transportation. Rail line rationalization of high cost, low volume 
branch lines will permit an overall reduction of system costs. 
Several grain companies and farmer owned groups are already 
preparing for this type of system by building high throughput 
elevators on economically viable rail lines.
<P>
	With respect to the creation of short lines, these should operate 
without government funding in locations where they will provide a 
viable cost effective alternative to other means of transportation. 
Short lines must be allowed to compete with other carriers on a 
level economic playing field. If they cannot compete, then they 
should not exist.
<P>
	There are competitive short lines in Canada. The line operated 
by Railtex between Truro and Sydney, Nova Scotia, the Cape 
Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway, carries coal, steel and 
general freight. Last year it had a profit of more than $3 million 
which was shared among the owners and employees. A second 
success story is the 70-mile Goderich-Exeter Railway, also 
operated by Railtex.
<P>
	Efficient cost conscious short lines work even when they are 
grain dependent. A couple of good examples are the little Southern 
Rails Co-operative in southern Saskatchewan and the 114-mile 
Northeast Kansas and Missouri line south of the border.
<P>
	A glaring fault in Bill C-101 is that under the proposed process 
for discontinuance, a railway company abandoning a branch line 
will be able to stifle competition by refusing to negotiate seriously 
with prospective buyers who want to operate a short line, 
notwithstanding section 144(3) which is window dressing. 
Canadian taxpayers, having financed these branch lines through the 
rehabilitation program in the 1970s and 1980s, have a very 
legitimate stake in this process.
<P>
	In order for a competitive transportation system to develop, 
cumbersome regulations and restraints must be lifted in all sectors. 
This is very evident in the marketing and transporting of grain. A 
large number of producers and shippers close to the United States 
no longer want to  be held captive by Canadian rail companies. 
Many farmers in southwestern Saskatchewan want to see more 
Canadian grain shipped on the U.S. rail system in order to take 
advantage of the efficient and economical elevation and terminal 
facilities south of the border. This would indirectly result in a more 
competitive environment for Canadian railways especially where, 
as in my riding, one carrier has a monopoly.
<P>
	In summary, there are a number of stakeholders with legitimate 
concerns about the proposed legislation. It is essential that these 
concerns be heard, reviewed and assessed accordingly. If the 
referral process to committee is just more smoke and mirrors on the 
part of the Liberals, then there is very little reason for the bill to go 
to committee.
<P>
	The Reform Party wants the consideration of legislation to be 
meaningful and open to all stakeholders. It therefore opposes the 
fast track ploy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-101, the Canada 
transportation act.
<P>
	It is important to note that the opportunity to speak on this bill 
prior to its going to committee is different from what the previous 
speaker from the Reform Party has indicated. It has really given the 
public a greater opportunity to put forward their concerns and to 
hopefully have them addressed and acted upon.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	Since the House was informed under Standing Order 73(1) of the 
intention to refer the bill to committee before second reading, there 
have been a lot of letters and submissions coming in to members of 
Parliament from provincial governments, organizations and 
individuals. I have found them in the main to be well thought out 
and well researched. This gives us the opportunity to investigate 
their concerns and apply some forethought to the bill from a 
number of different perspectives.
<P>
	Today I will address my remarks to some of the points being 
raised in some of those submissions, particularly points relative to 
the grain transportation industry and its impact on agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> In P.E.I.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> The member from Reform indicates in P.E.I. I have 
found the people from the prairies continue to come to some of us 
who did live out there for a while because they cannot get the kind 
of response they want through the Reform and they naturally have 
to come to the Liberals in other areas of the country.
<P>
	I bring these points up partly because of my past experience in 
this area and my identification of transportation as extremely 
important to the development of agriculture and the development 
of this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15092"> 15092 </A></B>
<P>
	During extensive hearings last spring the subcommittee on grain 
transportation which I chair, in reviewing the impact on 
agriculture of changes to the WGTA, ARFAA, MRFA and feed 
freight assistance, we heard a lot that relates to some of the 
Canadian transportation act points. We are currently awaiting a 
response from the government on some 14 recommendations.
<P>
	The minister was able to highlight the positive aspects of the 
legislation. I will try to highlight those aspects of the legislation 
which may-and I underline may-require adjusting and 
amendment.
<P>
	In April, Transport Canada briefed the provinces on the 
impending transport legislation. The four objectives outlined at 
that time were: one, allow the railways to dispose of surplus 
trackage by offering lines for sale to short line railways prior to 
initiating abandonment; two, maintain provisions in NTA 1987, 
which have improved bargaining of shippers and extend these 
provisions to shippers served by short line rails; three, provide for 
limited running rights for short line railways over CN and CP lines; 
and four, reduce regulatory controls on CN and CP providing the 
railways more freedom to manage. These objectives are sound but 
we must ensure the legislation actually meets these objectives.
<P>
	In a submission by the ministers of transportation for the three 
prairie provinces on Bill C-101, they claim the legislation does not 
meet these objectives. Although I will raise a number of points 
discussed by the prairie governments, I also want to indicate that a 
number of other submissions from prairie pools, UGG, NFU and 
others have raised similar concerns. I will table them to ensure the 
committee looks at them and considers them seriously.
<P>
	Having been a farm leader in the past I might say it is very, very 
important for the committee to develop an understanding of the 
people who are most affected by these changes. I would very much 
encourage the standing committee to get out of Ottawa, get away 
from the bureaucracy and go where the people are to hear their 
concerns relative to this bill. It is only in that way the committee 
will really understand the impact of this bill including how it will 
affect the lives of people especially those in the agricultural 
community.
<P>
	The three prairie provinces are specific in addressing their 
concerns the first of which is the role of the National 
Transportation Agency. The three prairie governments indicate in 
their submission: ``Bill C-101 significantly changes the scope and 
authority of the NTA. The Canadian transportation agency will no 
longer have the authority to initiate enquiries''. The prairie 
governments' submission continues: ``The result is greater 
restrictions on shipper access to the agency and a weakening of 
legislative provisions intended to address and/or redress situations 
where competition is weak or absent''.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	The committee has to go out to the prairies so it can understand 
where the prairie governments are coming from on that point of 
view and in order to get some balance so that there is fairness to the 
railways and to the communities and players involved.
<P>
	It is critical that the committee study these concerns to 
determine the possible amendments that may be required to 
address any shortcomings in the creation of the Canadian 
Transportation Agency.
<P>
	The second point is rail line abandonment. Prairie provincial 
governments in their submission outline their concerns as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-101 allows a railway to change its three-year plan without providing 
advance notice. A railway could indicate its intention to continue operating all 
of its lines and modify its plan each time it decides to sell or abandon a line. This 
would provide interested buyers only a minimum of 60 days to consider 
purchasing the line. This may not be sufficient time to develop a business plan 
and arrange suitable financing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That point should be looked at by the committee to ensure the 
public has the time and that part of the bill does not jeopardize 
efficiencies in the system. Bill C-101 must ensure the issues of 
notice and disinvestment by the major railways are addressed.
<P>
	The third point is legislative review. The prairie provinces and 
others have outlined that the review at the end of the four year 
period must address three specific issues besides the overview 
provided in the legislation: review financial performance of federal 
railways; assess the new line conveyance and abandonment 
procedures; assess provisions affecting the development and 
viability of short line railways. Those are important points.
<P>
	The subcommittee tabled its report in June. Included were a 
number of recommendations. A very important recommendation 
relates to short lines which really could create some efficiencies in 
western Canada and could ensure that if the short line were brought 
into place on lines targeted for abandonment, the farmers would 
have to haul their grain longer distances as abandonment would 
likely cause.
<P>
	Some key points raised in the report are: one, the appointing of 
an independent ombudsman to monitor freight rates; two, process 
of consultations with all affected parties prior to major decisions 
respecting grain handling and transportation; three, that there be 
appointed a consultant to undertake a special study to identify rail 
lines potentially operable by short line railways; four, that federal 
and provincial ministers meet to consider alternatives for 
approving branch line takeovers; five, that the cost benefit review 
of the NTA of grain dependent lines take into account total 
transportation efficiencies.
<P>
	I want to review the points in the act that the committee has to 
give serious concern to regarding  submissions coming from the 
agriculture community, particularly the west. I will not elaborate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15093"> 15093 </A></B>
<P>
on the points but simply indicate the clauses. Clauses 27.2, 34 and 
113 require extensive investigation by the committee.
<P>
	I hope the committee gives serious consideration to travelling. It 
should go out and develop an understanding. This bill has major 
implications. It can develop our future in a positive or a negative 
way. The government wants to develop it as positively as possible. 
To best do that we need input from the people most seriously 
affected.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleagues for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes and Rimouski, I think 
this bill lacks both transparency and clarity. This is why I will vote 
against it.
<P>
	In introducing Bill C-101, the government said it had three 
goals. First, it was to modernize legislation on rail transportation. 
Second, it was to redefine the mandate of the National 
Transportation Agency, which, in the future, would be called the 
Canadian Transportation Agency. Third, it was to further 
deregulate air transportation.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	With your permission, I will start with this last point, which, I 
must admit, causes me considerable concern. Clause 70 of the bill 
specifically provides that the minister must give his approval for 
the Agency to issue a licence to operate a scheduled international 
service.
<P>
	Thus, the minister is given full discretionary power in the issue 
or non issue of licences. This is a lot of power. I do not want to 
impute motives to the minister, but we have to admit that, in certain 
circumstances, a minister might well act a little less than rigorously 
and risk striking a nasty blow to this government's integrity and 
transparency.
<P>
	By way of example, we might recall the awarding of 
international air links and the treatment given Air Canada and 
Canadian Airlines International in this area. Is there some bias in 
favour of Canadian? I do not know. All I know is that these two 
companies do not compete on an equal footing.
<P>
	That same clause stipulates that the Minister shall also issue the 
same type of authorization to all non-Canadians wishing to hold 
this same type of licence. At this time, with Quebec sovereignty 
imminent, we have doubts about the Minister's ability to remain 
impartial despite all his good intentions. What guarantee do we 
have that Quebecers will be treated with the same concern for 
fairness and equality as anyone else? Might there not be another 
repetition of the double standard to which the federal government 
has accustomed us Quebecers ever since 1867?
<P>
	This is important. Last winter we were all in a position to see 
what solely political considerations and powerful lobby groups can 
accomplish, how they can influence government decisions. Keep in 
mind how Air Canada and Canadian Airlines contracts were 
awarded. Moreover, can we have any certainty that the minister's 
decisions will place public interest above everything else and, if so, 
how can we have that certainty?
<P>
	The government would have been far wiser to have taken 
advantage of the opportunity available in this bill to mandate the 
Agency to assess proposals from carriers and to decide on 
allocation of international routes through an impartial public quasi 
judicial process.
<P>
	Bill C-101 also affects the railways, and some of its provisions 
would benefit from a review. Clause 90 is a perfectly beautiful 
example of flexible federalism. While this government is 
unceasingly singing the praises of Canada with this bill, it is once 
again exhibiting an extremely unhealthy tendency to interfere in 
provincial jurisdictions. This government's flexible federalism 
means that the provinces give in and the federal government 
invades their jurisdictions.
<P>
	Take the short line railways, for instance, which are a purely 
provincial matter. Nevertheless, clause 90 of the bill authorizes 
Parliament to pass legislation declaring any railway, including 
short line railways, a work for the general advantage of Canada. 
Basically, this means that provincial legislation no longer applies 
and that the company is regulated by the federal government.
<P>
	While Quebec is doing everything in its power to encourage the 
creation of short line railways, the federal government, with its 
continuing tendency to interfere with the business and jurisdictions 
of the provinces, is doing everything it can to discourage or prevent 
Quebec investors from investing in short line railways.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Clauses 140 to 146 refer to the sale of railway lines. We read that 
potential investors have only 60 days to indicate their interest.
<P>
	Sixty days to indicate their interest, to make an assessment of 
and collect the capital required to purchase the lines available. This 
is hardly encouragement, unless it is supposed to encourage them 
to drop their plans.
<P>
	As a member from a region-the riding of Champlain-where 
railways are practically non-existent, I think I can say that this 
government gives no consideration to the development of the 
regions which, you may recall, were severely affected by the 
abandonment of branch lines. The federal government is letting the 
regions die a slow death.
<P>
	While the Quebec government supports decentralization towards 
the regions, the federal government is interested in the regions only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15094"> 15094 </A></B>
<P>
insofar as  that they give it an opportunity to interfere in areas 
under the jurisdiction of Quebec.
<P>
	As I read this bill, I wondered whether the Minister of Transport 
consulted his colleague, the Minister of the Environment, when the 
bill was being prepared. At a time when the Quebec government 
invests millions of dollars so people will ``think green'', when 
Quebec schools teach our children at an increasingly younger age 
about protecting the environment, the bill before the House today 
does not provide that the agency shall conduct an environmental 
study before authorizing the construction of a railway line. Why 
give more power to the auditor general under Bill C-83, if we 
cannot even ensure protection of the environment in an area 
relating to transportation?
<P>
	Is it not our duty as lawmakers to protect the future of our planet 
and, therefore, any legislation that could have an effect on the 
environment should contain clauses to ensure this protection.
<P>
	I cannot support this bill because it is unclear. It is totally vague. 
Is this government's trademark not its lack of clarity? The fog 
settles in without clarifying anything about the new Canadian 
transfer. And yet, the government was saying a few months ago that 
this was the key that would unlock Quebec's claims. The same was 
said about unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
	One thing is sure, Quebecers know the sort of society a yes vote 
will take them into. Whereas a no vote does not reveal what sort of 
Canada we will be in. No doubt it will be a foggy Canada, because 
discussions on this keep being put off.
<P>
	For these reasons, I will vote against Bill C-101.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to address the motion to refer Bill C-101 to the Standing 
Committee on Transport prior to second reading. As we are all 
aware, in the past a number of bills have been sent to committee 
prior to second reading. Bill C-45, Bill C-64, Bill C-89 and Bill 
C-91 are a few of the bills which have gone through that process.
<P>
	Originally Reformers supported this new process since we 
believed the government when it said MPs would play a much 
greater role in shaping legislation within committee. However, 
committee reform has come to represent yet another broken 
promise within the Liberal red ink book. That faulty document 
states that MPs will receive a greater role in drafting legislation 
through committees. It goes on to say that committees will also be 
given greater influence over government expenditures.
<P>
	It will come as no surprise to anyone who has sat on a committee 
that none of these things has come to pass. In most cases the 
opposite is true; the role of MPs at committee has been diminished 
or their efforts have been deliberately obstructed by Liberal 
committee members.
<P>
	The best example of this is the fiasco which arose over the 
committee hearings surrounding Bill C-64, an act respecting 
employment equity. As I mentioned earlier, this bill was sent to 
committee prior to second reading under the premise that it could 
be more easily studied there and amendments could be brought 
forward and discussed at length.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	However the proceedings were completely mismanaged and the 
whole examination of the bill was so skewed in favour of the 
government's position that Reformers boycotted the hearings. For 
instance, only four of the fifty witnesses to be called before the 
committee were accepted from the list submitted by the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	Furthermore, debate on each clause within the bill was limited to 
five minutes. This meagre five-minute allotment included the 
introduction of amendments, debate on the amendments and time 
to ask questions of departmental officials. Government members of 
the committee refused to accept amendments printed in only one of 
the official languages, and it is reported that numerous voting 
irregularities occurred. This was the new and improved committee 
process we were promised in the red book.
<P>
	Before referring Bill C-64 to committee prior to second reading 
on December 12, 1994, the minister of human resources stated that 
the process represented: ``innovation on the part of the government 
to turn over a bill after first reading to a committee so it can help in 
the actual drafting of the bill''.
<P>
	As we have heard, MPs from my party were allowed almost no 
input in the final drafting of Bill C-64. However the futility of 
committees is not constrained to that one example. If we turn to 
Bill C-89, a piece of legislation that would see the privatization of 
CN Rail, we can also point to instances whereby opposition MPs 
were simply ignored with respect to amending legislation.
<P>
	The Reform Party put forward a number of non-partisan 
amendments to the bill that were in the best interests of the 
Canadian National Railway, the industry and the taxpayer. Again 
these amendments were ignored and the bill was ultimately fast 
tracked with no amendments being introduced. MPs who were 
promised input into the legislative process were thwarted.
<P>
	Further, it comes as no surprise that the government fast tracked 
Bill C-89 and is now attempting to do the same with Bill C-101. 
Bill C-89 permits shares of CN Rail to go on sale this fall. Bill 
C-101 is an attempt to bring the Canadian rail industry into a more 
competitive position with respect to its U.S. counterparts. Bill 
C-101 attempts to make it easier to establish short line railways and 
abandon lines. It reduces the number of regulations and taxes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15095"> 15095 </A></B>
<P>
imposed on the rail industry. Should Bill C-101  be fast tracked, CN 
Rail shares will look more inviting to potential investors.
<P>
	In all, Bill C-101 is a huge piece of legislation which shippers, 
railways and provinces have serious concerns over. All these 
parties have a right to be heard and that right should not be denied 
because the government wants to ensure CN Rail shares will sell 
this fall.
<P>
	In August the minister of agriculture stated that the legislative 
process surrounding Bill C-101 would be open and amendment 
friendly. However, as I understand it, the Standing Committee on 
Transport has imposed arbitrary deadlines for submissions by 
stakeholders.
<P>
	Further, I am told that while submissions have been received by 
the committee, the committee has yet to make them available to 
committee members. Why should we believe the minister of 
agriculture or anyone else with respect to the promises of openness 
and thoroughness at the committee stage?
<P>
	The minister of human resources promised the same in relation 
to Bill C-64 and Reform MPs were shut out of that process as well. 
The government is long on promises, awarding MPs greater powers 
at committee stage. However it is short on delivering on promises, 
as we have already seen in a number of bills.
<P>
	Therefore it will come as no surprise to members of the Chamber 
that I cannot support the government's motion to refer the bill to 
committee prior to second reading. Reformers will not assist in fast 
tracking such an important piece of legislation to spruce up CN 
Rail's profile for sale of its shares this fall. Reformers will not help 
the government limit access to committee hearings under any 
circumstances.
<P>
	All parties affected by Bill C-101 have a right to come forward 
and be heard. We gave the government the benefit of the doubt and 
supported its promises of parliamentary reform through the 
committee reform system. It has done nothing to revamp the 
process and its promises amounted to nothing but so much Liberal 
hot air, of which we have had enough in the Chamber, let alone at 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	I guess committee reform will just have to be added to the long 
list of Liberal broken promises. Accordingly I will not support the 
motion presently under debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak to Bill C-101 respecting the Canada Transportation Act. In 
my capacity as chairperson of SCOT I had originally planned to 
speak to the bill after committee review. I believe it is my first duty 
to hear and evaluate the concerns and issues raised by various 
stakeholders who may be affected by the legislation to ensure an 
effective legislative process.
<P>
	Speaking of process, I was listening very carefully to the 
misleading statements made by the member for  Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke and felt compelled to respond. A full seven 
minutes of the ten-minute slot allotted to the member to speak to 
Bill C-101 were devoted to procedural matters that were not at all 
relevant to the substance of the bill. Plain and simple, the member 
chose to play politics, something the third party promised not to do 
when elected to the House.
<P>
	Bill C-101 was introduced in the House by the Minister of 
Transport on June 20. Privileged to be the chairperson of the 
Standing Committee on Transport, I attempted with the consensus 
of committee members, as stated in my letter to the stakeholders 
dated July 17, 1995, to ``solicit written submissions throughout the 
remainder of July and August in order to ensure that you and other 
stakeholders have ample opportunity to apprise committee 
members of your concerns prior to formal consideration of the 
legislation in the fall''.
<P>
	In other words, I first appealed to the opposition members of 
both parties to proceed with a pre-study of the bill. The notion was 
flatly rejected. Step two was to make an appeal to the stakeholders, 
as previously stated, to send along their written submissions to give 
committee members, especially members of the third party, an idea 
of the concerns raised by stakeholders as early in the process as 
possible.
<P>
	I asked them to prepare not 25 copies as alleged by the member 
for Kootenay West-Revelstoke earlier this day but 15 copies, if 
possible, to cut down on committee expenses, something else the 
third party preaches ad nauseam. We also asked that submissions 
be sent in both official languages. Unfortunately many were not. 
Therefore, before the clerk could circulate the submissions, we had 
to have them translated and that takes time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Tell your colleague from Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand that at all times 
matters of importance bring out strong views and strong feelings. 
However I remind all members to make their interventions through 
the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> There was no secret agenda to hold back 
submissions as the hon. member for the third party has suggested. I 
explained all this to the member verbally last week. I went over 
there, sat down, explained it all to him, and then I followed it up 
with a formal letter addressing each and every one of the concerns 
he raised in the House today.
<P>
	That did not satisfy the member opposite, not at all. Finally and 
quite frankly the chairperson, committee members, the 
government-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> And the parliamentary secretary.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15096"> 15096 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> And the parliamentary secretary, the member for 
London East. We are doing our level best to produce effective 
legislation.
<P>
	Because of my appeal to the stakeholders backed by the 
consensus of the committee in July, our committee clerk has 
received over 70 written submissions and close to 100 requests to 
appear before the Standing Committee on Transport. We have done 
our homework.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	I assure the House and all my colleagues that, as I stated in my 
letter to the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke, every 
stakeholder who has contacted the committee clerk to appear 
before the Standing Committee on Transport is being provided with 
the opportunity to do so with or without a written submission.
<P>
	We look forward to working on Bill C-101 as put forward by the 
Minister of Transport to create the effective legislation the country 
needs to go into the next century with a transportation system that 
will be unmatched by any other country in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to commence, albeit briefly, debate on the 
bill. I recognize that in only a few minutes we will be adjourning to 
commence proceedings under Standing Order 31.
<P>
	However, in the few moments afforded me, I want to talk about 
the bill in question respecting the Canada Transportation Act.
<P>
	I guess it is now time for question period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We always welcome astute comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It being two o'clock p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the 
House will now proceed to statements by members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada to overturn 
legislation passed by the House regarding the advertising of 
tobacco products is the latest evidence of a shifting balance of 
power away from Parliament toward the unelected and 
unaccountable Supreme Court.
<P>
	In this and other decisions the court has extended the rights of 
individual citizens to business corporations as presumed legal 
individuals. This presumption has transformed the charter from a 
guarantor of individual rights to a political lever that allows 
corporations to evade the legitimate regulatory actions of a 
democratically elected government and House of Commons.
<P>
	In addition, the court has also in some cases interpreted laws or 
extended them in ways deliberately not articulated by Parliament at 
the time the law was passed. This growing shift in power toward 
the court requires new measures to improve the accountability of 
the court.
<P>
	I call on the government to consider a royal commission to 
propose measures that would add transparency to and wider 
participation in the process of selecting Supreme Court judges in a 
manner consistent with our parliamentary system of government.

emerging new economy. It is leading in the area of making 
governments more user friendly and making it easier for Canadian 
businesses to compete in the global economy.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments will combine efforts on 
trade promotion and will share information on export programs. 
The program being announced today in Fredericton is to be known 
as ``Trade Team New Brunswick'', the first of its kind in Canada. 
This program will simplify the process of helping exporters 
develop new markets.
<P>
	Under the trade team concept an entrepreneur will be able to get 
information on both governments' programs from any economic 
agency of either level of government. The trade team concept is a 
result of ten months of work by eight different government 
agencies.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this fall is an anniversary of sorts for the Liberal

of the Pearson airport contract.
<P>
	For two years the government has claimed the process was 
corrupt and yet for the same two years it has not produced one 
substantive piece of evidence demonstrating its alleged corruption.
<P>
	For two years the government has claimed it was not a good 
financial deal for Canadians in spite of government documentation 
to the contrary, and yet for the same two years it has not come up 
with an alternative plan.
<P>
	For two years the government has claimed that failure to pass 
Bill C-22 has resulted in its inability to deal with the problem in 
spite of the fact there is no injunction standing in its way and the 
Pearson Development Corporation has not requested specific 
performance in its court action.
<P>
	Witnesses under oath at the Senate inquiry made allegations 
which indicate the cancellation of Pearson is nothing more than a 
snit by the Prime Minister against the principal partner in the deal 
who had the audacity to donate to the Prime Minister's main 
opponent in his leadership campaign.

	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Parti Quebecois Premier made use of something said 
by one of the executives of the Bank of Montreal to reaffirm his 
confidence in the economic future of an independent Quebec. It is 
paradoxical, to say the least, to see the head of the Parti Quebecois 
using the words of a representative of the Bank of Montreal to 
support his separatist pretensions. In June 1994, the same man was 
publicly inviting Quebecers who did business with the Bank of 
Montreal to pull out of the institution because its chief economist 
had dared to say that the election of the Parti Quebecois would 
make the money markets extremely nervous.
<P>
	This is a fine example of the separatists' double standard. If you 
make a statement in favour of Quebec independence one day, you 
are quoted publicly. Then, another day, if you say something 
against separation, you become the target of the PQ's big guns. So 
much for intellectual impartiality.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans,

by far when it comes to federal expenditures for job creation. A 
study commissioned by the Bélanger-Campeau Commission 
concluded that the current level of federal expenditures for job 
creation in Quebec is far below the average. Since statistics have 
been available, Quebec has not received its share of funding from 
Ottawa aimed at bolstering the economy, whereas Ontario has had 
the lion's share, whether federal purchases of goods and services, 
capital investments, research and development, defence spending, I 
could go on and on.
<P>
	With the cuts that were announced in the last federal budget not 
only will development continue in Ontario, but Quebec will not 
even receive the amount of social transfers it was receiving in the 
past. That is an excellent reason for a yes vote this coming October 
30.

sole access to every service from medical health to the mail.
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has said the salmon 
resource will prevent bridge demolition and reconstruction until

negotiation with the future partners before an independent Quebec

	This list of preferential acts and regulations Quebec currently 
enjoys as a province of Canada would no longer be covered by the

would be best assured of protecting these various sectors of activity 
by remaining in Canada, and this is what the people will say on

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RESEARCHANDDEVELOPMENT">RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Friday, the Prime Minister refused to take part in a 
four-way public debate on the political future of Quebec and asked 
the official opposition to give him one good reason to vote Yes on 
October 30. Here is one good reason among many others, and I am 
referring to Ottawa's ongoing under-investment in research and 
development spending in Quebec, which is otherwise a preferred 
way to create new jobs. I may recall that Quebec receives only 18.6 
per cent of federal funding, as opposed to 50 per cent for Ontario.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What explanation 
does he have for the fact that the federal government is depriving 
Quebec of its fair share of research and development and has done 
so for nearly 20 years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, Quebec receives more than its share of research and 
development funding. The figures quoted by the Leader of the 
Opposition assume that money spent within the national capital 
area only benefits Ontario, while in my riding, I have 1,700 people 
who work in research and development institutions on the Ottawa 
side.
<P>
	This is the wrong way to look at spending. In fact, when we 
exclude the National Capital area, we see that nearly 30 per cent of 
research and development spending goes to Quebec, which 
represents only 24.9 per cent of the population.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we exclude Ottawa, if we forget that Ottawa is in 
Ontario, if we overlook the fact that jobs created on the Ontario 
side benefit Ontario, that taxes are paid in Ontario, that contracts 
are awarded in Ontario and that research networks are created in 
Ontario, then he is right. However, Ottawa will not go away.
<P>
	It so happens that Quebec receives only 13.8 per cent of Ottawa's 
research and development spending in its laboratories within the 
national capital area. Only 13 per cent is done in Quebec and the 
rest on the Ontario side.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister, and my question is directed to him since 
he is ultimately responsible-since he will not go on television, he 
can at least answer me here-will the Prime Minister-unless he 
sends his ineffable minister who just replied-will the Prime 
Minister at least admit that the federal government systematically 
discriminates against Quebec when distributing funding for 
research among its own laboratories?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the Leader of the Opposition is getting a bit upset. 
The answers given by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
were quite clear.
<P>
	Here in the national capital, some people live in Quebec and 
work on this side of the river, while some people on this side of the 
river work on the other side. The minister just said that in his 
riding, Hull-Aylmer, on that side, 1,700 residents work on 
research and development in laboratories on this side, in the 
national capital. If we exclude the national capital, in other words, 
if we compare Quebec with the other provinces, Quebec receives 
more than its share.
<P>
	It has 24 per cent of the population and receives 30 per cent. That 
is clear, if we compare Quebec with Saskatchewan and Ontario 
with Quebec. Here in the national capital, we share and share alike. 
We have lived together for more than a century and will continue to 
live together for another hundred years.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all but a few-three, four or five-research centres are 
located on the Ontario side. Dozens of federal research centres are 
located in Ontario. The Prime Minister should at least acknowledge 
this basic truth, which is that Quebec has always been denied its 
fair share in research and development. Many have acknowledged 
this before him, so he could make a gesture today and admit it.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	We know that Quebec receives federal help on social assistance, 
unemployment insurance and equalization, but this spending does 
not create jobs or stimulate the Quebec economy in any way.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister admit that Ottawa's chronic 
underinvestment in research and development, which creates jobs, 
is the reason why Quebec is so dependent on unproductive federal 
contributions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada developed in such a way that today, for example, 
the aeronautical industry is concentrated in Quebec. It could have 
been elsewhere in Canada, but that is the way things turned out.
<P>
	Some sectors are concentrated in Quebec, some in Ontario, some 
in other provinces, so that Canada manages to develop in an 
equitable way. But there is always room for improvement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15101"> 15101 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not saying that Canada cannot be improved; it can always 
be improved. But one should not separate from a country simply 
because of petty quarrels on approximate budget levels on one side 
or another. One can find all kinds of justifications. For example, 
Quebec naturally receives money for national ports but, because 
it is in the middle of the Prairies, we have not yet dug a river in 
Saskatchewan so that we can give that province its share of the 
national ports budget. That province does not receive anything for 
national ports but it does not complain about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what an 
extraordinary leap of logic.
<P>
	The federal government is about to sign with GM, in Ontario, a 
major contract worth as much as $2 billion for the acquisition of 
armoured vehicles. Despite the intergovernmental affairs 
minister's attempt to reassure Oerlikon in Quebec, a GM 
spokesperson clearly indicated that Oerlikon was not a contender 
for the armoured turrets subcontract, in spite of the fact that 
Oerlikon is the Canadian center of excellence for this kind of work.
<P>
	Given that, in the past 15 years, Quebec has been shortchanged 
by at least $10 billion in the distribution of federal military 
expenditures, why would the Prime Minister not give Quebecers 
the assurance that they will get their fair share of the economic and 
technological benefits associated with the generous contract which 
was awarded to General Motors instead of Oerlikon?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, to date, no 
contract has been signed with General Motors, and the question of 
content will be addressed as part of the contract negotiations.
<P>
	As for Oerlikon, there have been discussions between officials of 
my department, other departments and General Motors to examine 
the possibility of including Oerlikon in GM's plans for 
manufacturing armoured personnel carriers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadian 
prime ministers have been promising for decades to remedy the 
situation. Yet, no corrective action has ever been taken.
<P>
	How can the defence minister explain the statement he made 
about this contract on Radio-Canada's television program <I>Enjeux</I>, 
that the federal government cannot afford to be fair to Quebec? 
How does he justify making such a statement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not unusual 
but the hon. member has taken the words I used on that television 
program entirely out of context. What I stated was that the mandate 
of the Canadian Armed Forces is to deliver its services in the 
fastest, most efficient way possible.
<P>
	We have to do that sometimes without having regard to the 
expenditures of national defence being equitable in every single 
region. Part of that problem harks back to the second world war 
when a disproportionate amount of Canadian forces infrastructure 
and spending was in the Atlantic provinces because it was a staging 
area for war. This has tended to disfavour certain regions.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	In spite of that, I would like to point out to the hon. member that 
in the 1994-95 fiscal year 20 per cent of military spending and 27 
per cent of the capital expenditures were made in the province of 
Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Media reports today maintain that documents received from the 
Department of National Defence through access to information 
have been falsified. One of these documents had entire sections 
deleted and the Department of National Defence did not indicate 
any omissions but presented it as an accurate copy of the original. 
Another document had not only been edited but entire sections had 
been rewritten in order to misrepresent statements which were 
damaging to the Department of National Defence in the original.
<P>
	I demand that the Minister of National Defence explain the 
actions of his department to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a review of 
certain access to information requests made of the department, it 
was discovered that certain errors and omissions had occurred. 
Immediately when that was made known to senior officials, I was 
informed. An investigation has ensued. The information 
commissioner has also been informed and we would like to know 
why this state of events has occurred.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on Friday the Prime Minister assured the House and 
all Canadians that the government takes responsibility for making 
sure that the Somalia commission has all the facts. Today's 
revelations call into question the government's commitment. The 
Department of National Defence has turned over mountains of 
material to the commission.
<P>
	If the Department of National Defence is capable of falsifying 
documents to the media, how can Canadians be sure it is not 
altering evidence to the commission of inquiry in a similar fashion?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15102"> 15102 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> I certainly do not accept the 
premise in the hon. member's question.
<P>
	It is quite obvious that some erroneous thing has happened which 
is being investigated. Certainly we stand by what we have said 
repeatedly and what the Prime Minister said Friday, that all 
documentation will be made available and all co-operation will be 
given by the Department of National Defence to the inquiry.
<P>
	We would like to know why these omissions did occur. We acted 
responsibly by informing the information commissioner. As soon 
as we know why this happened we will certainly make that public.
<P>
	It was the department officials themselves once they found the 
errors who called in the person who had originally made the 
request. They were quite open and honest about this particular 
mistake that had occurred.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has consistently 
expressed confidence in his department officials despite recurring 
charges of mismanagement, poor judgment and misconduct.
<P>
	Another internal inquiry is utterly unacceptable. The DND 
hierarchy is absolutely unable to investigate itself. The evidence of 
these documents suggests possible criminal behaviour.
<P>
	Will the minister treat this as a criminal matter within his 
department which is separate from the Somalia inquiry and 
immediately call in the RCMP to investigate the Department of 
National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would not 
preclude any measure that might be taken with respect to this 
matter. Initially we are investigating it ourselves. Should it warrant 
investigation by an outside agency such as the RCMP, that will 
done.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	In order to lessen the consequences of the closure of the base in 
Chatham, New Brunswick, the minister forced the bidders for the 
program of refurbishment of armoured vehicles to do the work in 
Chatham, where there is no expertise in the field. Yet, in 
Saint-Jean, Quebec, the government closed the Military College, 
reduced the staff and the activities of the base, with dire 
consequences for the region's economy, but offered no 
compensation whatsoever.
<P>
	How does the minister justify, on the one hand, compensating 
Chatham for the losses while, on the other, refusing to give 
Oerlikon of Saint-Jean the same incentives he gave GM, and this 
despite the fact that Oerlikon has unique expertise in the area of 
gun turrets?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the armoured 
personnel carrier contract, the refurbishment of the old carriers and 
the direction of part of that work to Chatham-and the hon. 
member conveniently forgot to mention that most of the work on 
the refurbishment would be done at the defence workshops in the 
east end of Montreal-do not constitute any reparation or 
compensation for base closures. We have categorically ruled that 
out.
<P>
	If we can assist a community, whether it is Chatham, Saint-Jean, 
Quebec, Calgary or anywhere else where base closures have been 
announced, by directing or encouraging suppliers to do business 
with a base or make purchases or manufacture in certain regions, 
then we would do so.
<P>
	What we have said because of all of the closures-the one at 
Chatham being the most devastating in terms of its regional 
impact-is that any contractor who wishes to carry out a small part 
of the work of refurbishment would have to stipulate that the work 
be done in Chatham, New Brunswick. I think that is fair and 
equitable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did 
not forget the whole business of refurbishing the armoured 
vehicles, but I remind the minister that he specified that contracts 
would be in Chatham, whether there is expertise there or not.
<P>
	Should I understand that when it comes to Ontario and New 
Brunswick the Minister of National Defence does not hesitate to 
compensate for closures, protect jobs and even create new ones, 
whereas for Quebec there is no maintenance work provided for the 
old armoured vehicles? The Prime Minister wants us to give him 
good reasons to vote yes, here is one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member is quick to criticize the government, especially on defence 
reductions.
<P>
	First, I have to remind the hon. member that it was his party in 
the last election that called for a 25 per cent reduction in defence 
spending.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member has the Canadian forces base 
Valcartier near his constituency. He conveniently forgets  to tell 
you, Mr. Speaker, that actually defence expenditures at Valcartier 
have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15103"> 15103 </A></B>
<P>
been increased in the last couple of years when other regions have 
suffered.
<P>
	Third, he conveniently forgets to say that the majority of the 
refurbishment work is going to be done in an area of very high 
unemployment, the east end of Montreal, because the defence 
workshops there are the most able to perform that work. He does 
not tell us all of that.

race is included in the 1996 census because a specific question on 
racial origin would be beneficial for a wide range of purposes.
<P>
	However, question 19 is inconsistent as it confuses race, 
nationality and geographic location. It would allow the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration to claim to be a visible minority 
because of his Latin American birth.
<P>
	Can any minister advise the House of one purpose this question

<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and

her question. Every five years Statistics Canada gathers important 
information to allow the government to fulfil its programs and 
commitments to Canadians.
<P>
	In this context, the questions which have been developed for the 
1996 census are eminently reasonable and sensible.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians filling out this question will have 
the option of stating whether they are one of the following 
nationalities: Chinese, Filipino, Japanese or Korean. However, 
most immigrants, or descendants of immigrants from these 
countries, consider themselves to be proud Canadians but they 
cannot indicate that.
<P>
	Is the government prepared to stop the practice of creating 
hyphenated Canadians by adding another nationality to the list, 
Canadian?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and

to read question 17. Question 17 asks to which ethnic or cultural 
group does this person's ancestors belong. In Question 17, one of 
the answers is Canadian.

question is for the Minister of Finance, who is responsible for 
regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	When it was first announced that the Canadian space agency 
would be located in Saint-Hubert, we were told that federal 
aerospace research would be conducted in Quebec. However, 
aerospace research centres, which have a combined budget of close 
to $45 million, have remained in Ottawa.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance, who is responsible for regional 
development in Quebec, agree that maintaining space research 
activities in Ottawa, rather than centralizing them in Saint-Hubert, 
close to the space agency, favours Ontario at the expense of 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the aerospace 
industry employs over 32,000 people in Quebec, thanks to the 
federal programs in that sector. The fact is that the agency is there. 
It is not in Ottawa. As a Montrealer, the hon. member should know 
that there is a great deal of work in research and development. The 
agency is located in her riding. The member should be very proud 
of that and she should know that there is a lot of R and D being 
conducted, that a lot of work is being contracted out, and that many 
jobs were created thanks to federal activities in her riding.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the minister claim that Quebec was treated fairly by the federal 
government regarding federal research centres, considering that 
these centres employ only 3,000 people in Quebec, compared to 
11,000, or almost four times more, in Ontario? Is this not another 
good reason to vote Yes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, Quebec's 
pharmaceutical industry exists thanks to federal programs. The 
aerospace industry exists thanks to federal programs. As for the 
computer industry as a whole, Quebec entrepreneurs are successful 
in these sectors thanks to federal programs.
<P>
	If we look at R and D grants, Quebec gets over 40 per cent thanks 
to federal programs. The truth is that the federal government has 
built on the enormous capabilities of our entrepreneurs and, instead 
of criticizing us, the hon. member should take pride in their 
success.

recognized in the telecommunications area that our structure in 
terms of foreign investment is appropriate. They are looking at and

	The Prime Minister asked us to find good reasons to vote Yes in

Quebec has never had its fair share of federal spending in this area.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance, who is responsible for regional

done nothing in the past two years to redress a long standing 
injustice with respect to research and development in federal

the R&amp;D budget although it represents 25 per cent of the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

Canada Opportunities Agency. Can the minister tell the House and

benefits it brings to the region and what is his response to the 
criticism from the third party?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member 
knows, the government committed itself both in the throne speech 
and in subsequent budgets to developing strong regional 
economies.
<P>
	Regional development agencies by their very nature are 
decentralized institutions committed to working with the private 
sector, provincial governments, universities and other community 
organizations.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada, ACOA has been able to facilitate the private 
sector and its success rate is approximately 94 per cent.
<P>
	I said to committee members that there are bound to be setbacks. 
There will probably be setbacks in the future, but at a success rate 
of 94 per cent when the federal government contributes one dollar 
under that particular agency it generates $4.20.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
criminal element in Ipperwash has led insurance companies to 
declare that the whole area of Ipperwash is an area of insurrection 
and rebellion. The solicitor general has decided to pass the buck 
and lay blame at the feet of the Ontario Provincial Police.
<P>
	Now the provincial police is on a heightened state of alert 
because of a potential land grab by militant natives at the 
2,000-acre Pinery Provincial Park this Thanksgiving weekend.
<P>
	Will the solicitor general declare these renegades a national 
security threat and deal with them immediately? When will the 
minister put the safety of Canadians ahead of the interests of thugs 
and criminals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the matter is clearly under the jurisdiction of the Ontario provincial 
government through its police of local jurisdiction, the Ontario 
Provincial Police.
<P>
	If the Ontario government through the Ontario Provincial Police 
feels that it needs assistance, there are recognized procedures in 
place to request such assistance. If a request is made it will be 
given very active and immediate consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
solicitor general should do his job and make sure that the law is 
applied equally. Ipperwash is just one example of organized 
criminals getting out of control.
<P>
	Since he does not believe it is a national security threat, how 
about the biker wars in Montreal and Toronto? These wars are 
being waged over the control of the drug trade, gun smuggling, 
prostitution and other contraband. The pipeline for this contraband 
is Akwesasne, Oka and Kanesatake.
<P>
	If he does not believe this is a national security threat, will the 
solicitor general tell Canadians what is a national security threat, 
what is organized crime, and his reasons for not acting?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
under our Constitution the administration of justice is a provincial 
responsibility. The federal government cannot simply walk in and 
tell the Ontario Provincial Police or the Quebec Provincial Police 
to leave and let somebody else do their job. If they feel they need 
assistance there are provisions in place for that assistance to be 
requested and, if so, it will be responded to in a quick and effective 
way.
<P>
	We are there to help law enforcement across the country. We 
want to see the laws enforced in an equitable and firm way across 
the country, but we are not in a position to tell, like the hon. 
member, that we do not think the Ontario Provincial Police or the 
Quebec Provincial Police can do its job. I am sure he should have, 
as a former member of a local police force, more respect for and 
confidence in similar police forces across the country.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. 
Since the last federal election, Quebec has been awarded only 13 
per cent of the research and development contracts of the 
Department of Natural Resources. Turning the clock back a little, 
Quebec has received under 10 per cent of research and 
development contracts for the past six years, a shortfall for the 
Quebec laboratory industry and Quebec researchers of tens of 
millions of dollars. Another good reason, Mr. Prime Minister, for a 
yes vote.
<P>
	Because the Minister of Natural Resources has long been aware 
of the situation, what steps has she taken to ensure that Quebec 
obtains its full share of research and development contracts from 
her department?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me provide the hon. member this afternoon with 
some very good reasons why Quebecers should vote to stay in 
Canada.
<P>
	In the Department of Natural Resources we have a substantial 
presence in the province of Quebec. Let me share with the hon. 
member some examples: our annual contribution to Forintek 
Canada, which recently established its eastern office in Quebec 
City; funding provided to the Centre canadien de fushion 
magnétique; the establishment of the Canadian Centre for 
Geomatics in Sherbrooke; and let us not forget the work done at the 
Varennes laboratories pertaining to energy efficiency and 
alternative energy.
<P>
	The financial infusion of my department into Quebec is strategic 
and represents targeted investments that will ensure not only 
Quebec's long term economic future but the future of our nation.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that only amounts to 13 per cent, which is peanuts. You 
know very well that Quebec is being had all down the line.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, you must always address the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	So the minister knows very well that Quebec has been had all 
down the line in research and development. Ten or thirteen per cent 
is far from our share. She could give us a long list; we would not be 
impressed.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. Mr. Prime 
Minister, how do you justify-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> No, no. ``How does the Prime Minister 
justify''-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Pardon me. I should address you, Mr. Speaker. 
I got it wrong. I am all mixed up today.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister justify his minister and his 
government's inaction in a matter in which Quebec is clearly 
wronged?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Natural Resources clearly showed a few 
minutes ago that she was not at all mixed up.
<P>
	In Canada, we always try for a balance in all areas possible, but it 
is mathematically impossible for the proportions to be the same in 
each area for each province. Some provinces are smaller, some are 
bigger. It depends on circumstances. On the whole, however, the 
distribution of laboratories, research and development in Canada 
has been very fair. When I visit Quebec, I realize some sectors have 
benefited enormously from research and development in Canada. 
Aeronautics, as I said earlier, is concentrated in Quebec. In the 
Montreal region, Canadair is expanding considerably. Pratt &amp; 
Whitney is another of the major specialty firms. It has gained a 
reputation for manufacturing engines not only in Canada, but 
throughout America.
<P>
	So we do a lot and we will do even more in the future, that is 
certain, because once the situation in Canada becomes extremely 
stable, as it will on October 31, Canada will enjoy a new period of 
prosperity, and we will be able to share even more.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government subsidizes VIA Rail to the tune of 
over $800,000 a day.
<P>
	Last spring VIA ran a 50 per cent off special. The consequences 
of this action were twofold. First, privately run bus companies were 
forced to lay off workers due to the fact they could not compete 
with twice subsidized rates. Second, the Canadian taxpayer ended 
up paying for the 50 per cent cuts. Now VIA is at it again offering 
50 per cent off rates for the winter and the fall.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Transport. When will he do 
the responsible thing and put an end to this grotesque abuse of 
taxpayers' dollars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the future of passenger rail in the country is certainly in 
doubt. When we look at what the hon. member has just suggested 
in terms of the overall subsidy paid to VIA Rail and to other 
non-VIA passenger services, we have to be extremely careful about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15107"> 15107 </A></B>
<P>
how we  will handle the very strong demand on Canadian taxpayers 
for a subsidy.
<P>
	Surely even the hon. member would agree that since VIA is 
running trains on a number of corridors throughout the country we 
should try to keep them as full as possible and try to avoid as much 
of a drain as possible on Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again the government is competing against the 
private sector and using taxpayers' dollars to do so. There is only 
one way to deal with the situation: privatize VIA Rail and end the 
squandering of public funds.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Transport make the logical and ethical 
decision and introduce legislation that will commence the 
privatization of VIA Rail?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have already indicated that as the budget called for last 
year Transport Canada is looking at all its activities and all areas in 
which we have subsidies.
<P>
	I am glad to see the hon. member believes we should be 
eliminating subsidies. I hope he will speak to some of his 
colleagues who are having second thoughts about some of the 
subsidies that have been eliminated so far.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member that we will be taking into account the 
need to look at the future of VIA.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	Now that the province of Ontario, the province of Quebec and 
the Government of Canada have made public the report on high 
speed rail, we believe the time has come to look very carefully at 
what the future of VIA and other passenger services in the country 
should be. Certainly, as has been the case in the past, we will be 
looking at privatization as one of those options.

<P>
	Canadians expect a lot from Canada Customs in its 
responsibility for our international border. On the one hand we 
expect it to keep our streets and communities safe from smuggled 
guns, drugs and pornography. On the other hand we expect customs 
to speed the passage of tourists and goods into Canada because 
tourism and trade mean jobs in this country.
<P>
	What is the Minister of National Revenue doing to improve 
service at Canada's borders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member is quite right that we do expect a lot from 
Canada Customs. Indeed it performs very well. It is one of the best 
customs services in the world.
<P>
	Recently we worked on the accord between the President of the 
United States, Mr. Clinton, and the Prime Minister of Canada with 
respect to making the border easier for people who are regular 
travellers and those who pose no great risk to either country.
<P>
	We have instituted a number of programs, CANPASS for the 
airports, CANPASS for rail and land traffic, CANPASS for boats, 
which allow people to get across the border substantially faster 
than before. At the same time it frees up resources for special teams 
where we feel there are areas of higher risk. It is this weeding out 
areas of higher risk from those of lower risk which we think will be 
the future of our services.

<P>
	In a letter to the Minister of Natural Resources, a group of 
Quebec organizations, including the Union des municipalités du 
Québec, is demanding $80 million from the federal government to 
compensate for its complete withdrawal from the funding of the 
private forestry sector by April 1996.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Natural Resources intend to agree to the 
Quebec partners' request and to compensate the thousands of 
Quebec forestry workers abandoned by the federal government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member well knows because of his interest 
in the forestry sector in Quebec, it was the previous government 
that decided to cancel FRDA or Federal-Provincial Forest Resource 
Development Agreements. Because of the sorry state of the 
finances of the nation left to us by the previous government, we had 
no choice but to confirm that decision of the previous government. 
Therefore FRDA will expire across the nation as their due dates 
come upon us.
<P>
	Let me say that because of program review my department had 
to reassess its priorities. The Department of Natural Resources is 
not a department of regional economic development. It is primarily 
a department of science and technology. We are working very 
closely with our provincial counterparts and industry to ensure the 
forestry sector has the science and technology base it needs to 
compete with the best in the world.

our position is well known by the Canadian public, by the French

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I had just started to make my remarks a few 
moments before two o'clock. Before I got into full flight I was 
interrupted for question period. I want to resume where I left off by 
applauding the Minister of Transport for bringing forward Bill 
C-101.
<P>
	Bill C-101 is there to modernize Canada's transportation system. 
This task has not been easy to undertake but this minister is up to it. 
He is certainly someone who is not afraid of these challenges and 
of dealing with issues involving our transportation sector. 
Transport is one of the largest if not the largest departments of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	The constituency of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell has a number 
of rail lines running through it. The Ottawa to Montreal CN rail line 
obviously runs through through Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. 
Perhaps I should not say obviously but virtually the only way of 
getting between the two cities is to travel through my riding. The 
train goes through such communities as Alexandria, Maxville and 
others between Ottawa and Montreal.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15111"> 15111 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Some years ago I was very concerned because of a fear that CN 
would attempt to close down the rail line between Ottawa and 
Montreal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This fear was justified as one CN document called for the closing 
of the rail line between the communities of Glen Robertson and 
Ottawa in Ontario, so that there would no longer have been a 
railway line for VIA passenger trains between Ottawa and 
Montreal, except if VIA had wanted to acquire the line abandoned 
by CN.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The second concern in my constituency was that if the line was 
abandoned there would not be enough interest or possibility of 
converting part of what was left of that line into a short line 
railroad.
<P>
	This was particularly disconcerting at the time because we had at 
one point an NDP government in Ontario, although luckily we are 
rid of it now. I invite my colleague from Winnipeg to listen to this 
attentively because he will realize the damage that government was 
doing in Ontario.
<P>
	It passed the successor rights bill. If someone wanted to start a 
short line railroad, if the previous company had four people doing 
the job-it did not matter that it only needed one to do the task in 
that short four, five or ten-mile piece of railroad-that person was 
forced to hire the amount of people who were there under the 
previous regime because of those so-called successor rights.
<P>
	This was done probably in good faith in an attempt to protect 
jobs. What the government was really doing was making 
everybody lose their jobs because if the short line railroad was not 
viable, it could not be operated at all. Therefore everyone lost their 
employment rather than some of them keeping it.
<P>
	Maybe that made sense at the time or prima facie may have 
made sense. Maybe it was some dictate from the socialist agenda 
and seemed reasonable in that respect.
<P>
	In any case, there could not be a short line railroad in Ontario. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, who is 
very knowledgeable on these issues, will be discussing this issue 
with the member for Winnipeg, Bird's Hill and will be briefing him 
and straightening him out so that he fully understands this issue. I 
have good reason to believe he is doing that as we speak.
<P>
	The bill we have today will address a number of issues. It will 
address provincial running rights. It will address rail line 
rationalization and short line railways, as I have been discussing, 
rail transportation issues generally, and economic regulation 
regarding grain and rail. VIA Rail issues will be addressed along 
with mergers and acquisition, air transport and a number of other 
important topics related to the transport industry.
<P>
	I end by expressing a note of sadness regarding one issue. I know 
the member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke shares my view 
in this. He and I have discussed this issue before.
<P>
	A couple of years ago there were plans whereby CN and CP 
wanted to jointly own the rail line linking Coteau junction and a 
location in northern Ontario, the Montreal to North Bay rail line.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Now I notice that negotiations between CN and CP broke off and 
this joint ownership of the rail line will not come to be.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The reason why I am concerned about this is that, in my view, to 
ensure its long term viability, traffic should be increased on this 
particular railway line. I viewed favourably this effort on the part 
of the two railway companies to jointly own the line.
<P>
	I am disappointed that the whole thing seems to have failed. To 
conclude, I urge CN and CP to combine their efforts again so that 
this line connecting eastern and western Canada that the people of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell benefit from can be saved in the 
medium term and even the long term.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to have had the opportunity to participate in this 
debate. I ask all colleagues to support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on Bill C-101 to amend the National 
Transportation Act, 1987. As the member representing 
Trois-Rivières, I would just like to point out that our region, 
Trois-Rivières in particular, makes extensive use of the railway 
system, with the northern part of the Mauricie using the CN, and 
the southern part, including the city of Trois-Rivières, mainly using 
CP.
<P>
	It is obvious that the government is trying to harmonize this 
legislation to draw attention to the bill to privatize CN and make its 
acquisition more appealing to potential buyers.
<P>
	Many of the amendments in connection with the National 
Transportation Agency are designed to remedy regulatory 
deficiencies which hinder CN and CP's profitability and cause 
operating deficits that these companies have to absorb in order to 
maintain existing lines.
<P>
	It may seem commendable to strive to improve on the National 
Transportation Agency so that both companies can become 
profitable, but at the same time it is dangerous to try both to 
achieve these objectives through more flexible regulations for 
operators like CN and CP and preserve the intent of the law, which 
is to protect  public transportation. It is dangerous to change the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15112"> 15112 </A></B>
<P>
perspective of the legislation which is intended to foster the use of 
public transportation, and particularly rail transportation, for the 
development of people and businesses.
<P>
	The role of the National Transportation Agency should be to 
ensure proper balance between the CN and CP monopolies, 
commercial users and passengers. Since this bill is only at first 
stage, we can assume that heated discussions will take place when 
it is reviewed by the transport committee, which will hear many 
witnesses who will debate these amendments, including railway 
unions, commercial users and railway companies. These groups 
will not all agree with the new mandate that this bill proposes for 
the National Transportation Agency.
<P>
	In that respect, I want to mention some of the concerns that will 
surely be raised by various stakeholders during the hearings which 
will be held regarding this legislation.
<P>
	First, there is the ability for shippers to call upon the National 
Transportation Agency to block a rail monopoly. I am referring 
here to the approach used by Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, 
but the same could apply to all shippers of raw materials, such as 
the mining and forest industries which, by nature, ship enormous 
quantities of materials, usually from remote areas located far from 
the main industrial centres.
<P>
	The 1987 act allowed commercial users of railway companies to 
call upon the agency to circumvent CN and CP's excessive 
monopoly power. These provisions are maintained, but new 
hurdles will limit the ability of shipping companies to use them.
<P>
	Indeed, the shipper will now have to prove that he will suffer a 
serious prejudice in order to convince the agency to keep CN or CP 
from unduly raising its prices. We are not saying that the industry 
should not pay its fair share for the transportation of its products. 
The problem is that the notion of serious prejudice is not defined in 
Bill C-101, thus leaving open the possibility that a shipper may 
resort to political or court action to win his case before the National 
Transportation Agency.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	It is difficult for the industry to prove the degree to which an 
increase in rates would be harmful to it, and more difficult still to 
prove that there would be serious prejudice or material injury.
<P>
	It is vital to discuss what is meant by serious prejudice; 
otherwise it can be anticipated that too often the decision will have 
to be made in the courts, after time-consuming discussions have 
failed.
<P>
	I would also like to discuss the issue of competitiveness in 
remote regions. It is essential that all regions have access to a 
competitive and affordable rail system in  Canada that will permit 
them to compete in the export market.
<P>
	How will the new changes to the National Transportation Act 
allowing rail carriers to raise charges or simply discontinue 
unprofitable branch lines take regional economic realities into 
consideration by spreading operating costs over the entire system 
instead of dividing it up into more profitable and less profitable 
branch lines?
<P>
	For too long now, the cost of developing remote regions has been 
calculated without taking into account on the positive side of the 
ledger the development natural resources confer to the more 
urbanized regions.
<P>
	Here again, the concept of serious prejudice might be sustained 
provided it is given a fairly precise definition in order to prevent 
rail rates from being raised, thus cancelling out the profitability of 
industries dependent on this mode of transportation, without any 
consideration of the wages earned by workers in these industries.
<P>
	Another provision, which will probably raise questions, deals 
with agency membership. The bill proposes to cut from nine to 
three the number of members of the National Transportation 
Agency. This reduction could lead to a lack of understanding of 
regional issues across Canada and, in turn, to a misappreciation of 
any significant risk that shippers may be at a disadvantage because 
of the monopoly enjoyed by CN and CP.
<P>
	It will be more difficult for shippers to draw attention to their 
needs and their regions if the agency is composed of three members 
instead of nine. Listening to witnesses at the hearings held by the 
Standing Committee on Transport will surely help us strike a 
balance between a reduced agency of three members and an 
expanded agency of nine members.
<P>
	My comments will also deal with the establishment of short-line 
railways. The financial difficulties experienced by CN and CP in 
recent years have led to the recent establishment of short-line 
railways.
<P>
	Since these small organizations enjoy higher profits, smaller 
management and fewer constraints in the distribution of work 
through their collective agreements, we will see more and more of 
them. Unfortunately, the phrase ``short-line railway'' is not defined 
anywhere in this bill. Furthermore, in many clauses of this bill, it is 
unclear whether short-line railway operators should be regarded as 
railway operators or simply as shippers.
<P>
	Clauses 130 through 137 of this bill concern the identification of 
competitive lines. In the past, railway operators had their own 
systems and, already, the two antagonists do not like the idea of 
using the lines of their competition in return for fair compensation.
<P>
	Public interest requires better co-operation in the management of 
CN and CP. For example, CP could pay a price to use CN's tracks, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15113"> 15113 </A></B>
<P>
and vice versa, without the  tracks' owners being able to prevent 
such an arrangement.
<P>
	This would promote free competition, while also giving a more 
accurate idea of the actual costs of transportation in a particular 
region.
<P>
	Since my time is running out, I will immediately move on to the 
issue of regional development. In the past, under the act governing 
the agency, railway companies wanting to close or abandon a line 
had to comply with an elaborate process. Now, these companies 
will only have to announce their intention to dispose of a line.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The new process to transfer and discontinue the operation of 
railway lines will be very quick: a 60 day notice, a 15 day period 
for each level of authority, for a maximum of 105 days. This time 
frame will allow railway companies to dispose of their lines very 
quickly, without having to justify their decision on either economic 
grounds or grounds of public interest.
<P>
	However, this new transfer and discontinuation process hardly 
encourages the establishment of short line railways. Indeed, it is 
difficult, if not impossible, to find a potential buyer in just 60 days. 
Quebec, and the same goes for any other province, will only have 
15 days to decide whether or not to buy a line and continue to 
provide the existing service to the public.
<P>
	In conclusion, I can only hope that, this time, the government 
will have the vision that it has been lacking so far, and think in 
terms of the future, including as regards the interests of Quebec. In 
this case, as in others, we find no reasons to vote No, but many 
reasons to vote Yes, and I hope that Quebecers realize this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I might say just by way of beginning that it is interesting 
to notice how the members of the Bloc Quebecois are using every 
opportunity in the House of Commons to make the point about why 
they think their fellow citizens in Quebec should vote yes in the 
coming referendum. I was interested in question period today when 
they were going on and on about alleged injustices to Quebec. It 
struck me that if the people of Quebec vote yes they are going to 
have a heck of a lot less of what the Bloc Quebecois were 
complaining they were not getting enough of.
<P>
	The same of course is true with respect to transportation matters. 
I heard people in the Bloc refer today to the privatization of CN. I 
think I can say with some certainty that if there is a yes vote in 
Quebec the provision in Bill C-89 guaranteeing that the 
headquarters of this new privatized CN will be in Montreal will not 
continue very long past a yes vote. At least if I have anything to do 
with it, it will not. I would imagine that would be true for a lot of 
western Canadians, particularly  people I represent, who from the 
very beginning felt that if CN was to be restructured in such a 
radical way, the headquarters of CN should be in western Canada, 
in particular in Winnipeg, because most of the traffic this new 
privatized CN will be directing will be in western Canada. This is 
just by way of making that point to the Bloc.
<P>
	There are two things I want to get on the record with respect to 
Bill C-101. First, I do not think I have to tell anyone in the House 
that I am in general opposed to the overall agenda of the 
government with respect to Bill C-101, the privatization of CN, the 
deregulation of the transportation system in this country, going 
back to fights we had in this House against the former transport 
minister, Don Mazankowski, and going back before that.
<P>
	Sometimes people tend to forget, in particular people in 
Winnipeg, that this deregulation business really started under a 
former Liberal Minister of Transport, who is now the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. There is a tendency to blame the 
origins of this agenda on the Conservatives when in fact it goes 
back beyond that to this fascination the then Minister of Transport, 
the member for Winnipeg South Centre, had with deregulation at 
that time, prior to the defeat of the Trudeau government.
<P>
	I was interested to hear some of the things members said. The 
point I want to make here, and I do not think it has been made to 
this point, at least not to my satisfaction, is the process by which we 
are doing this, if I understand the origins of this procedure by 
which we refer matters to committee before second reading.
<P>
	I had a lot to do with parliamentary reform in previous 
Parliaments and we considered this at one point. The goal of that 
procedure as it was first imagined was that this would be something 
that would be applied to bills that were held to be of a non-partisan 
nature. It would not be something that was available to the 
government alone. It would be something that could only be done 
with some kind of agreement in the House and therefore it would 
be a mechanism whereby parties could say this is a bill we do not 
really have much to fight about in, so we want to take it into 
committee and we want to go over the details.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	I have noticed something that may be related to the fact that this 
procedure was adopted, I believe, after the beginning of this new 
Parliament, when the government only had to deal with rookies on 
the opposition side in committee. This has now become a 
procedure that is available to the government whenever it wants to 
use it, not something that requires a certain amount of co-operation 
on the part of the opposition. In my judgment, this goes against the 
spirit of the reform intent. When I say reform I do not mean 
Reform Party, but reform in the best sense of the word, reform of 
the House of Commons. This procedure has become a kind  of a 
fast track 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15114"> 15114 </A></B>
<P>
procedure. In my judgment, it is not being used for the intention for 
which it was originally designed.
<P>
	We have here a massive bill, which represents a major 
reorientation of the way transportation decisions are made with 
respect to rail line abandonment, the creation of short line railways, 
relationships between shippers and the railway companies, a whole 
host of things, all of which deserve a major second reading debate. 
We are reconceptualizing the transportation system of the country. 
We should be having a debate about that, in which I would want to 
argue very strongly and at length, hopefully being open to 
questions from colleagues in the House.
<P>
	Instead we have this very prescribed, circumscribed three-hour 
debate in which people have only ten-minute speeches, after which 
the whole thing is whisked off to committee. There is never really 
any significant debate on the principle of the bill. That is fine if 
there is agreement to do so and if it is the kind of legislation that 
lends itself to that procedure.
<P>
	With respect to my Bloc and Reform colleagues, I think they let 
the government get away with something when they agreed to 
move ahead with this kind of procedure. They allowed it to go into 
the standing orders without the kinds of safeguards that should 
have been required. That is, there should have been some provision 
that there had to be opposition agreement in order for this 
procedure to be followed. I believe their inexperience did not stand 
them in very good stead in that respect.
<P>
	I want to register once more my opposition to this bill. My 
opposition has been longstanding to an agenda of which this bill is 
the latest stage. I know my Reform colleagues were saying earlier 
that it does not go far enough, that it should be absolute, utter I 
suppose, comprehensive, total deregulation. However, I think 
deregulation has not served this country particularly well. It 
certainly has not served the transportation system very well. It 
certainly has not served my constituents very well, those who work 
at the railway and others, and the economic spin-off that used to 
exist in Winnipeg as a result of the presence of railway jobs there.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago another 266 people were laid off in the 
CN shops in Transcona. This is a far cry from the kinds of promises 
that were made during the 1993 election campaign by members 
opposite about how the many terrible things that were happening 
under the Tories were going to cease if only a Liberal government 
were elected: NAFTA would not go through, Winnipeg would be 
returned to its former glory as a transportation centre, rail jobs 
would return from Montreal and Edmonton, and no one would ever 
be laid off again. Well, that is not the way it has turned out. In fact 
we have a Liberal government doing what no Conservative 
government ever contemplated in public: privatizing CN Rail and 
devastating the community I come from.
<P>
	We see here an intention on the part of the government and the 
railway together to basically dismantle CN Rail as we have known 
it and to have basically tracks and trains, that is it. Maintenance, 
repair, stores, and all kinds of other things the railway used to do 
for itself will all be contracted out, pieced off here, there, and 
everywhere. As a result, a lot more good-paying jobs will be lost. 
In the end, this is also about good-paying jobs. It is not just about 
railways.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	I listened earlier to the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the government whip, talking 
about the impediment to short line railways. One of the reasons for 
successor rights was to make sure that short line railways are not 
used as a way of union busting, are not used as a way of laying 
people off and then hiring them back at half of what they used to 
make. I do not think that is such a bad sentiment. I do not think that 
is something for which the NDP government in Ontario or 
anywhere else should have to apologize.
<P>
	Those good paying jobs are disappearing. I do not think that is 
good for Canada. It is not good for the middle class, which is being 
eroded at both ends. It is not good for the revenues of the 
government. It is part of the reason we have a deficit in this 
country, because a lot of the good paying jobs are going, and with 
them is going the ability to pay the kind of income tax that would 
help pay off the deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
always a joy to rise in this House and follow the member for 
Winnipeg-Birds Hill. Excuse me, it is Winnipeg Transcona; I 
apologize for that. I would not want to confuse him with the 
member for Birds Hill, who is a Liberal and represents his 
constituents very ably and helps them understand the needs of 
doing business in the 20th century and not the 19th century, as the 
member for Winnipeg Transcona does.
<P>
	It is passing strange to me to note how the NDP, once a leader in 
social justice in this country, has become a conservative party, 
simply refusing to accept any kind of change or acknowledge that 
any kind of improvement should take place anywhere, anytime.
<P>
	Like the previous member, I want to briefly comment on the 
process. I am delighted that the government has chosen to go this 
route with this bill. I am somewhat astounded at the remarks from 
the Reform Party, who seem to be opposed to this.
<P>
	What has happened in this Parliament since the new government 
arrived in 1993 is we changed the rules of the House in a manner 
that allows the people of Canada to participate in important debates 
on public policy prior to the government making up its mind finally 
on a piece of legislation. It is an opening up and an inviting into the 
process, rather than a fast tracking, as the member for Winnipeg 
Transcona would have us believe.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15115"> 15115 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the minister has done a great deal in a very short period 
of time to deal with the regulatory burden that has been imposed 
on this country, some of it for good reasons and some of it perhaps 
we have outgrown. I think we owe the minister a vote of thanks 
for allowing this debate to take place in this fashion and for 
steering this debate.
<P>
	We have the member for Hamilton West, the chair of the 
transportation committee, who is well known to this House, who is 
very experienced on these matters. I am assured he will give people 
right across this country an opportunity to come before the 
committee and put on the table their issues on this very important 
matter.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary, the member for London East, has 
been working tirelessly to see that members of this House are 
informed on this issue and are responding to issues that have been 
raised by constituents right across the country.
<P>
	I want to make a comment on an earlier change this minister has 
brought in, the changes in the WGTA, which represented a stepping 
back from subsidy and regulation on the part of this government. 
Two days ago in my home town of Winnipeg there was an 
announcement by Schneider's that they are going to open a very 
large, two million hogs a year, meat processing plant. At last we are 
doing what western Canadians have been calling for for a long 
time: we are taking the false subsidies out of the rate structure and 
we are allowing the development of secondary processing in the 
prairies, where it should have been for a long time. We are all very 
pleased about that, and we are pleased it is this government that 
finally has the courage to challenge the burden that has been 
imposed by regulation.
<P>
	I am not going to stand up in this House and say all regulation is 
wrong; it is not. Whenever there are imperfect markets, whenever 
monopolies exist, for example, or whenever the public good needs 
to be protected, there is a need for government to act, and act in a 
manner that attempts to level the playing field between competing 
interests. That is what this is all about.
<P>
	The government has said that while it has owned the CNR it has 
imposed burdens on the railway for reasons other than the 
commercial interests of the railway. In an environment where 
change is taking place so rapidly now and where there has been 
such a tremendous evolution in transportation, it is time to revisit 
that. It is time to ask whether or not these regulations are serving 
the purpose for which they were intended.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	As chair of the western and northern caucus I can tell the House 
that we take great interest in the particular matter. Transportation is 
vital to all regions of Canada, but nowhere is that seen as vividly as 
it is in western  Canada with its tremendous distances and sparse 
populations.
<P>
	In addressing Bill C-101 this afternoon I cannot emphasize too 
strongly the importance of rail transportation to western and 
northern Canada. Commodities such as coal, sulphur, grain and 
petrochemicals must be shipped substantial distances from points 
of origin in western and northern Canada to markets around the 
globe. For most of these movements highway transportation does 
not present an effective competitive alternative to rail 
transportation and inland water transport is non-existent. For the 
great majority of the transportation requirements of western 
Canadian industry rail is the only realistic way of accessing export 
markets.
<P>
	Canadian railways rely heavily on resource based products for 
their revenues. Intermodal traffic handled by the railways is highly 
truck competitive and has limited profitability. The eastern 
Canadian operations of the railways by their own public statements 
have not been profitable in recent years. Railways accordingly look 
for their profitability to the resource based industries of western 
Canada. It is essential that we do not endeavour to solve the 
financial problems of railways by creating a bigger problem, 
namely to give railways greater leverage to increase freight rates in 
western Canada and thereby impair the ability of western Canadian 
industry to compete on a long term basis in world markets.
<P>
	There is widespread agreement on the need for railway reform in 
the country. Railways are burdened with excess track and 
impediments to productivity improvements. Bill C-101 will permit 
CN and CP to sell or abandon unprofitable trackage without 
regulatory intervention and will encourage lower cost short line 
railway operations to be developed. We believe this makes good 
economic sense and the legislation is to be commended for 
enabling railways to become more cost efficient.
<P>
	There is widespread agreement in the House that the 
encouragement of a competitive railway environment in Canada is 
the best way to achieve efficient and cost effective rail service. 
This, however, is not achieved by complete deregulation as some 
would allege because there are many industries in western Canada 
that are essentially captive to rail transportation.
<P>
	Railway regulation has historically served a different purpose 
than the regulation of other modes of transport. Trucking 
regulation restricted available trucking services and limited the 
freedom of choice of consumers. The deregulation of that industry 
had a pro-competitive result.
<P>
	Railway regulation has served a different purpose. It protects 
captive shippers against the excessive monopoly power of the 
railways. Legislative provisions which give competitive options to 
railway customers promote competition. It is the stated policy of 
the government that  those provisions, called the shipper relief 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15116"> 15116 </A></B>
<P>
provisions, will remain untouched in the present legislation. We are 
in full agreement with that approach.
<P>
	I do have grave concerns, however, with certain sections of the 
proposed legislation that will make it more difficult for railway 
customers to obtain access to the Canadian transportation agency 
should the need arise. These barriers to agency access are 
counterproductive to a competitive railway environment and are 
unnecessary based on the experience of the last eight years.
<P>
	The shipper relief provisions have been used by railway 
customers on only a handful of occasions. Their principal benefit 
has been to provide railway customers with some bargaining 
leverage in negotiating rates and service agreements with the 
railways. In this regard they have been particularly successful, as 
virtually thousands of rate and service agreements have been 
entered into between rail carriers and their customers and only 
when agreements could not be reached has recourse to the agency 
been required. Accordingly there is no need to construct barriers or 
fences to prevent their continued utilization. This will only have 
the effect of impairing their efficiency and making it more difficult 
for commercial arrangements to be concluded.
<P>
	Section 113 of the proposed legislation provides that all rates set 
by the agency must be commercially fair and reasonable, while as a 
general principle no one could reasonably argue that rates should 
not be commercially fair and reasonable. The problem is that there 
is no definition of what is commercially fair and reasonable in the 
current bill.
<P>
	Subsection 34(1) will enable the agency to order the payment of 
compensation for any loss or delay as a result of a proceeding 
which is found to be frivolous or vexatious. While this again does 
not appear to be unreasonable on the face of it, I am not aware of 
any pressing reason for its inclusion in the legislation. There is no 
history of frivolous or vexatious applications being filed with the 
agency and should a proceeding be initiated the agency has the 
jurisdiction to assess costs against an offending party.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I am concerned that this provision could operate as a deterrent to 
a railway customer who has a valid proceeding to advance before 
the agency. The chilling effect of a large damage award, should the 
application be unsuccessful, could well cause a railway customer 
not to proceed with a valid application.
<P>
	A further area which I know the committee will consider 
concerns the running rights provisions. The provision to allow 
railways to sell or abandon lines will lead to, it is hoped by many, 
the creation of a great many short line railways. Absent the right to 
run as was originally proposed to the first competitive interchange  
where they can receive two bids for their cost of transportation and 
short line railways will remain captive in a less free environment 
than they currently have.
<P>
	I appreciate very much the opportunity to speak on the bill. I 
know the committee will take the time to hear from many 
Canadians who are very concerned as we move to a new 
environment for rail transportation in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to voice our complete 
agreement with the assessment of Bill C-101 as stated by my 
Reform Party colleague from Kootenay West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	During the last election campaign the Liberals outlined in their 
infamous red book how they were to do business differently. Does 
the House remember that? They could hardly control themselves 
describing how they would do business differently once they seized 
the reins of power.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister was so reckless as to claim the 
Liberals would replace the goods and services tax within a year of 
coming into power or she would resign. The GST is alive and well 
and the Deputy Prime Minister shows no signs whatsoever of 
voluntarily resigning her seat as she promised to do. Is this what 
Canadians are supposed to buy as doing business differently?
<P>
	My constituents are asking: ``Different from what?'' This type of 
shenanigans is the same as the shenanigans of the Mulroney 
government. They are all doing business differently and we all 
know what the people did with Mr. Mulroney's party and its way of 
doing business differently.
<P>
	What are we looking for? What are we looking at? We are 
looking at failed promises. The Liberals promised major changes to 
the MP pension plan. They gave us minor changes which do not 
reflect private sector pension plan standards.
<P>
	The Liberals promised they would empower individual members 
of Parliament through an increase in the use of free votes. My 
goodness, free votes in the House of Commons. The Liberals have 
reneged on that promise by enforcing a heavy handed control of 
voting on their own party members.
<P>
	The point I am leading to is simple. In the view of the motion 
being forwarded by the government at this time, there is no way we 
on this side of the House can trust the Liberal government. Neither 
should the Canadian public. The Reform Party's transport critic is 
quite right in the stand he has taken. British Columbians rely on 
railway transportation. B.C. has relied on railway transportation 
since the time of Confederation. Mining and forestry constitute a 
substantial portion of the economy in British Columbia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15117"> 15117 </A></B>
<P>
	We have contacted many companies in British Columbia 
respecting the bill. Our solicitations for input have caused an 
avalanche of information to flow to our offices. Detailed 
amendments to the bill keep coming in from many industry 
sources. All these companies make it very clear they feel strongly 
that Bill C-101 is vital to maintain and enhance competition in 
Canadian railways.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	However there exists a danger that the Liberals intend to use the 
bill as a baby step in the right direction. Canadian railways are 
infected with exorbitant taxes and regulations which have created 
an unlevel playing field between us and our major trading partner. 
If there is anything the federal government can do to improve 
Canada's competitive advantage in terms of land transportation 
policies, these companies would have us do it.
<P>
	We all agree that the major accomplishment of Bill C-101 of 
establishing a clear redefined process for line abandonment is 
desirable. This would enable railways to establish short line routes 
to be governed under provincial legislation.
<P>
	The major flaw in the bill is that the free market is prevented 
from establishing prices. The Liberals intended the railways to 
continue to be treated as a service rather than as a business. They 
will continue through the bill to allow the transportation agency to 
regulate prices.
<P>
	The Liberals are once again attempting to use policy as a means 
of regional development. It is a shame. Canadian businesses are 
sick and tired of this treatment being used on policy which affects 
their livelihood. The bill gives cabinet the authority to decide 
which rail lines will be abandoned in the next few years.
<P>
	The Liberals are sealing their exclusive right to use these 
abandonments as policy footballs in their pre-election campaign. 
There is no reason for the bill to be sent to the committee directly 
following first reading.
<P>
	Such a move is only convenient to the Liberal political agenda. 
We on this side of the House have seen many times in the past what 
this kind of request from the government benches really means. 
The Liberals would have us believe that this manoeuvre is another 
example of doing business differently, using the Grits terms. 
However we know differently. The Liberals are only interested in 
facilitating CN's share offering due this fall.
<P>
	The Liberals are circumventing access to the committee 
hearings. The committee, suffering from a bad case of Liberal 
dictatorship, has already affixed arbitrary deadlines for 
submissions from stakeholders.
<P>
	These deadlines were adopted by the committee as a result of the 
domination of Liberal Party membership on the committee. We all 
know what happens to Liberal Party members who do not vote the 
way of the Liberal  Party intelligentsia or the way they are told to 
vote. We have seen it before in the House.
<P>
	On this side of the House we know that the committee has 
received numerous submissions over the summer. We also know 
that the committee promised to circulate the submissions so that all 
hon. members could take them into consideration.
<P>
	Finally we know that none of the submissions have been 
circulated. I might add that we know that the Liberals are doing 
business differently. I remember the last government. I cannot see 
the difference. Do you see the difference, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	Here is the different way of doing business that Canadians are 
seeing. Bill C-89 and Bill C-91 were fast tracked through this place 
by the Liberals. At that time the Liberals said that it would provide 
a more amendable process or something like that. Both those 
legislative proposals were passed without a single amendment. 
That is doing business differently. They do not allow any 
amendments whatsoever. It would be laughable if it did not concern 
important legislation regarding the interest of Canadian 
stakeholders.
<P>
	I strongly urge the House not to vote for Bill C-101 which 
requires due process. Let us make sure this piece of legislation gets 
the due process this place should give it.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would point out to hon. members that the 
Speaker, as a rule, does not answer questions. I know hon. members 
will know that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
intend to share my 10 minutes with my colleague from 
Souris-Moose Mountain.
<P>
	The Reform Party insists on dealing with only the process and 
not the content of Bill C-101. I would simply like to comment that 
from our perspective here on the government side, we feel we are 
complying with the new rule changes that were initiated by the 
government. We intend to fulfil those changes.
<P>
	Bill C-101 has had some interesting background. It attempts to 
reduce the National Transportation Agency to some degree, from a 
full complement of nine members down to three full time and three 
part time. We are also hoping to reduce the number of employees 
within that agency from 500 down to 200. We feel this is a move 
that will initiate and respect our drive for efficiencies within the 
system.
<P>
	I might further comment that the structure of the rail industry in 
particular and the laws that regulate it hark back to a time when 
Canada was a self-contained internal market. That time has passed. 
Canada's growth and the opportunities of our people now depend 
on the ability of our industries to embrace and meet the needs of 
global markets. Rail transportation is strategically important for  
our exporters as the means that will keep us in those markets. A 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15118"> 15118 </A></B>
<P>
viable rail industry, one that can attract new capital and one that is 
sensitive to shippers' needs, is crucial.
<P>
	For many years the focus of the law has been on the network of 
the two large railways and ways to prevent these two companies 
from changing this network. The law was seen as a mechanism to 
prevent abandonment and also to reduce service. The focus was not 
on alternative ways to deliver local rail service.
<P>
	As I read this bill, I am sensing that there are provisions whereby 
rail abandonment, if it does occur, will be done on a much different 
basis. There will be respect for the fact that the economics of 
abandonment must be addressed and that there must have been 
efforts put in place by the two major lines to actually show that they 
have attempted to sell such railways in terms of setting up short 
lines.
<P>
	The Canada transportation act encourages these main lines to 
restructure in a way that promotes the establishment of new rail 
initiatives and alternative short lines. In the future, the law will set 
in place a process that will allow private sector interests or regional 
officials to intercede to take over lines they consider important for 
regional rail transportation.
<P>
	The framework under the new Canada transportation act sees our 
rail industry and its future viability as crucial for long term growth. 
It also encourages new participation at the local and regional level 
to preserve rail service.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Canada transportation act is good for Canada 
because it reflects what a modern Canada needs. It is a framework 
law that recognizes the global nature of markets and the strategic 
importance of transportation, particularly rail transportation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset may I point out that I was one of the nine 
members of Parliament who voted in opposition to Bill C-68. I 
want to go on the record here today as indicating to this House that 
there was no action taken against any of us for the position we took 
relative to that vote some time ago. Maybe that will clarify the 
minds of some of the members of the Reform Party who said that 
we were going to be held in some disdain for the stands we took. 
Such was not the case.
<P>
	With regard to the bill before us today, the federal government is 
committed to a safe, efficient, affordable, and competitive 
transportation system for Canada. This legislation is part of the 
modernization process that is already under way.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The constituents in my riding welcome a modernization and an 
increase in efficiency in the system. They have a lot at stake in this 
legislation. The  entire riding's economy rises and falls on the 
relative wellness of the grain industry. Many changes have taken 
place in the grain farming industry in the past year. There is a 
period of very dramatic adjustment that our farming community is 
embracing and dealing with at this moment. The Canada 
transportation act is one more adjustment. Hence, we must be very 
careful as we proceed.
<P>
	Let me say at the outset that I am concerned about short line rails 
in the expansion. I am concerned about shippers so that they have 
some degree of knowledge that they are going to be protected and 
that their rights are preserved in this new competitive arrangement 
under the new act. That is why I am pleased that this bill is now 
being referred to committee. This will give the committee and the 
public ample opportunity to review and debate the merits of each of 
the aspects of the bill.
<P>
	In my riding there are many groups with very good ideas, 
constructive criticisms, and suggestions for changing and 
finetuning on this bill. They want to look at these very carefully 
and consider the impact of the bill for the long term. This can take 
place on a detailed level in committee.
<P>
	I know that this bill addresses the entire spectrum of 
transportation issues, from rail to air to marine. In particular, my 
concern is the modernization and increased efficiencies of the rail 
sector. The legislation cuts red tape and eliminates administrative 
costs. It restricts government involvement in the day to day affairs 
of the rail industry.
<P>
	Rail is the most highly regulated mode of transport in Canada. 
The act reduces the number of actions that require regulatory 
agency involvement from almost 200 to 40. This is in line with the 
federal government's commitment to streamline operations, 
eliminate duplication, and improve the way we deliver service.
<P>
	The legislation makes it easier for short line operators to take 
over lines by making the process more commercially oriented, less 
adversarial, and more conducive to the sale or lease of surplus lines 
to newcomers.
<P>
	The legislation also contains details to preserve shipper rights 
and protections. There is a lot of heated debate in this area. This is 
what our government wants to hear. We want those people affected 
by these changes to come forward at the committee stage and 
contribute to the final version of the bill.
<P>
	The CTA is one more step this government has taken toward the 
modernizing of Canada's transport sector. It enables Canada and 
Canadian businesses to compete in the 21st century. That, along 
with our concern for the actions of the agriculture sector, can 
contribute to a more sufficient and efficient system that is foremost 
in the world.

<BLOCKQUOTE>April 26, 1995-The Minister of Justice-Second reading and reference to 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs of Bill C-84, an act to 
provide for the review, registration, publication and parliamentary scrutiny of 
regulations and other documents and to make consequential and related 
amendments to other acts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> Mr. Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-84, an act to provide for the review, registration, publication and 
parliamentary scrutiny of regulations and other documents and to make 
consequential and related amendments to other acts, be referred forthwith to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs following first reading, pursuant to 
Standing Order 73(1).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I do indeed make that motion. I say that 
Bill C-84, which is intended as a new regulations act, should go to 
the committee, and members of this Parliament should have the 
opportunity, before the House decides in principle on this approach 
to regulation, to discuss its terms.
<P>
	It may seem that the legislation that governs the making of 
regulations in government is a technical or a dry subject, but in fact 
it will surprise some of the members to know that indeed there is a 
great deal of interest in this subject. There is a great deal of interest 
among Canadians because that process, the process by which 
subordinate legislation is made, has a direct effect  on the way 
business is done in this country, on the productivity, on the 
competitiveness of business.
<P>
	May I say that this proposed legislation is intended to increase 
the productivity and the competitiveness of our economy, which 
this government believes it will do.
<P>
	I also observe this motion and indeed the regulations act, which 
is being sent to committee after first reading, is another good 
example of the value of Standing Order 73(1) of the House of 
Commons, which was sponsored by my hon. colleague the House 
leader at the opening of this Parliament.
<P>
	The new regulations act to which I speak today is intended to 
replace the Statutory Instruments Act, which for almost 25 years 
now has governed the Canadian system of making regulations. Bill 
C-84 offers important improvements to that outdated piece of 
legislation, intending to streamline and reduce delays in the 
process by which regulations are made at the federal level in 
Canada.
<P>
	The legislative reform is an important part of the regulatory 
reform, part of the innovative economy initiative of my colleague, 
the Minister of Industry. This legislation is intended to support the 
bold, innovative, imaginative measures he is taking to strengthen 
Canada's economy.
<P>
	There can be no doubt about the need for change in the process 
by which regulations are made. Problems are created by the current 
regulatory process. They have been identified many times in the 
past. There have been repeated calls for legislative improvements, 
most recently during the government-wide regulatory reviews of 
1992-93.
<P>
	Permit me to touch on some of the key elements of this bill. 
First, it is intended to provide a simpler and more principled 
definition of what a regulation is in modern government so that the 
scope of the act will be more clearly understood, so that its 
application will be more readily determined.
<P>
	Second, an effort has been made in drafting Bill C-84 to use 
plainer language, to more directly communicate its meaning to 
those persons who use it and who invoke the process.
<P>
	Third, the statute divides regulatory documents into different 
categories and provides for different kinds of review, depending 
upon what category a document falls into.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Fourth, it provides for a revised exemption power that will now 
be subject to an express public interest consideration.
<P>
	Fifth, Bill C-84 codifies and I believe clarifies the law by 
expressly authorizing incorporation by reference, whether on 
international or other standards that are intended to be included in 
Canadian regulations, always  subject to an express requirement 
that whatever is incorporated by reference should be made readily 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15120"> 15120 </A></B>
<P>
accessible to members of the public or any other interested party 
who wishes to have them.
<P>
	Sixth, Bill C-84 contemplates a modernized process allowing for 
the creation of an electronic registry of regulations while at the 
same time maintaining government accountability for regulations 
through parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know that in order to reform the Statutory Instruments Act, a 
balance must be struck between the interests of the various 
stakeholders. The new legislation is to streamline and expedite the 
making of regulations. Yet, this will be done without overlooking 
the requirement for advance notification, public representations 
and a thorough parliamentary scrutiny of any related mandatory 
legislation.
<P>
	That is why I believe it is important to note that the changes 
sought by the Regulations Act are, for the most part, material 
amendments that leave the essence of the current process 
unchanged. These amendments are designed to remove 
ambiguities, simplify steps as required and generally modernize 
the regulatory process.
<P>
	But first and foremost the purpose of the new Regulations Act is 
to maintain and strengthen the objectives and basic principles of 
the Statutory Instruments Act, which contains the legal safeguards 
required to make binding regulations. These objectives include the 
rule of law, transparency, the publication of regulations and the 
monitoring of the executive by Parliament as part of its legislative 
power.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While the Statutory Instruments Act has generally served 
Canadians well over the last two decades, over time the regulatory 
process has come to be viewed both inside and beyond government 
as an impediment to the timely and efficient making and repeal of 
federal regulations. The current operation of the Statutory 
Instruments Act makes it difficult for federal regulators to respond 
in a timely manner to changing needs with new and improved 
regulations because the regulatory process is too cumbersome and 
time consuming. This is of concern to all Canadians, particularly 
Canadian business because these regimes are not well tailored to 
evolving circumstances.
<P>
	Unnecessary delays in modernizing and improving regulatory 
schemes can also reduce our ability to respond quickly and 
effectively to new developments in areas such as health and safety, 
environmental regulation, international trade or federal-provincial 
relations. Outdated and inappropriate regulatory schemes can also 
undermine respect for the law, economic growth and 
competitiveness. They can also complicate the working  
relationship between the government and the private sector.
<P>
	We believe that the new act will improve the capacity of 
government to respond quickly and effectively to changing 
circumstances, reduce the overall volume of regulations and 
provide for an expedited process. It will allow us to incorporate 
important documents by reference. It will do all of that without 
reducing the role of Parliament in overseeing government as it 
makes subordinate law.
<P>
	In moving today that this proposed statute now go to committee 
for consideration, I express the government's conviction that it 
represents a significant improvement in Canadian law. I know it 
will receive the usual balanced and insightful commentary from 
my colleagues in other parties. I look forward enthusiastically to 
my own involvement in that important process.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-84.
<P>
	First of all, let me say that this bill will effect changes in more 
than 60 acts or bills currently before this House. Its passage will 
therefore have a very major impact on federal legislation.
<P>
	Bill C-84 seeks to replace the old Statutory Instruments Act with 
a new Regulations Act completely consolidated and revised. Like 
the act it seeks to replace, the bill sets out the principles and 
administrative procedures that will govern the four steps involved 
in drafting new regulations: preparation, passage, enactment and 
publication of regulations passed under federal statutes.
<P>
	The bill also confirms the reviewing power of the Standing Joint 
Committee for the scrutiny of Regulations, ensures better control 
by Parliament and maintains governmental responsibility over the 
regulatory process.
<P>
	In short, Bill C-84 provides, first, a simpler definition of 
``regulation'', second, an expedited process for regulations that do 
not require legal review, third, a revision of the bases for 
exempting regulations from the regulatory process, and, fourth, a 
modernization of the regulatory process by providing for 
consultation, registration and publication by electronic means.
<P>
	Bill C-84 therefore aims at modernizing the current act and 
correcting the problems encountered with the present regulatory 
process.
<P>
	I will now review some major items in Bill C-84 that I find very 
important. First of all, the definition of ``regulation'' is simpler and 
more principled than the current term ``statutory instruments'' 
found in Section 2. This legislation also specifies that regulations

<P>
also  include all kinds of lists and guidelines, putting an end to an 
ambiguity in the current act.
<P>
	It seems also that publication by electronic means will shortly 
become an addition to regular printing of the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, but 
it might be possible for the government to eliminate the printed 
copy of the <I>Canada Gazette</I> by publishing only by electronic 
means.
<P>
	In this case, why not include a reference to the printing, even 
though that might involve limited editions? Bill C-84 eliminates 
the requirement of printing a specific number of copies of 
regulations during the regulatory process, allowing for substantial 
savings, even in the absence of electronic means.
<P>
	One can only wonder why goals in the areas of security, health 
and the environment are specifically mentioned like in Bill C-62. Is 
it yet another backhanded way of intruding into provincial 
jurisdictions? Criteria concerning the use of this exemption power 
of the governor in council are not crystal clear.
<P>
	Why not extend the prohibition in clause 64 concerning the 
Defence Production Act to other federal statutes with a significant 
impact on health and the environment such as big economic 
development projects like pipelines, Hibernia, nuclear plants and 
so on? To be able to answer that question, we need to have the 
complete list of exempted regulations and of other regulations that 
could be exempted later on if Bill C-84 is passed.
<P>
	It also seems unthinkable that clause 11(4) should provide that 
no regulation is invalid because it was not published. We need 
more openness in this government. Regulations have force of law 
and should always be published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. This bill 
does provide that no penalty can be imposed for a violation of 
unpublished regulations. We think that people in Canada and 
Quebec have the absolute right to know which regulations are in 
force. Why make regulations if there is no penalty when they are 
disobeyed?
<P>
	Sometimes, groups or businesses will find out about regulations 
only when the quarterly index is published.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, this bill introduces a publication and 
distribution system for regulations that can be tailored to fit every 
single case. Clause 15 should simply be dropped, in our opinion.
<P>
	This new regulatory process would allow the federal government 
to withdraw gradually from regulating certain industries through 
the incorporation by reference of private or international standards.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Clause 16(5) provides that an amendment made by a business or 
a foreign government could have force of law in Canada as soon as 
it is announced. This in spite of the fact that the amendment is not 
published as a regulation in <I>The Canada Gazette</I> or in both official 
languages,  particularly in French where American standards are 
concerned. Considering the context of free trade in North America 
and eventually in both Americas, this may jeopardize the position 
of the French language.
<P>
	The purpose of having a regulation incorporate material by 
reference is twofold. First of all, to remove the requirement for the 
federal government to regulate every aspect of the sector 
concerned. Second, to take advantage of the expertise of Canadian, 
American and international organizations that set standards which, 
sooner or later, will have to be adopted by Canadian industry. In 
fact, industry is being asked to regulate itself. Incorporation by 
reference means that standards can be updated directly by the 
agencies or governments concerned, while the federal government 
in Canada is not obliged to adopt them.
<P>
	This ``privatization'' and ``internationalization'' of business and 
industrial regulations, probably on the basis of American and 
international standards, opens the door to the adoption of standards 
that are drafted exclusively in English.
<P>
	Even if the code is available in French, in accordance with clause 
16(2), what assurance do we have that subsequent amendments will 
be published in French by the American association or, 
simultaneously, by the Canadian regulatory authority? Clause 17 
on accessibility is not, in our view, a sufficient guarantee in this 
regard.
<P>
	It is possible to conclude that a number of documents 
incorporated by reference in a regulation with force of law in 
Canada will be neither published nor available in French from the 
regulatory authority. Will Quebecers have access to regulations 
wholly in French only after Quebec attains sovereignty? One must 
wonder.
<P>
	We are also proposing an amendment to clause 25 in the form of 
a new paragraph (3) requiring the government to submit the draft 
regulations to the regulatory committee at the same time as it tables 
its bills in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Also, subparagraph 26(<I>g</I>)(i) authorizing the making of secret 
regulations concerning the conduct of federal-provincial affairs 
must be struck out. Bill C-84 is suggesting here that provinces, like 
foreign countries, are enemies of the federal government. This 
same precaution probably does not even exist in European 
legislation for the Fifteen.
<P>
	How can an atmosphere of harmony, consensus and co-operation 
between federal and provincial governments be created when even 
regulations call for secrecy in federal-provincial affairs? Is such a 
clause necessary in international relations today? We feel that the 
defence of Canada is the only part of 26(<I>g</I>) fully justified today.
<P>
	Bill C-84 uses the French expression ``autorité réglementante'' 
and there is no such word in French as ``réglementante''. The 
expression that should be used instead is ``autorité réglementaire'' 
to designate the  institutions, departments, organizations and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15122"> 15122 </A></B>
<P>
commissions with regulatory authority, in keeping with the 
definition found in the 1990 edition of <I>Trésor de la langue 
française.</I>
<P>
	In conclusion, we agree that Bill C-84 is modernizing the 
existing regulatory process provided by the Regulations Act and 
deserves our support, but let us support it only after the government 
has adopted the many amendments we have mentioned today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to join in debate with my colleagues on 
Bill C-84. This is not a discussion on criminology so it will be a 
nice articulation of the points today.
<P>
	Bill C-84 is an act to provide for the review, registration, 
publication and parliamentary scrutiny of regulations and other 
documents and to make consequential and related amendments to 
other acts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> He is a legend in his own mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Why is it, Mr. Speaker, that I 
cannot stand up in the House-
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> After hearing those opening remarks, I had to 
check to see it was really the member for Fraser Valley West. I 
invite him to debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> He has your number.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is pretty bad 
when even the Speaker has your number.
<P>
	I want to say at the outset that it is the Reform Party's intention 
to oppose this bill, not because of the legislative intent of the bill, 
but instead we oppose the bill because of what we feel are 
substantive flaws in the act put forward by the Minister of Justice. 
In addition, there is equal weight in our opposition to this 
document because of clauses which are not in this act.
<P>
	Make no mistake. Reform members on this side of the House are 
just as intent to see that the regulatory process in Canada functions 
in an efficient manner. Clearly, this bill constitutes the other half of 
the government's effort at regulatory reform.
<P>
	In fairness and in stark contrast with the conclusions reached 
concerning Bill C-62, the government has put forward a bill which 
attempts to tidy up the regulatory process and replace the Statutory 
Instruments Act. Yet for the reasons which follow, this initiative, 
like so many others in the Liberal red book, is long on promise and 
short on substance.
<P>
	To begin with, this act should have been forwarded to the 
Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations and not, 
as has been done, to another government operations committee. 
You need not take my  word for it. It should be self-evident to even 
the most partisan of members that the words ``parliamentary 
scrutiny of regulations'' contained in the act's title should have 
made referral academic. Indeed, the hon. government member 
from Scarborough-Rouge River said as much in committee on 
May 18.
<P>
	My esteemed colleagues on the government side of the House 
might argue that no precedent or provision exists for such a 
referral. However, in a letter from the committee clerk to members 
of the scrutiny of regulations committee there are indeed well 
documented procedures. In addition, Standing Order 73(1) would 
allow the government to make such a referral.
<P>
	With all due respect, the fact that it was not referred to the 
appropriate committee leads me to believe there may be something 
untoward in the government's intention on the bill in the first place.
<P>
	Also, I refer to the fact that the Reform Party would oppose this 
bill for what it is not. In this case and as members from the scrutiny 
of regulations committee will point out, there is no statutory 
disallowance procedure put forward.
<P>
	One way Parliament ensures that regulations are reviewed is 
through the scrutiny of regulations committee. You will hear me 
refer to that committee again and again in this speech. Its work is as 
germane to this debate as is Bill C-84 itself.
<P>
	In any event, the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of 
Regulations has had power since 1986 under Standing Order 123 to 
recommend that a regulation be disallowed. Let me assure 
colleagues that this is done in the rarest of situations and usually as 
a result of a government department exceeding its authority.
<P>
	The recommendation by the committee under Standing Order 
123 is just that, a recommendation. It is up to the minister 
responsible to address the disallowance. Sadly, there is nothing 
which obliges him to act upon the committee recommendation to 
disallow a regulation. Further, the disallowance procedure does not 
apply to regulation made outside of governor in council or by a 
minister.
<P>
	Throughout the life of the previous Parliament, the then 
opposition Liberals on the scrutiny committee saw the 
shortcomings of this situation presented to them. In fact, in a 1992 
report released by the Subcommittee on Regulations and 
Competitiveness, they requested that the disallowance procedure 
be replaced on a statutory footing.
<P>
	The government responded that such a measure was not 
necessary. The Hon. Ray Hnatyshyn stated that it was inappropriate 
to proceed with legislation until the effect of the experimental rules 
could be assessed. It is 1995, a full nine years of experimenting and 
the only thing that has changed is that the Liberals are now in 
power. I ask hon. members on the government side to join with me  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15123"> 15123 </A></B>
<P>
and amend this bill accordingly so that all regulations and deleted 
legislation is subjected to full and effective parliamentary review.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The definition of a regulation contained in clause 2(1) contains 
the phrase ``are of general application''. This open ended catch all 
is likely to be the source of debate for many years to come. 
Granted, when placed alongside the dual version of what exists in 
the Statutory Instruments Act the government has tidied up the 
definition somewhat.
<P>
	However in practice the definition could exclude a departmental 
order which is specific in its nature. For example the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development makes an order with 
respect to the Sechelt Indian Band concerning licensing. The 
question then arises whether the order is considered a regulation 
which is subject to examination as it represents a specific rather 
than a general application. This is significant because it does 
represent an anomaly over what presently exists. It is my hope the 
situation will be clarified by the government at some point in the 
debate stage.
<P>
	In addition clause 5(1) modifies the exemption guidelines which 
are presently set out in section 27 of the Statutory Instruments Act. 
The problem is that the guidelines in section 27 appear to be 
replaced with a general discretion. The only check in place is that 
an order to exempt is itself a regulation and therefore is subject to 
review.
<P>
	Clearly this so-called safeguard is subject to interpretation and 
as such should be considered suspect as it departs from previous 
practices. The point here is that the Reform Party and Canadians 
are fundamentally opposed to any kind of exemption power. 
Somewhere along the way an exemption power has the potential to 
be abused.
<P>
	In no way am I trying to question the sincerity in which this 
Liberal government has put forward this bill. I would never do that. 
Yet if a government with less integrity were to come into the House 
and for which we have an ethics counsellor-if members over there 
remember the ethics counsellor who, as I keep repeating in the 
House, is about as busy as the Maytag repairman-would they 
exempt on the basis of a connection to the cabinet? Perhaps not, 
though I say the potential is there.
<P>
	Clauses 6(1), 6(2) and 7 are at the heart of the government's 
initiative to speed up the regulatory process. This effort should be 
applauded. The clauses could have a disastrous effect on the 
regulatory process and I will explain why.
<P>
	The clauses I referred to are supposed to ensure that each 
regulatory authority, for instance the minister or a government 
department, is responsible for drafting their respective regulations. 
Only then can they be submitted  to the privy council office of 
justice for advice. This is thought to be an improvement over the 
Statutory Instruments Act because in past practices the privy 
council office drafted and reviewed its work on behalf of most 
regulatory authorities. It did after all have the most expertise in this 
area but unfortunately this situation represented a conflict of 
interest.
<P>
	Bill C-84 attempts to address that conflict of interest by taking 
the drafting responsibility away from the privy council office of 
justice and entrenching it with the relevant minister or department. 
In doing this the government is turning over the drafting 
responsibility to legal departments which heretofore have had 
limited or non-existent experience in the drafting of such 
regulations. The result is likely that poorer quality drafts will be 
submitted to the privy council office of justice. In turn, that office 
will probably end up doing the drafting from scratch.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Again, the clauses represent a good intention but fail to consider 
the reality of the regulatory process.
<P>
	In closing out my remarks, I again call on my colleagues in this 
House to enhance the provisions of this bill. This can best be 
accomplished by placing a statutory disallowance procedure in the 
bill. There will be ample opportunity to discuss and review this 
request, but I ask my colleagues from the government side, 
especially those who sit on the regulations committee, to push for 
an amendment in this regard. Many of them pushed for this in 
opposition and to do any less now would be indefensible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak in support of Bill C-84. This bill is about 
improving the regulatory process to the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	The limitations and particularly the delays created in the existing 
system result in hidden but very real costs to all Canadians. These 
are in the form of increased expenditures of revenues spent in 
enforcing outdated and inappropriate regulations and in reducing 
competitiveness in the global marketplace.
<P>
	The reforms proposed in the new regulations act will improve 
the regulatory system without in any way sacrificing its basic 
objectives. The government's improved capacity to update 
regulatory standards faster will promote the public interest by 
ensuring that health and safety standards are current and take into 
account evolving technologies.
<P>
	I would like to spend a few moments now dealing with the 
provision of Bill C-84 which deals with incorporation by reference. 
This is incorporation by reference of international standards and 
other material into regulations. This is an important element in 
achieving the objectives of our regulatory reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15124"> 15124 </A></B>
<P>
	First, it is important to understand that these provisions do not 
create a new regulatory technique. Incorporation by reference is 
a legal technique that is currently being widely used by 
governments in Canada. It is a legal technique whose legitimacy 
has been recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada. It is a legal 
technique that is widely employed in Europe and has been 
advocated by the Standards Council of Canada and many 
international bodies, including the International Standards 
Organization of Geneva.
<P>
	Incorporation of materials into regulations particularly as they 
are amended from time to time is an important way for government 
to promote the goals of international and interprovincial 
harmonization of regulatory standards. I want to stress that such 
harmonization does not mean that Canadian standards will be 
lowered. In many cases the standards adopted will be higher.
<P>
	Reliance on the expertise and timeliness of international and 
interprovincial standards writing organizations whose material is 
typically incorporated on this basis is of significant value in 
promoting Canadian competitiveness, particularly in the context of 
rapid technological change. The usefulness of this technique in 
promoting Canadian competitiveness was recognized in the 1993 
report of the finance subcommittee on regulations and 
competitiveness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The provisions of the new legislation, which authorize 
departments with regulatory power to develop and revise 
documents incorporated by reference, also provide the important 
opportunity to quickly revise and improve regulations. This form 
of incorporation is limited to documents that are essentially 
technical and the rules of conduct on substance, established by the 
departments, remain subject to the entire regulatory process.
<P>
	I stress once again that, in this area, we will not be amending the 
legislation in use, we will be codifying and clarifying. It has 
existed for years, and the new legislation simply incorporates the 
current practice.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	However, we are proposing a significant improvement to this 
practice, because the provisions of the new Regulations Act 
establish the express statutory requirement for departments with 
regulatory power to ensure the accessibility of the documents 
incorporated.
<P>
	To ensure effective parliamentary control over the technical 
standards incorporated, the new Regulations Act provides that the 
Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations be supplied <I>ex 
officio</I> with all the regulations.
<P>
	Consequently, this committee could at any time call for, revise 
and comment on the regulations into which documents have been 
incorporated and by so doing review the documents in question. 
The documents, which  are periodically revised, are made available 
in their form at the time of the request.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Like the rest of the new regulations act, provisions relating to 
incorporation by reference strike what we believe to be the right 
balance between the need to streamline and speed up the regulatory 
process and the objectives of ensuring the legality and accessibility 
of regulations and providing necessary oversight by Parliament.
<P>
	The regulatory process is already overburdened. We cannot 
afford to bring into the process documents that are not currently 
subject to it. The bill will facilitate use of a legitimate technique 
that offers opportunities for achieving the flexibility we need 
without sacrificing legality, accessibility, or parliamentary 
accountability. For those reasons, I urge the committee to review 
the bill and I urge the House to ultimately pass the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased-well, maybe not exactly pleased-to speak to Bill C-84 
now before the House.
<P>
	I listened earlier to the minister of Justice when he addressed the 
Chair to refer this bill to a parliamentary committee. I will come 
back to this issue in a little while, but for now, let me say that we 
know the party now in office, the Liberal Party, and the somewhat 
contradictory objectives it is pursuing by introducing all the bills 
we have seen lately. First, there was Bill C-43, the infamous bill on 
lobbyists on Parliament Hill. In that bill, the government stated its 
intention-probably because of the Pearson Airport fiasco-to 
have an ethics counsellor, someone to oversee everything.
<P>
	Soon after, they introduced Bill C-62, which I call the standard 
substitution bill. That bill allowed civil servants to act on impulse, 
to give in to pressure by their colleagues, and often by friends of 
the government, as is still the case, and to change some statutory 
standards. That was what Bill C-62 was all about. Now, we are 
considering Bill C-84, an act to repeal the Statutory Instruments 
Act.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, know that progress must be made, 
and the Liberals are not stupid. They talk about great principles, 
things like ``increased efficiency'', ``something good'', something 
close to the citizens, close to the governed. Let us examine this bill 
closely. It does contain interesting provisions that we cannot 
approve blindly.
<P>
	Let us take, for example, this legislation by reference. The Joint 
Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations is having problems with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15125"> 15125 </A></B>
<P>
Revenue Canada about the incorporation by reference of material 
in a regulation. We could have specified in the appropriate 
provision that  these incorporations by reference also include 
material provided-as clause 16(1)(<I>c</I>) says-by a government.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Can we incorporate in our legislation regulations passed by a 
foreign government? It is possible. It is possible when, for 
example, we want to figure out the income of a person, someone 
who has done his military service in the United States or in another 
country and is entitled, in that country, to compensation for his 
involvement in the armed forces. We could possibly refer to 
regulations or legislation from abroad. But we should specify it. 
Here we are faced with total uncertainty; we are not sure.
<P>
	And what happens if the regulations to be incorporated by 
referral are amended? There again, we do not know. To come back 
to my example, are we to amend our regulations every time the 
State Department in the United States raises the pension payable to 
American veterans? Will we have to amend our regulations? If so, I 
start to doubt its efficiency.
<P>
	This bill was motivated by good intentions, that could hardly be 
challenged. Everybody is in favour of efficiency. Yet, it starts by 
undermining the principles which, ever since the Bill of Rights of 
1688, in England, have been part of the regulatory practices of our 
constitutional monarchy.
<P>
	As they say in Latin <I>delegatus non potest delegare, </I>you cannot 
delegate something which has been delegated to you. However, this 
is what the bill does. After some 300 years of implementation of 
past regulations. I agree that we should make some changes, we all 
want changes, especially if they are for the best, but are we going to 
sub-sub-sub-delegate regulatory powers to the most junior clerk, 
hired last week, that would have an interest-I know that we must 
always assume that things are done in good faith-in, for example, 
changing a regulation to benefit someone in his family, one of his 
friends? There is no limit to sub-delegation under Bill C-84.
<P>
	This is dangerous, especially when we refer back to Bill C-62 on 
measure substitution. Although it started with good intentions, I 
think the government is about to shoot through the bottom of the 
boat, which will sink. The bills of the justice minister are always 
like that. They always state fine principles. We have seen it with 
the gun control bill. The principle was noble, the principle was 
laudable, but watch out when it comes up in front of the courts. The 
government wants to relieve the courts' backlog, but this type of 
legislation will not help.
<P>
	There is already too much pressure on the courts, and the 
government keeps introducing bills that are based on principles but 
not so much on reality.
<P>
	At the beginning of my speech, I said that this bill should have 
been referred to another committee. The Minister of Justice said 
that it should be referred to a committee of members who would 
examine its scope. We  have a Standing Committee for the Scrutiny 
of Regulations which has existed for at least 25 years. It is 
composed of experts, and God knows the Liberals form the 
majority on that committee. Are they afraid of themselves?
<P>
	There are Liberal MPs and Liberal senators on that committee. 
We know that all bills are sent to the Senate for review after they 
are adopted in the House. We asked the Solicitor General of 
Canada: Why not refer Bill C-84 to the Standing Joint Committee 
for the Scrutiny of Regulations, where sixteen MPs and senators 
spend a lot of time studying regulations? They would be the most 
competent people to evaluate the scope of this bill.
<P>
	The solicitor general thought it was a wonderful idea, an 
extraordinary idea, but that there was no precedent in this House 
where a bill was referred to a joint committee.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	But that is exactly what a precedent is all about; it is a first. If a 
precedent is not a first, it is not a precedent. Why is the minister so 
adamant in refusing to refer this bill to a committee which knows 
the subject, which does that kind of work year in and year out and 
which reviews thousands of regulations of all kinds annually, from 
the diameter of nickels to the disposal of toilet waste from 
airplanes.
<P>
	There are all kinds of regulations and we study them all. And 
then we become incompetent overnight because there is no 
precedent. Another proof of this government's inability to go off 
the beaten path. The government keeps its eyes on its narrow path 
and fails to see anything outside of it. Therefore, I would ask the 
minister to show some common sense and ask his colleague, the 
Solicitor General of Canada, in the name of all Canadians and for 
the sake of our regulations, to actually set a precedent. Now is the 
time to act. Next year, it will be too late. The work will have been 
done. Otherwise, I will ask him to define ``precedent''.
<P>
	This was my point. Finally, if this government is trying to be 
effective, why does it not give a response immediately, within the 
time frame set out in the Standing Orders? When the committee 
presents a report on amendments to regulations to the minister, why 
does he ask for two or three extensions and why does the 
committee have to go on writing for two years, finally giving up in 
desperation for lack of results? If at least the minister responded to 
the committee report, things would improve, and there would be 
greater effectiveness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, when I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15126"> 15126 </A></B>
<P>
was asked to speak on Bill C-84 I was quite interested and 
enthusiastic, just as the member for Fraser Valley West was.
<P>
	This bill affects small and medium-sized businesses. It is an 
important bill. As a business person, I have experienced the 
regulations at all levels of government that do not make sense 
today.
<P>
	Bill C-84 replaces the Statutory Instruments Act, which is 
almost 25 years old. We have not had a serious look at it in 25 
years. That is a long time. It was probably outdated 10 years ago. It 
is something we should have looked at a long time ago. 
Unfortunately, in government and in politics legislation that should 
be reviewed frequently is often not because there is no political 
pressure to review it. I hope we will look at opportunities to review 
legislation more often and add some sort of sunset clause so that we 
can modernize regulations on a regular basis.
<P>
	I was disappointed to hear that the opposition is not going to 
support the bill. They should actually be congratulating the 
Minister of Justice for putting the bill before a parliamentary 
committee before second reading, where the principles of the bill 
can be examined. This is something members of the third party 
have often asked for. They want more participation. They want 
greater opportunities for members of Parliament to be involved in 
discussions of the bills. This is a great opportunity. Since members 
across the way asked for it, I thought they would be very 
enthusiastic and would congratulate the minister for giving that 
opportunity. Instead, the member for Fraser Valley West was very 
articulate in talking about the fact that he was not in favour of the 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	This bill is 25 years old. It is complex, cumbersome, and a real 
burden to Canadians. The minister is saying we want to simplify 
and modernize it. We want to make sure that it makes sense for 
today. What do we hear from the opposition members? They 
cannot support it; they are not in favour of it. Are they not in favour 
of simplifying the bill? Are they not in favour of modernizing the 
bill? Are they not in favour of making sure that committees can do 
their work and look at this bill?
<P>
	We often hear in this House about how we have to simplify 
regulations. We often hear how a lot of the legislation does not 
make sense for today and that we need to have common sense. Here 
the minister is providing that opportunity and the opposition 
members are saying they do not agree with it.
<P>
	I, and I presume many other members, have been confronted 
with a regulation that often makes no sense for today. We then go to 
some of the bureaucrats and tell them this does not make sense in 
today's business climate, in today's environment, and in today's 
technology. Often some of the bureaucrats agree with us but tell us 
their hands are tied because the regulation is very old and has not 
been reviewed and therefore they have to comply with the 
regulation.
<P>
	This is a very good opportunity for all members of Parliament to 
participate in the changes that are required to have an environment 
that is efficient. I know the members from the third party often talk 
about creating greater efficiencies and an environment for 
businesses so they can have a cost saving.
<P>
	In terms of the environment, I toured a company in my own 
riding, Pacific Meadows, that is involved in the recycling of metal. 
They inform me that there are certain regulations that impede their 
opportunity to recycle.
<P>
	Often when government forms regulations it throws this huge 
net out there and catches, just as it does in the fishing industry, 
something it does not intend to catch. It becomes an impediment 
for small and medium-sized companies to do their business. The 
net was cast out to cover all sorts of things but not intended to catch 
some businesses. That is why we need the opportunity, on a regular 
basis, to review the regulatory process and regulations to ensure 
that it makes sense for today's environment in terms of 
international trade, changes in the environment, and changes in the 
health care area. All those areas have to be taken into 
consideration. The present act does not take those things into 
consideration.
<P>
	This bill will go a long way to ensuring that we have a 
simplified, modernized bill. I do not know how anybody can be 
against simplifying something. We have come to a new age of 
communications and electronics. One of the things this bill 
proposes is that we have an electronic registry where forms will be 
filled out electronically so that we can become more efficient and 
more cost effective. I believe that will go a long way.
<P>
	I hope the members across the way will realize that small and 
medium-sized businesses all over this country will be disappointed 
with the stand they have taken to vote against modernizing a 
regulatory process when business people all over this country know 
we have to improve the way our regulatory process works. I think 
Canadians across this country will applaud the government and the 
Minister of Justice for bringing this legislation forward to 
modernize and simplify our regulations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Bill C-84 is an attempt to create confusion in Canadian regulations. 
There is certainly no indication that this bill will lead to any 
improvement.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	As my colleagues already pointed out, the bill will in fact allow 
the government to hide its operational mistakes and waste. It will 
make it easier for public servants and government officials to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15127"> 15127 </A></B>
<P>
circumvent Parliament. My colleagues already explained that it is 
creating confusion in the regulatory process.
<P>
	This is one of the reasons why we will vote against the bill. 
Contrary to what my colleague just said, I do not even believe it is 
an important bill. It was merely introduced to keep the House busy, 
to avoid dealing with the real issues, the real problems. This bill 
will not help job creation. We know full well that this bill, like a 
number of other insignificant ones, is being introduced to keep the 
House occupied and avoid any debate on sovereignty or the future 
of Canada. It allows the government to procrastinate and wait until 
after the referendum to make cuts in Quebec. Social programs will 
be drastically cut.
<P>
	Next year, cuts will be more drastic than this year. This year, 
$650 million will be cut in social programs. Next year, it could be 
$1.2 billion and maybe more. The following years, it will be $2 to 
$3 billion a year. These are the real problems. They affect 
Canadians and Quebecers who would like their elected 
representatives to address these problems. And yet, here we are in 
this House talking about a piece of legislation which deals with 
regulations and does not even improve the situation, creates 
confusion and gives bureaucrats more powers to impose 
regulations which might not be beneficial to small business and 
business people.
<P>
	As far as the real issues are concerned, this government has a 
tendency to table legislation in keeping with a political philosophy 
which is increasingly more right wing, favouring cuts and the 
centralization of powers. What is happening to social programs 
clearly shows that this government has no respect for the ordinary 
citizen. When it makes huge cuts in social programs and reduces UI 
accessibility, these are the real issues.
<P>
	Why not talk about that, rather than about regulations which, for 
all intent and purposes, are without any importance? It is because 
we are waiting until October 30, to see whether Quebec will vote 
for sovereignty. Personally, I hope that Quebecers will realize that 
federalism is no longer profitable, that Quebec contributes more 
and more to a central government which is less and less effective, 
and Bill C-84 proves it, because again it creates confusion. It is 
inconsistent and does not even abide by the Official Languages 
Act.
<P>
	We are giving powers to officials without making them 
responsible to Parliament. This is what Canada is offering the 
people of Quebec. Here we have a government which is less and 
less effective, which creates confusion and which despises Quebec. 
When we talk about cuts in social programs worth billions of 
dollars per year, when we talk about cuts in unemployment 
insurance, we are talking about things which impact on ordinary 
people. Also, the government has shown that it intends to reduce 
old age pensions. These are real problems, real issues which worry 
people, at least in Quebec, and here we are, today, talking about 
regulations, something that nobody understands.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Reading through the bill, one cannot see its purposes nor its 
basis, except perhaps to keep us busy here, in the House, talking for 
hours on end about this worthless jumble. The real questions are 
being avoided, or postponed to the end of October.
<P>
	This bill is another example of the federal government's 
tendency to centralize, of its policy shift to the right. This is 
serious, because the trend was already evident throughout North 
America, in Alberta, in Ontario, but now it reaches into the federal 
government. It will soon make itself felt in cuts to unemployment 
insurance and social programs, and many Quebecers will end up on 
welfare.
<P>
	Federalism is not profitable for Quebec any more. From now on, 
Quebec will see itself paying more and more every year into the 
federal system while receiving less and less. Incidentally, Quebec 
has not been receiving its due share from all federal departments 
for a very long time now. We did receive a lot of money through 
equalization payments and unemployment insurance benefits, but 
that will change in the next few years. Quebec will get less and less 
and pay more and more.
<P>
	In the case of unemployment insurance, the federal government 
stopped contributing to it in 1990, employees and employers 
paying for it entirely. This year, in 1995, the federal government 
took from the UI program some $5 billion that will be used to other 
ends than unemployment insurance payments. Not only are they 
not giving money for those who lost their job, they are limiting 
access to UI benefits. Next year, in Quebec, two thirds of the 
people who will claim unemployment insurance benefits will be 
found ineligible.
<P>
	It has already been estimated that 40,000 unemployed will have 
to go on welfare. These are the real issues that concern people. But, 
this week, in the House, we will be talking about regulations which 
do not make sense and only show that the government does not 
know where it is going. This government is not addressing 
fondamental concerns, because in the debate on sovereignty, it has 
nothing to offer to Quebec; therefore, it is avoiding dealing with 
issues.
<P>
	In Quebec, we want to give confidence to Quebecers and to 
encourage them to take their destiny into their own hands after 
October 30. We want to give real hope to employers, to ensure 
equity and justice. This bill concerns the justice department. 
However, the best way for Quebecers to get real justice at home is 
for Quebec to become sovereign.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I must say 
that it gives me a great deal of pleasure to take part in the debate 
this afternoon.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15128"> 15128 </A></B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, when you and I were both elected in 1988, 
among all of us who came into Parliament that year there were 
probably a number of things we wanted to do here as 
parliamentarians. A number of issues were of tremendous interest 
to us: the question of the future of our wonderful country, the unity 
of Canada, the continued thriving of one united Canada, and issues 
relating to matters very close to my heart such as making sure 
that violence against women is eradicated soon.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	It is a safe bet to say that the majority of members of Parliament 
whenever they were elected do not necessarily become passionate 
over tissues like Bill C-84, the Regulations Act. Yet these matters 
are very important.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands will take part in 
the debate a little later. I think this is something the hon. member 
understands full well. From his years as a high school student when 
he wrote a paper about the pipeline debate in the House the hon. 
member has been very interested in and perhaps one of the most 
knowledgeable members of the House on questions of process.
<P>
	When we talk about regulations and the Regulations Act we are 
really talking about process, if I might wax somewhat hyperbolic, 
read in tooth and claw, as I am sure the hon. member from Kingston 
and the Islands would agree.
<P>
	It is not the stuff of which romantic novels or poems are written. 
It is not the stuff of overweening rhetoric, but it is the stuff of the 
day to day operation of government. Most particularly it is the stuff 
of the day to day operation of good government.
<P>
	What are the objectives of the bill? There are a number of 
objectives. It will simplify and streamline the regulation making 
process because it will clarify existing legal uncertainties in the 
regulatory field. That sentence probably does not strike huge 
chords of interest in the populous in general. It probably does not 
strike huge chords of interest in my colleagues on the opposite side 
in any of the opposition parties. I would hazard a guess that, fond as 
I know my colleagues on this side of the House are of me, it 
probably is not striking huge chords of interest in the member from 
Miramichi, for example. I do not think it is striking huge chords of 
interest in my friend from Saskatchewan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Not at present.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Not at present. That is all right too because this is 
the stuff of good government. It also is the stuff of promise 
keeping. One of the major promises in our red book in 1993 was to 
simplify and streamline the red tape that affected small business 
and this act will do just that. For example, it will replace the 
antiquated and misunderstood phrase statutory instrument with the 
word ``regulation''.
<P>
	In my time practising law, teaching law and commenting on the 
law in the media before I came to this place, there was the idea that 
we had to demystify the processes of law and government for most 
Canadians. It is certainly of great importance that we demystify 
those processes for those Canadians working in the area of small 
business.
<P>
	The legislation will modernize the regulatory process for the 
information age by providing a legislative framework for the 
electronic publication of regulations and for public comment, the 
electronic medium. That is yet another milestone for us on the 
information highway, an area in which the hon. Minister of 
Industry and the hon. Secretary of State for Science and 
Technology have served us so well in recent days.
<P>
	The act will make regulations more responsive to public 
concerns by improving the scrutiny role of the Joint Committee on 
the Scrutiny of Regulations.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	It was not necessarily one of those committees that members of 
Parliament from either side of the House rushed to join, but it was 
one very important to the smooth functioning of good government. 
One of the reasons the government is in power is that historically 
and currently we offer good government to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> One of the ways we do it is by not electing empty 
barrels.
<P>
	By streamlining and simplifying the regulatory process and 
making it more accessible to the public, the act supports 
government efforts to make government more transparent and open 
to Canadians, again a fulfilment of a red book process.
<P>
	The legislation also supports the government's agenda of 
promoting economic growth and job creation through a streamlined 
and expedited regulatory process that will improve the capacity of 
departments to respond rapidly to the changing circumstances of 
the global economy.
<P>
	One thing I find when I go back to my riding and talk with 
people in small business is the question of not knowing what is 
expected of them. The passage of the bill will make the problem 
much less onerous for Canadian operators of small businesses.
<P>
	I think, for example, of those people who opened small 
businesses in the city of Halifax. I think in particular of those 
people who are the most common openers of small business in the 
country, women. Women start more small businesses in Canada 
than men do. They tend to stay at it longer and they tend in the long 
run to be more successful.
<P>
	One of the problems I hear from women when I go to meetings 
encouraging women entrepreneurs, talking with them about small 
business and the relationship between government and small 
business, is a fear to get into these  areas because they are not sure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15129"> 15129 </A></B>
<P>
what is expected of them. They feel they will have to pay 
accountants and lawyers large amounts of money to interpret 
government policy to make sure that their businesses are staying 
within the realms of government regulation.
<P>
	The bill will go a long way to easing those fears, to opening up 
for entrepreneurs the ideas of government policy and to telling 
them exactly what is expected of them.
<P>
	The whole point of good government is to make the country an 
even better place, an even more liveable place for the people who 
live in it. I listened to my colleague from Quebec a few minutes 
ago. He made the point over and over again that the federal 
government had nothing to offer to the people of Quebec. I do not 
believe that, Madam Speaker. I know that you do not believe it. 
More important, the people of Quebec do not believe it either.
<P>
	Just recently I had the very good fortune to travel right across the 
country. As a matter of fact this summer I did it twice, once by 
stopping off in various places with the immigration committee and 
listening to people-my hon. colleague from Bourassa was with 
me on that trip-and once again by returning from the fourth 
women's conference in Beijing via Vancouver and Calgary to 
Ottawa.
<P>
	The ties that bind us together never cease to amaze me, whether 
we are from Quebec or the maritimes, the north or the west; 
whether we are from Southwest Nova or Kingston and the Islands; 
whether we are from the beautiful province of British Columbia; 
whether we are from the north or the prairies; or whether we are 
from that beautiful province that is every bit as much my country as 
it is yours, the province of Quebec.
<P>
	It is good government that this government offers Canadians. It 
is good government that will keep Canadians together. It is acts like 
this one in their plainness that give us good government.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
although in favour of the updating of the Regulations Act to 
address the problem of the current regulatory process, the Bloc 
Quebecois cannot and will not enter this venture blindly.
<P>
	As it is, Bill C-84 does not give all the safeguards we should 
expect. First, clause 5 provides that the Governor in Council may 
exempt regulations from the application of the regulatory process 
provided that the public interest is respected.
<P>
	According to the same clause, the public interest includes 
achieving goals relating to safety, health, the environment and 
sustainable development and reducing regulatory costs and delays. 
Why are the objectives of safety, health and the environment 
mentioned? Is the  government trying in a underhanded manner to 
extend the federal jurisdiction over the environment sector? Is the 
government once more trying to create unnecessary and expensive 
overlaps?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>Come on!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Nothing of the such.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> That is what the bill says, dear colleague.
<P>
	Does this government want to take over provincial areas of 
jurisdiction? Is this what they call flexible federalism? For me we 
are rather going backwards. Another attempt to pull a fast one on 
the provinces. This bill also questions the publication of 
regulations. This bill calls into question many other aspects. It is 
left to the Clerk of the Privy Council to decide whether all 
regulations should be published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> as is now 
the case or in any other venue as he sees fit, either in special 
interest magazines or through electronic means.
<P>
	What openness. Only the people and organizations directly 
concerned could have easy access to the regulations. This 
procedure fosters inequalities between people and between small 
businesses and large corporations, which, unlike small businesses, 
can afford lobbyists to keep a close eye on what the government is 
doing.
<P>
	This kind of action is unconscionable. The clerk must be 
required to publish an official notice in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. And to 
better spread the information, he may order that the regulations be 
published in a different venue. I have no problem with that. That is 
progress, that is transparency, and not a double standard policy 
where the government tries to hide some information. But there is 
worse than that in this bill.
<P>
	This bill is indefensible, especially the clause that indicates that 
failure to publish a regulation does not invalidate it. That is where 
the shoe pinches. The government must at least be honest; people 
have the right to know which regulations are in effect. The official 
publication of the regulation must validate it. How could it be 
otherwise, if we want to insure equity to the people in general?
<P>
	To some extent, this bill allows the privatization of commercial 
and industrial regulations, probably based on American standards, 
which opens the door to the introduction of standards written only 
in English.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Who will be responsible for translating an American code on 
screw and bolt strength requirements for the aircraft industry, for 
example? If such a code were available in French, what guarantee 
do we have that subsequent changes will be published in French by 
the American association?
<P>
	By providing few guarantees, Canada is using cooperating 
agencies or countries to impose upon us  standards and frameworks 
that do not concern us. With this legislation, in particular clause 19, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15130"> 15130 </A></B>
<P>
the federal government is trying, little by little, to minimize the 
Quebec culture by eroding our identity.
<P>
	In its opinion, there is only one multicultural Canadian culture 
expressing itself in several languages, including French, but mainly 
in English.
<P>
	Parliament scrutiny of the regulatory process is maintained in its 
existing form. The government should have taken the opportunity 
given by this act to improve distribution of regulations to all 
members of Parliament. The legislation should provide for the 
right of every member to have access to regulations through 
electronic means or at least through a printed copy. The whole body 
of federal legislation must be available. Yet, at present, members of 
Parliament do not have access to this work instrument.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to point out another anomaly the 
government is not correcting in this legislation. As soon as a bill is 
introduced in the House, the government has regulations drafted. If 
members had access to draft regulations when legislation is 
debated, we would avoid a loss of time in basic discussion and we 
would be in a better position to assess the impact of new 
regulations.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I will vote against this legislation in its 
present form, but I will vote yes in the upcoming Quebec 
referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with a great deal of interest to the speech of the hon. 
member for Bourassa, because it contained many good ideas. I 
hope he will sit on the standing committee on government 
operations, to which this bill will be referred. He will then have the 
opportunity to move amendments because, as he knows very well, 
the government introduced this bill and moved that it be referred to 
committee today, before second reading, so that he and other 
members on the standing committee can move all kinds of 
amendments. That is part and parcel of the new procedure 
introduced by the government at the beginning of this session of 
Parliament, and I certainly hope the hon. member will be on the 
committee with his ideas and amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think it is an extremely important procedure that is being 
followed on this particular bill. I say so because I think the bill has 
some deficiencies, some of which were pointed out by the hon. 
member in his speech, which cause me concern. I am sure the 
members of the committee will want to take a very careful look at 
it.
<P>
	As a member of the scrutiny of regulations committee who has 
been working in this area for about two years now, I have my own 
concerns about this bill. I am sorry that it is not being referred to 
the Standing Joint  Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations, which 
has some expertise in this area among the members of the 
committee who have worked on this. Many of the members of the 
committee have worked on it a good deal longer than I have and are 
far more knowledgeable. I am sorry they are not going to have the 
opportunity to deal with it as a committee.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, I strongly suspect some of us will attend the 
odd meeting of the government operations committee and make 
known our views in respect of certain aspects of this bill, which I 
hope will help the minister as he deals with it in committee and will 
help make the bill a better one for everybody in Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Bring Mary back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I know the hon. members want to hear more from 
the hon. member for Halifax, the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. I too regret that her 
speech was limited to 10 minutes. I was enjoying her speech too. I 
also note her reference to hon. members opposite as barrels. I am 
sure they were enjoying that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> At least we're full barrels, not empty like the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Well, the hon. member says that they are full 
barrels. I am not sure what they are full of.
<P>
	I would like to deal with a few of the proposals in the bill. Rather 
than being distracted by the comments from the other side, I would 
prefer to stick to my own views on this bill today.
<P>
	I want first to praise the minister for agreeing to allow the bill to 
be referred to committee before second reading. I believe it gives 
the committee maximum scope-notwithstanding the criticisms 
we have heard from the other side about this-to effect change to 
this bill should it find the provisions in the bill are unsatisfactory.
<P>
	We know from the previous speaker's comments that the bill 
purports to repeal the Statutory Instruments Act and replace the 
definition of statutory instruments with a new definition of 
regulation. It allows among its provisions for the incorporation by 
reference of regulations or of descriptions in other documents 
promulgated by other organizations or other governments.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Bourassa in his remarks referred to 
clause 16 of the bill, which says that a regulation may incorporate 
by reference material produced by a person or body other than the 
regulatory authority, including a personal body such as an 
industrial or trade organization and a government agency or 
international body. He expressed some concern about that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15131"> 15131 </A></B>
<P>
	I have an additional concern. In clause 19 of the bill it says 
``Material does not become a regulation for the purposes of this 
act because it is incorporated by reference in a regulation''. I have 
a slight concern, because a regulation is referred to the Standing 
Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations. Will the material 
incorporated by reference also be referred to that committee? I 
believe it is important that it be so referred. If clause 19 will be 
argued as a means for saying that it is not before the committee, 
I would have concerns. That is a point that should be clarified in 
the course of the committee proceedings on this bill.
<P>
	I note that clause 25 of the bill, which refers regulations to 
committees, does constitute an improvement over the existing law. 
There are certain statutory instruments currently now adopted that 
do not come before the scrutiny of regulations committee. The 
definition contained in this act widens the scope of the committee's 
work to allow it to see more than was otherwise the case.
<P>
	I have attempted through questioning to elicit the lists of the 
kinds of things that would not now be referred to the committee, 
but without a lot of success. I fully anticipate the government 
operations committee in the course of its deliberations on this bill 
will be able to get that information. I am looking forward to seeing 
the list and I will review it of course with some care.
<P>
	The fact that there is a wider definition of those things being 
referred is significant. I believe it represents an advance in the law. 
I am surprised to hear the hon. member for Bourassa
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	-and his colleagues, the hon. members for Québec-Est and 
Chambly, expressing negative views on this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Very negative.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Very negative, as the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is saying.
<P>
	This is not necessary, because the bill is a good bill, with good 
ideas. There have been a lot of changes in this area of the law, and 
that is important. This is a renewal, and that is why it is important, 
because nothing was done in this area for several years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
The other aspect of the bill I wanted to mention was the fact that 
the changes the government is proposing in simplifying the whole 
regulatory process one hopes-it is a hope that is fervent on my 
part, but I am not sure I am fully expecting it to be fulfilled-will 
result in more efficient use of the regulatory process.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	As a member of the scrutiny of regulations committee, one of the 
criticisms I have of the current process is the slowness with which 
things move. I know that citizens I  run into who are operating 
businesses find it passing strange that it takes the government so 
long to make changes to regulations that are shown to be out of date 
and inapplicable in the circumstances.
<P>
	I did not bring any horror stories with me today. I have not had a 
recent incident. However, I am aware that over the years members 
of the public have complained that a regulation is out of date, 
should have been changed, the standards in the industry have 
changed dramatically and the regulation no longer reflects 
industrial practice and is simply not enforced because nobody is 
obeying the regulation. Yet nobody gets around to making changes 
to it. Part of the reason no one gets around to making these changes 
is because of the time it takes to get changes effected in 
government regulations. It is a process that takes months or years. 
Because of that we have suffered.
<P>
	The regulatory regime in Canada is nowhere near as good as it 
should be. It could be improved drastically if change could be 
effected more quickly. This bill will allow that. To that extent, it is 
a beneficial change. We may want to look at the ways it allows it, 
we may want to look at the safeguards built into the process, but the 
fact is that the bill does allow more efficiency. For that reason 
alone, I think it is worth supporting.
<P>
	As I say, I am surprised to hear my colleague from Bourassa say 
that he will not vote for the bill at this stage when we are not 
approving it in principle. We are simply referring the bill to 
committee before second reading. I know what has happened. He 
has listened to somebody else in his party who decided that the 
party should vote against it and he is going along with that. If he 
had argued in the right places I think he could have convinced his 
leader and the other members of his party that they should be 
supporting the bill.
<P>
	I am not sure of the position of the Reform Party. Unfortunately, 
I missed their speaker on this bill. But I understand that the Reform 
Party is also opposed to the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> You missed more than that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says that I missed more than 
that. I did miss more than that, but I understand there was only one 
speech made by the Reform Party on this bill. I do not know who 
made the speech. I suspect it was one of the members who is sitting 
here now. I am sorry I missed it. I am sure I would have enjoyed it. 
But whether it would have illumined me on the subject of the bill is 
another matter. Perhaps the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, when he makes his speech, will be 
able to comment on the pearls of wisdom, or otherwise, we heard 
from the Reform Party earlier this afternoon.
<P>
	I would like to thank the minister again and praise him for 
bringing forward the bill. I believe it is important to have a look at 
this area of the law. This bill will allow the committee responsible 
to do that. I only hope that the  members of the scrutiny of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15132"> 15132 </A></B>
<P>
regulations committee will have an opportunity to have some input 
on the bill during the course of committee deliberations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak, 
albeit briefly, on this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, once again, we have seen that the Liberal government is 
in favour of this democratic evolution, this modernization of the 
legislation, and we can see too that the two parties on the other side 
want to maintain the status quo. It is clear. Obviously, this is not 
surprising on the part of the Reform Party, because we know that 
these people are much like a species that disappeared millions of 
years ago, and I do not think it is necessary to mention the species 
we are talking about. However, we are a bit surprised by the hon. 
members from the Bloc Quebecois, because they claim they want 
progress, they want change.
<P>
	Oh, well. Sometimes, they change things by going backwards, 
but I must say that I am a bit surprised to see that they are in favour 
of the motion before the House today. The motion now before the 
House is interesting, because we are not passing this bill. We are 
only talking about the House referring the bill to a parliamentary 
committee without first having approved it.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	I could have read the exact motion. Pursuant to Standing Order 
73(1), Bill C-84 would be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Government Operations before second reading. The bill deals with 
the registration, publication and parliamentary scrutiny of 
regulations.
<P>
	In other words, we are not asking members to tell us today if 
they are in favour or against the bill. The only thing the government 
is asking the House is for this bill to be discussed in committee, 
without first getting approval in principle at second reading stage.
<P>
	So, we are not asking members opposite for their approval. We 
are asking for a parliamentary committee to consider this bill 
beforehand, to determine if we should approve it, with or without 
amendments. In other words, we want to find ways to improve the 
way we do things.
<P>
	The member for Bourassa and others are in favour of the status 
quo. They are against progressive, flexible federalism as we see it 
on this side of the House. They are uncompromising, they are dead 
set on keeping the status quo and they refuse to let this bill go 
through.
<P>
	You can see how our colleagues opposite are acting. They are 
very partisan and show a total lack of objectivity. We heard the 
member for Bourassa say in his speech that he thought the 
government could use this bill-and keep in mind that we are not 
voting on the bill, but only referring it to a committee for prior 
study-that  this bill could be used against the French culture. 
Imagine that, we are talking here about a bill aimed at modernizing 
the regulations review process. Is the member not going too far?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill will do a number of things such as replace the rather 
antiquated and misunderstood phrase statutory instruments with 
something a little more modern like regulations. I must say that 
some of these terms confuse the best of us.
<P>
	A moment ago I was saying to my colleague, the parliamentary 
secretary, that the term statutory instruments was about as clear as 
a term used sometimes in real estate known as incorporeal 
hereditament. My colleague, the member for Victoria-Haliburton, 
who I think is a real estate agent by training, will know what I am 
referring to. It is another way of describing curtain rods and such. It 
can mean more than curtain rods, but that is the thrust of the debate. 
I am told it can also mean sump pumps and the like.
<P>
	The point I am making is that we have some terms in law that are 
confusing at the best of times. In this process we are studying at 
committee level the Regulations Act to modernize it. There could 
be places in the bill where the committee will offer changes or 
modifications to better the bill before it asks the House for 
approval in principle.
<P>
	The important and operative point to remember is that the only 
matter being sought of the House right now is whether the bill 
should be studied in committee, not should it be approved in 
principle first and referred to a committee which is the normal way 
of doing business. Today that is not even being sought.
<P>
	What do we hear from across the way but systematic obstruction 
that we are familiar with? Those members are married to the status 
quo. They want no improvement in the federation, no improvement 
in our laws and no modernization.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands has informed us 
that he is very much interested in the issue, as he should be, 
because he is learned in the law. He will no doubt have an 
important contribution to make to that effect in committee.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Government Operations is very ably 
chaired by the hon. member for Fundy Royal. He is also a very well 
known lawyer and will be able to deal with the issue along with 
other members of the committee who will be studying the bill.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How many lawyers are there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> A member across the way is asking how many 
lawyers are on the committee. I think it is a grand total of one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15133"> 15133 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> That is too many.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> A member across says that is too many to deal 
with statutory instruments. Perhaps we can have the benefit of the 
wisdom of the member who has made these utterances. In 
committee he will no doubt enlighten the rest of us on how to 
proceed with modernizing the statutory instruments of Canada.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member for Timmins-Chapleau will be 
listening attentively. He too is learned in the law and will be 
listening to the immense contribution of the member across the 
way so he can inform us on how to better the statutory instruments 
or the regulations made pursuant to the laws of the land.
<P>
	I know the hon. member across the way is just champing at the 
bit. I know he will make a profound discourse on the subject. My 
colleagues and I are all waiting anxiously to hear the comments of 
the hon. member across the way in the Reform Party who is 
heckling at the present time and who is obviously very anxious to 
participate in this very important debate this afternoon.
<P>
	I want him to tell us exactly what the position of his party is with 
regard to referring the bill before second reading for a full study 
prior to approval in principle in the House of Commons and why it 
is his party is choosing to behave in that way, if not simply to say 
that it has no interest in making things in the House better or more 
modern.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will say, in conclusion, that it is not too late for the member for 
Bourassa, the member for Drummond and others to change their 
mind and to vote in favour of this motion to refer the bill to 
committee before second reading.
<P>
	In doing so, we are showing our intention, our desire, 
collectively and individually, to improve the laws of Canada. We 
will see in a few moments if the members for Bourassa, Mercier, 
Drummond and our other colleagues opposite are in favour of the 
status quo or if they are in favour of improvement. We will see in a 
few moments. But let us not hold our breath, because it is quite 
likely that these people will want the status quo because it suits 
their purpose in the current debate.
