</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for the country of my ancestors, Hungary, the year 2000 
marks a special anniversary.  The Hungarian state is 1,000 years 
old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At Christmas in the year 1000 AD, almost 500 years before 
Europeans stumbled upon the new world, Stephen, the first king of 
the Magyars, was crowned with a crown sent by Pope Silvester II. 
King Stephen later became St. Stephen, canonized on August 20, 
1083. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many celebrations are planned in Hungary for this historic 
milestone.  On May 19 and 20 in Budapest the Hungary 2000 
Conference will be convened.  The Canadian parliament will be 
represented by a delegation of the Canada-Hungary Parliamentary 
Friendship Group led by me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to extending congratulations on behalf of all 
parliamentarians as Hungary celebrates 1000 years of statehood, 
the Magyar millennium.

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one year ago today the 
Minister of Justice said in response to the special joint 
committee report “For the Sake of the Children”,  “Canadians 
agree that when families break down, the needs and best interests 
of children must be the highest priority”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, a year has elapsed and this high priority item is nowhere 
to be seen.  The minister has caved in to the bureaucratic 
insider systems agenda of just leaving the Divorce Act as it is. 
The concerns are the same wherever I go in Canada about the 
shortcomings of the Divorce Act for the child-parent 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need shared parenting put in the law.  The act must serve 
children's needs first and grandparents must be permitted their 
rightful place in the law.  Maintenance should reflect the 
principle of ability to pay and demonstrated need. There must be 
easier access to the superior courts and all orders must be 
easily enforced, especially child access terms and parental 
guardianship.  The act must respond to false allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of parents, grandparents and most of all the children, 
I pray that the House of Commons does not have to hear a similar 
plea for action on May 10, 2001 but rather, that the Canadian 
Alliance government will have already acted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to draw the attention of the House to a ceremony which took 
place today. The Canadian National Railway donated a vast 
collection of photos collected by it over the last 150 years of 
railway building to the Canadian Museum of Science and 
Technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the Grand Trunk Railway to the National Transcontinental, 
to the Newfoundland railway system and the Canadian Northern, 
railways have been the building blocks that have made our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These pictures are available to Canadians on the web.  This 
shows how the new technologies being learned by Canadians can 
help celebrate our past history and culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of parliament, I would like to thank the CNR for its 
contributions to making the stories of the building of our 
country available to all Canadians so that we can appreciate the 
struggle that has made Canada the great country it is today.

is the 52nd anniversary of the establishment of the state of 
Israel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Israel is not simply the Andy Warhol of the international media. 
Rather, it must be seen and understood as the drama and 
development of civilization itself, as a first nation of 
humankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a word, the Jewish people are a prototypical aboriginal 
people just as the Jewish religion is a prototypical aboriginal 
religion and Hebrew an aboriginal language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Jewish people still inhabit the same land, bear the same 
name, worship the same God, study the same Bible and speak the 
same language as they did 3,500 years ago and whose abiding hope 
and dream is to live in peace with the other indigenous nations 
and peoples of the region, the Arab nations and Palestinian

I rise today to advise all hon. members that the Nature

potentially groundbreaking research projects and 36 research 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues, please join me in urging all Canadians to join these

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

Edmonton at the age of 95. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1929 Dr. Jackson was fresh out of medical school in England 
and was looking for adventure.  She found it in the Battle River 
area of the Peace River country where she became the resident 
doctor and made her rounds on horseback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her patients, who were mainly Cree and recent immigrants, 
pitched in to buy her a horse.  The working conditions were rough 
and isolated. Supplies and provisions were scarce.  In spite of 
that she was successful and highly regarded because of her 
dedication to her patients.  She used her ingenuity to overcome 
the isolation, transportation challenges and lack of medical 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 Dr. Jackson was awarded the Order of Canada in 
recognition of her service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of knowing Dr. Mary Percy Jackson and of 
listening to her stories of practising medicine under tough 
conditions.  I debated health care issues with her when she was 
almost 90 years old.

being a senior citizen having worked hard all of your life and 
planned for a modest retirement on fixed income with just enough 
money to pay for essentials and drugs with a little bit left over 
to treat your grandchildren.  Then imagine $2,000 or even $5,000 
a year being yanked from your savings because the federal 
government signed a treaty with Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty thousand Canadian retirees face that very problem.  Until 
1996 these pensioners were taxed on 50% of their social security. 
Today it is 85%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I met with CASSE, a group appealing to their Windsor 
MP and the finance minister to restore the 50% exclusion in 
effect when they planned for their retirement.  Because of the 
sudden drop in income, seniors are being forced to move into 
cheaper apartments, are being ejected from nursing homes and are 
suffering erosion of their modest lifestyles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the finance minister today to restore the 50% 
exclusion or at the very least grandfather this rule so that it 
will no longer punish people who are already retired.

invitation to the Dallas Gold Festival in 2001, an honour in

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House of a real success 
story involving Canada's youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national youth at risk pilot project initiative resource 
collection “Open Your Mind—Open Their Lives” is the result of 
nine national organizations, 28 communities and hundreds of local 
partners in youth working together.  Teen Express 2000 in 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough is one of seven profiled as 
extremely successful.  Teen Express 2000 was established during 
the summer of 1998 as a co-operative venture among the Pictou 
County Women's Centre, New Glasgow Youth Centre, New 
Glasgow/Westville Police Service, YM-YWCA of Pictou County and 
Recreation New Glasgow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Establishing partnerships and creating mechanisms for shared 
information between organizations related to youth is the goal. 
This is achieved by means of a four step process: building 
awareness, gaining commitment, implementation and sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities and organizations form partnerships that will 
provide support, leadership, expertise and the commitment needed 
to develop a sustainable program for youth and children.  Many 
agencies and individuals are unaware of just how beneficial youth 
networking can be in their community.  Teen Express 2000 is a 
shining example to all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

dreadful addiction for fiction.  Yesterday he said “Today and 
for the past five years we have been giving only loans which have 
to be paid back”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a list here of 123 grants totalling more than $12 
million.  They are all grants.  They were all in the last three 
years when the Liberals were in power and all of them were 
non-repayable.  Why did the minister claim what he knew to be 
false? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, members of the official opposition stood 
in the Chamber two days ago and for 15 minutes blamed ACOA for 
giving money to the Clarenville sportsplex, only to discover that 
they were wrong, that it was an infrastructure program that did 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before that they blamed ACOA for spending all this money in 
1997, only to discover that they were wrong and that it was 
fisheries money.  Yesterday they claimed we gave out grants to 
businesses.  They are wrong because they are only loans.  I ask 
the leader:  What does it feel like to be wrong 100% of the time? 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at lease I will feel free to admit it 
when I have made a mistake.  I would like to remind the minister 
about what he said yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Yesterday the minister said“ we have 
been giving only loans which have to be paid back”.  He talks 
about infrastructure.  Everyone thought that was sewer and water, 
not sportplexes.  He says ACOA is about loans but really over the 
past five years 70% of ACOA spending has been on contributions. 
Those are giveaways, as far as I know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister pretending that ACOA is simply a lending 
agency when he knows that is not the case? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I have said consistently is the 
truth, that one cannot walk into an ACOA office anywhere in 
Canada as a business person and ask for a grant.  They will say 
“We only have loans and they must be paid back”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information that the official opposition has is zero based 
on facts and 100% based on fiction, pulp fiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  We are getting a little 
close on both sides with the fiction, pulp or otherwise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would seem to me that golf 
courses, let us use that as an example, would be equivalent to a 
business.  I thought they made money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a list of four golf courses here that ACOA funded in 
1998-99 under a Liberal administration to the tune of more than 
$2.5 million.  That is a business.  It came under grants and 
contributions.  We see now that ACOA really did fund golf 
courses.  When it comes to golf courses, should not this minister 
just improve his lie? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I would say the hon. member 
is pretty close to being out of bounds on that shot.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member said improve his 
line.  I think that was what she said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To clear up the confusion in case the hon. member's research 
bureau cannot do it, one can get grants, non-repayable 
contributions, if one is transferring money to the provincial 
government to do something that is a provincial government 
priority in these agreements, or under infrastructure, or if one 
is a non-profit organization, but there are no forgivable loans 
for businesses.  On these lines, if these lines keep up, they— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is enough on lines for today.

spending is one strange tale indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the little overblown agency that he has come to know and 
love seems to have a very big problem with its bookkeeping. Since 
the Liberals have come to power, ACOA has spent more than $19 
million on projects they refer to as “rationale unknown”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it the policy of the government to hand out millions of 
dollars of taxpayer money without knowing why or how that money 
is being spent?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and

example yesterday of this unknown category— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Are you going to answer the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker:</B>  I am answering the question. They 
gave an example as Bombardier ACOA grant unknown and then they 
said Mirabel, Quebec.  That was a loan.  It has been paid back. 
It set up a business in Fredericton, New Brunswick.  It employs 
over 30 people.  The only unknown thing here is where the 
opposition is getting this terrible information. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Well, Mr. Speaker, the similarities between the ACOA minister and 
the human resources minister are becoming more obvious every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both hand out millions of dollars of taxpayer money.  Both kind 
of know where the money went.  They just cannot figure out why it 
went to those agencies:  $19 million under rationale unknown.  If 
ACOA cannot explain why the money is needed, why does the 
minister continue to write the cheques?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency),

ACOA goes to big business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada did a study in 1997.  It examined over 6,000 
ACOA clients.  It found that 92% of the money goes to small and 
medium size businesses.  Who do we believe, the reform alliance 
or Statistics Canada?

“to be national one must first be regional”.  Yet today English

runs our military?  Is our military accountable to Canadians

forces ombudsman purely for show, or is he willing to give him 
the tools to do the job?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year when the Nanoose Bay testing range contract was

in Canadian waters.  Yet I have a document in which DND is 
advertising for trainers of DND personnel in the use of nuclear 
weapons components and construction and nuclear capable vessels 
at Nanoose and at CFB Halifax.  These are nuclear weapons, not 
nuclear powered vessels.

<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

There is certainly no testing of nuclear weapons that would be 
allowed in that range.  The United States navy never confirms or 
denies whether any nuclear weaponry is aboard its vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have operated this test range for numerous years.  It has 
always been done quite safely and quite successfully.  We want to

another petition from people in the Peterborough area who are 
concerned about children and civilians in Iraq.  They point out 
that Desert Storm and the sanctions since have devastated the 
Iraqi economy and estimate that it has caused the deaths of 
5,000 children a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call upon the Parliament of Canada to stop the 
suffering and death of the Iraqi people, and that excluding an 
embargo on military matériel, other sanctions be lifted.  They 
urge Canada and the United Nations to vastly increase efforts to 
provide food, medicine and funds for infrastructure 
reconstruction in Iraq.  They also ask that the compensation fund 
taken from the oil for food program be suspended.

their concerns regarding the production of child pornography.

child pornography perpetuates the production of child 
pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call upon parliament once again to recognize the fact that

of child pornography to ensure that it will never, ever, ever be 
legalized.

opportunities and a real boost to tourism.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the intention of the 
agricultural income disaster assistance program was to target 
assistance to those farmers in the greatest need. The federal

sound basis on which to design a disaster program for 
agriculture.  Therefore the government, and the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food in particular, has not produced any

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise at report stage 
debate on Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has come up twice before, having started through the 
process and having failed for various reasons.  It was started in 
this parliament again at first reading which was a surprise.  It 
had been through committee once before but there was need for a 
lot of change.  Unfortunately not nearly enough change was made 
to the bill to make it acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the motions I propose today will improve the bill.  If 
they are all accepted, they will improve it to a point where 
maybe we could support the bill.  It is certainly in need of 
change. I start by speaking to the Group No. 1 amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 deals with the issue of citizenship at birth for 
people born in Canada. For the past several years any child born 
in Canada automatically becomes a citizen.  Whether or not one of 
the child's parents was a citizen, whether or not one of the 
child's parents was a landed immigrant, it did not matter.  If 
someone was just here on a visit or in our country illegally, it 
did not matter; if the child was born in Canada the child 
automatically obtained Canadian citizenship. 
This remains in the new act in spite of many concerns raised 
which I will talk about.  Any child born in Canada, even if born 
of a person who is in our country illegally, will automatically 
become a citizen.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concern has come up several times before.  I deal with this 
concern in my amendment.  My amendment would ensure that a child 
would only become a citizen if one of the parents was either a 
landed immigrant or a citizen.  My proposal will ensure that the 
child will take the citizenship of a parent. Most Canadians see 
that as being reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians understand that there is a lot of abuse of the 
current system. People come to our country as visitors or come 
here illegally and have children born in our country knowing that 
those children will automatically become Canadian citizens.  That 
has an impact in particular because of the Mavis Baker case to 
which I am going to refer in detail. Due to court rulings and the 
inaction of the government, there are situations where 
people claim that because they have a child who was born in 
Canada, even though they were here illegally at the time the 
child was born, it would be wrong to remove the parent from the 
country because the child is a Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was taken to court by Mavis Baker last year and the 
courts ruled on it.  Mavis Baker was in the country illegally for 
years and had been ordered to leave the country on several 
occasions.  She had children born in Canada. These children 
became Canadian citizens.  In spite of all that, the court ruled 
that Ms. Baker would be allowed to stay in Canada.  One of the 
main considerations was that her children were Canadian citizens. 
The court did not seem to consider that Mavis Baker could return 
to her home country, that the children would be citizens of that 
country and that they could live together as a family in the 
country of origin.  The court did not consider that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result and because of inaction on the part of the 
government, this situation will lead to a lot more abuse in the 
country.  More people will come to our country illegally, have 
children and then use the argument that because they have a child 
who is a Canadian citizen they should be allowed to stay.  I do 
not think anyone would deny that argument has been used for being 
allowed to stay in the country when people otherwise would not be 
allowed to stay. It is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only have to refer to a recommendation of the House of Commons 
standing committee in 1994.  Of course since 1993 House of 
Commons standing committees have had a majority of government 
members, as did that committee.  The committee recommended that 
children born in Canada should be Canadian citizens only if one 
or both parents is a permanent resident or a Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government listen to the recommendation of that 
committee back in 1994?  It was a very strong recommendation. The 
committee strongly encouraged the government to take it to heart 
and put it into law.  That was in 1994.  Here we are six years 
later and the government has ignored what the committee 
recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not the only group that was really here at the will of 
the government.  Again, that committee had a majority of 
government members.  In voting the committee said that it wanted 
the law changed so that a child born in Canada would only be a 
Canadian citizen if he or she was born to one parent who was 
either a Canadian citizen or a landed immigrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the Immigration Legislative Review Advisory Group was set 
up by the government in 1997.  In its report “Not Just Numbers: 
A Canadian Framework for Future Immigration”, it made a comment 
on this issue. 
This is a quote from page 40 of the LRAG “Not Just Numbers” 
report which stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our consultations across the country we heard concerns about 
the abuse of the provision of the Citizenship Act granting 
automatic citizenship to children born on Canadian soil.  The 
government should collect data, study the real effects and 
determine whether current policy should be changed.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was three years ago, and still the government has not taken 
this recommendation to heart and put it in legislation.  I think 
this change is long overdue and will remove some of the abuse in 
our immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1998 during a press conference on Bill C-63, which was 
almost the same legislation as Bill C-16, the bill we are now 
debating, the former minister of immigration said that she made 
no changes to this clause because no research was done on how big 
the problem was.  They had not done the study after six years and 
they would not make the change because they did not really know 
just how big the problem was.  She knew that the committee was 
set up on behalf of the government and that the committees have 
said there was a problem.  She did not know how big the problem 
was so she would not make the change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That change was not made, which is very unfortunate.  That is 
why I brought this amendment before the House today so that the 
change would be made and we would respect the will of Canadians 
expressed through various consultation processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a terrible reputation for ignoring 
consultation when it consults.  That is a sad commentary.  People 
become very cynical about government when they see that time 
after time the results of its consultations are completely 
ignored.  That is what has happened here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister acknowledged that this was a problem.  On 
May 12, 1999, during a committee meeting discussing the 
legislation, Greg Fyffe, assistant deputy minister for policy and 
program development, was questioned on how long it would take to 
gather the data needed.  He replied: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We're looking now at a pilot project with the provinces to see if 
we can collect the data properly.  I think when we discussed this 
we were talking in terms of approximately three years, plus or 
minus, before we would have enough data to make a declaration on 
this 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are in 1999 and the minister and her department are 
saying after six years since the House of Commons committee 
reported, three years since the commission set up by the 
government reported and both recommended change, that they will 
establish a study to see just how big a problem it is.  This is 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have made the change and then do the 
study.  If it felt it had made the wrong change, if need be it 
could change it.  Canadians supported the change so I doubt it 
would be wrong.  I certainly do not believe it would be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several more motions in this group to which I would 
like to speak.  However I will count on other of my colleagues to 
cover these issues since my time is up. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak today to Bill C-16, particularly as we begin the debate on 
the motions in Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I deplore the fact that we are here debating this 
bill at report stage while the minister is appearing before the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. There is 
something rather odd about that. But, as parliamentarians, we 
must be flexible and we will adapt to these realities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several members of this Parliament, like my colleagues on the 
committee, will remember the battle I led in committee with 
regard to clause 8, particularly on April 11, 12 and 13. Those 
who read the minutes of proceedings from the committee will 
notice that I raised a number of concerns about clause 8, which 
deals with international adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legal counsels for the Department of Immigration were present at 
the time. They had the opportunity to provide their 
interpretation of the impact of clause 8, but I expressed a 
number of reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why so many reservations when it comes to international 
adoption?  There are, basically, two reasons, three even.  The 
first is that it must be kept in mind that this is primarily a 
provincial area of jurisdiction, particularly in Quebec.  The 
entire issue of international adoption comes under the 
jurisdiction of Quebec.  I had indicated at that time in 
connection with this that, as long as there was no amendment to 
confirm Quebec's jurisdiction, it was clear that we would be 
bringing in amendments to clause 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I said that I was concerned enough to think twice 
about supporting Bill C-16.  On April 12, I raised my first 
question and expressed my first concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second concern I expressed to the Immigration Canada legal 
adviser involved the specific nature of Quebec and one of the 
things that distinguishes it, namely the Civil Code, which is 
not, unfortunately, taken into consideration in Bill C-16, 
particularly in clause 8.  I therefore expressed a second 
concern: the fact that the bill did not take the Civil Code into 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third area of concern was the discrimination I feel will 
affect Quebec children, and of course Quebec parents, during the 
processing of the adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out first of all that, under its legislation, 
Quebec is responsible for adoption, which is allowed only once 
the process is complete.  The process is complete when the child 
arrives here in Canada, and more specifically on the territory 
of Quebec, and when a Quebec court hands down a decision. 
That is part of the system, of the reality and of the distinct 
nature of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill, as it is worded, states that the adoption 
will be complete once the following criterion has been met, that 
the adoption “was in accordance with the laws of the place where 
the adoption took place and the laws of the country of residence 
of the adopting citizen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 of the bill has a direct effect, because we think it 
discriminates to some extent against the children and the 
parents of Quebec.  We also feel that there is some loss of 
benefits for the children and the parents. It is clear, 
moreover, that Quebec parents will not benefit, as will parents 
in the rest of Canada who decide to adopt abroad, from the same 
rights and benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is fair, because I had already made the committee 
aware of it, on April 13.  The deputy minister was in attendance 
at the hearings, and I was assured there would be bilateral 
negotiations, that Quebec's views, the Civil Code and Quebec's 
jurisdiction in the area of international adoptions would be 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department's legal counsel went even further addressing this 
issue of bilateral work.  It was not new. 
I remind the House that the international adoption secretariat, 
especially for Quebec, had made requests.  It had indicated that 
it hoped bilateral work would be undertaken so that Quebec would 
be consulted in the various stages of the process, before the 
federal government granted citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not new.  The minister woke up and her officials woke up 
two weeks before the passage of this bill, when the Bloc 
Quebecois said in committee that there was a problem.  So things 
had to be activated and negotiations initiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec gave negotiations a chance.  As late as yesterday, the 
deputy ministers were talking.  They wanted amendments to be 
made, they wanted the government to respond to the wishes 
expressed by the Government of Quebec so that Bill C-16 could 
conform to the Quebec Civil Code and the Quebec reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, close to 12 hours after these negotiations have failed, we 
have no other option. In committee, I told the minister that I 
would be patient and that I would not propose amendments. I said 
we would give bilateral negotiations a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, it is sometimes better to have a negotiated 
solution than direct proposals. Today, we have no alternative 
but to present this motion at report stage. That motion, which 
seeks to amend clause 8, reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater certainty, the Province of Quebec shall continue to 
have full jurisdiction in respect of international adoptions, 
including the acceptance of any psychosocial assessment of 
adoptive parents and the issue of a letter of no objection to 
the adoption of a child. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister shall, on application, grant citizenship to a minor 
child adopted outside Canada by a citizen domiciled or 
ordinarily resident in Quebec, although the adoption procedure 
has not yet been completed in accordance with the laws of 
Quebec, if 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the adoption is not intended to circumvent the requirements 
under any enactment for admission to Canada or citizenship; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) the adoption proposal has been approved by the 
administrative authority designated for that purpose by the 
minister of the government of Quebec responsible for 
international adoptions. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment that we are proposing has already been submitted 
to the deputy minister. 
It was also communicated to the Minister of Immigration very 
recently, on May 9, in a letter from Minister Robert Perreault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our hope that, even though negotiations have failed, the 
government will support this amendment, which only seeks to 
ensure respect of Quebec's Civil Code.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make a few comments in response to the motions brought 
forward by my colleague from Lakeland with respect to Bill C-16, 
beginning with Motion No. 1, which would amend clause 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the intent of the motion seems to be reasonable, the 
reality is that the member is calling for quite a shift from the 
way Canada has been doing things for over 100 years and what many 
democracies around the world have been doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the motivation for his motion, which would 
deny a child born in Canada the right to citizenship.  The member 
is indicating that there is a problem.  Aside from the very few 
cases that have been reported in the media, I do not believe 
there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people were born in Canada while their parents were 
visiting or on a diplomatic assignment to our country.  When 
these individuals returned to their home countries, many of the 
children turned out to be people who held high positions in their 
country's government and they became very good friends of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On many occasions when I served as a parliamentary secretary I 
came across people who were very successful in their own 
countries.  The only link to Canada which these individuals had 
was the fact that they were born here, and they are very good 
friends of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadian diplomats and tourists travel abroad and give 
birth to children in foreign countries.  Their children require 
citizenship in those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue cuts both ways and I do not see it as being a 
problem.  I do not consider it to be a major issue that we need 
to be concerned about.  I hope to God we do not spend a lot of 
money studying the magnitude of this issue because I believe it 
is not a major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make reference to Motion No. 2, which would amend 
clause 6 of Bill C-16.  If a refugee claimant claims refugee 
status in Canada, he or she would be required to wait up to 365 
days for citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that what we have in place at the present time is 
fairly efficient and fairly good.  A claimant who has already 
been accepted as a convention refugee can accumulate that period. 
I do not think that amendment to the legislation would make any 
sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that the two amendments put forward by my hon. colleague 
are a bit odd, a bit out of place and just do not fit into the 
bigger picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member indicated in his first amendment that a child would 
have to be born to a person who is either a Canadian citizen or a 
landed immigrant.  What would happen in the situation where 
someone is a convention refugee and his child is born here? 
Would that mean we would have to start a process for the child in 
order to process the child through the system?  That would create 
a huge amount of unnecessary paperwork and unnecessary 
complications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that the House will not support those two motions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 3 brought forward by a member of the 
Bloc Quebecois, the member for Rosemont, new clause 8(2) is 
unnecessary because provincial jurisdiction over adoption is 
already provided for in the Constitution.  The Citizenship of 
Canada Act in no way interferes with Quebec's authority in this 
regard.  In addition, clause 8(<I>c</I>) stipulates that citizenship 
may not be granted until the adoption is in accordance with the 
laws of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to approve the motion, citizenship would then be 
granted even though an adoption was not in accordance with the 
laws of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the motion introduces the new concept of “domiciled 
or ordinarily resident”, which is incompatible with the 
definition of residence in the Citizenship of Canada Act, which 
requires physical presence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal does not take into account the criteria in clause 
8, which were developed so as to cover both the best interests 
of the child as well as international adoption fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 has been drafted in such a way as to treat the 
provinces and territories on a equal footing, while ensuring 
that their respective adoption laws are respected without 
interference from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note the difference between the “laws of the country of 
residence” in the English text and “lieu de résidence” in the 
French.  The English is the equivalent of the French.  The 
applicable law involves all of a country's adoption legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term is general and was chosen because it was also necessary 
to take into account the adoption of a child in another country 
by a Canadian resident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada, “laws of the country of residence” can only refer to 
laws of the provinces and territories, because the Constitution 
has expressly given them full jurisdiction over adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the government will not be supporting 
this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it has often been said that Canada is 
a country of immigrants.  I too am one generation from an 
immigrant in that my American mother was born in Missouri.  My 
oldest brother was born in North Dakota.  At that time, of 
course, when immigration was taking place in the west, we did not 
experience many difficulties.  We did not have all of these rules 
and regulations that we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of interest to know what we would do to our own citizens 
under this act.  I refer to a border area where there are a lot 
of marriages on each side of the border.  A lot of people move to 
the U.S. and are married by a justice of the peace.  By 
necessity, a lot of people rush to hospitals in the U.S. because 
they are closer than the hospitals in Canada.  Therefore, when 
they give birth in the U.S. the child is automatically a Canadian 
citizen by birth.  There are problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We penalize our young people in this country who marry someone, 
particularly from the United States. It is more difficult perhaps 
in other areas.  Let me cite two cases which I have had to deal 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a young girl who lives not too far from where I live 
and she is going to a special school.  As young people do, she 
fell in love.  There is nothing new about that.  She decided to 
get married.  The complications that this girl faces in moving to 
the United States are unbelievable.  It is a story book in 
itself, not just from the Canadian side but from the American 
side as well.  There has to be a better way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House an example of the most recent case.  There 
is a young fellow who has found a girl, I believe in Wisconsin. 
They fell in love.  Guess what?  They want to get married. 
Immediately the young fellow living in this country applied to 
bring his fiancée to Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I got married I was not asked how much money I had.  If I 
had to measure up to Immigration Canada today I probably never 
would have been married because I never made that much money. 
When this young fellow applied to bring his spouse to Canada, the 
Department of Immigration said “No, your T-4 slip says you are 
not making enough money”.  That was bad enough, but the young 
fellow had to put up $500 or $600 with his application.  When he 
obtained proof that in the year 2000 he would be making 
considerably more money, Immigration Canada said he would have to 
resubmit his application.  That represents another $500 or $600. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying to the House and to people across Canada is 
that when we mention the words citizenship and immigration they 
have bad connotations in many areas.  People think of refugee 
status, the smuggling of refugees and people smuggling, and 
the inability to deport.  Yet when it comes to our very own 
citizens, people of high quality, young people, we impose 
restrictions on them that should not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish we could become more amenable to the idea of looking at 
people and their character and why they want to marry and live 
with their spouse without having to be married and then separated 
for a period of almost a year.  That happens.  That ought not to 
happen.  There is no reason for that to happen.  I have dealt 
with a case in which it took a man over a year to bring his wife 
to Canada, and there was no good reason for the delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can discuss this bill all we like, but we have to look at 
what is happening within our country.  All of the motions, all of 
these things, will not mean too much if we do not deal with 
reality.  I am speaking particularly of our young people who 
choose a spouse outside Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to the amendments in Group No. 1 to Bill C-16 put forth 
by the critics for citizenship and immigration.  I am not our 
party's critic for immigration.  The critic for our party is the 
member for Compton—Stanstead, but I am glad to have the 
opportunity to speak to the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with the motion put forth by the member for Lakeland, 
our party does not agree that either the father or the mother 
should have to be a citizen or a permanent resident for a child 
to have Canadian citizenship.  Citizenship in this country is 
precious and should not be thrown around frivolously.  However, 
if someone is born on Canadian soil, he or she should be 
recognized as Canadian.  It is for this reason that we have a 
problem with this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning Motion No. 2, we do not feel that an individual 
should claim time toward permanent residency status after having 
made a refugee claim.  When an individual makes a claim there is 
not even a guarantee that he or she will achieve refugee status. 
We support the present provision in the act, which states that a 
person begins claiming time toward permanent residency status 
once he or she has been determined to be a convention refugee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motions Nos. 3 and 17, the hon. member for 
Rosemont has been quite concerned about the adoption provisions 
for some time.  The amendments he proposes solidify the fact that 
adoption is a provincial area of jurisdiction.  We support the 
autonomy of the provinces in their areas of jurisdiction and 
would gladly support the hon. member for Rosemont; however, he 
specifies only jurisdictional powers over adoption for the 
province of Quebec.  If the motion had specified all of the 
provinces in Canada we would have supported it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Motion No. 22 put forward by the hon. member for 
Lakeland.  During the course of debate on Bill C-16, this party 
raised concerns about the coming into force of this act.  It 
stipulates in the bill that all citizenship cases will fall under 
the new act once it is proclaimed.  We did not like this.  What 
kinds of extra paperwork and headaches will this cause for cases 
which are smoothly making their way through the system under the 
current act?   There should be some sort of cut off point for 
cases presently going through the system.  Perhaps there could be 
a period of one year to give the department and applicants alike 
time for adjustment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is one 
aspect of the bill on which I must insist, and it concerns 
international adoptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, an adopted child could be granted citizenship 
even before arriving in this country. This goes against current 
practice under the Quebec Civil Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What worries me here is not current practice in Quebec, which 
could be changed since the Quebec National Assembly has full 
power over its Civil Code. 
What I find troubling and even shocking here is to see a federal 
bill that goes completely against a practice under the Quebec 
Civil Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has the indisputable right to decide upon it own 
legislative practices under the Civil Code. It has always 
exercised that right. It is free to change its legislation as 
and when it sees fit. It does not have to follow dictates set 
out in federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fundamental problem I see with this bill. It is not 
the substance of the bill as such, but rather the tone of this 
federal attack on Quebec's civil legislation. With this bill, 
the federal government is interfering in an area that is beyond 
its jurisdiction. 
Ultimately, this bill, if passed, could even be challenged on 
this point in the courts, because it oversteps the jurisdiction 
of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial governments have rights that are guaranteed by the 
Constitution and by tradition.  The Civil Code, the content and 
form of which were recently revised in Quebec, forms a 
longstanding tradition going back two and a half centuries to an 
undertaking given by the British crown to the French crown that 
it would respect the French civil legislation known as the 
Napoleonic Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rights enjoyed by Quebecers today are acquired rights dating 
from two and a half centuries ago, rights over their own civil 
legislation, and their own Civil Code, which differs from the 
British common law applicable in other provinces. 
These rights were agreed to by the British crown at the time of 
the conquest; they are rights which continue to apply, rights 
which the Confederation has guaranteed, rights which, to all 
intents and purposes, are constitutional.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing today with this bill is an intrusion in a 
jurisdiction that belongs to Quebecers and to the National 
Assembly of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem is with the approach, not with the issue of adoption 
itself.  This approach is unacceptable.  If this bill, as it 
stands, were to be passed by a majority of the members of this 
House, which would not include us, it would clearly leave itself 
open to a court challenge. We certainly do not want this for 
adoptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec, in correspondence of May 9 to the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration signed by the minister 
of public relations and immigration, Robert Perreault, proposed 
amendments that, without changing the essence and merits of the 
bill before us, would permit it to respect Quebec jurisdictions 
and avoid potential legal problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill were to be passed, clearly Quebecers wanting to 
adopt a child abroad would not be able to take advantage of the 
measures otherwise available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the common sense and good judgement of this House. 
Whatever is necessary will have to be done to ensure that this 
bill honours the constitutional rights of the National Assembly 
of Quebec and the rights of the citizens of Quebec, my rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to once again speak 
on immigration issues.  It has been some time I dare say since I 
held the portfolio of immigration critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose, when we analyze it, not a whole lot has changed as 
far as cleaning up some of the problems within the immigration 
ministry as it reflects down to the immigration offices located 
in the various regions of the country, right down to the 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first group of motions deal with a burning issue for a lot 
of people in our country, both for immigrants and those who were 
born here.  Many of those immigrants who arrived years back, and 
even some more recently, struggled to reach the level required to 
be admitted into the country.  While they were happy to have been 
accepted, they continued to struggle to meet the requirements of 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that has always been of concern to both them and 
others who have been established here for a long time, is the 
issue of children being born to visitors in our land and being 
granted citizenship at that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is well aware of that particular issue.  She was 
aware of the issue when she took office.  The previous 
immigration minister was also aware of the issue when she took 
office, and so on down the line.  I could go all the way back to 
when Sergio Marchi was the immigration minister.  He was very 
well aware of the issue of children being born in Canada to 
parents who were not Canadian citizens but visitors. 
Each one claimed that they would look at the issue.  They also 
agreed that it was an issue to a degree, but that they needed to 
know how important it really was.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I served as the immigration critic, the matter came forward 
and the immigration minister at the time was going to examine the 
problem to see how significant it was; in other words, collect 
some data and make a decision.  That was good because that was 
the way it should be done.  In his two years in that portfolio he 
did absolutely nothing.  I do not know if he even collected any 
data even though it was not very difficult to collect that kind 
of data.  That has been the case with every Liberal immigration 
ministers since I have served in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful to think that a minister or ministers 
procrastinated, stalled, refused and ignored those requests 
raised by both the opposition and Liberal backbenchers.  I am 
sure there are members in the government who have raised this 
issue with their specific ministers.  I do not think that is the 
response that should be coming from a minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the present minister stated that she made no changes to 
this clause because there was no research done on how big a 
problem the citizenship at birth issue really was.  She further 
stated that hospital records do not request the nationality of 
parents and changing this would require provincial co-operation. 
Why does the minister not take a little trip over to the city of 
Vancouver?  It is well known that a hospital there is a target 
for those visiting this country to do that very thing, to 
register their births in that hospital and with the province. One 
hospital in particular handles a number of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister was truly concerned about collecting data, and I 
believe that the data is already there, she would make that 
effort and do it forthwith.  Obviously, she does not want to do 
that.  She does not want to question status quo immigration 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem with that.  We must question status quo 
immigration policy.  We have an immigration document or an 
immigration code that gets thicker every year.  We bring in more 
and more legislation but none of it really corrects the problems 
that exist.  If it is poor legislation or inadequate legislation, 
why are we here?  Is it just so we can add to the immigration act 
year after year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to shake my head at the ministers sitting across the 
floor who do not seem to want to correct some of the major or 
glaring issues of the day, specifically the immigration policy 
which is often generated from legislation.  This is a great 
shortfall and there are series of flaws in the process and in the 
legislation.  That it does not address serious problems concerns 
a number of Canadians. 
I will make the reference again.  When I say “a number of 
Canadians”, I mean those who have come here as immigrants and 
have had to wait and wait in line and those who were born here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in a quandary on how to get a point across to that side of 
the House on very significant issues which have been expressed 
time and time again and are of concern to Canadians in general. 
There has been no action taking place over there in spite of the 
fact that it has been raised numerous times.  We have had five 
immigration ministers since 1993, the length of time reform and 
now the alliance has been in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pointed out that it likes consultations.  I can 
remember as an opposition critic for immigration that we were 
involved in consultations.  The consultations consisted of 
dropping around to various spots in the country and talking to 
people in the department, to advocacy groups, to lawyers and to 
consultants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had consultation after consultation.  Yet shortly after all 
the consultations took place, lo and behold an interdepartmental 
survey landed on the desks of several opposition members.  That 
survey clearly outlined all the problems within the immigration 
department and even recommendations on how to fix them.  There 
were not only serious breaches of policy but serious flaws within 
the act and how it was carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rest my case.  The bill before us is inadequate.  The issues 
of concern to most Canadians will not be addressed.

<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to debate Motions Nos. 4 and 
5 which are before the House.  The proposed legislation that is 
outlined should be addressed to its fullest.  It is quite 
significant when certain groups of people can be excluded from 
the advantages of our legal system.  Not that I say our legal 
system is all that great, but if there is an entitlement there 
should be an entitlement.  It means having access to legal 
opinions of the courts of our country as citizens and another 
group not having that access.  We will support Motions Nos. 4 and 
5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation does not allow individuals equal access 
to the legal system in spite of the fact that they may be granted 
citizenship. Even if there were fraud I think there is 
entitlement.  I find it passing strange that this provision is in 
the bill when a judgment was made in the Supreme Court of Canada 
in 1985 which declared that refugees have complete and total 
access to our legal system .  That was under the Singh decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First they were allowed or permitted an oral examination.  Then 
a process was set up which I think was unnecessary, but be that 
as it may we have it right now.  It could be changed.  A process 
was set up whereby they could fight the matter in the tribunals, 
in the courts, all the way up to the federal court and tie up the 
courts for long periods of time fighting cases to which there is 
never any conclusion, except the federal court will say whether 
or not they are refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes through the tribunal process again with the legal 
minds jumping into the fray.  The lawyers all line up, just like 
they were when the Chinese boat people ended up lined up on a 
dock on the west coast wanting to fight their cases.  They knew 
there was a legal entitlement and a battle to be fought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we have provisions in this bill that even though citizenship 
is granted and then for some unknown reason fraud is found or 
misrepresentation determined they are not permitted to fight the 
case on legal grounds.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an irony in this part of the bill.  On the one hand we 
see abuses taking place within the immigration process where 
those fighting their cases with legal representation are caught 
up in a whirlwind.  They are constantly going around and around 
with nothing ever being resolved.  This costs taxpayers hundreds 
of millions of dollars and in fact billions over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is acceptable, but on other other hand someone who may have 
committed some act is still entitled to legal representation by 
the mere fact that he or she has been granted Canadian 
citizenship.  Is that not somewhat of a paradox or a 
contradiction?  I think it is a contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even a judge listening to a case, despite the fact there may 
have been fraud or there may have been suspicion of 
misrepresentation, could make a decision on whether there is 
fraud and could say that the individual after being found guilty 
is no longer entitled to legal representation.  It is clear that 
she or he has committed fraud, and everybody goes on his way. 
However that is not what the bill provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lawyers sitting across the way.  It is odd that we do 
not hear too much from them.  Many times there are charter 
arguments surrounding the issues of which we speak, but there has 
been substantial silence on that side of the floor.  I find that 
passing strange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point in question is the issue of citizenship. My hon. 
colleague from the Vegreville area, the critic for immigration, 
put it quite eloquently.  Once citizenship is granted it must be 
assumed to be genuine.  Once it is revoked then another matter 
must be dealt with such as deportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mention of that in the bill at all.  We deport 
people who commit fraud, who lie, who misrepresent.  That is not 
even mentioned in the bill although I would assume there are 
provisions in another part of the act which might deal with that. 
When there is a violation of the law as blatant as a 
misrepresentation or a fraudulent application, it should be 
spelled out here that a course of action will be pursued against 
the individual.  It all comes back to the fact that there should 
be an entitlement to fight the case and to present the evidence. 
It has to be adversarial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately that side of the House has either overlooked this 
point or maybe wants some other legal entanglement which will 
take off in a new direction in our courts.  The Immigration Act 
is fraught with all kinds of weak areas that continually require 
argument in our courts and tie up our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time we had some good, clear policy and legislation 
that can be easily interpreted without the courts so that 
everyone knows where he or she stands.  When there are arguments, 
which would be fewer by far, they could be settled in the federal 
court.  I find the whole proposal lacking. 
On the other hand, my colleague, the immigration critic, has 
addressed those issues in Motions Nos. 4 and 5, and I fully 
support them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, let me 
first say that I support the bill before the House because it 
would give greater value to citizenship for those Canadians who 
are citizens by choice and not by birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at Bill C-16 we notice that clause 12 talks about 
people who become citizens by choice having all the rights and 
responsibilities of every other Canadian.  I am one of those five 
million to six million Canadians who are citizens by choice.  Let 
me tell hon. members that it is a very central part of my 
identity as a person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my family left Hungary in 1957 we came through mine fields. 
I was a young boy.  There has to be something pretty desperate to 
motivate a family to cross mine fields.  The situation has to be 
pretty bad.  When I arrived with my family in Canada I could say 
that we felt we had arrived in heaven.  It is important for 
Canadians to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the present act in dealing with the revocation 
of citizenship pertains to the fact that it is the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, who, under section 17, could proceed 
on grounds with a notice stating that it is believed an immigrant 
at some point in time obtained citizenship by fraudulent means. 
The person has 30 days to respond from the time the minister sent 
the notice, not from the time of receipt of the notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the immigrant wishes to dispute the allegations of the 
minister, there will be a hearing before a federal court judge in 
the trial division.  What is important to understand is that 
there is not an opportunity to appeal the decision of that judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about it.  The whole history of jurisprudence in Canada 
and the western world is based on the right to appeal.  It is the 
recognition that no one judge is infallible.  If judges were 
infallible we would not need courts of appeal, nor would we need 
the supreme court.  The fact of the matter is that judges are 
human and they are prone to error.  It is the ability to appeal 
the decision to revoke somebody's citizenship to a higher court 
that really underlies the judicial system in its finest sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the present system there could be a case of an individual 
who got here by fraudulent means, whom the crown strongly 
believes got here by fraudulent means, but a judge could make a 
mistake and say that the immigrant did not come here 
fraudulently.  The crown would not have the option to appeal. 
Conversely, if a judge makes a wrong finding and says that an 
individual is guilty of coming here by misrepresentation, the 
immigrant would not have the right to appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is this.  The minister is the prosecutor in the 
case.  She goes to the federal court trial division.  The 
decision of the federal court trial division goes to the 
minister, who, under the present act, has to act as an appeal 
court and also has to make a report to cabinet.  The cabinet 
makes an order on revocation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Canadian by choice who values his citizenship, like many 
other Canadians by choice, if I am to lose my citizenship I want 
to have the due process of law.  My family came across mine 
fields because we wanted to be in a country that is ruled by law, 
not where the politicians or the prime minister of the country 
decide what my rights are as an individual citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good motion.  It reflects the views of all of the 
people who made presentations before the committee on Bill C-63, 
which was the predecessor to Bill C-16.  They included people 
from right across the country.  We had the B'Nai Brith.  We had 
the Ukrainian Congress.  We had the Immigrant Lawyers' 
Association.  We had the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. 
What was so unique about it was that they all agreed that there 
should be the opportunity to appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us was prepared mainly through the work of 
Kenneth Narvey, who is a legal researcher for the Coalition of 
Concerned Congregations on the law relating to war crimes and 
crimes against humanity, including those of the holocaust.  It 
captures the spirit put forward by the B'nai Brith and the 
Canadian Civil Liberties Association, as well as the Ukrainian 
Congress—all those groups representing people across this 
country, who are in many cases citizens by choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law on revocation goes back to 1920, which is one of the 
darkest periods of our immigration history.  If we think back, we 
had the Asian exclusion act.  We did not want Asians coming to 
this country and we made laws to keep them out.  We had the head 
tax to keep the Chinese out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the time of the <I>Komagata Maru</I>, a ship from Asia 
which arrived legally.  The popular belief was that we did not 
want those kinds of people in this country and laws were passed 
to turn them around and send them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not long ago that we had a policy in this country that 
related to Jews which said “None is too many”.  We only have 
to go back to the second world war.  To our collective shame in 
the western world we turned away the <I>SS St. Louis</I>, which 
had almost a thousand Jews on board.  They were sent back to the 
gas chambers.  That is the timeframe in which this piece of 
legislation concerning the revocation of citizenship goes back 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to my citizenship as a citizen by choice is only as 
good as the least popular among us in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made some great strides heading into the new millennium. 
We have a premier of British Columbia who is from India.  We 
have a governor general who is from Hong Kong.  We have a 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration who is Jewish. 
I urge my colleagues in the House to go the rest of the way.  Let 
us get rid of this archaic piece of legislation on revocation. 
If we are going to revoke citizenship, let us revoke it by the 
due process of law, let us trust our legal system that we have 
built and supported, and let us not have second class citizens in 
this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
Human Resources Development; the hon. member for Québec, 
Parental Leave; and the hon. member for Mississauga South, 
Trade.

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad I was in the House to 
hear the parliamentary secretary speak.  He certainly did a fine 
job in helping us to relive some of those things.  He also 
experienced great danger in coming to Canada.  I have talked to 
many people like him.  It is always very emotional when 
individuals have the desire to live in Canada.  People like the 
parliamentary secretary inevitably make good citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My area of Canada is much younger than that of Ontario.  We are 
still very much akin to groups of people who came over in this 
century, even as late as the twenties, who still maintain their 
nationalist ties.  One of Canada's few Romanian settlements is 
located some 20 miles north of where I live, and there is another 
settlement about 100 miles from my home.  These people are very 
proud Canadians today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. gentleman mentioned some of the dark periods in 
Canadian history.  I think about the time of Confederation when 
we became a nation.  That was the time of the plight of the 
Irish.  I can remember Irish people during the famine trying to 
immigrate to Canada, but there were people in this country who 
were quite willing to send them back.  That is another dark 
story, another era in our Canadian history of which Canadians are 
not very proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my hon. colleague is also somewhat taken back by the 
number of illegal immigrants who somehow get into Canada.  All of 
the people I know who have immigrated to this country are 
concerned about the way in which people get here, how long they 
stay and how they abuse the name of the legal immigrant.  These 
people, like me, are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want it understood that I am not anti-immigrant.  I am not 
against the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.  I am, 
like most Canadians, which has been shown in poll after poll, 
against the policies of the government which do not tighten up 
the immigration policy.  Not too long ago most of the crimes 
being committed in certain areas were being committed by illegal 
immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. gentleman that he should take his case and his 
story to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.  If we 
have people of his calibre applying to enter Canada, then for 
goodness sake let us speed up the process and bring these people 
in.  We have not done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been home to too many people who have been here for 
years and years.  In some cases these individuals have committed 
crimes and have never been deported.  Our whole immigration 
policy, our whole citizenship department, has taken on a very bad 
name.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were three people in my office not too long ago.  They 
were all immigrants within the last 10 years.  That was exactly 
their complaint, that they were finding it difficult because of 
the headlines flashed across the papers and stories about a very 
lax policy toward immigrants coming into Canada. They were taking 
the brunt of the jokes in society.  That is not right and we 
could do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day one of the members opposite referred to the member 
for Calgary Northeast as being anti-immigrant.  I am not 
anti-immigrant.  I have tried my best in every case to speed up 
the process when I knew it was legitimate.  I am against the lax 
deportation and the inability to deal with people who are abusing 
our Department of Citizenship and Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. gentleman has presented a very worthy case.  I want to 
support him and I want to support this.  However, I want to put 
the idea out there that we need to honour those people who are 
legitimate immigrants.  We need to move very quickly and deport 
those people who are not legitimate immigrants and not follow the 
practice we have right now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it gives me pleasure to talk about 
an issue that is very important to Canadians and to Canada, the 
idea of citizenship and immigration, and to reiterate some of the 
thoughts that my colleagues have expressed when it comes to the 
proposed changes. I also want to talk about how strongly we feel 
about citizenship and immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are basically in agreement with the government on Motions 
Nos. 3, 4 and 5 in Group No. 2.  When it comes to giving rights 
to citizens in this country, and once they obtain citizenship, 
they should be treated equally, as my colleague just mentioned. 
Specifically we cannot take those rights that are given to 
Canadians once they receive citizenship lightly.  They have to be 
taken very seriously and treated equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I carry on in addressing these particular motions 
pertaining to the bill, I want to congratulate my hon. colleague 
from Lakeland who is our immigration critic.  He has worked 
tirelessly to make sure that the Liberals are kept accountable, 
that our immigration system works as best as it can, that people 
from across the country give their feedback on the changes we are 
debating and that there is the most involvement possible.  I know 
my colleagues would agree that immigration and citizenship is 
something we should all take an interest in.  We should not take 
it lightly.  It is very important to take a moment to 
congratulate him.  He has worked tirelessly on the bill and on 
the changes that have been proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the official opposition wants to support these 
particular motions.  As two of my colleagues mentioned in this 
round of debate, currently the proposed legislation does not 
provide individuals who have been granted Canadian citizenship 
full access to the legal system if their right to citizenship is 
challenged, that is due to misrepresentation or fraud or any of 
the particular cases where someone's citizenship can come up for 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I understand, during the course of the committee 
hearings department officials insisted that this clause was not 
of serious concern.  However, the issue caused great concern to 
members of the committee and a vast majority of the witnesses.  I 
started out by saying when citizenship is granted to any Canadian 
we have to make sure their rights are treated equally if any 
possibility of suspicion or misrepresentation comes up 
surrounding the granting of their citizenship.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot just have the minister being able to revoke that 
citizenship without any discretion.  That is the big concern we 
have with this part of the bill and the motions put forward. We 
are happy to see that the Liberals as well realize this in this 
part of the debate and do not want to leave that kind of blatant 
discretion in the hands of the minister, but instead allow the 
proper legal channels to work in the case of suspicion of 
anyone's citizenship or any fraudulent activity when it comes to 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alliance agrees that once citizenship is granted, it must be 
assumed to be genuine because hopefully the person who has 
obtained the citizenship has gone through the proper channels to 
obtain that citizenship.  The revocation of citizenship is not 
something to be taken lightly and must be done only under 
complete and thorough scrutiny by the Canadian legal system. That 
is the point of these motions.  We have to go through the proper 
channels. There cannot be the blatant ability for any person, or 
any minister for that matter, to revoke someone's citizenship 
unless the person has been proven guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing I found a little odd during the course of 
reviewing the committee hearings and especially in raising this 
point of debate is that during the course of the committee 
hearings my colleague from Lakeland tabled an amendment which was 
very similar to the two Liberal amendments.  I think it is in 
clause 17. There were a few Liberal members on the committee who 
wanted to support that but in the end for some reason it was 
voted down. That is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to review what is being done on committees. 
I sit on the environment committee and I often want to see a 
sense of co-operation and collaboration.  If there is any member 
on the committee who brings forward an amendment to government 
legislation to make it better, one would think the government 
would support it and still take credit for it anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the partisanship in this place gets to be 
too much to handle for all of us.  We forget that we are here to 
make legislation better for Canadians, not just to make ourselves 
look good.  I think that is why most members of parliament got 
involved in the business they are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be nice once in a while to see the initiatives of the 
opposition when it comes to making legislation better supported 
by committee members and especially by the government.  A 
committee is supposed to be a non-partisan effort to make 
legislation better. I have seen in many cases during my short 
experience here sitting on committees that that very rarely 
happens.  In the case of my hon. colleague from Lakeland, his 
amendments, which are almost identical to the motions, were voted 
down at the committee level, which unfortunately was not a good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we see that these amendments are virtually the same, we 
want to support these amendments. As I said we do feel, and my 
hon. colleague from Lakeland attempted to bring this before the 
committee, that these amendments will help to protect citizens 
who are under suspicion of having fraudulent citizenship.  They 
will protect those people who are innocent but are under the 
suspicion of having fraudulent citizenship.  It will take the 
discretion out of the hands of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we put this part of the bill into perspective of how many 
revocations of citizenship there are in the overall scheme, I 
think there is usually fewer than one per year. It is not 
something that happens very frequently, thank goodness. At least 
on that level citizens of Canada can rest assured that when 
citizenship is given to them, it is something that is taken 
seriously.  However, in the problems which do come up from time 
to time, if there is suspicion of any fraudulent activity when it 
comes to citizenship, people can rest assured that their rights 
will be protected.  The equality of all citizens and Canadians 
will be taken very seriously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is with great respect for my colleague on this side of the 
House and his poignant remarks on our history and his personal 
experience that I reluctantly stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not support these motions.  I want to correct the member 
opposite who just spoke. 
In fact the Liberal government is not sponsoring these two 
amendments.  They are being sponsored by the Canadian Alliance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak as one who has a riding of 40% immigrants.  Those 
immigrants are law-abiding, hardworking, productive members of 
society.  I also speak as someone who does not have the story my 
colleague beside me has, but I come from immigrant stock from 
eastern Europe.  My grandmother chose to be a Canadian by coming 
from Poland in a cattle boat separated by one thin wall between 
the cattle and herself in the bottom of the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read the amendments carefully and I do not support them. 
I would like to give my reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on behalf of the almost 100%, as just 
pointed out, of legitimate immigrants who would not support 
citizenship for those who have entered this country through 
stealth, or acquired citizenship through lying or any other means 
that were other than honest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to use the previous immigration critic's own words. 
I find it passing strange that his party supports lengthy court 
referrals.  He talked about it as being a paradox and a 
contradiction. He has in the past, and so has his party in one of 
its previous incarnations and its current incarnation, not 
supported putting too much power in the hands of the courts.  As 
a matter of fact this has been a hue and cry of that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now members of that party are talking about putting power back 
into the hands of the courts and taking it out of the hands of 
parliament. They also railed against too many lengthy procedures 
when the Chinese boats arrived off the shores of Vancouver.  They 
were most vociferous that those people should be deported 
immediately. Therefore, I am again finding this whole argument 
coming from the opposite side of the House passing strange, a 
paradox and a contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear about what the motions would do.  The motions 
would make citizenship revocation solely a court proceeding.  The 
revocation process under Bill C-16 is the same process that has 
been government policy for over 20 years, tried, true and 
reinvestigated. The federal court makes a determination of facts, 
deciding whether the person obtained citizenship by 
misrepresentation or by concealing material circumstances. 
Following that determination the minister makes a report to the 
governor in council and the governor in council decides whether 
to revoke citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions before the House would remove the roles of the 
minister and the governor in council and would leave the decision 
of fact and of whether to revoke citizenship to the courts. 
Again, the party opposite has constantly said that we are giving 
too much power to the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revocation of citizenship is a very serious matter that the 
federal government does not take lightly, but a pillar of 
parliamentary tradition— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member opposite has indicated that this motion was not a 
Liberal motion when in fact this motion was given to the clerk by 
the member for Parkdale—High Park.  When it came time for the 
member to move the motion, she was ordered not to do so.  I did 
it as a co-signator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clarify that for the member. The motion did come from 
the government originally.  It is a good motion and she should be 
supporting it but I will talk about that in my debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That certainly 
clarified things for me but it may have got the rest of us even 
more confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite and 
I will agree to disagree as we do on many things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to go back to my point.  Revocation of citizenship is a 
very serious matter that the federal government does not take 
lightly.  A pillar of parliamentary tradition is the principle of 
responsible government.  A decision to revoke citizenship should 
remain with cabinet which itself is accountable to the Canadian 
people through parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, adding appeal rights or giving exclusive power to the 
judiciary to decide revocation will lengthen the revocation 
process of suspected war criminals and terrorists, people who 
were never entitled to Canadian citizenship in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also add that the revocation process under Bill C-16 
guarantees due process for persons undergoing revocation of 
citizenship and many opportunities to state their case.  The 
motions before the House would also allow any revocation done 
under the 1977 or 1947 acts to be appealed to the court of appeal 
or the supreme court. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that appeal results in a finding that the person did not 
obtain citizenship by misrepresentation or concealing material 
circumstances, the revocation would be deemed to have not 
occurred, that is the decision of the governor in council would 
be overturned.  This would be a radical shift in the way 
citizenship revocation is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is not the time to make a radical shift in citizenship 
revocation.  Now is the time to pass the new citizenship act 
which has been 15 years in the making.  It has been reviewed 
extensively across the country.  There has been much 
consultation, particularly with immigrant groups.  Again I would 
like to state that the government does not support these 
amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I start my comments on the motions in Group No. 2, I 
feel I must respond to what the member from the Liberal Party 
just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that she does not want to support these motions because 
they would be making a substantial change to the current 
citizenship act when in fact the replacement act we are debating 
today has been in the process for 15 years.  I do not understand 
the logic in that.  It seems ludicrous if there is a change that 
makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a change in a motion which was originally put forth by 
a Liberal member of parliament.  He was not allowed to actually 
read the motion today so I as a co-signator put it forth.  It is 
a good motion, supported by members of the party opposite.  Some 
have told me they will to support the motion so I will assume 
they will.  The argument this member put forth is that it is just 
too much of a change to put into the new citizenship act which 
has been in the process of being amended for 15 years.  I cannot 
understand the argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue to which the member spoke was the issue of too 
much power in the hands of the court.   That is interesting in 
that right now the revocation of citizenship is in the hands of 
cabinet.  We have several members of our party who were not born 
in Canada.  If I, a Canadian Alliance member of parliament, had 
come from another country and if the cabinet had a political 
reason for wanting to expel me from the country, the ultimate 
power is with the cabinet, the way it has been laid out in the 
new citizenship bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unacceptable.  That is old style.  That is something one 
would expect from the 1920s, perhaps, because democracies were 
not as well developed then.  Back in 1920 is exactly when it was 
put into the act originally.  With modernization of democracy 
surely it is time to make a change so that it is wrong when 
someone is threatened with revocation of citizenship, which is an 
extremely serious thing to have happen, and when the ultimate 
control is in the hands of cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support the motion that has been presented.  It would 
give that ultimate power to the courts so that a less partisan 
body would be making the ultimate decision.  That is what the 
motion is meant to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will have to answer to her constituents.  Many of 
them will be upset by it.  Anyone who has come to our country and 
is in Canada now should be concerned about it.  They should be 
asking this member and all other members of the government why 
they did not support a motion which would put that authority in 
the hands of the court rather than in the hands of cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe the member made this argument.  It looked as 
though she had been given a speech by the minister or by the 
particular public servant who is responsible for that.  She read 
it, but she should have looked at it first.  Some members have 
already spoken in support of the motion from the government side 
because it is a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the power in the courts, the government for some reason 
does not have any particular desire to interfere with power given 
by the courts when it comes to the Singh decision.  I do not 
believe it is a correct interpretation.  It leaves a situation 
where anyone coming to our country who is not a Canadian citizen 
or a landed immigrant and has no status here is entitled to the 
full protection of the charter of rights and freedoms, including 
the complete judicial process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They seem to be happy with that.  It is something that no other 
country offers.  In the new immigration bill that has been 
proposed they do not even have to be in Canada to be offered 
charter protection.  If they want to apply to come to Canada and 
are not citizens, have no status and live in another country, 
they will have access to the protection of our charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the government refuses to grant the same protection to 
people who have become citizens of our country during their 
lifetime.  It is an absurd concept and I expect the government to 
have to answer that concern, not to me but to citizens in its 
constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from many constituents, as have some of the members 
opposite.  I would be very curious to hear how the hon. member 
responds to that and how members of the government who brought 
forth this new Citizenship Act and yet refuse to make this 
change, which is a good change, can live with themselves when 
they wake up in the morning and look in the mirror.  I really do 
not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Citizenship Act is very important.  It could lead to 
individuals being thrown out of our country when they have become 
citizens.  It is all wrong that the ultimate power is going to 
cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two motions in this group both deal with this issue.  I 
encourage the government to reconsider.  I believe some members 
will support them.  I encourage them to talk with their 
colleagues and change their minds.  If government members decide 
to change their minds on this issue between now and when we vote 
on these motions, I can guarantee that there will not be one bit 
of heckling from this side of the House.  There will not be one 
negative word from this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead there will be congratulations because they will have listened 
to a good idea which has come from the opposition but originated 
with members of the governing party.  I give them credit for 
that, but they will not let it pass.  I encourage them to change 
their minds and I look forward to their doing exactly that.

NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to take up much time in this 
debate, but I want to use it as an opportunity to raise an 
important issue for my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to do with a family from the former Yugoslavia that has 
been trying for some time to enter Canada.  These folks have 
experienced extreme persecution in their country.  They have 
lived a period of horror in terms of their personal lives. 
Unfortunately they have been trying, I must say unsuccessfully, 
to enter Canada.  I have recently asked them to put their case 
clearly on the record so that I could present it to the Minister 
of Immigration, which I have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister of immigration to involve herself and make 
a decision based on compassionate and humanitarian grounds to 
enable this family from the former Yugoslavia to enter Canada and 
to join with extended family members who have been here for some 
time and have integrated very successfully into the fabric of 
Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fortunate to know one of the families that has been working 
very hard on behalf of extended family members in the former 
Yugoslavia.  While all sorts of people are using various ways to 
get into the country, these people have chosen the legitimate 
way, the honourable way, the correct way, the appropriate way. 
They have gone through all the appropriate channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been informed by our foreign service people abroad, 
particularly those responsible for immigration, that the former 
Yugoslavia from which they come, and particularly the 
neighbouring area of Macedonia, is not an area of serious 
problems. 
These people on a personal basis have experienced severe 
persecution and extreme harassment.  The spouse of the head of 
the family has been threatened with rape.  Their children have 
been threatened in the school yards with repeated beatings 
because they happen to be of the wrong ethnic group in this case.

use this occasion to raise their plight and concern.  I hope and 
pray the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration will see fit to 
grant this family entrance to Canada based on compassionate and 
humanitarian grounds so they can join extended family members 
here.  I know they will make a very positive contribution to life 
in Canada and will be able to leave a very unfortunate 
circumstance behind them in Europe.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motions in Group No. 2. I 
want to talk about what has been happening with regard to the 
government and its management of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the citizenship bill in report stage before the House 
today and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is in 
committee at exactly the same time.   Also at the same time the 
government makes an announcement that it has finally managed to 
deport a small portion of the 600 people who arrived illegally by 
boat this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way the government seems to manage.  It cannot 
co-ordinate things even in the House.  The minister cannot 
co-ordinate her own time.  She should be here.  She is the 
minister responsible for citizenship.  I will not say whether or 
not she is here but she should be.  The minister should be taking 
part in this debate and listening to this debate.  Her time 
management and the way she manages herself and her department are 
so poor that she has three things going on at the same time. That 
is completely unacceptable.  Many members who would like to be 
taking part in the report stage debate of Bill C-16 are at 
committee.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 deals with consultations between the Prime 
Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of any 
party recognized in the House, in other words any party with over 
12 members, on the issue of appointing a retired judge who in 
certain cases will take the place of the security review 
committee. This would be done on very serious issues, usually 
security issues.  The minister would be asked to appoint a 
retired judge to preside over the hearing.  For some reason the 
government does not want the security review committee to do 
that.  To add some measure of protection in the act, it has said 
that the minister must consult with all party leaders.  This 
motion would require the minister to get agreement from all party 
leaders that this judge is an acceptable person and that he or 
she will be able to deal with security issues or a very touchy 
issues.  I do not think that is too much to ask.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe any of the party leaders, current or in the 
future, would let partisan politics stand in the way of such an 
important appointment when dealing with the security of our 
country and an issue that affects human beings in such a serious 
way.  I do not understand why the government would reject Motion 
No. 6, and I hope it will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 points out that in this legislation there are no 
provisions preventing the appointment of a citizenship 
commissioner who has been found guilty of an offence under clause 
39 or 40 of this bill.  I will run that by members again, because 
it is important to take careful note.  The government has put no 
protection in this proposed new citizenship act against 
appointing someone as a citizenship commissioner who has a 
criminal record as a result of breaching this proposed new act. 
It is unbelievable that would be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed this out in committee on several occasions and yet the 
government insists that it wants the minister to decide on the 
appointment.  It is an unacceptable process.  The minister is 
willing to allow someone who has breached the new citizenship 
act, the very serious clauses 39 and 40, to be appointed to the 
position of citizenship commissioner in spite of having committed 
these serious crimes.  One has to wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government suggesting that it has political friends whom 
it would like to appoint to these positions?  Everyone in this 
group is a political appointment.  That is why they are grouped 
together and that is why I have brought forward these motions. 
The government seems to be so concerned that it cannot find 
enough of its political friends, who have not breached the 
citizenship act, to appoint to this position of commissioner that 
it has to open it up to those who have broken the law under the 
very bill we are debating today.  It is unbelievable.  Any other 
government would turn red-faced or maybe white-faced at this type 
of thing going on and someone pointing out that it should be 
changed.  I would hope that the government members would support 
this motion but I doubt very much that they will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 deals with another instance of patronage.  It is 
the same type of thing.  The Canadian Alliance understands that 
the government wants to ensure that the senior citizenship judge 
who is appointed reflects the government's principles and way of 
thinking.  I am talking about only the top dog here, and I 
understand that.  I am not saying that there should not be a 
political appointment at the top.  I am saying that in this 
position the government naturally would want someone who reflects 
its values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking for is that the appointment be at least 
monitored and scrutinized by the appropriate standing committee 
of the House.  Does that not make sense?

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Alliance forms the government in a year or a 
year and a half, which I hope and believe it will as there is a 
good chance of it, we will take this act and completely overhaul 
it.  The person who ultimately will be responsible for the 
granting of citizenship will reflect the principles of the party. 
All other members will not be patronage appointments.  This 
government has left dozens and dozens of patronage appointments 
in this citizenship act so it can give its political friends 
these lucrative jobs.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that it is okay for the top person to reflect the 
values of the government, but that a House of Commons standing 
committee should scrutinize the appointment.  That is all Motion 
No. 8 does.  It is completely reasonable.  We will see whether 
the government supports the motion or not, although I doubt it. 
It just does not seem to want to support anything that comes from 
anyone other than itself.  If it steals the idea from someone 
else and passes it that is okay but if it misses that 
opportunity, which it often does, and an idea is brought forth by 
someone else, then it is not a good idea.  That is not the way 
government will be when we are in power, which will not be that 
far from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the last chance I have to talk about Motions Nos. 15, 
16, 18, 19, 20, 21.  They all deal with the fact that too much is 
left to regulation in different areas of the bill.  This is 
something this government is guilty of on more occasions than I 
can say.  In fact, the new immigration act, Bill C-31, which was 
tabled by the minister a few weeks ago, is so full of holes that 
we could navigate one of those rusty illegal migrant ships 
through it with no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had to run out of here today to go to committee in order to 
take part as the official opposition immigration critic. When I 
asked the minister some questions about the new act, she said 
that it was not really a new act, that it was a framework act. 
She knows that it was so full of holes it will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have left everything in Bill C-31 up to regulation 
which is the same thing they have done with Bill C-16.  Too much 
is left to regulation.  In no way should the minister, civil 
servants or the department be making decisions on such critical 
issues as who can make an application on behalf of a minor, on 
how a relationship between a parent and child should be defined, 
or on what is in the best interests of the child.  They are all 
found within the new act but that have no definition and there 
are not guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way should this government or any civil servant be left to 
decide what constitutes adequate language knowledge or other 
knowledge in order to be eligible for citizenship.  However, that 
is what this new act will do.  These proposed motions would say 
that this cannot all be left to regulation.  We will put it in 
legislation so at least the principle of the new act can be 
understood.  That was not done and that was what we wanted.  I 
encourage the government to support these motions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would 
like to indicate that we will support the motions in Group No. 3. 
These motions deal with a couple of topics, including of course 
the whole issue of the citizenship commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fundamental issue. Why are we asking that the standing 
committee have a say in these appointments? It is to ensure that 
the work of the commissioners is done in all fairness, but also 
in a way that will respect the legal character of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the law, citizenship is based on rights and 
responsibilities, but we, in the Bloc Quebecois, want it to be 
even broader. We want it to allow various groups, individuals 
and new Canadian citizens to be aware of the importance of the 
democratic rights that have been shaped in Quebec over the last 
few years by our own charter of rights and Election Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the commissioners to be able to pass on this information 
and the standing committee to have a say in their appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed motions deal more specifically with clause 43, the 
regulations clause. Our motions call for these regulations to be 
made, subject to ratification by the House of Commons. In our 
opinion, this is fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the Canadian Alliance has said, there is a 
tendency for this government to govern and pass legislation on 
the basis of regulations that cannot be debated by 
parliamentarians.  In a democratic system, if a government does 
not bother informing parliamentarians of what it is doing 
through clauses in a bill, I believe it is a basic requirement 
that such regulations be debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an example, clause 43(<I>a</I>) reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>)—including medical evidence to establish parentage, and the 
times when those applications and notices must be made; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-63 was being looked at in the standing committee, 
adoptive parents from Quebec made recommendations and proposals 
to it. 
What they wanted to tell us was that they wanted medical 
evidence, records of medical examination, to be transmitted 
before the proposal of adoption, so the parents could be aware 
of the child's medical status. This is fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the regulations there is reference, among other things, to 
the best interests of the child.  Some of the motions are aimed 
at defining what the child's best interests are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the prospective parent is not aware of the results of the medical 
examination, does not know the child's health status, this might 
to some extent affect the child's best interests.  It is 
important that the parent be aware of the child's health status 
in order to ensure that his or her vital needs are being met. If 
information on the health status of the child is not provided 
within a reasonable length of time, the best interests of the 
child might be compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill, nothing tells us what the expression “in the best 
interests of the child” means. There is no definition. There is 
nothing specific as to when the results of the medical 
examination of the child must be given to the parents. We do not 
know if it will be before of after the proposal. Adoptive 
parents were clear on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was studied in committee, a number of proposals 
were made. We wanted these fundamental aspects to be considered. 
I think that, for the sake of transparency and due to the fact 
that the government refused to include in the bill certain 
details regarding the regulations, we must have a debate in this 
House on all the regulations pertaining to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that my party will vote in favour of 
the motions in Group No. 3.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, section 163 of the Criminal 
Code should be amended to reflect a new definition of obscenity 
as follows: “For the purposes of this Act, any matter or thing 
is obscene where a dominant characteristic of the matter or thing 
is the undue exploitation of any one or more of the following 
subjects, namely, sex, violence, crime, horror or cruelty, 
through degrading representation of a male or female person or in 
any other manner.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to my Motion No. 69 
regarding the issue of pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in Canada sexually explicit material generally 
characterized as pornography is more available, more explicit and 
more violent than ever before.  Most Canadians support the 
prohibition or restriction on what is considered beyond society's 
level of tolerance.  Pornography is viewed as amoral and that it 
portrays sexes and their relationship as basically repugnant.  It 
is also considered to cause harm and as a result, strong 
legislation is considered appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, there are those who would argue that there is 
no convincing evidence of any causal relationship between 
pornography and actual physical harm significant enough to 
justify infringement on the constitutionality guaranteed— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Could the hon. member just indicate the number of the 
motion so that I might follow the debate carefully? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is Motion No. 69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 69 is a private 
member's motion.  It is non-votable which means that this matter 
is here for debate tonight.  I want to take some latitude simply 
because the issue of pornography, particularly child pornography, 
has seized Canada with regard to a particular case which has now 
been appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians generally support prohibitions and restrictions with 
regard to pornography.  There is some concern that there is 
direct causal harm.  The problem is that there are others who 
argue very strenuously that there is no significant evidence that 
there is a causal relationship between pornography and actual 
physical harm significant enough to justify infringement on the 
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression.  That is the 
issue, freedom of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in our laws today, freedom of expression and the 
rights of the individual continue to be promoted by the courts. 
It continues to be argued that individual rights in fact are now 
in conflict with the greater good, the greater right, and of the 
society as a whole.  That is a serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Harm is said to flow from pornography in two ways.  First, it is 
theorized that there is a direct causal link between violent 
pornography and violence against women so that such material can 
act as a trigger to aggression.  Second, it is said that 
pornography contributes in a general way to the myths about 
sexuality and about women which ultimately makes violence and 
degradation more acceptable to a society as a whole. It can 
however be difficult to find objective proof of the harmful 
effects, according to some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three potential sources of proof available.  The first 
is anecdotal evidence. Police or press reports may say that a sex 
offender was a habitual consumer of explicit material or victims 
may claim that their assailants had been influenced by 
pornography.  The second is statistical evidence which attempts 
to show a correlation between the prevalence of pornography and 
the incidence of violent crime.  The third is experimental 
evidence, accounts of experiments which attempt to measure the 
reactions of individuals to the stimulus of pornography, 
particularly aggressive or violent material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anecdotal and statistical evidence suffer from the defect of 
being unable to establish a causal link between pornography and 
violence.  The Library of Parliament produced a little report for 
me.  It notes that the presence of such material may be merely 
symptomatic of antisocial behaviour rather than its cause. It 
also points out that some research has purported to show that 
many rapists report having little exposure to pornographic 
material.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As for statistical evidence, rates of sexual assaults have 
increased but not significantly more than those of other forms of 
crime.  In any event, establishing a statistical link of this 
sort is extremely problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was researching this subject matter I came across an 
article in a publication of Focus on the Family called 
“Citizen”.  It talked a bit about the harm effects.  The 
article which is dated May 1999 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pornography is a root of all kinds of evil.  A 1988 study by 
Queen's University psychologist Dr. William Marshall found that 
86% of convicted rapists and 77% of convicted child molesters 
admitted to being regular or habitual users of pornography. 
According to one journalist who covered the trial of Paul 
Bernardo, convicted in 1995 of kidnapping, torturing and brutally 
murdering two teenaged girls in Ontario, “the most frightening 
realization” was the appetite he had developed for hard core 
pornography as a teenager, to the point that he eventually 
graduated “from using it to doing it.  Bernardo's trial was, in 
part”, she concluded, “a trial about pornography”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of things which I suspect motivated me to 
bring this issue to the House in a way in which it would promote 
discussion and maybe some thoughtful consideration by members of 
parliament about the issue of pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Criminal Code of Canada the word pornography is actually 
not there.  It is the word obscenity. I would like to read into 
the record what constitutes obscenity In the Criminal Code of 
Canada.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant 
characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of 
sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, 
horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is legal language but it basically says that violence, crime, 
horror and cruelty in themselves are not obscene.  It says that 
if there is a sexual activity and it is in conjunction with 
crime, horror, cruelty and violence it shall be deemed to be 
obscene. It struck me that it is very difficult to segregate 
obscenity on the basis that there must be sexual content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, I drafted an amendment to the existing 
criminal code definition of obscenity which tried to do a couple 
of things.  I have had some input from others that maybe some of 
the language is not absolutely necessary.  The principal change 
within the definition that is being proposed is that it makes 
obscenity, whether it is undue exploitation of any one or more of 
the following subjects, namely, sex, violence, crime, horror or 
cruelty, through degrading representation of a male or female 
person or in any other manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am well aware that this is a significant change in the 
definition.  The issue for me has more to do with social values 
and the tolerance and standards which society establishes for 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence has clearly shown that the prevalence of pornography in 
our society continues to grow.  Consider what has happened in the 
past 20 years.  We have evolved to a point where pornography 
involving adults is broadly acceptable within society, but add a 
child to it and the entire country is outraged.  It is amazing to 
me that to achieve the age of 18 would all of a sudden somehow 
change the social acceptability of pornography.  I do not think 
so.  Yet socially, adult pornography has been a massive industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to raise this issue with the House of Commons because I 
felt that the whole question of dealing with child pornography 
had to take into consideration the social realities with regard 
to adult pornography.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised it and I will be interested to hear members' 
questions, but I want to leave it at that, only because it is now 
on the floor and in the hands of the members to deal with if they 
want to talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make some comments about the B.C. court case in which 
John Sharpe was acquitted of possession of child pornography.  It 
spawned an outrage right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House will know that the consequence of the 
original decision was basically to strike down the laws with 
regard to the mere possession of child pornography in the 
province of British Columbia.  At the same time, the laws of 
Canada remained intact and were in place in all other provinces 
and territories.  However, that did not matter because the laws 
of Canada were under attack.  As a consequence, there was an 
immediate appeal to the B.C. courts on the same matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, after all of the consideration and after all of the 
outrage that was expressed by Canadians, the B.C. appeal court 
upheld the decision of the lower court and basically tore down 
the law.  It did not sustain the law of Canada with regard to the 
possession of child pornography.  The case is now before the 
Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case was originally heard in January 1999.  On June 30 the 
B.C. court of appeal upheld the decision.  It was a two to one 
decision.  Madam Justice Mary Southin and Madam Justice Anne 
Rowles felt that the current law was an unreasonable violation of 
the guarantee of freedom of thought, belief, opinion and 
expression contained in the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are back to the fundamentals.  It is the rights and the 
freedoms of the individual in conflict with societal values and 
the tolerance level for what constitutes an undue exploitation, 
in this case of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much written about this case.  Much of it refers 
to the legislation that was put in place in the 34th parliament 
with regard to child pornography.  It was admittedly a rushed 
piece of legislation.  It was a piece of legislation which many 
criticized as being so broad that it would even constitute a 
violation if a person had certain thoughts.  Certain things 
written in a diary could be subject to problems within the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious situation.  I wanted to raise this aspect 
of the discussion of pornography because in a short time we will 
hear from the Supreme Court of Canada and I have some fears about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the B.C. appeal court Chief Justice Allan McEachern disagreed 
with the other two judges.  He believes that the harm caused by 
child pornography justifies handling the law.  This question of 
cause and effect and is there harm is a very serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity to discuss this issue with the justice 
minister so that I could better understand some of the nuances of 
the law and the judicial system.  My view is that the protection 
of children is enhanced by the prohibition against simple 
possession of child pornography.  I cannot state it any more 
simply.  I believe that the protection of children comes before 
the rights and freedoms of the individual guaranteed by the 
charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in conflict, I suppose, in terms of a statement; but in 
terms of a value system I believe that the starting point in this 
discussion, the starting point with regard to the legislation, 
has to be with the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event that the supreme court appeal is not successful—in 
other words, the decision of the B.C. lower court and the court 
of appeal that Mr. Sharpe is not guilty because it was an 
intrusion of his rights and freedoms—we have the opportunity to 
do something under section 31(1) of the charter, commonly known 
as the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, in response to the B.C. court of 
appeal, said that the notwithstanding clause should only be used 
as a last resort and only after every available legal recourse 
has been exhausted. 
I tend to agree with the justice minister.  I believe that the 
notwithstanding clause is for extraordinary circumstances.  I do 
believe, though, that should the supreme court render a judgment 
which does not uphold the laws of Canada, it should be dealt with 
by a swift response of the government in invoking the 
notwithstanding clause and then dealing with the points of law or 
legislation which the courts have identified as leading them to 
render those decisions and make those corrections.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it would be appropriate for us simply to accept 
the supreme court decision and continue to study or ponder the 
consequences.  I do not believe Canadians would tolerate a 
protracted consideration of a negative supreme court decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want it to be dealt with promptly.  I believe I have the 
support of colleagues in this place.  I believe that members in 
this Chamber would say that the notwithstanding clause is our 
first available option with regard to a negative supreme court 
decision.  I hope we will be able to have that consensus in this 
place so that we can act swiftly when a decision comes down.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by the 
member for Mississauga South and I welcome the opportunity to 
participate in the debate on Motion No. 69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few minutes ago members of the House were in the 
Speaker's office shaking hands with John Glenn, a man who has 
gone up into space twice, once as a younger man and once as a man 
in his seventies.  That proves that in this world we can do 
anything we want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of legislation is something we should support.  With 
respect to the pornography issue, if we do not get a favourable 
decision from the supreme court, I agree with the hon. member 
that it may be the first time this parliament will have to use 
the notwithstanding clause.  It should be used if the supreme 
court does not make the proper decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 69 calls for an amendment to section 163 of the 
criminal code and would broaden the definition of obscenity.  The 
member's motion states, in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of this act, any matter or thing is obscene 
where a dominant characteristic of the matter or thing is the 
undue exploitation of any one or more of the following subjects, 
namely, sex, violence, crime, horror or cruelty, through 
degrading representation of a male or female person or in any 
other manner. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say at the outset that I see no problem with this 
amendment to section 163.  In fact, it is more reflective of our 
times.  After all, the definition of obscenity in section 163 of 
the criminal code was written in 1959.  Surely times have 
changed, particularly the manner of transmission of obscene 
material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the impetus for this motion by the member for 
Mississauga South comes from the leading supreme court case on 
the issue of obscenity.  I am talking about Regina v Butler.  In 
that case the supreme court upheld the ban of obscenity as 
constitutional.  In essence, the court ruled that banning 
obscenity would be an infringement of the freedom of expression, 
but is saved by section 1 of the charter as a reasonable limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sex that is degrading or dehumanizing will be considered undue 
because it is harmful to society, particularly women.  However, 
material which offends against community standards could be saved 
if it was necessary for the serious treatment of the theme.  The 
stronger the inference of the risk of harm, the lesser the 
likelihood of community tolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sex with violence will almost always be undue exploitation. 
Explicit sex that is degrading or dehumanizing may be undue if 
the risk of harm is substantial.  Explicit sex that is 
non-violent and non-dehumanizing will almost always be tolerated. 
That seems to be the manner of law in the interpretation of 
obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga South does not appear to be objecting 
to the supreme court case involving Butler.  For background, the 
Butler case involved an individual, Mr. Butler, who was a 
purveyor of hard-core video tapes.  In the first case the court 
said that charges of obscene were inappropriate and that the 
video tapes were acceptable.  The court of appeal did not agree. 
The supreme court used the harm test and agreed that the tapes 
were obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Motion No. 69 the member's definition of obscene still 
contains the word undue, which leads to the community tolerance 
test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member for Mississauga South has picked up the 
notion of degrading for the genesis of his motion. 
The effect of this motion is simply to make undue exploitation of 
violence, crime, horror or cruelty as obscene even if no sex is 
involved.  For example, if I have interpreted the member's 
rationale correctly, under his proposed definition beating 
someone to death in a degrading manner, torture without 
exploiting the person sexually, no rape, would be obscene.  If 
that is the case I have no problem with this step forward in 
amending subsection 163(8) of the criminal code.  In fact, I 
would welcome this new definition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may say that it goes too far and may unduly restrict the 
publication of photos by legitimate media sources. I do not 
believe this could happen.  In light of the defence of serving 
the public good, which is contained in subsection 163(3) of the 
criminal code, it seems unlikely that any legitimate media would 
be threatened by Motion No. 69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to see any reference made to amending section 
163 of the code.  As I said previously, that section dates back 
to 1959.  I have always believed that the code is an evolutionary 
document which must reflect the times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a close look at section 163, which is entitled 
“Offences tending to corrupt morals”, we will find some archaic 
and startling sections more reminiscent of the 1950s.  Paragraph 
163(1)(b) states that it is a criminal offence to make, print, 
publish, distribute, sell or have in one's possession for the 
purposes of publication, distribution or circulation a crime 
comic.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, a crime comic.  Surely this is a bit 
out of sync with the times and suggests to me that section 163 
needs a complete review and a complete overhaul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 163(1)(d) states that anyone who advertises or 
publishes an advertisement of any means, instructions, medicine, 
drug or article, intended or represented as a method of restoring 
sexual virility or curing venereal disease of the generative 
organs, is guilty of a criminal offence.  This is another example 
of the 1950 attitudes existing in our criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we have moved beyond that thinking.  Section 163 is out 
of touch with our times.  That is why I have no objection to 
Motion No. 69, which seeks to amend subsection 163(8) of the 
criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 69 reflects the need to deal with the issue of 
degrading and reflects community standards and norms of today.  It 
is in step with the times, which I support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close by once again talking about the 
notwithstanding clause.  It comes up many times in the debates of 
the House.  Sometimes it is said that we should only use it in 
extraordinary circumstances.  The constitution of the country was 
drafted by people from across the country.  There was a very good 
reason the premiers in certain segments of the country insisted 
they would not sign the constitution, the bill of rights, unless 
it contained the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have never used it in this House and I find that rather 
strange.  It lets the supreme court and any other court in the 
country know that the elected members of the House form the 
supreme body of this country.  We have gotten away from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a debate today with a reporter who said “No, 
you are wrong.  The supreme court runs the country”.  He was 
serious.  He really believed that the supreme court had the final 
say.  When I brought the notwithstanding clause forward he said 
“But you have never used it”.  He is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps now is the time.  The member for Mississauga South 
talked about the child pornography case.  If a ruling comes down 
which is not agreeable to the majority of members of the House, I 
would hope we would have the courage to use the notwithstanding 
clause to make a law that the majority of members of the House 
would agree with.  We know what the majority feel.  We saw it in 
a letter from a number of members on the Liberal side to the 
Prime Minister about using the notwithstanding clause in this 
particular case.  Yet they voted the way they had to vote when we 
put the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there will be a public outcry on this issue if the 
supreme court allows this case to go the way it has been going 
through the other levels of the courts, even though it was not 
unanimous in those courts.  I read the minority decision of the 
Chief Justice of British Columbia, Allan McEachern.  I have a lot 
of respect for him as a lawyer and as a judge, not only in this 
case but in other cases before him in British Columbia.  He 
disagreed with the other two honourable justices in that case.

it does not, we must let the supreme court know that this is the

majority of people in the country want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the bill.  We also look forward to support from 
the other side when that pornography issue comes down, if it is 
not the right decision by the supreme court. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would echo much of what has already been said in 
terms of the timeliness and the importance of this debate.  I am 
very pleased to participate in a debate of such a very 
significant nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by commending my colleague, the hon. member for 
Mississauga South.  I know he has been a tireless worker with 
respect to issues such as this one.  I know the particular motion 
comes from a very purist and principled motivation to protect 
children.  I could not embrace in a more enthusiastic way 
anything that we as legislators and we as members of parliament 
do that will enhance protection for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would amend subsection 163(8) of the criminal code. 
It would basically tighten up an existing definition.  Without 
casting any aspersions at all on what the hon. member is trying 
to accomplish, that current section sets out significant 
protection for individuals who would be victims of exploitation 
under this type of activity.  However, as has been referred to, 
there is certainly a need to have clarity in this type of 
legislation and in some cases to provide some direction for 
judges who might interpret too broadly this type of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The references to the case that is pending before the supreme 
court, Queen v Sharpe, was highly publicized and received a great 
deal of response nationally although it arose out of a court in 
British Columbia.  It has sparked very much a debate and a need 
to revisit this type of legislation.  Anything that would depict 
children in such a way as to be defined as pornography or 
exploitive is something on which we have to move swiftly and very 
starkly to oppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My only regret, as this case has progressed through the courts 
and has been argued before our justices of the supreme court, is 
that the Minister of Justice did not act in a more swift and 
decisive way to refer the case immediately to the supreme court 
so that the decision would have been made and the signal would 
have been sent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any suggestion that the possession of child pornography, let 
alone its production and distribution, is constitutionally valid 
is asinine.  Any type of activity that leads to the production of 
child pornography obviously has to be what has created the 
opportunity for someone to possess it.  It is not beyond logic to 
follow that someone had to produce it for a person to be in 
possession of it.  We have to send a clear message that it is 
absolutely offside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current practice is to let these matters progress through 
the courts.  As the hon. member has stated there may very well be 
the need in the near future, if things do not go as they should 
in the supreme court, for the government to act swiftly and to 
invoke the notwithstanding clause.   We know that is a very 
severe intervention and it is one that is very rarely 
implemented.  It is the equivalent of a legislative nuclear bomb. 
It brings in a legislative bar on further discussion on the 
particular issue and suspends any further litigation in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is of importance.  I agree very much with the 
commentary we have heard already on the subject matter before us. 
I agree wholeheartedly that it is a perfect example of something 
where parliament should very much consider, if need be, invoking 
the notwithstanding clause.  I know we can all speculate and that 
there is not a great deal of merit in doing so at this time, but 
let us hope that step will not be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are dealing with issues that involve charter rights it 
is something that we have to contemplate carefully. 
There are fundamental freedoms which are very much protected by 
our charter.  I am sure the Chair would agree that the charter 
has also led in some instances to very perverse decisions where 
community rights are used to stomp on individual rights and vice 
versa.  Individual rights are often displayed in such a way that 
the majority of people are very much taken aback by a court's 
decision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law is and has been referred to many times as a living tree. 
We have to be careful when we cross into the area of legislators 
telling or restricting judges in what they can and cannot do.  I 
for one still have a fair bit of faith in our judiciary.  We have 
some very talented judges.  Just like it is not popular to defend 
politicians, it is sometimes not popular to say that we have some 
very able and very competent judicial minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is ample evidence to suggest that when it comes 
to children and the protection of children there are times when 
it is incumbent, not just our responsibility but our absolute 
right, to intervene on behalf of children.  I can think of many 
instances where that is the case.  One that comes to mind quite 
quickly is the potential change to the criminal code with respect 
to conditional sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentences should not be handed down by judges when 
it comes to sentences for sex offences, offences of violence or 
offences against children.  That is something that should not be 
contemplated.  I am sure it was not contemplated when the 
legislation was passed.  The government should very much consider 
revisiting the particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly I think we can do more to protect individuals from sex 
offenders.  I have a private member's bill before the House that 
would amend the conditions of probation which attach under 
section 161 of the criminal code with respect to putting a bar on 
a sex offender attending a private dwelling house when a child is 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more examples of what we can do to tighten up and very 
much close in on anyone who would cross that line and harm a 
child.  It goes without saying that the harm done to a child by 
even the mildest display of violence or sexual intrusion carries 
with that child for life.  It is a life sentence imposed and has 
absolutely drastic and far reaching effects on the life of a 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of debate is very useful when it comes to looking at 
these types of issues, examining what more we can do.  We in this 
place are tasked to do everything we can to protect young people, 
people of all denominations, ages and creeds across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member would very much agree that we should 
have a national strategy to combat child pornography.  We should 
be doing more to study this area.  We should have a national 
databank with respect to those who are convicted of pedophilia 
and crimes of such a nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do a great deal more if we had a national sex offender 
registry that would inform those who are most at risk.  We know 
that the use of the Internet, the use of modern technology, 
allows us to expand the horizons of information and availability. 
Technology has broken down many barriers in terms of making 
information available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much to be done.  We should have legislation that would 
allow for testing of sex offenders for communicable diseases such 
as AIDS.  That is another suggestion I am sure many members of 
the House would embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamental changes can be made.  I think the hon. member is 
moving in the right direction with his suggestion under this 
motion.  Obviously a lot can be done.  One of the greatest fears 
against which we have to be guarded is the creeping complacency 
or apathy that exists, desensitization by the prevalence of 
pornography and violence and its perpetration as some form of 
art.  We have to do more to ensure that this is not the case in 
the House.  That is not what Canadians expect us to do. Although 
I am very quick to point out that freedom of expression is 
something we always have to be conscious of and respect, freedom 
of expression never involves the exploitation of a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that we will be discussing the Sharpe case again 
at some point in the future. 
As I have indicated, I hope it will not come to pass that it will 
be incumbent upon this government or any government to intervene 
with the notwithstanding clause.  Should that happen, I expect 
that the hon. member will echo the remarks he has already put 
forward.  I support him in that.  The charter is there as a 
shield and a sword.  Similarly we have to be prepared to use the 
particular piece of legislation when it is necessitated, when it 
is incumbent and when it is proper.

that would improve the protections which currently exist in our 
criminal code.  In conclusion, I support the matter and I fully 
hope that all members of the House will do likewise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have the opportunity this evening to speak to 
Motion No. 69 introduced by the hon. member for Mississauga 
South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion seeks to amend the current definition of obscenity as 
it appears in subsection 163(8) of the criminal code as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“For the purposes of this Act, any matter or thing is obscene 
where a dominant characteristic of the matter or thing is the 
undue exploitation of any one or more of the following subjects, 
namely, sex, violence, crime, horror or cruelty, through 
degrading representation of a male or female person or in any 
other manner”. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I praise the member for his efforts to protect Canadians from 
any material containing violence. He is well known for his work 
in this area and I congratulate him. However, I am not sure the 
aim of the motion is clear enough. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us examine the effect of the proposal before us.  The 
proposed definition of obscenity would extend the notion of 
obscenity beyond the bounds of its common understanding.  The 
current code definition requires the undue exploitation of sex or 
the combination of sex and at least one of violence, horror, 
crime or cruelty in order to be considered obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obscenity is understood to include some notion of sexual 
immorality or indecency.  The proposed definition of obscenity in 
the motion would include materials that unduly exploit violence, 
crime, horror or cruelty alone.  To include within the definition 
of obscenity strictly violence, horror, crime or cruelty would 
not fit in within the common and legal understanding of the 
concept.  Other changes to the current definition of obscenity 
proposed by the motion would have little or no effect on the 
manner in which the term is currently applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The replacement of the word publication with matter or thing is 
not necessary.  The courts have already held that the definition 
of obscenity in subsection 163(8) applies to all matter whether 
or not it is a publication.  There is no need therefore to make 
this change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the addition of through degrading representation of a 
male or female person is also unnecessary because it is included 
within the judicial interpretation of the current definition of 
obscenity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been referred to tonight, the Supreme Court of Canada 
said in R. v Butler that material which depicts explicit sex 
without violence will usually also have to depict degrading or 
dehumanizing treatment in order to be constitutionally 
prohibited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by the court, explicit sex that is not violent and 
not degrading or dehumanizing is generally tolerated by society 
and will not qualify as undue exploitation of sex.  Where there 
is undue exploitation of sex alone, therefore, it is unnecessary 
to specify that it includes degrading representations because 
that is implicit in the context of undue exploitation based on 
the interpretation given by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also proposes to add the phrase “in any other 
manner” as a qualifier of undue exploitation.  The type of 
manner contemplated by this wording is unclear but it would 
appear unnecessary as well.  For reasons similar to those I have 
already referred to, the provision as it currently appears in the 
code leaves the notion of undue exploitation unqualified so as to 
allow for more flexible interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition proposed in the motion would qualify the phrase 
undue exploitation with through degrading representation of a 
male or female person, with the result that the possible 
interpretations of the phrase would be narrowed. 
It then attempts to broaden the definition with the addition of 
the phrase “or in any other manner”.  This addition is 
unnecessary and needlessly complicates the current wording with 
the possible result that judicial interpretations of the new 
definition may not turn out to be what the motion seeks to 
realize in proposing this definition.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like the hon. member, we want to protect children from the 
harmful effects of material containing violence. But there may 
be other, more efficient ways to go about it than to legislate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we must trust the conscientiousness of Canadian parents 
to adequately supervise the activities of their children and 
regulate the types of materials to which their children are 
exposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to parental supervision, the broadcasting industry 
has adopted a voluntary code regarding violence in television 
programming to respond to the public's concern over the issue of 
violence in the media and in society in general.  The voluntary 
code states that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of the broadcaster, the regulator, the 
cable operator and cable delivered programming services, in 
conjunction with parents, teachers and individual viewers to work 
cooperatively to inform and educate society on how to best 
manage this technological revolution which has created an endless 
video buffet of programming choices. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government must certainly play a role in protecting 
children from the harm occasioned by violence in the media, all 
sectors of society must work co-operatively to achieve this goal. 
The criminal code is a blunt instrument.  It is not the sole 
instrument or even the most effective instrument available to 
deal with social or moral behaviour.  It may be used to deal with 
certain discrete types of behaviour but we must resist the 
tendency to rely too heavily on it as a panacea for all that we 
wish to repair in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would also like to join with other members in 
thanking this hon. member for his contribution to the debate on 
this subject. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to say, particularly to those 
people looking in across Canada, that they indeed should pay 
tribute to the hon. member for Mississauga South for bringing 
this motion before the House.  No other issue has brought more 
attention from across Canada than this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I totally disagree with the parliamentary secretary. 
What he is doing is giving credence to an issue that goes beyond 
any reasonable doubt about the content and how the courts should 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an issue that the lower courts and the supreme court of 
B.C. have agreed on.  It is now before the Supreme Court of 
Canada.  The question Canadians want answered is, what happens if 
the supreme court agrees with the two lower courts?  Canadians 
from coast to coast are worried about that.  Is it not the 
responsibility of the House to draft new legislation?  It cannot 
be any clearer than it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only recourse we have is the notwithstanding clause.  If 
that clause was to be used only on rare occasions, then this is 
that rare occasion.  How can any elected official in this House 
not know full well that when those pornographic films are made 
somebody's child or grandchild is being abused?  I cannot believe 
the defence of the system.  It simply goes beyond my imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion introduced by my hon. friend is a new definition for 
obscenity.  Obscenity takes place in many different ways.  How 
far does freedom go when the two lower courts of B.C. based their 
dismissal of the case on the grounds of freedom of expression?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take freedom of religion.  If we look around the House we 
see people of different religions.  No one for one moment would 
accept a member of the House criticizing a Jewish member and 
using degrading representation or degrading remarks.  The member 
would be called totally out of order.  However, out in society 
and in the media it is fair game to attack one religion, that 
religion being Christianity, and it is all done in the freedom of 
expression.  It is even creeping into the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reporter came up to me the other day and asked me what I 
thought about the baggage a leading politician was carrying.  I 
told him to wait for a minute and then I asked him what he 
thought about the baggage I was carrying.  He said that I was not 
carrying any baggage.  I told him that I happened to believe in 
God, in prayer and in fellowship, and that I too volunteered my 
time as an administrator for a private Christian school.  He 
asked me why I called that baggage.  We are allowing this in many 
different ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme case under the charter of freedom of expression has 
allowed two court decisions to make a mockery out of decency and 
a mockery out of everything that this country has ever stood for 
since Confederation.  We cannot pass the buck by simply saying 
that we have to train the parents or we have to stop it on TV. We 
have to say to the courts that this House is supreme when it 
comes to decisions like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will we do, I would ask the hon. member?  I congratulate 
him for bringing this forward.  I have never had so many cases of 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the hon. parliamentary secretary and government 
members opposite that if they had a free vote they would bring in 
the notwithstanding clause just like that.  They would bring it 
in tomorrow if they had to.  This is not a party thing.  It is a 
thing of principle, of morality and of decency.  However, here we 
are in limbo.  We will let the courts decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, possession of pornography is legal, and by 
information that I have been able to acquire, it is growing.  Why 
would it not grow?  If it is legal in B.C. it will soon be legal 
all over the country.  Hon. members should ask the RCMP and their 
police forces.  It is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members may think I am carrying some baggage.  They may 
also think that what is happening in this country is all right. 
We know about the interference with the clergy at the Swiss 
Airlines memorial.  We know that people were told what to do. 
That was interference in the freedom of religion.  Now, under the 
guise of freedom of expression, we sit here as legislators with 
the possibility of the supreme court agreeing with the two lower 
courts on this terrible issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the passing of the charter of human rights, one of the 
supreme court judges said that they would finally get a chance to 
make laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our whole democratic system is built on the principle that there 
is a big stone wall between the legislature and the judiciary, 
but we are quite willing to let the judiciary do its thing and 
make rulings that affect the lawmakers of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to congratulate the hon. member. 
When the decision comes down and then comes before the House, I 
know where he will stand.  He will stand in defence of children. 
He will stand against child abuse.  He will stand against 
pornography.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was home in Saskatchewan for the weekend I experienced a 
big debate in the provincial legislature on pornography.  This 
debate was not about child pornography.  It was about a crown 
corporation and the government giving money for the production of 
a pornographic film of gays and lesbians to be shown at 
government expense.  This is freedom of expression.  This is 
wrong.  Nobody can defend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the House and to people across Canada that they 
should rise up and take control.  Canadians elect us.  They 
should say that it is not up to anyone but the people in this 
place to make the laws.  They should say that it is up to us to 
protect the people with the laws, not to interpret according to 
some feelings of the people needing to be politically correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are so worried about being politically correct that we have 
become obscene within ourselves.  Let us face indecency, 
corruption and immorality the way we should.  We should not be 
passing the buck.  It is our responsibility to do it in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague in the Conservative Party and my hon. 
colleague in my own party have spoken.  There will be no change. 
I say to the member for Mississauga South that when this issue 
comes up again he can bank on my party's full support in what he 
is doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank all my colleagues who took the opportunity to participate 
in this debate on an issue that will unfortunately continue to 
seize this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the question of the Sharpe case will certainly be 
one that we will be waiting in anticipation for from the supreme 
court.  It is certainly our wish that the court will uphold the 
laws of Canada to make possession of child pornography illegal 
and that we will be sustained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully, from all three levels of the courts, we will have 
received input with regard to those areas of the existing 
legislation which may lead to this kind of problem where there is 
some ambiguity as to whether or not those laws are an unnecessary 
and undue infringement on the rights and freedoms of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things that were said in the House today were useful and 
constructive.  From that standpoint, I feel that Motion No. 69 
served a purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary took me to one other dimension of 
this whole issue.  He talked about the role of parents.  There is 
no question that we all have to be part of the solution.  We 
cannot legislate morality.  We cannot legislate behaviour.  All 
we can do is provide some of the thinking and some of the 
principles under which we should guide Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the case of David Trott, the 20 year old B.C. man 
who has been charged with the murder of Jessica Russell, a nine 
year old child.  This is a very tragic case.  We have to look at 
the facts not at the victim, which in itself is a terrible 
tragedy. 
When we look at the accused, he is somebody who is 20 years old 
and has a criminal record that would make anybody understand that 
this is a serious problem.  He is also a person who was sexually 
abused as a young child.  It is linked to this debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  This 20 year old Canadian was born with fetal 
alcohol syndrome.  He is a person for whom there is no recovery. 
He has permanent brain damage.  He is a person who was physically 
and sexually abused.  He is a person who dropped out of school 
and abused drugs.  He is a person that anybody who has known him 
throughout his life has said that he is a bomb waiting to 
explode.  They could see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have we failed in society to help people who cannot help 
themselves?  As a consequence the tragedy is amplified by the 
tragic death of young Jessica. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of things I want to talk about here and I 
know many members want to talk about it.  I throw it back to the 
parliamentary secretary and say engage parliamentarians in some 
of the principles that have to guide us in making the laws.  Not 
only can we make good laws, but those laws can also be an 
inspiration to parents to provide the guidance to their children, 
and for those in society who are in the company of those children 
and for those parents to step forward and intervene in a 
constructive fashion as appropriate to make sure that these 
tragedies do not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to be a part of the solution.  That is 
why Motion No. 69 came forward.  It has been a constructive 
debate.  I thank hon. members for their kind comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the starting point is children.  We know that the 
notwithstanding clause is the tool that parliament has in the 
event that parliamentarians do not agree with an unfavourable 
decision.  We have to look at that seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this as another dimension of the debate on Motion No. 69 
from the standpoint that as time goes on the House may find 
itself in recess when this decision comes down.  I want to be 
absolutely sure that people start thinking today about what 
happens when that decision comes down and it is unfavourable. 
Have we got a clear understanding of the views of this place?  If 
not, maybe we should.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today on the subject of parental leave, further to a 
number of questions I have raised with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's intentions with regard to making the system 
more flexible and to extending it to pregnant women and parents 
wanting to take maternity or parental leave are unclear.  The 
minister talks of her desire to expand parental leave by 
doubling it.  It would increase from 25 to 50 weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her answers, the minister says that the Government of Quebec 
broke off negotiations in 1997.  We ask her to be of good faith 
in this exercise, to truly want to help parents by giving them 
parental leave, to extend a hand to the Government of Quebec so 
Quebecers may be entitled to parental leave as sought by the 
Regroupement pour un régime québécois d'assurance parentale. 
This group represents Quebec organizations.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to provide some information to the minister, because it 
is very nice to want to double the length of parental leave and 
let women look after their children for a year at home, but one 
must have the means to do so and be able to qualify for that 
leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the minister to reduce the number of hours of work that 
is required. The minister says she wants to give more 
flexibility to her parental leave policy, but she should first 
take a look at the working conditions of women. Just take a look 
at the current reality in the labour force: women hold 
non-standard, temporary and part time jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures confirm our concern about who can qualify. How many 
of those who qualify will be able to afford parental leave? We 
all know that the 55% provided under the federal parental leave 
program is totally inadequate. If women hold non-standard, part 
time or temporary jobs, their income is small; so, 55% of their 
salary during a year spent at home is totally inadequate. 
Obviously, the Minister of Human Resources Development did not 
look at the whole issue of parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures speak for themselves. Since 1997, when the changes 
were made, 10,000 fewer women than before have qualified for 
maternity benefits. Why? Because 700 hours are now required to 
qualify. That number has been reduced by 100 hours, but it had 
gone from 300 to 700 hours and, in the last budget, the 
government only reduced by 100 hours the requirement to qualify 
for parental leave. This is totally inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to be generous, but everyone knows that only 49% of 
women who are eligible for maternity leave take advantage of the 
additional parental leave, because they either do not qualify or 
cannot afford it. Very few women take the whole parental leave 
because they cannot stay at home too long, as their income is 
essential to balance the family income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will be able to afford it? Those who work full time, those 
who have fringe benefits. Once again, a large percentage of the 
female population will be excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to examine the whole issue of parental leave, 
to show openness and to negotiate, so that Quebec can finally 
implement its parental leave policy, which is far more generous. 
The federal government could have responded to Quebec's request 
for extended parental leave for self-employed women who want 70% 
of their income. That is the whole issue with regard to parental 
leave. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, maternity 
and parental benefits are a longstanding part of the Government 
of Canada's commitment to children and families.  These benefits 
are provided to Quebecers like all other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1999 the government indicated that it would extend 
these benefits to provide greater flexibility to parents to 
better balance work and family needs.  Our priority is to 
implement our improved parental benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent budget announcement on the extended parental benefits 
now allows parents up to one year of leave instead of the 
traditional six months. We have also made parental benefits more 
accessible by lowering the eligibility threshold to 600 hours, 
about four months on a 40 hour week and five months on a 30 hour 
week, and giving more flexibility to parents by removing the 
second waiting period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Government of Canada did enter into negotiations 
with Quebec so that it could establish its own parental leave 
plan.  At that time we made a fair and equitable offer to the 
Government of Quebec but the Government of Quebec walked away 
from these negotiations.  For our part, at the moment our 
government is focused on providing extended EI maternity and 
parental benefits to Quebecers and to all other Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is May 10 and a couple of our colleagues have birthdays today.  I 
want to wish them a happy birthday.  We are going to share a 
dinner.  They cannot share it with their families at home because 
they are here working.  I want to let everyone know that we are 
still trying to remain whole even when we cannot be with our 
families, but we hopefully will make it up in other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I had an opportunity to ask a question of the Minister 
for International Trade.  He is the Minister for International 
Trade not of international trade.  It is a fine distinction.  He 
pointed out to me at a trade exposition in Mississauga a couple 
of weeks ago that we are for trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In preparing for my intervention tonight I pulled out the annual 
report of the Export Development Corporation which has been 
getting a lot of attention in the House of late.  I wanted to 
look at the section on increasing Canada's competitiveness.  It 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is enjoying renewed prosperity.  Unemployment is at its 
lowest point in 20 years, inflation is low and under control; 
private spending is up and fiscal deficits are down.  Canada is 
experiencing robust growth, which is expected to remain strong in 
2000. The economy is continuing its shift to the high-tech and 
services sectors that look set to dominate the 21st century 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combined impact of trade liberalization and growing trade 
integration within North America have heightened Canada's 
dependence on trade— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that wording, our dependence on trade, that triggered the 
question.  I asked the Minister for International Trade to give 
us some indicators of how we have benefited from trade and also 
to deal with the myth that somehow what we produce in Canada for 
export is ostensibly either low value added or in fact raw 
materials or commodities and that maybe we are not getting the 
amplification or the leverage from high quality export trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister gave some very interesting statistics.  He said 
that our exports now total 41% of Canada's GDP versus 27% just 10 
years ago.  He also clarified that in fact our commodities 
exports were down from some 60% some years ago to a low 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard could the parliamentary secretary provide a bit 
more information about how vital trade is to Canada and possibly 
how this is going to translate into Canada being more competitive 
in a global economy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
for International Trade has said in the House that among the G-7 
nations, Canada benefits the most from trade and therefore is the 
most open to trade of the G-7 economies.  Our exports plus 
imports add up to the equivalent of over 80% of our GDP. The next 
closest to us is the United Kingdom at less than 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More of our production at home depends on export markets than 
any other G-7 country.  By the same token we have made the global 
market our market to a greater extent than any of our 
competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we have to see the importance of global markets to 
Canada's emerging new economy sectors.  Our trade numbers show 
that we are having some success.  Some of our new economy exports 
such as earnings from royalties and licences and research and 
development have consistently been the strongest components in 
our services exports. These grew by 16.8% and 15% per year 
respectively since 1993. Services are the key to the new economy 
and we are starting to do very well here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that we ship a lot of rocks and logs.  We have and 
will continue to have a strong comparative advantage in many 
resource sectors.  The numbers show that the relative size of the 
resource sector in total Canadian exports has fallen over the 
years. But the good news is that we have not been losing our 
resource sector.  Rather, we have been gaining vibrant 
manufacturing and services sectors that have become world class 
competitors in their own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This points to what I think is the most significant way in which 
trade and investment are benefiting Canada.  Our integration with 
the global economy is not type casting us as producers of raw 
materials. 
It is paving the way for Canadians to enjoy the benefits of a 
vastly more diversified economy with more knowledge based 
economic activity and more rewarding jobs than an inward 
orientation possibly could offer.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
