rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak in favour 
of Motion No. 261 as proposed by my hon. colleague from 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government 
should: (<I>a</I>) develop, along with their provincial counterparts, a 
comprehensive National Head Start Program for children in their 
first 8 years of life; (<I>b</I>) ensure that this integrated program 
involves both hospitals and schools, and is modelled on the 
experiences of the Moncton Head Start Program, Hawaii Head Start 
Program, and PERRY Pre-School Program; and (<I>c</I>) ensure that the 
program is implemented by the year 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition are pleased that the motion is 
receiving so much support in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion clearly states that the federal government should 
develop a national head start program along with its provincial 
counterparts.  This would be a comprehensive program for all 
Canadian children in their first eight years of their life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I have divided my mandate into four 
components of society which I would like to focus on.  They are: 
youth, senior citizens, families and women.  I find this helpful 
in my work because, for example, I find that I learn a great deal 
about youth when I meet with students at schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should provide a good start in life for our children.  Our 
federal government tries to help all children through our health 
and education programs.  The motion simply asks the federal 
government to concentrate on our children in the first eight 
years of their life, which is a critical stage in a child's 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that inadequate attention and nurturing for our 
youngsters can often lead to subsequent developmental 
difficulties.  We know that with a poor start the life of a child 
is at risk of winding up on the wrong side of the law.  Our 
federal government should be interested in any opportunities that 
result in successful crime prevention.  We spend more money 
dealing with criminals than on early detection and prevention of 
crime.  The dollars spent on providing a good head start for our 
children will result in the saving of many dollars in the future 
that would have been spent dealing with anti-social and criminal 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already implemented head start programs for 
our aboriginal communities.  They have been primarily limited to 
reserves, but most aboriginal people living off reserve and 
non-aboriginal people also need this kind of program.  We should 
treat all Canadians equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have head start programs for our aboriginal children.  Why 
are head start programs not available to other children who are 
not living on reserve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion proposes that the government explore models based on 
the Perry Preschool Program, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's National Crime Prevention Council has been 
very of supportive a national head start program.  On page 2 of 
the executive summary of its 1996 report it states: 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample evidence that well-designed social development 
programs can prevent crime and be cost-effective.  Rigorous 
evaluations, mainly American, show that crime prevention through 
social development pays handsome dividends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In almost 30 years of participant follow-up the Perry Preschool 
Program in Michigan has been shown to be responsible for very 
significantly reducing juvenile and adult crime. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for Children and Youth has already spoken 
to this motion on behalf of the Liberals.  She acknowledges the 
success of the aboriginal head start program and pointed out that 
funding had doubled due to its benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to expand our efforts to include the protection of all 
children and to assist needy parents to properly nurture and care 
for our country's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are debating should be supported by all members of 
this House, but especially by Liberals.  The motion is not in 
conflict with the comments made by the secretary of state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is known that healthy babies become healthy children. 
Hospitals could screen all new mothers to identify babies and 
families who may need extra support and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supporting this motion would pave the way for providing high 
risk families with the parenting help needed to avoid child abuse 
and neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition justice critic spoke on this motion 
during its second hour of debate.  He recounted that during the 
justice committee's recent 10-year review of the Young Offenders 
Act the committee travelled across the country.  It listened to 
witnesses.  It heard experts, professionals and lay people who 
have an interest in the whole area of the development of youth 
and the prevention of youth crime.  During the hearings experts 
told the committee that teachers could detect aberrant and 
over-aggressive behaviour in children as early as grades one, two 
and three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc fears that the motion encroaches into the area of 
provincial jurisdiction.  As such, it has tied this motion into 
the Canadian unity debate.  That is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec the justice committee found programs that are far 
ahead of some of the other provinces.  That province has done an 
excellent job.  There are programs in Quebec that ought to be 
looked at and perhaps emulated by other provinces if they have a 
real concern about dealing with early detection and preventive 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to the heart of the role of our federal 
government.  Far from being threatened, Quebec should be anxious 
to share its technology and some of its successful programs with 
the rest of the country.  The Bloc members should also support 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our federal government should pursue this motion and pool our 
resources to reduce the cost of implementation.  Ideas and 
successes could be shared.  National standards would ensure that 
children from all parts of this country receive the necessary 
assistance and protection in a national head start program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in August 1996 the former minister of justice commented 
about the justice system and how the harm has already been done 
by the time people come before the courts.  He stated “We must 
do more than deal with the symptoms of the problem.  We must go 
to the source”.  Programs, as proposed by this motion, go to the 
source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Child Welfare League of Canada argued the need to 
create a comprehensive and permanent universal program across 
Canada to address funding for early intervention measures to 
assist our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example.  Sandor Nyerges was a 
constituent of mine and a veteran of the two great wars.  He was 
deaf, mute, 80 years old and lived alone.  He became the victim 
of a ferocious attack by an assailant who has a long record as a 
young offender.  My constituent died in the hospital from that 
attack. 
The alleged assailant was apparently intoxicated, a youth, 
possibly on drugs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Surrey Central and I are furious.  In Surrey 
and elsewhere we hear about such crimes day after day.  We have 
had another murder in Surrey, a caretaker at the Sikh temple, 
another victim of youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our federal government had been acting in a timely fashion in 
the direction of the motion we are debating today, maybe Sandor 
and many other Canadians might not have been assaulted or 
murdered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Princess Margaret Senior Secondary School in Surrey in 
March 1998 I met with students shortly after Sandor died.  During 
my meeting with these students they raised the issue of crime as 
a major concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just another example of how the government continues to 
put the rights of the accused first and the safety of Canadians 
second.  The government does not have a national head start 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I would like to say that Canadians are suffering.  We 
want safer streets and safer communities.  We want the Liberal 
government to respond to society's justice needs.  That is why we 
should all support Motion No. 261. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise today to speak on Motion No. 261 
put forward by the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  The 
member continues to demonstrate his commitment to progressive 
social policy. I have spoken about this issue previously in the 
House and it is with great pride that I do so today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good government means providing the vehicle for a prosperous 
Canadian economy and also ensuring equality of opportunity in 
that prosperous economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best economic system to provide prosperity is the free 
market, but the free market is only sustainable if all citizens 
have access to the economic levers.  I believe that if we were to 
implement a national head start program and focus on early 
intervention, we would be going a long way in addressing the 
equality of opportunity and the access to those levers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently several issues have been debated in the House and 
focused on by the Canadian people.  One is the Liberal 
government's $2.5 billion millennium scholarship fund introduced 
in Bill C-36 which will be debated later on and which has been 
debated quite extensively in the House lately.  Another is the 
government's new posturing on the Young Offenders Act.  Not 
surprisingly the Liberals have missed the point on both programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 261 speaks to a process that is far more admirable, 
effective and economical than these government sponsored 
programs.  Motion No. 261 is an early intervention program that 
promotes prevention instead of punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Study after study suggests that one dollar invested in a child 
in the formative years, particularly between birth and three 
years of age, and some studies say birth and six years of age, 
can deliver a six dollar and some say a seven dollar return on a 
child during those formative years.  Some studies indicate that a 
one dollar investment in a child between birth and the age of 
three will provide a return of seven dollars to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Programs like the head start program in Moncton, New Brunswick 
offer this alternative, an economic return already in Canada. Not 
all areas are so fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From personal experience, I grew up on the Hants shore in rural 
Nova Scotia. In grade 6 there were 23 students who left grade 6 
at the same time I did to go to another school.  Only 8 of those 
students ever graduated from high school, 8 out of 23. I have 
some degree of experience and indeed a very personal empathy for 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently in that community there has been significant 
progress by that school.  The Dr. Arthur Hines School has become 
a leader in Nova Scotia in terms of providing equality of 
opportunity in rural Nova Scotia. I commend the principal, Hazel 
Dill, for her hard work.  I also commend grassroots organizations 
such as the Hants Shore Health Clinic that work on these head 
start and early intervention programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other programs in my community, including an adult 
literacy program which is being promoted by Patricia Helliwell. 
It is achieving significant progress with people who have fallen 
through the cracks in the system early on.  I commend that adult 
literacy program for its commendable work and its effectiveness 
in helping provide these people with an opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think what if we really started to deal with 
the roots of the problem. 
What if we got to these people earlier, when they were children 
and a significant impact could be made.  Then someday perhaps we 
would not need adult literacy programs in Canada because all 
Canadians would have achieved a basic competence in communication 
and literacy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has chosen a different more politically palatable 
route.  It has decided to use the memorial fund for the Prime 
Minister.  This Canadian millennium scholarship fund will only 
benefit 7% of Canadian students who attend university when it is 
implemented two years from now.  If the government had put this 
$2.5 billion toward a national head start program, it would have 
provided a better economic return on that money for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the Liberal Party's focus group and polling data have 
told it to spend the money on university students, that 
post-secondary education is a more politically palatable 
initiative than is early intervention.  The facts are contrary to 
this. Experts on post-secondary education will agree that the 
best bang for the buck for the Canadian taxpayer is to invest in 
the youngest of Canadians, those Canadians who are most 
vulnerable to negative influences and who can benefit most from 
positive influences, those between birth and the age of three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume based on focus groups and polling data that the 
government has recently decided to get tough with young 
offenders.  Arguably it is extremely important that the Young 
Offenders Act be tightened and that young people be made more 
responsible for their actions.  Again the Liberals have really 
missed the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Harsher penalties will not prevent young people from committing 
crimes.  We must address the flaws in the Young Offenders Act but 
what can we do to prevent these young people from turning toward 
crime?  Why are we not dealing with these issues in a more 
holistic manner instead of by knee-jerk reaction and crisis 
management?  The real answer is early intervention. A national 
head start program would go a long way toward addressing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A stable and caring environment during a child's formative years 
offers the best opportunity to provide a productive and stable 
adolescence and ultimately a productive and prosperous adulthood. 
Studies have demonstrated that this early intervention is one of 
the best social policy approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the finance committee hearings earlier this month I 
questioned Professor David Stager from the University of Toronto. 
I asked him how he felt about early intervention. Professor 
Stager is an expert on post-secondary education. When I asked him 
how he felt about the investment we could potentially make in 
early intervention he said that the best bang for the buck would 
be before school.  There was a splendid synthesis done this past 
fall of the research in the area of human capital.  It concluded 
that early intervention has the greatest pay-off for a number of 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man is an expert on post-secondary education and an 
advocate for post-secondary education who has spent his life 
advocating investment in areas of post-secondary education.  He 
told the finance committee that the best investment for society 
to make is in early intervention before children even get to 
elementary school where much damage could have already occurred 
if positive environments were not provided earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for his forward 
thinking and his commitment to progressive social policy.  His 
motion would be very effective in addressing the real needs of 
Canadians at a very critical time.  We are entering the 21st 
century.  We have a global knowledge based economy that will 
generate the economic growth of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House can make a difference so it is absolutely 
imperative that we focus on ensuring that young Canadians have 
every opportunity.  If we as public policy makers and 
parliamentarians can ensure that young Canadians do not just have 
as good a chance but that they have a better opportunity than 
people in other countries, we will be doing a great deal to 
ensure that Canada is on a firm footing and that young Canadians 
are poised to participate actively and prosper in the new 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of commitment will prevent the necessity of a TAGS 
program in the 21st century.  It will prevent the necessity of a 
lot of the social investment that has been more reactive than 
proactive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an Atlantic Canadian, I have watched over the years as 
successive governments have tried to effectively deal with the 
situation in Atlantic Canada frankly by using money on social 
spending as opposed to social investment. Unfortunately these 
governments in trying to protect Atlantic Canadians from the 
risks of the future have prevented them from participating in the 
rewards of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where aggressive and forward thinking social policy, 
such as an early intervention program, would make a difference. 
Then we would not have to be engaged in regional economic 
development debates in 20 years in this House because we would 
have provided the equality of opportunity which is necessary to 
allow all Canadians to participate in growth.  As an Atlantic 
Canadian it is very important to me that we continue to work to 
this end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge every member of this House to consider very 
carefully and to support this motion.  I think it is very 
important for us, when provided with the opportunity, to make the 
right decisions, to make decisions that will last much longer 
than many of us will be in this House and to provide those types 
of benefits.  It would be an affront to the people who put us 
here not to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the House 
today on this motion advocating a national head start program for 
Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to applaud the hon. member for his strong support of 
early childhood development.  The Government of Canada shares his 
enthusiasm for early childhood development as a way of positively 
influencing the health of children.  In fact the government has 
made increased knowledge of and action on early childhood 
development a top priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next few minutes I would like to share with the House 
some of the things we have learned about early childhood 
development and how this knowledge is shaping our approach to 
prevention and early intervention initiatives on behalf of 
Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing we have learned from a vast body of 
research over the last 30 years is that the experiences of 
Canadian children especially in their early years profoundly 
influence their health and well-being throughout their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have long known that early negative factors such as low birth 
weight, low income, abuse, neglect and poor physical and mental 
health are barriers to healthy child development.  Government 
initiatives such as the community action program for children, 
the Canada prenatal nutrition program and aboriginal head start 
have achieved considerable success in responding to these 
factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, research and experience tell us we must do more to 
recognize and support positive factors that contribute to healthy 
development.  These factors range from healthy pregnancies and 
birth weights to loving parents, to supportive mentors or role 
models, to caring families and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key thing we have learned is that developing these 
positive factors requires the involvement of many partners across 
society.  These include parents, who are children's earliest and 
most influential teachers, volunteer organizations, health 
service providers, schools, neighbourhoods and communities. We 
need strong involvement from across society because we all have a 
stake in ensuring that Canada's children get off to the best 
possible start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Health recently noted in this House, 
Canadians and their governments have a moral responsibility to 
help improve conditions of childhood for the seven million 
children in this country.  He went on to say that taking 
collective responsibility for children is not just the right 
thing to do, it makes good economic and social sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How early do we need to focus on childhood development? Research 
tells us that we have the best opportunity to make a positive 
impact in the very early years of life.  This is because 85% of a 
child's core brain development occurs by age three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While negative experiences in these early years can result in 
disorganized and underdeveloped brains, positive experiences 
often stimulate overall brain development. What are the social 
implications of negative versus positive early experiences for 
children? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research shows that negative experiences tend to produce 
impulsive, aggressive adults.  On the other hand, positive early 
life experiences tend to produce more intelligent, caring and 
responsible citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area where we have made advances is our increased 
knowledge of the developmental pathways children pass through on 
their way to adulthood.  These pathways can be influenced by a 
wide variety of negative or positive factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers have found that all children pass through critical 
periods along their own developmental pathways.  During these 
periods, there are windows of opportunity where support and 
intervention can make a difference in their development. The 
period from conception to the age of five or six is seen as the 
most critical of these periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While families are first and foremost responsible for the 
development of their children in this early period, they are not 
the only ones that must assume the responsibility. Families need 
support.  Governments, communities, corporations, employers, 
unions, teachers and individual Canadians all have a role to 
play.  We must work together to help children move along healthy 
pathways to adulthood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind, I call on fellow members to join me in 
encouraging Canadians to make healthy child development a 
priority in their own neighbourhoods and communities.  By acting 
together we can make a world of difference for Canada's children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the motion by the Reform Party member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, although we support the motion in principle and 
the underlying reasoning concerning youth crime, we cannot 
support it for the following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, family policy is a matter of provincial jurisdiction, and 
this has always been the case.  Second, as far as Quebec is 
concerned, it has well established policies in place to reduce 
juvenile delinquency, to help young people reintegrate society 
and to divert them from a life of crime. 
One thing the Reform Party member should understand is that 
youth crime will decrease when other Canadian provinces do as 
Ontario has done and follow Quebec's example with respect to 
youth protection, creating youth centres to help young people 
and tracking those at risk throughout their formative years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to provide some very important, and very revealing, 
statistics, which were brought to light by my colleague, the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, a little while ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures on juvenile delinquency recidivism rates are 
eloquent and speak for themselves.  Quebec has been active in 
this area for 30 years, through its youth centres and through 
its youth protection legislation.  The result is that it has the 
lowest rate of recidivism in Canada. 
It has the lowest rate of recidivism for youth crime anywhere in 
North America.  The number is 195 per 100,000 in Quebec while, 
for a province such as Saskatchewan, where the accent has been 
much more on punitive measures than on reintegration into 
society, the number is 800 per 10,000.  That is high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four or five years ago, Ontario decided to follow Quebec's 
example and model part of its youth protection program on what 
is being done in Quebec.  The results are very impressive.  For 
the past five years, the rate of juvenile delinquency in Ontario 
has steadily decreased.  Right now, it is around 400 or 500 per 
10,000, as opposed to 800 per 10,000 for provinces such as 
Saskatchewan.  These are the two points I wish to make regarding 
the motion per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the fact that this motion is being introduced by the 
Reform Party, that I find somewhat confusing, because we no 
longer know where Reformers are coming from. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT8"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT8"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1135

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they have a common party policy regarding youth protection 
and the Criminal Code in general? We have heard all sorts of 
things in the past five years. We even heard of a delegation of 
Reform members planning to visit a country, whose name I forget, 
to look into the benefits of flogging criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' bills were tabled and remarks were made by 
members of the Reform Party, which were extremely harsh and made 
no mention of reintegration or social rehabilitation, only of 
punishment per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, there is this Reform bill, which is kind of mild compared 
to the ones tabled previously. This is somewhat confusing. What 
do members of the Reform Party think? Are they in favour of 
reintegration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, Reformers criticized the Minister of Justice for 
lowering the age at which children may be tried in adult court 
for a serious crime. They argued that lowering the age was not 
enough. They wanted provisions included in the legislation 
whereby children under the age of 10 who are charged with a 
serious crime may be tried in adult court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this debate, when the Minister of Justice lowered the age 
for transferring young offenders charged with serious crimes, 
not once did a Reformer raise the importance of reintegration 
and the need to help young offenders re-enter society for its 
greater benefit. This is a bit confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern we have is with the fact that, in their remarks 
on this motion, Reformers failed to mention that there is a 
major reason why youth crime is on the rise, as crime in general 
may be, and that is the social and economic conditions people 
live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last four or five years, the Liberal government has 
imposed drastic cuts to social transfers for welfare, health and 
provincial funding for higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such cuts, which total billions of dollars and which will 
continue to be made until the year 2003, have an obvious impact 
on the economic situation of households, particularly those with 
children. Social problems surface whenever the economic 
well-being and development opportunities of families are 
targeted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A child whose basic needs are not met because of financial 
problems experienced by the parents, or because of psychological 
distress also related to reduced federal transfers is more 
likely to become a juvenile delinquent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what this government has done regarding 
employment insurance since January 1996. The changes it made had 
a significant impact on the economic conditions of Canadian 
families, thus creating a tendency among children to become 
juvenile delinquents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics on employment insurance are shocking and 
revolting. They amount to political and administrative 
barbarism. This government has made so many cuts and has 
tightened the eligibility criteria for employment insurance so 
much that, for the fiscal year 1997-98, only 42% of the 
unemployed are eligible for EI benefits, compared to 83% just 
nine years ago. In 1989, 83% of the unemployed were entitled to 
benefits, compared to only 42% today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you tighten eligibility criteria to that extent and when 
you triple the number of hours that must be worked, you create 
conditions that are conducive to a rise in juvenile delinquency. 
You also create conditions which, in the families that suffer 
psychological shock and stress as a result of these cuts, 
promote delinquency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, there were a million unemployed.  Now, there are 1.4 
million unemployed, but we are paying out $3 billion less in 
employment insurance than in 1989.  So, there are 400,000 more 
unemployed and $3 billion less.  This can only cause increased 
distress and lead to juvenile delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, eligibility requirements for parental leave, leave 
that is often necessary, have doubled. It now takes 700 hours, 
or 20 weeks of 35 hours each. 
This is one of the major areas that was tightened up, along with 
the way seasonal workers and those on the labour market for the 
first time are treated when they are hit by unemployment.  The 
requirement now to receive employment insurance benefits is 910 
hours, whereas before it took 20 weeks at 15 hours per week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly these cuts, which are pushing families toward welfare, 
are increasing the distress of these families and the likelihood 
of the children of these families turning to delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the Reform Party taken a coherent and intelligent  approach, 
it would have supported the Bloc Quebecois in the matter of 
provincial transfers for welfare, post-secondary education and 
health and it would have supported the Bloc's demands for reform 
of employment insurance, which is needed immediately to avoid 
psychological and economic distress to the people of Quebec and 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am rising to 
indicate my support of Motion M-261, presented by the hon. member 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  I would like to draw particular 
attention to his proactive action in proposing a preventive 
solution to crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-261 is composed of three elements. First, that the 
government should develop, along with their provincial 
counterparts, a comprehensive National Head Start Program for 
children in their first eight years of life.  Then, that they 
should ensure that this integrated program involves both 
hospitals and schools, and is modelled on the experiences of the 
Moncton Head Start Program, Hawaii Head Start Program, and PERRY 
Pre-School Program.  Finally, the government should ensure that 
the program is implemented by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-261 is a good idea, because it addresses the fundamental 
causes of crime and prevents criminal behaviour in later life. 
This government's strategy toward crime involves reacting once a 
crime has been committed.  We spend millions of dollars on the 
criminal justice system processing offenders through the court 
and prison systems.  This approach to the problem is very costly 
in both financial and personal terms.  Anyone who has been the 
victim of a crime can say that the effects linger long 
after the actual incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are really concerned about victims' rights, we should work 
at decreasing the number of crimes and this will decrease the 
number of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this motion is to address the fundamental needs 
of Canadian children at a very early age.  The NDP has long 
recognized the importance of meeting our children's basic needs 
so that they may develop to their full potential with the right 
nutrition and the right environment. 
In 1989, the then NDP leader Ed Broadbent introduced a motion 
aimed at eliminating child poverty by the year 2000.  This 
motion was adopted by all parties, but now in 1998 the situation 
has not improved, in fact it is even more critical. We must 
invest in our children in order to ensure a better future, with 
less crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program this motion is suggesting is not a new one. Head 
start programs were introduced in Michigan, Hawaii and Moncton, 
New Brunswick.  Hawaii's healthy start program was one of the 
first early intervention programs for children.  It focussed on 
high risk families and on interventions during pregnancy.  By 
tackling problems such as basic parenting skills, nutrition, 
conflict resolution and substance abuse, it was able to reduce 
child abuse by 99%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PERRY Pre-School Program in Michigan has focused on improving 
parenting skills, improving infant health, bettering family 
circumstances and promoting cognitive and social development. 
Assessments of this program have shown that it has reduced the 
adult and juvenile crime rate by almost 50%, decreased the 
number of teen pregnancies by 40%, and increased rates of 
employment and income.  Long-term savings to taxpayers were 
substantial and, in all, amounted to six times the initial 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Head Start Program in Moncton, New Brunswick, provides 
children of parents who are socially, emotionally or 
educationally disadvantaged with an environment that focuses on 
children's and parents' basic needs. For each dollar spent under 
the Head Start program, it is estimated that six are saved in 
social assistance services. 
In addition to saving money, we are preventing the considerable 
emotional difficulties suffered by crime victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should set aside political discourse that talks about crime 
as though it is inevitable.  A proactive approach that invests 
in our children not only ensures a future with less crime but it 
also ensures a promising future for our young people.  I can 
think of no better investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-26l should go further.  Federal and provincial 
governments should urge first nations chiefs to take part in the 
program, because we know that the problem of crime among 
aboriginals is incredible.  By inviting them to join us in our 
efforts, I think we will be able to accomplish something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, I urge all my colleagues to support Motion 
M-261.  All our children deserve a head start. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have three 
minutes left in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, since the debate is to be 
terminated in three minutes and since Government Orders do not 
start until noon, I ask for unanimous consent of the House that 
we continue until noon to debate this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also ask that the member for Elgin—Middlesex—London be 
allowed five minutes, that the member for Lethbridge be allowed 
five minutes, and that I would have a minute to thank everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The House has heard 
the suggestion of the hon. member.  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the hon. member for putting forward the motion 
we are debating today.  I remind members of the House that the 
motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should (a) 
develop, along with their provincial counterparts, a 
comprehensive National Head Start Program for children in their 
first 8 years of life; (b) ensure that this integrated program 
involves both hospitals and schools, and is modelled on the 
experiences of the Moncton Head Start Program, Hawaii Head Start 
Program and PERRY Pre-School Program; and (c) ensure that the 
program is implemented by the year 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could speak for some time on the substantive merits of the 
proposal.  I support the intent of the motion quite strongly.  It 
has been stated eloquently by members who spoke before me that by 
investing in children in the early years of life we get a 
tremendous compounding effect of benefits throughout a person's 
life.  If we invest early we get better literacy rates.  If we 
invest early we get lower criminal rates.  If we invest early we 
get better health rates.  All social factors are improved by 
investing early between the ages of zero and eight. 
I certainly hope the member knows that I know that and that I 
know the intent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we had questions and answers I would raise some 
concerns over the bill.  For the federal government to partner 
with the provinces these days is a difficult task.  Anyone who 
reads the newspapers knows that it is difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately in many parts of the country the provinces want 
the federal government to write a cheque.  Then we would let 
provinces go off on their merry way and devise programs.  They 
would thank Ottawa and take the money, but they do not want the 
federal government involved in their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec would have some opinions on federal government spending 
on what traditionally would be seen as a provincial jurisdiction. 
That causes me some concern.  Other provinces whether out west 
or whatever would also have some concerns about the federal 
government embarking on a new spending program.  I am not sure we 
can put a time line of the year 2000.  These things would involve 
some very difficult negotiations.  They would have to be 
processed and I do not know whether that can be done by the year 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the member is suggesting that the federal 
government, if it does not have an agreement to bring in a 
program by the year 2000, would unilaterally embark on its own 
program.  I do not read that in the bill so I am not sure what 
would happen if the motion passed and the federal government 
could not get agreement by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to suggest I do not support the bill.  I have some 
difficulty with the wording.  I ask members when they vote on the 
motion not just to vote on the intent of the bill.  All members 
can see the intent is worth while.  It is worth supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is not simple and straightforward to embark on new 
federal-provincial programs.  The federal government is trying to 
get a new federal-provincial program on home care.  It has on its 
agenda that at some point it would like a new federal-provincial 
program around a national pharmacare program. This would become 
another program that would be added to the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it on the hepatitis C issue.  The government is trying to 
work out another agreement with the provinces on how to treat the 
people excluded from the original agreement.  Those negotiations 
are proving to be difficult.  I could throw some stones at those 
on the other side who are in some respect playing politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main point is that federal-provincial agreements are not as 
simple as a simple private member's motion might suggest on first 
read.  I ask members to think about what they are voting on when 
the motion comes before us for a vote.  I advise members opposite 
that I support the intent of the bill, but I will have to reflect 
on whether I will be voting for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
members present for allowing us to carry on.  It is a pleasure to 
rise to speak to Motion No. 261 advising the government to 
develop a national head start program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca is someone for whom I 
have a great deal of respect.  I know many members in the House 
have respect for him as well.  He has dedicated his life to 
helping the injured and the sick.  He has had a firsthand 
opportunity to witness breakdowns in our health care and 
education systems as the two are so closely linked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident all members of the House will support the motion 
because almost all of us are parents and many of us are 
grandparents or soon to be.  We know that in an ever increasing 
competitive global market technological advances make leaps and 
bounds but should never come at the expense of our children.  The 
generations to come will require every head start they can get, 
every advantage their health and happiness will allow, giving 
them the support and positive reinforcement required to excel in 
a competitive world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague recently wrote in a note: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—research has clearly demonstrated that events in early 
childhood can have a dramatic effect on an individual.  Ensuring 
that children's basic needs are met (i.e. proper nutrition, 
strengthening parent child relationships, good parenting skills, 
preventing child abuse, etc.) has proven to have a profound 
effect in producing stable, happy children and thereafter, well 
functioning adults.  Programs that address these needs are not 
only effective in their outcome, but also, extremely cost 
effective. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt any member of the House would refute that youth crime is 
becoming increasingly common and increasingly violent. While 
legislative changes can bring about statistical changes in youth 
crime, my colleague urges us to consider the motion, to support 
it, and to get to the root of youth problems before they start.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The operative word here is prevention.  The time has come for 
the House to start taking a proactive stance on youth problems 
and to stop relying solely on reactionary solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of youth crime may not be the only problem in 
society but it is one issue we can try to resolve before it 
materializes.  If we can implement a national head start program, 
children who may have began an early life in crime can be helped 
in the right direction through such a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of implementing a national head start program will be 
returned many times over, as has been previously mentioned, with 
every child that is helped.  Youth criminals can easily become 
serious adult offenders and we all know how expensive our 
judicial and penal systems have become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we invest the money now we could save the costs associated 
with youth criminals and their subsequent adult crime life. 
Children do not begin lives in crime out of choice.  My colleague 
has done a great deal of research on the issue and I urge all 
members here today to seriously listen to the facts and act in 
the best interest of Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today will help children, plain and simple. 
Regardless of our political affiliation let us put our partisan 
politics aside and act in the best interest of our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative we remember to whom we owe these seats in 
parliament: our constituents, the men, women and children who 
rely on us to represent their best interest.  Today we can prove 
to all our constituents that we recognize a good thing when we 
see it.  Today's motion will only improve the conditions of our 
children by addressing basic parenting skills, proper nutrition, 
conflict resolution and abuse issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics are in and early intervention programs can be 
very successful.  Members of the House cannot ignore the 50% 
decrease in juvenile and adult crime as a result of early 
intervention programs.  Nor can my colleagues ignore the 40% 
reduction in teen pregnancies and the resulting higher rates of 
employment and income.  The long term savings to Canadians are 
enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to do the math to remind my colleagues about the 
huge price tag associated with crime.  Costs go up and insurance 
premiums rise.  Policing expenses, court costs, in addition to 
incarceration and counselling are all extremely expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To simplify the decision of whether or not to support the 
motion—and my common sense tells me that all in the House will 
support a decent and worthwhile initiative such as this one—I 
liken the situation to a favourite poem of mine “The Road Not 
Taken” by Robert Frost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our great country we have and will often come to a 
crossroads, two diverging roads that branch off in two different 
directions.  I see today's motion on the implementation of a 
national head start program as exactly that.  It is a fork in the 
road.  Either we take the road that has been travelled many 
times, the reactionary road of detention and incarceration, or we 
take a new path, a proactive path of crime prevention through 
social development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every child in Canada deserves the opportunity to develop as a 
normal human being.  I urge all members here today to support my 
colleague's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stand in debate to move a friendly amendment to

House to rise in debate to move an amendment to the motion?

given unanimous consent for three persons to speak.  That is why 
it has to be done in this way.

<A NAME="LINK23">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 13, 1998 consideration of Bill C-36, 
an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 24, 1998, as reported (without amendment) 
from the committee; and of Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-36 before us contains various provisions, including one 
regarding the millennium scholarships program, which the Prime 
Minister would like to impose on and force down the throats of 
the provinces, particularly Quebec, whose loans and grants 
system is working remarkably well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, last Wednesday, in the City of Lac-Mégantic, I 
attended the opening of a new foundation, which does not make 
any waves or cause any jurisdictional problems. 
The founding president of the Montignac Foundation, Serge 
Poulin, who is the vice-principal of the Montignac school, 
together with the board, will carry out his duties on a 
voluntary basis and will be required to raise up to $1 million 
within five years in support of Montignac's high school 
graduates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the federal government, this foundation does not plan to 
spend 5% of its budget on administration costs. Everyone 
involved unanimously agreed to work for free, not only in 
managing and administering the fund but also in raising funds, 
while it is a well known fact that the federal government has 
already earmarked $2.5 billion in the 1997-98 budget for 
scholarships that will not be granted to students for another 
two or three years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real scandal, and, in addition, it is causing barefaced 
duplication.  The last time I spoke on this bill, I compared the 
duplication to the situation of a farmer with a mixed quota of 
processing milk and fluid milk.  That means two ministers of 
agriculture will be managing the same cow, which belongs to the 
same producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be two levels of government, two heads of government, 
two forms for every student to complete to obtain money to 
continue studying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course students do not care whether the cheque bears a maple 
leaf or a fleur de lys. 
We all know that the Government of Quebec will deduct from 
bursaries to students any amount it discovers the federal 
government has given them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate Serge Poulin, the founding 
president, and the members of his board of directors along with 
the members of the 15 municipalities surrounding the city of 
Lac-Mégantic, who will manage the Fondation Montignac. The 
region of Lac-Mégantic is very prosperous, with a level of 
unemployment no doubt under 6%.  However, the average income is 
lower than that in the eastern townships.  With this sort of 
foundation, we will enable dozens and dozens of students to 
continue their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I invite the federal government and the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, in particular, to sit down with 
Pauline Marois and come to an agreement.  It is disastrous when 
the government is continually sowing the seeds of discord and 
always looking for an argument or a run in with the provinces, 
given that education is a provincial matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me pleasure to speak on Bill C-36, the budget 
implementation bill, and to represent my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose what is most frustrating, though, would be for them to 
witness this last vote.  The government should be ashamed of 
itself.  It has just forced closure again, again and again. There 
are 107 amendments to this bill.  There has been less than one 
day to debate these at report stage and what does this government 
do?  It does like it has in the past from the very first bill, 
right back to Bill C-2. It forces closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pulls every single trick and all the people on 
that side of the House get their little marching orders, they 
stand up like trained sheep and do what they are told to do.  It 
is absolutely disgusting and appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about Group No. 1. I have not quite figured out 
whether this is the Prime Minister's slush fund or if it is the 
finance minister's. The Prime Minister has announced a $2.5 
billion slush fund which nobody will see until at least the year 
2000.  We have no idea what direction it is going.  He is sort of 
burying it in a dark hole.  We are not sure if it is being put 
away for the finance minister's announcement when he wants to 
seek the nomination of this party to sit on this side of the 
House.  We do not know where it is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if it does go to some of the students. Only 6% of the 
entire student population would receive any benefit of this $2.5 
billion slush fund belonging to we are not sure who. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that very disturbing but even more disturbing is that 
this government stands up on that side of the House, gets on its 
moral high horse and all of a sudden it is so proud of doing 
something for young Canadians, putting something back into 
education. 
This government has a very short memory.  Over the last four 
years during the last parliament this government cut $7 billion 
in transfer payments to the provinces.  What do those go to? 
Education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students are struggling. Now the government is on its moral high 
horse again to announce a slush fund.  It does not want to do it 
too early in its term.  It is going to wait and the fund will 
benefit at best 6% of students if it ever gets to them.  That is 
a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the budget. The minister was quite upset at 
being criticized by the auditor general for his accounting 
practices so he sent his cronies to talk to the auditor general. 
The message was basically that if you do not like the way we are 
keeping our books, we will just change the rules.  Who do you 
think you are to criticize the government, you are only the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to commend the auditor general on his reply.  On March 18 
the auditor general stated this to the government: “I believe 
the change will open the door for governments to influence 
reported results by simply announcing intentions in their budgets 
and then deciding what to include in the deficit or surplus after 
the end of the year once preliminary numbers are known”.  The 
auditor general is trying to very politely tell the government to 
quit cooking the books.  That is exactly what the government is 
doing.  I cannot believe the Liberals sit on that side of the 
House with their faces buried in their papers.  They are not 
paying attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the facts.  Look what those guys did less than a half 
hour ago.  They stood up like trained sheep and followed their 
marching orders.  How can they do that?  We watched it on 
hepatitis C and we watch it on vote after vote. Why do they even 
come to Ottawa?  They are ordered here.  They think they have 
some dignity coming to this House and voting like that. I have 
been here for one year. Time after time I see closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can crack jokes but this is serious business. The people of 
Canada are incredibly frustrated that the Liberals sit on that 
side of the House and force closure on bills like this, that they 
make a slush fund for the finance minister to dispose of when he 
feels it is right for his political advantage while students are 
out there struggling. They are struggling all over British 
Columbia where I come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian students are facing rising tuition costs and expenses 
and the government's response to them is we will create a slush 
fund but come back and see us in the year 2000 and we will decide 
if you qualify.  If you buy a young Liberals membership we will 
see where you fit in the mix and if you will get some of this 
fund.  We have not quite decided who will benefit from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is absolutely shameful.  Students are looking for help. 
They are facing rising tuition costs on account of this 
government's massive cutbacks to post-secondary institutions, $7 
billion since the Liberals formed government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is straight fact.  Look at the numbers.  Any financial 
expert can tell them that.  They sit over there and think it is a 
big joke.  The day of reckoning will come, next election day. How 
they can actually stand up and vote to force closure on 107 
amendments is incredible.  We have had one day of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when those members sat on this side of the 
House.  They thought it was appalling to force closure.  But how 
quickly it changes when they are on that side of the House.  Time 
and time again we have seen what these members have done.  They 
get their marching orders from the whip. 
I think they call it a triple whip vote.  That is what we are 
getting again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can those guys sit on that side of the House with straight 
faces and joke and laugh about something this serious?  We are 
talking about the budget implementation act and I am specifically 
talking about the $2.5 billion millennium scholarship fund which 
is a nice fancy title for the Prime Minister and his cronies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government had anything to do it would put that $2.5 
billion into tax cuts immediately where there would be a tangible 
benefit, where jobs could be created for students who will be 
getting out of university in the next week or two looking for 
jobs.  Students are facing dismal prospects right now across the 
country due to the government's high taxation on small business. 
This government could have done something positive for the 
students of this country.  Instead it chose to play its political 
games, cooking the books, hiding the money and deciding what fits 
its political agenda and how it can benefit from this. That is 
exactly what the government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honestly believe that students and all Canadians in the next 
election will come back to this.  We will make sure they remember 
that time after time this government forced closure when it was 
convenient, when it suited its own political agenda. There is no 
substance in this.  It is just hiding $2.5 billion. The 
government calls it a scholarship fund but it is not accessible 
until the year 2000.  Even then it may benefit 6% of the students 
of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, about 10 days 
ago, the Quebec National Assembly unanimously passed a 
resolution asking the federal government to amend its bill on 
the millennium scholarship fund, so as to respect Quebec's 
unique student loans and grants program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next few minutes, I will explain why the 
representatives of the people of Quebec asked Ottawa to 
unconditionally withdraw from this area and to provide full 
financial compensation to the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first discuss the federal government's unconditional 
withdrawal from education. 
Many reasons justify such a measure, but it is always worth 
repeating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, under the Constitution, education is an exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. We can never say it too often. The 
federal government argued that its initiative is not related to 
education, but to the funding of education. Yet, it is clear 
that the federal program interferes in the education sector by 
evaluating scholarship recipients and asking them for an 
activity report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the issue is even more sensitive in the case of Quebec 
which, as you know, is not a province like the others, even 
though some refuse to recognize that fact. Again, anything 
relating to language, culture and education is vital to Quebec's 
national identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the federal government's project is a waste of time, 
money and resources. Indeed, the Quebec government has been 
administering its own loans and scholarships program for 34 
years. 
It has the expertise and the necessary infrastructures to ensure 
the smooth operation of a new scholarships program. Why create a 
new structure, the millennium scholarship foundation, and 
provide it with the required staff and mechanisms, when 
everything is already in place in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such shameful duplication is condemned so strongly that a 
consensus quickly developed in Quebec to have all student 
scholarships administered by the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to discuss the second Quebec claim, that is the 
transfer to the Quebec government of the financial resources 
reserved for Quebec, so that it can implement an additional 
scholarship program if needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main reason for this is the current imbalance between the 
federal government's financial resources and those of the 
provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1957, ten years before he became Prime Minister of 
Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau wrote the following: “The total 
wealth at the disposal of the Canadian tax system needs to be 
divided between the federal government and the provincial 
governments so that each may do as it sees fit with its share”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, each level of government must have its share of 
taxes so that it may meet its constitutional responsibilities. 
The present Prime Minister would do well to read what his mentor 
had to say on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government does, however, have greater powers of 
taxation than the provinces. 
This problem dates back to the beginnings of Confederation, 
worsening as the provinces began to develop programs to meet the 
growing needs of their populations in the areas of health, 
education and welfare.  Instead of splitting tax resources 
differently with the provinces, however, the government of 
Canada offered to co-finance programs under certain conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, the federal government did not settle for controlling 
the provinces' exercise of power.  Often, solely in order to 
raise its profile, it wants to be the one to control a program 
in an area of provincial jurisdiction.  As we know, very often 
it does this by taking advantage of its spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the millennium scholarship foundation but just one 
more abuse of the federal spending power, despite this 
government's promise to limit spending in the aftermath of the 
1995 referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Prime Minister of Canada is launching unprecedented 
assaults on the provinces.  Even Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
supported the Quebec premier in his opposition to the federal 
grants to universities in the 1950s.  On this he wrote the 
following: “If a government has such a superabundance of revenue 
that it undertakes to provide part of the common wealth which 
does not fall under its jurisdiction—that government is 
conspicuously guilty of going against the principle of 
proportional taxation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by these words from a Quebecker who cannot be labelled a 
separatist, the Government of Canada collects too much taxes 
compared to the provincial governments.  This is no doubt the 
reason the Minister of Finance is trying to camouflage his 
budget surplus.  Every year he has underevaluated his taxation 
revenues, overestimated his reserve for contingencies, and as a 
result exaggerated the size of the federal deficit. 
Today, he is trying to include in the 1998-99 budget expenditures 
that would be made over a period of ten years. What will he 
invent tomorrow to interfere, once again, in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government now has more money than it needs to 
fulfil its responsibilities. That money is not the federal 
government's money. First of all, it is the money the provinces 
should have received through transfers, which were cut by 
several billion dollars. It is also the money of the workers, 
whose EI contributions were diverted. Finally, it is the money 
of taxpayers from Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and all the 
other Canadian provinces where the federal government collects 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a need for scholarships, the provinces must meet 
that need themselves. 
The federal government just has to give them part of the fiscal 
base so they can collect the necessary taxes directly or, as a 
former premier of Quebec used to say, “to give them back their 
loot”. But, as we can see, the more things change, the more they 
stay the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the federal government should withdraw from the 
area of scholarships with full compensation to the provinces, as 
demanded unanimously by the members of the National Assembly of 
Quebec. As a matter of fact, that is the intent of the 
amendments to the bill that were brought forward by my 
colleague, the member for Quebec. It is so convenient to attack 
the separatists when things are not going well in the Canadian 
system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if there is a sovereignist movement in Quebec, is it not 
primarily because the Canadian federation is not working? If it 
is not working, is it not mainly because the federal government 
is infringing upon provincial areas of jurisdiction, which is 
leading to costly overlap? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer these questions, let me remind the House of what the 
late political analyst Léon Dion wrote in 1980: “The political 
stability of our country relies on Quebec being granted control 
over all linguistic and cultural matters as well as the 
financial means to develop and implement the programs it would 
see fit to promote in these areas as suitable for its own 
people.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a dysfunctional entity. For the last 50 years, 
Canadian federalism has moved away from the model developed by 
its founders, since respect for the autonomy of the provinces is 
at the heart of the 1867 pact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Millennium Scholarship Foundation is but another example of 
this distorted federalism. Since negotiations are underway to 
allow the Government of Quebec to regain exclusive control over 
scholarships, it would be appropriate to suspend the 
implementation of the millennium scholarship program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal government seems to be too concerned about 
its political visibility and not enough about the welfare of the 
students to support the amendments put forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have some quick facts on the so-called Liberal 
millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to human resources development, in Canada 45% of all 
new jobs by the year 2000 will require post-secondary education. 
This means that for many young people attending university or 
college is not an option if they want to find work.  Despite this 
fact and despite the fact that the Liberals say they are 
committed to youth, the Liberals continue to throw barriers in 
the way of young people struggling to develop the skills and 
talents necessary to get ahead in a cutthroat global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 the federal Liberals have cut $1.5 billion from 
federal funding for post-secondary education.  Since 1980 Liberal 
and Conservative governments have cut federal funding from $6.44 
for each dollar of student fees to less than $3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 10 years tuition fees have climbed by 240%.  Last 
year alone they rose by almost 12% nationally, increasing at a 
rate seven times the rate of inflation.  Tuition fees in Canada 
have reached a national average of $3,100 which surpasses the 
average tuition rate of publicly funded universities in the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1997 survey of high school students in the maritimes, 40% 
of students not going to university said they could not go 
because they could not afford it.  The average student debt load 
is $25,000.  That is up $13,000 in 1993 when the Liberals took 
power.  Bankruptcies for students trying to pay off loans are at 
record levels, having increased by 700% since 1989.  Currently 
130,000 students are in default.  The number of bankrupt 
graduates is estimated at 37,000.  Missing one payment determines 
default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now some questions for them.  By the time the first cheque from 
the millennium fund is mailed out the Liberal cuts to the Canada 
health and social transfer will have cost colleges and 
universities $3 billion.  It does nothing to redress rapid 
increases in tuition fees for post-secondary education which have 
almost tripled since 1990.  It would not substantially alter the 
huge debt load the university students face upon graduation.  Nor 
does the scholarship better the situation for students graduating 
into unemployment.  Less than 1% of unemployed youth will benefit 
from the government's program to fight youth unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add hypocrisy to the mix, very deep within the budget's small 
print is a provision that stops students from filing for 
bankruptcy for at least 10 years after they have graduated.  The 
current policy is two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot of discussion about the millennium fund and 
whether it will improve the situation for post-secondary 
education.  Having looked at the document in committee where some 
of the discussion has taken place, it is quite clear that 
post-secondary education is in a very deep crisis.  One of the 
reasons that we are facing a crisis with post-secondary education 
is the retreat of public funding for our post-secondary 
educational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we have heard a lot of talk about the millennium fund, 
this grand fund of $2.5 billion, the reality is that this fund 
will not even begin until the year 2000 and will only help 7% of 
the students. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has some questions about the accounting 
practices of the millennium fund.  Those questions should be 
raised with the Minister of Finance as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time the fund begins in the year 2000 we will have 
experienced cuts of around $3 billion.  It becomes very clear 
that the millennium fund does not even come close to replacing or 
compensating for the massive draining cuts we have experienced in 
post-secondary education.  This is causing enormous concerns not 
only in terms of where public policy is going, but also for the 
impact it is having on the lives of individual students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of the retreat of public funding that tuition fees 
have skyrocketed.  We have seen huge increases over the last 10 
years. There is a direct relationship between the pain and debt 
load students are facing in the retreat of public funding as a 
result of a loss of transfers from the federal government to the 
provincial governments.  There is absolutely no escaping the fact 
that the millennium fund cannot make up and does not make up for 
the loss we have experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the other really serious situation that the 
millennium fund creates is that it begins to take us down the 
slippery slope of privatization.  New Democrats are very 
concerned that with this foundation, a private foundation being 
set up which will have representation from corporations in the 
private sector, there will be less and less control of public 
administration and public direction of our post-secondary 
educational facilities. For that reason alone this fund should be 
rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should go back to the drawing board and say that the real 
issue here is to support publicly administered, publicly 
accessible post-secondary educational facilities.  We have 
already seen examples in Canada where the corporate influence on 
a board of governors of universities and colleges and now on this 
millennium fund is beginning to have an impact on the curriculum, 
deregulation of tuition fees and deregulation of programs. All 
these things are creating an environment where there is 
increasing privatization and corporatization of our 
post-secondary educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes that we have to have leadership from the 
federal government.  It needs to be the kind of leadership done 
in co-operation and collaboration with provincial jurisdictions 
to design a national program of national grants that deals with 
different jurisdictions and different provincial contexts where 
there is a clear understanding and a principle that accessibility 
for all students in Canada is a national standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes that this is a starting point of ensuring that 
our post-secondary educational system is protected and 
strengthened and not destroyed as we have seen over the last few 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is only one of two OECD countries that do not have a 
national grants system.  We need to ensure federal funding is 
provided in co-operation with provincial governments to establish 
a national system of grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of British Columbia as well as in the province 
of Quebec leadership has been shown in terms of trying to keep 
education accessible for students even in the face of massive 
cutbacks.  British Columbia is now in the third year of a tuition 
freeze.  This has been very difficult to accomplish, given the 
massive cutbacks it has experienced in transfers from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is calling on the federal government to show the 
necessary leadership. We have heard a lot of rhetoric and concern 
expressed by government members about the levels of student debt. 
There is nothing in this bill that will alleviate the pressure 
and the huge debt load now facing students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go back to the drawing board and state clearly that 
this millennium fund is taking us down the wrong road.  We need a 
national grants system.  We need accessibility.  Most important 
of all, we need restoration of the federal funding for 
post-secondary education in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pride that I contribute to the debate on the merits of 
Bill C-36.  The question in my mind is, on such a basic issue as 
education, a mom and apple pie type issue, what does Reform have 
against students?  It boggles me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider it a privilege to serve as a member of this 
government and as we for the first time in a generation deliver a 
balanced budget speak about an education initiative this 
government has brought forward. What makes me most proud about 
this accomplishment is the fact that it has enabled us to 
introduce perhaps the most progressive program every witnessed in 
this country, the Canada millennium scholarship program, the 
cornerstone of the Canadian opportunities strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government knows there is no better investment in the 
future than future investments in access to post-secondary 
education, knowledge and innovation.  That is why we are creating 
the single largest endowment ever offered by a federal government 
to ensure that a post-secondary education is within reach of 
anyone who wants it.  We are especially targeting those of modest 
means for whom post-secondary education would be beyond their 
grasp.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This $2.5 billion initiative will change the lives and the 
future of Canadians.  It will give Canadians access to the 
knowledge and skills necessary for jobs of the 21st century.  It 
will give up to one million Canadians a chance to thrive in a new 
economy and in a new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no debate.  As we stand here on the threshold of 
the 21st century we must prepare our citizens to think 
innovatively and creatively in a world that is transformed into 
information and technology.  For this very reason increasing 
access to post-secondary education must be a national priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet there are some in this country who suggest it is not the 
Government of Canada's business to ensure higher learning and 
make sure it is accessible and affordable; this despite the fact 
it is now universally recognized that post-secondary education is 
a precondition for full participation in a future economy.  These 
critics overlook the federal government's well established 
history in helping Canadians to pursue advanced studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to funding post-secondary education through Canada's 
health and social transfer we have provided some $4.2 billion in 
financial assistance since 1964 to students in provinces that 
participate in the Canada student loans program. Since that same 
year we have provided $1.4 billion to the two jurisdictions that 
do not participate in the program, namely Quebec and the 
Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a long tradition of awarding scholarships to students 
through various granting councils and programs such as the 
Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the 
Medical Research Council of Canada, and the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council of Canada.  If this legislation is 
adopted we will add an additional $400 million for the next three 
years to the combined budgets of these three councils.  This is 
pretty impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While similar in spirit, the Canada millennium scholarship fund 
is quite unique.  This contribution is Canada's way of 
celebrating the passage into the new millennium.  We are 
observing this extraordinary event not by building monuments but 
by investing in Canadians and preparing them to be the knowledge 
workers in a knowledge economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An equally important reason why the millennium scholarship 
cannot be considered the same as other federal funding for 
post-secondary education is that the endowment fund will be 
managed by an independent organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada millennium scholarship foundation in consultation 
with key stakeholders will decide how to design and deliver 
millennium scholarship funds.  The fund will be administered by a 
board of directors made up of private citizens, at least one of 
whom will be a student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of education as well as the education community 
will play a key role in identifying prospective directors and 
nominating people who have a pulse on the education community. 
Once operational, the foundation will be able to enter into 
agreements with provincial governments and post-secondary 
institutions on some aspects of scholarship eligibility.  In 
addition the Canadian millennium scholarship foundation will be 
expected to minimize administrative costs and overhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our overriding goal is to significantly increase access to 
post-secondary studies everywhere in Canada for low and middle 
income students and to do so in a way that avoids duplication 
with any province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that the 
millennium scholarship complements other types of student 
assistance programs.  Given this flexibility the Government of 
Quebec's decision to break off discussions regarding the 
millennium fund is both puzzling and very frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is deeply dismayed that Quebec has not put the 
interests of young Quebeckers first.  Dismayed but not totally 
surprised.  From the outset the PQ government took a hard line 
putting forward a lopsided proposal that left no room for 
reconciliation.  Despite our repeated efforts to find common 
ground, our provincial counterparts remained intransigent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of Mr. Bouchard's government has not changed.  Mr. 
Bouchard wants to opt out with full compensation.  His government 
has shown no flexibility whatsoever.  It is clear that Mr. 
Bouchard had no intention of negotiating so there is no point in 
returning to the negotiation table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though Premier Bouchard told the Prime Minister last March 
that he recognized the Government of Canada's intention to “make 
a significant concrete and modern contribution to the knowledge 
through scholarships and” acknowledge that this was “a 
legitimate concern”, the Quebec government wants to opt out of 
this program with full compensation. 
This would seriously weaken and undermine the Canadian millennium 
scholarship foundation and the intent for which it is put in 
place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As disappointing as these developments are, we must move forward 
without interfering with Quebec's priorities in the areas of 
education and without penalizing, most importantly, Quebec 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on this side of the House are confident that a solution 
to outstanding issues relating to implementing a foundation can 
be found in the context of the current legislation.  As the Prime 
Minister has already said in the House “We are satisfied that 
the bill gives us the needed flexibility to resolve the situation 
in a reasonable manner”.  Reasonable words from a reasonable 
man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the finance committee decided to extend its 
consideration for Bill C-36 to hear further witnesses is a 
further reflection of that flexibility, but there are practical 
limitations which must be factored into the equation.  If we want 
this program in place by the year 2000 we must adopt the 
legislation as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear my colleagues across the floor commenting “Not until the 
year 2000”.  They speak is if we are in the 1950s or the 1930s. 
The year 2000 is merely 18 months away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is equally important that we not lose sight of the principal 
reason for introducing the millennium scholarships.  Canada's 
success and competitiveness in the next century will depend on 
Canadians being well equipped and well motivated to meet Canada's 
challenges in a knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada millennium scholarships are critical new tools to 
help us prepare Canadians for the challenges and opportunities of 
the 21st century.  As much as they will help equip 100,000 
students each year with the knowledge necessary to function in an 
information society, they will also inspire other youth who may 
be thinking about dropping out or hesitating about going to 
college or university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most significant, these scholarships will heighten 
public awareness and appreciation that a post-secondary education 
is essential in a knowledge based economy.  They will help 
mobilize the entire population behind a clear and strong 
inspiring vision, a collective future in which we all have the 
knowledge and skills we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is determined to lead our society 
toward a future in which all Canadians are empowered to succeed 
in the new economy.  That is why it is so critical that we 
quickly pass Bill C-36.  If Canada is to grow and prosper in the 
21st century we must begin by implementing the federal budget 
today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the very fundamental issue that we are dealing 
with in this very shortened debate that we are going to have 
today is the issue of time allocation.  The Liberals, once again, 
have cut off debate for the 41st time since 1994.  It is 
despicable.  I think there is rising resentment across the 
country due to the fact that there is no democracy in this 
Chamber, the very place that is supposed to be the heart of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government has done this because it has decided that 
it wants a longer summer break.  Perhaps the backbenchers put 
pressure on cabinet and on the Prime Minister to ensure they get 
a long enough time to flip burgers and go to barbecues in their 
ridings.  While that is important work for an MP, no doubt, the 
fact is that the main thrust should be to debate legislation in 
this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this so many times in the past.  When the 
opposition parties start to really get to this government and 
start to hold it accountable on important national issues like 
its complete failure to address the reform of the Young Offenders 
Act or the issue of compensation for all victims of hepatitis C, 
what does this government do?  It runs for cover by invoking time 
allocation, by bringing down closure to cut off debate.  In this 
case what we see is the cutting off of debate on a whole long 
list of amendments to this very important bill.  The Group No. 1 
amendments alone constitute over a dozen motions.  How can these 
types of motions be adequately addressed when debate has been 
limited? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do they want to cut off debate, they are heckling and 
directing inappropriate comments at opposition speakers who stand 
here today wanting to hold this government accountable to the 
people of Canada.  They direct those comments at us to distract 
us from the little time that we are allowed to speak on this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of amendments specifically deals with the millennium 
fund.  I listened in somewhat stony silence as the hon. member 
opposite— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  That is exactly what is between your 
ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, he had his opportunity to 
speak.  Now he is heckling me, trying to throw me off track when 
I am trying to drive home the message to the viewing public that 
there are fallacies contained in his prepared speech that 
probably came out of the minister's office or the Prime 
Minister's office and was handed to him a few minutes before he 
walked into the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stood and read it.  If he really wants to debate the 
millennium fund and how much support it has, then why do we not 
have a debate about that instead of him standing and reading a 
prepared speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the millennium fund is going to be a disgrace. 
It is going to be a failure.  Why?  The reason is simple.  We 
pointed it out during the budget debate.  I am sure the pages 
watching this debate today will be interested in this because, 
once again, what we see is that the Liberal government wants to 
differentiate between Canadians.  It wants to set up two classes, 
just as it has on the hepatitis C issue.  It wants to have two 
classes of victims.  It will compensate some of the people.  The 
government says it is a caring government, that it will 
compensate the post-1986 victims. 
The ones between 1986 and 1990 will be compensated, but the ones 
before will not be compensated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across the way who just spoke was bragging about 
how the millennium fund will help 100,000 students.  Is that not 
great?  But the fact of the matter is that there 1.6 million 
post-secondary students:  400,000 are full time students and the 
rest are part time students.  Do the math.  The students are 
doing the math: 100,000 out of 400,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again this Liberal government wants to differentiate. 
Which will be the lucky quarter of the full time students who 
will get the scholarships?  The government will decide which of 
those young students will get the scholarships.  If they belong 
to the Young Liberals of Canada they might get a scholarship. 
Somehow the government is going to differentiate and decide who 
gets the scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not totally true.  The hon. member who spoke before me 
said that there is going to be one student on the board.  I am 
sure the government can find one Liberal student, but after this 
maybe not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, there is no budget surplus to help Canadians in a 
unified way because of the false accounting practices of this 
government.  That is the fact.  This millennium fund is the 
latest example of that.  The finance minister has put $2.5 
billion into the 1998 budget.  He has built it in, but he has not 
spent the money yet.  The money will be spent down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general on March 18 responded to a threatening 
letter from finance officials by saying “I believe the change 
will open the door for governments to influence reporting results 
by simply announcing intentions in their budgets and then 
deciding what to include in the deficit or surplus after the end 
of the year once preliminary numbers are known”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are very clear.  The government is trying to separate 
students.  It is trying to pit student against student.  Very 
clearly during the last election campaign, and we are nearing the 
first anniversary of this new government since the June 2 
election a year ago, we laid out our plan on how we would help 
all students.  We did not hear anything back then about a 
millennium fund.  This is something that the government has come 
up with to pit student against student.  It will help a quarter 
of them.  What about the other three-quarters who are seeing 
tuition costs rising? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, these students cannot afford huge increases in the 
cost of obtaining their education.  The Liberal government with 
its millennium fund is effectively bringing down a subsidy for 
people like Bill Gates because of the huge brain drain of our 
brightest young students.  They get their education here and end 
up going to work for companies like Microsoft.  The richest man 
in the world is getting a subsidy courtesy of the Liberal 
government because it has refused to address fundamental issues 
like high taxes that drive our young people away from our country 
to seek employment in the United States where taxes are more 
reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a fundamental issue that this government is not 
addressing and the government refuses to address it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was looking 
forward to address this issue, but not under these 
circumstances. Shame on the government for moving time 
allocation. Why? Because this bill makes no sense and it knows 
it. This is obvious in Quebec, where there is a consensus 
against the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has taken a very drastic approach to 
reducing the deficit by cutting transfer payments for health, 
education and welfare. At the same time, by tightening 
eligibility requirements for employment insurance benefits, it 
ensured that the employment insurance fund would grow; it will 
soon contain $19 billion. This is an extremely harsh and severe 
bite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the federal government doing with the bite taken out of 
transfer payments to the provinces, now that it has reached zero 
deficit? 
It has given a $2.5 billion budget to a private sector 
foundation responsible for distributing scholarship cheques, 
with a little maple leaf in the corner and the Prime Minister's 
signature at the bottom I guess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is that, in Quebec, these drastic cuts 
in education have turned universities into institutions where it 
is increasingly difficult to receive quality education, not 
because teachers and students are not doing their best, but 
rather because the conditions they are facing are increasingly 
difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been countless wage cuts, job cuts, student-teacher 
ratio increases, budget cuts for research, labs, while all of 
these are essential to quality education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of having $3,000 scholarships after the year 
2000, when the system itself has been hurt and impaired? It is 
so shameful that there is a consensus in Quebec—which is even 
echoed across the country—that the federal government has no 
business in this area. This is an ill-conceived project. The 
government must give back to Quebec the money earmarked for 
education, so that the province can help students pursue their 
education through its own loans and scholarships program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal initiative makes no sense. It is despicable and 
shameful, as well as wasteful. In this day and age, it is 
unacceptable to waste money in education just to satisfy the 
Prime Minister's vanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I so convinced that it is a waste? For a reason that I 
will try to make clear. 
Under the legislation, scholarships will be awarded based on 
merit to help the best students, not those who most need the 
money so they can become successful, but those who are the best 
students and are also in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the policy that was developed in Quebec over the 
years. It is not even the policy that was developed in the other 
provinces and applied by the federal government, but this is 
another issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we chose a system that help students in need who, of 
course, also make the grade. What does a needs-based system mean? 
It means that a completely different structure will have to be 
built. Criteria will have to be set for each subject, to 
determine who are the best students, how many there are and how 
to go about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A burdensome bureaucracy will have to be put in place. Even 
though it is a private foundation, it will be burdensome and 
bureaucratic, because there is no other way to determine who are 
the best students. Even the system currently in place in Quebec 
would become a lot more burdensome and would have to undergo 
major changes if it were to use criteria based on merit, in 
addition to those based on needs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is not designed for that, nor are the universities or 
the student loan system.  This is wasteful.  It means that 
every dollar of the $2.5 billion, and of the portion to which 
Quebec is entitled but has no certainty of getting anyway, will 
not go to student aid.   This is totally scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals, who made such slashes to welfare, health and 
education, and have padded the employment insurance fund, are 
patting themselves on the back that this hard earned money will 
go, not to education, but to stroke the ego of the Prime 
Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Canadian Millennium Scholarship Foundation is unacceptable 
in every way. 
What an image it gives of federalism. A few days before the 
referendum, our Prime Minister said he would take Quebec's needs 
into account.  What an image. What discouragement about today's 
federalism, if the division of power under the Constitution 
makes it so hard for the central government to perform its 
functions that it must also assume the functions of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not content with the way things are, not satisfied, so it 
decides to see that the provinces' educational systems follow 
the line it sets.  Come now, this makes no sense because when it 
comes to getting the best use of funds, each level of government 
has its responsibilities and must exercise them.  In other 
words, I repeat, it would require one more bureaucracy—and this 
is already happening, as people have been hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What recourse will students or universities have? None at all. 
How will Quebec be sure of having its share?  It will not. 
Public money and officials will be administered by a private 
foundation under criteria that it will set for itself according 
to the very broad principles in the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned, I note in passing, about the following in the 
bill: “The appointment of directors shall be made so as to 
ensure that (<I>a</I>) the Board is knowledgeable about post-secondary 
education”, that should go without saying, “and learning in 
Canada and the needs of the Canadian economy; and (<I>b</I>) the 
directors are drawn from the various regions of Canada.” 
University scholarships awarded on the basis of merit must not 
be given out according to the state of the Canadian economy, but 
according to the needs of the individual societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did we in Quebec choose to have an assistance plan based on 
need and to ensure access to university to just about everyone 
with the ability?  Because we think merit is encouraged by the 
conditions of use and not because scholarships are given out on 
the basis of merit.  I think that the results indicate that we 
in Quebec made the right choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the federal government is dismantling and derailing a system 
that worked well.  It is doing so in two ways.  First it 
dangerously underfunded it and now it has just introduced new 
factors for which it will be spending money that would be 
infinitely better spent where it should rightly go.  That is, to 
the educational system, to assistance and as loans and 
scholarships to needy students.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when it 
brought down its budget last February, the government once again 
demonstrated its lack of respect for the institutions and 
mechanisms developed by the people of Quebec during the quiet 
revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating millennium scholarships, the Liberal government is 
once again poking its nose into a jurisdiction that belongs 
exclusively to Quebec, in this case education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather ironic to see the Prime Minister of Canada trying 
to sell the Canadian Constitution to Quebeckers and to 
Canadians, when his own government is not even able to respect 
it. 
Section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, recognizes Quebec's 
exclusive jurisdiction over education, and the millennium fund 
is an unprecedented intrusion into this area of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1964, the government of Lester B. Pearson suggested making 
interest-free loans available to Canadian students.  When this 
federal education subsidy was opposed by Jean Lesage, a Liberal, 
the Pearson government then wisely declared that, if a province 
preferred to stick with its own loans program, it would be 
entitled to equivalent compensation.  So said a Liberal.  The 
government of the day had tried unsuccessfully to interfere in 
the area of education.  The right to opt out of student 
financial assistance programs with compensation has existed 
since 1964. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Liberal government be as fair a player in 1998? 
Knowing that paragraphs 29(1) and 25(2) of Bill C-36 are designed 
to block the transfer to the Government of Quebec of its fair 
share for opting out of the millennium fund, one could have 
one's doubts.  In order to have access to the program, Quebec 
will have to embark on a series of long and pointless 
negotiations in a field where it has already proven itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, in order to deny Quebec its right to opt out with 
compensation, the federal government has decided to create a 
foundation outside regular federal programs.  The federal 
government's imperialist attitude is beyond all understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why interfere in Quebec's loans and bursaries program when it is 
the most advanced in Canada?  Quebec has built up an effective 
and vigorous loans and bursaries program that is the envy of 
students in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, just when the federal government has reduced its deficit to 
zero, is the Minister of Finance rushing to create additional 
federal-provincial duplication and again wasting taxpayers' 
money?  Now that it again has money to spend, the federal 
government is spending it in provincial jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is Missing Children Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This special day is an opportunity to educate Canadians about 
what they can do to protect their children from becoming the 
victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also an opportunity for all Canadians to recognize the 
outstanding work of law enforcement agencies and other partners 
in finding missing children. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

children's registry in partnership with Revenue Canada's 
international project return, the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade and the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration has helped to search for, locate and return missing 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 alone customs and immigration assisted in the safe 
recovery of 111 children at the border, a 28% increase from 1996.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, programs from Moncton to Hawaii to Michigan all 
demonstrate that early intervention programs improve parenting 
skills, healthy babies, and reduce substance abuse and crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have shown a reduction of 50% in crime, 40% in teen 
pregnancies, less dependence on welfare and a much more 
productive life for these individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are going to vote on Motion No. 261, a motion which 
calls for a national head start program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to win the battle against crime, teen pregnancies, 
fetal alcohol syndrome and provide our children with the tools to 
become functional members in an increasingly hostile world, a 
head start program will do just that.  It will give parents the 
tools to enable their children to grow up in an environment free 
of rancour and abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far five provinces and territories are on side.  I implore 
the House to vote for Motion No. 261 to work together with the 
provinces and build a stronger, secure and safe environment for 
all our children.

grieving over their loss, the Missing Children Society of

Through this simple act we show the families of the missing that 
they are not forgotten.  We shine the lights, expressing our hope 
that some of these children will find their way home.

exceptional beauty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the quiet revolution, the Fleur de Lys 
became the symbol of Quebec's distinctiveness and desire to 
achieve self-determination. Today, Quebeckers of all political

community open to the world and that continues, as the Council 
of Europe pointed out, to be an example to follow in the 
treatment of minorities.

compensate those victims we are going to have to compensate those 
who got hepatitis C from dirty needles.  This is not about

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the following question of the government. Is 
it not true that the Prime Minister gave one instruction and one

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it was this government that put the deal in place.  It was this 
government that involved the provincial and territorial 
governments in making the deal. Until the Prime Minister and this 
government initiated the process every health minister in the 
country was refusing to talk about compensating those with 
hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The instructions of the Prime Minister and the position of this 
government are that the interests of the hepatitis C victims

as recently as an hour ago I asked that very question of

Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we invited the caucus colleague of the leader of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Krever recommended that the federal government “retain 
the duty and authority to make decisions about products to be 
distributed in Canada”.  Yet this government has gutted the 
health protection branch to the point where the safety of blood

learned nothing from the hepatitis C tragedy?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think we are going to have them over to the department again 
and take them through the facts one more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that for the first time, Health Canada under this 
government is requiring all foreign blood product manufacturers 
to sell their product through a licensed Canadian importer. We 
put new and stringent requirements in place. The product referred 
to by the member meets health and safety standards both in the

<Question No. 38—<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the procurement of new maritime helicopters for 
the Department of National Defence, (<I>a</I>) how much will it cost 
to procure replacement helicopters for both the shipborne Sea 
King helicopters and the Labrador search and rescue helicopters; 
(<I>b</I>) what is the total cost of maintaining the Labrador and Sea 
king helicopters an extra six to ten years beyond the time they 
were to have been replaced under the EH-101 contract; (<I>c</I>) what 
was the total compensation paid to suppliers of the EH-101; and 
(<I>d</I>) what was the cost to the department of National Defence to 
operate the project management office for the procurement of the 
EH-101 helicopters? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
(a) The total project budget for the Canadian search and rescue 
helicopter, Labrador replacement, includes: a maximum of $593 
million to E.H. Industries; plus approximately $200 million in 
government costs for project management, training, spare parts, 
integrated logistics support, and a small contingency allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The estimated cost for the replacement of the Sea Kings will not 
be known until the government approves a Sea King replacement 
project. The final cost will be known when the government 
announces its decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The annual steady state cost of supporting the Labradors is 
$36.4 M, current year 1997-98 dollars, and the cost of supporting 
the Sea Kings is $79.4 M, current year 1997-98 dollars. These 
costs include personnel, spares, modifications and engineering 
but not infrastructure costs such as base facilities and 
services. It should be noted that new helicopters will also 
have an annual steady state support cost.  The delivery delay 
between the first delivery of a search and rescue SAR configured 
helicopter from the cancelled new shipborne aircraft new search 
and rescue helicopter project, and the first delivery of a 
helicopter from the current Canadian SAR helicopter project is 
approximately 12 months.  The delay associated with the delivery 
of the new maritime helicopter is unknown since the project has 
not been approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The total compensation paid to suppliers of the EH-101 is 
detailed in the Public Works and Government Services Canada and 
E.H. Industries Limited joint news released dated January 23, 
1996 which follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The cost to the Department of National Defence to operate 
the project management office during the implementation phase for 
the procurement of the EH-101 helicopters was $15.5M in 1993-94 
dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Settlement reached with E.H. Industries for EH-101 helicopter 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa—The Government of Canada and E.H. Industries Ltd., a 
company jointly, owned by Westland Helicopters Ltd. and Agusta Spa, have 
negotiated a settlement agreement for E.H. Industries' claim 
arising from the cancellation of the $5.8 billion EH-101 
helicopter program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The details of the agreement, reached in October 1995, were 
announced jointly today by the Honourable David Dingwall, Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services and Enrico Striano, 
Managing Director, E.H. Industries Ltd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Negotiating this settlement has been a long process and I am 
pleased that the Crown and E.H. Industries have reached this 
mutually satisfactory agreement,” the Minister said.  “It is 
fair to say that the Government of Canada has closed the books on 
the EH-101 helicopter program.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcement of this agreement was delayed pending the 
conclusion of negotiations between E.H. Industries and its 
subcontractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a promise outlined in the Government's Red Book, the 
contract with E.H. Industries for the supply of helicopters, 
valued at $1.45 billion (1992 dollars) was terminated in November 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The settlement agreement with E.H. Industries totals $157.8 
million.  This includes $136.6 million for the cost of work 
completed prior to termination and work in progress at the time 
of termination, and $21.2 million for termination costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total termination costs include a $68 million settlement 
reached earlier with Loral, the project's other prime contractor 
and the $21.2 million settlement with E.H. Industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government allocated $250 million in 1994-95 Main Estimates 
for termination costs of which only $89.2 million has been 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that the approach to settlement was undertaken in a 
fair and reasonable manner and to provide an independent and 
commercial perspective on various issues, the Crown enlisted the 
services of an independent consulting firm, Lindquist, Avey, 
Macdonald, Baskerville Inc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding for this consulting contract was provided in the 
February 1995 federal budget and is therefore built into the 
existing fiscal framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Striano, expressing satisfaction with the final settlement 
stated, “Although we regret the loss of this contract, I am 
pleased we have been able to close the matter with the Crown to 
our mutual satisfaction and now look forward to future 
opportunities for our products in Canada.”

certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on 
February 24, 1998, as reported (with amendment) by the

<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
January 1994 throne speech, the federal government, which was 
faced with an unprecedented deficit, committed to clarifying the 
role of the federal government with respect to the other levels 
of government in order to eliminate duplication and overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not make better use of proven education structures within 
the provinces rather than creating more?  As Minister Landry told 
<I>Le Devoir</I> last February 25, Quebec “will again be 
penalized... by endless discussions and mechanisms of all 
kinds.... 
This is not the way a system that respects the various levels of 
government operates”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government forgotten that, in the February 1996 throne 
speech, in response to the referendum, it made the promise to no 
longer make use of the federal government's spending power to 
create programs in areas under provincial jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the federal government not acknowledge all of Quebec's 
accomplishments in education over the past 30 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is a leader in the area of education in Canada.  To the 
people of Quebec, education represents a vital tool for 
cultural, economic and social development.  What is more, 
education is the cornerstone of any society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to its lack of political logic, and the creation of the 
millennium fund, the federal government has managed to create 
consensus in Quebec.  All those consulted, who are involved in 
the education field, are opposed to Bill C-36.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will have once again shown its complete 
ignorance of the Quebec reality. It is not the first time a 
consensus is achieved in Quebec against any federal interference 
in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that, in May 1991, in a motion passed in the 
National Assembly, Liberal and PQ members unanimously condemned 
the federal government's unacceptable urge to interfere further 
in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of Canada is doing his best to and will go 
down in history as the first government leader to so bluntly and 
obviously interfere in the provincial jurisdiction that is 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Government of Quebec has made itself quite clear: 
any additional funding for education must be directed to the 
Government of Quebec, which will redistribute it according to 
its own priorities. Any other form of funding will be considered 
as interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will be known as the founding father of the 
millennium scholarships: a fine waste of public funds and a 
rather unoriginal way for the current government to send 
students in Quebec cheques with the Canadian maple leaf on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no logical and rational reason to create yet another 
scholarship system in Canada. Instead, the government should 
improve the system already in place in Quebec. It seems obvious 
to us that Ottawa's only motivation for establishing the 
millennium scholarships is to raise its profile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the purpose of these scholarships is visibility at the 
expense of efficiency. 
The Prime Minister has said so himself.  These scholarships run 
counter to Quebec's practice of entitling all students desiring 
to further their studies to financial assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to their criteria, the millennium scholarships will 
help only about a third of low and middle income students.  In 
addition, they are only a medium term solution, as they will 
become available only in the year 2000.  It will therefore be of 
absolutely no assistance to those currently completing their 
studies with a significant debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that the millennium scholarships will be 
given out not only according to need but also on the basis of 
merit.  Linking the subsistence of disadvantaged students to 
their academic performance is unconscionable. 
The scholarships fall short of the expectations of student 
associations because assistance is not based solely on need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the millennium fund focused its assistance on the most 
needy students, the Government of Quebec also administers merit 
scholarships.  Regardless of the name given these scholarships, 
Quebec will no doubt most effectively manage the new money.

counterpart: “Quebec will not be told what approach to take with

veritable outcry of protest, not only from sovereignists, as the 
Prime Minister of Canada had hoped, but also from all those with 
any sort of interest in Quebec's education system.

told the federal government that while C-36 is good for Canada 
it is not good for Quebec.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK228">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-36, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 24, 1998, as reported (without amendment) from the 
committee; and of Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, every Canadian needs and deserves an equal chance to 
live up to his or her full potential.  I am in favour of the 
legislation establishing the millennium scholarship foundation 
because it will help Canadians reach their goals.  In so doing it 
will also play a part in helping our country live up to its full 
potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No nation can rely solely on its resources in the ground for 
economic growth.  In today's global economy and in the growing 
knowledge economy of the future the key to economic success is 
the development of our human resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply we need to have a highly skilled, highly adaptable 
and highly motivated workforce if we are to continue to prosper 
into the next century and beyond.  The new reality for every 
Canadian is that getting and keeping a job in the growing 
knowledge economy demands ever higher levels of learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know the result is that not everyone has the financial 
means to take advantage of the learning opportunities that are 
out there.  It is certainly true that the Canada student loans 
program and provincial student programs have helped millions of 
young people over the years including myself.  Indeed without 
these essential supports many thousands of low and middle income 
young people would not have been able to participate at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even so, today far too many people are facing enormous student 
debt burden upon graduation.  Too many others are simply not 
going on to post-secondary institutions because the costs are 
just too high.  We all recognize that the problem has become 
progressively worse and that there is a need to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November a national all stakeholders working session on 
Canada student loans brought students, teachers, administrators, 
federal and provincial governments, lenders, colleges and 
universities together to reach consensus on student assistance 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the 
Status of Persons with Disabilities undertook an extensive study 
of the issue.  It consulted Canadians across the country and the 
report it tabled last December made 16 specific recommendations 
for change.  At its meeting last December the Prime Minister and 
the premiers made a commitment to work together to reduce student 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, in response to these recommendations and 
discussions the Minister of Finance outlined the Canadian 
opportunities strategy in the budget of last February, a strategy 
that directly reflects the sentiments and the directions offered 
by many Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT47"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT47"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a seven-part strategy that puts the following measures 
into place: to help graduates manage growing debt; to give 
Canadians access to the financing required to upgrade their 
skills throughout their careers; to help families pay for their 
children's education; to help graduate and post-graduate students 
continue to develop their skills and carry out research that 
benefits the whole country; to help young people make the 
transition from school to work; to help connect Canadians to the 
information age technology; and to greatly improve access to 
learning by helping students in financial need cope with the 
increasing cost of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time remaining I would like to concentrate my remarks on 
the last point, in particular the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation.  The endowment that the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation will manage is the largest single investment ever made 
by the federal government in support of access to post-secondary 
education for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with what the Prime Minister said in the House when he 
announced this initiative last fall.  There can be no greater 
millennium project for Canada and no better role for government 
than to help young Canadians prepare for the knowledge based 
society of the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10 year endowment of $2.5 billion will provide over 100,000 
scholarships to low and middle income students every year for the 
next decade.  The scholarships will be available to young and 
old, to full time and part time students.  Students in 
universities as well as students in community colleges, 
technology institutes and other post-secondary education systems 
will all be eligible.  That is over one million new scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a million new scholarships devoted to equalizing 
access to learning is a fitting way to commemorate the next 
millennium, a millennium in which all societies will look more 
and more to the knowledge, skills and creative intelligence of 
their people for growth and prosperity.  Contrary to the 
assertions of some people, the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation does not intrude into a provincial area of 
jurisdiction.  Quite the opposite.  It will help more people 
benefit from the educational opportunities provided by provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can understand our deep disappointment when the 
Government of Quebec chose to break off the discussions on the 
Canada millennium scholarships.  Our government demonstrated much 
flexibility during negotiations with the Government of Quebec to 
ensure the alignment of a new foundation with the Quebec system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing new in our desire to help people help 
themselves.  Since Confederation the federal government has 
helped people improve their education.  Following the second 
world war for example, thousands of returning soldiers benefited 
from grants to help them upgrade their skills and rejoin the 
peacetime economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in addition to the Canada student loans, several billion 
dollars each year are transferred to the provincial governments 
in Canada health and social transfers to help fund post-secondary 
education, social assistance and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe as do most Canadians that all governments have a role 
to play in providing everyone with an opportunity to improve 
themselves, an opportunity for a better life for themselves and 
for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Government of Quebec would accept the principle of the 
millennium scholarships for what it really is, namely an ad hoc 
and unique contribution to help young people access opportunities 
in the new economy, it would be proud to be associated with this 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government can rest assured that the foundation will 
be able to build on the existing needs assessment processes and 
complement provincial efforts to provide accessible, affordable 
post-secondary education to all its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation will have nothing at all to do with determining 
curricula, setting tuition levels or managing educational 
institutions.  Those are questions for the provincial governments 
and the institutions themselves.  That has been clear from the 
very beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister has said in the House, we are satisfied 
that this bill gives us the needed flexibility to resolve the 
situation in a reasonable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent foundation will manage the fund.  It will not be 
run by government but by private citizens.  Among other things, 
this fund will also facilitate a greater degree of student 
mobility, allowing students the opportunity to complete all or 
part of their studies in different parts of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With it we are marking a unique event in the history of our 
country, a passage into the new millennium.  At the same time we 
are also improving the prospects of all Canadian students by 
giving them a better chance at starting the next millennium with 
the skills and knowledge they will need to become full and 
contributing members of this economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I believe that every Canadian deserves the chance to live 
up to his or her full potential.  I believe that this legislation 
will help them do just that.  I sincerely hope that all hon. 
members of the House will give it their enthusiastic support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be here today to take part in the debate 
on the Group No. 1 amendments to Bill C-36, the budget 
implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure Canadians will be pleased to know that once again we 
are being pushed to limit the debate on this important topic by 
the time allocation motion that the government has introduced to 
the House.  Many speakers who were planning to take part in this 
debate will now be prevented from doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was happy to speak on this bill at second reading.  At that 
time the millennium scholarship foundation was one of the hottest 
issues of the budget.  It has now been three months since the 
federal government announced its budget and the $2 billion legacy 
to our current Prime Minister, also known as the millennium 
scholarship fund, is still a hotly debated issue particularly in 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From day one the government was criticized for entering into an 
area of provincial jurisdiction, especially by the province of 
Quebec.  The government was strongly criticized not only by 
members of the official opposition but by parliament's watchdog, 
the auditor general, whose job is to keep an eye on the 
government's questionable accounting methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend some time on this issue because this is an 
important issue which needs to have some emphasis.  As a member 
of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts I am well aware of 
the work of the auditor general.  As I have stated on several 
occasions not only in committee but here in this place as well, I 
hold the Office of the Auditor General in the highest esteem for 
the integrity, perseverance and determination to see that value 
is received from every dollar that the government spends.  It is 
largely because of the work of the Office of the Auditor General 
that the government has worked toward cleaning up its act in the 
spending of the hard-earned tax dollars of Canadians. I am sorry 
to say there is still a long way to go in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has shown Canadians all too frequently that if 
given the opportunity it loves to tax Canadians to the very hilt 
while providing them with useless programs having little if any 
tangible benefit.  As I speak on this issue I am reminded of the 
distribution of $15 million to $20 million worth of flags. I 
would like to know what tangible benefit that had to the economic 
well-being of Canadians.  Some of these programs do not provide 
Canadians with good value for their money, something on which as 
a member of the public accounts committee, as a member of 
parliament and perhaps most of all, as a Canadian taxpayer I work 
to hold the government accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has criticized the finance minister for his 
accounting practices in previous budgets and has gone so far as 
to offer a qualified opinion on last year's budget.  It is 
obvious by this qualified opinion that the government is not 
producing a transparent picture of the nation's finances. The 
year before, the auditor general also questioned the manner in 
which the government crafted its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to know and have a right to know and have a clear 
picture of the financial situation of this government, how it 
intends to spend the money and not have those numbers fudged by 
moving figures from one year to another. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has responded by saying that the government 
has to evolve and change as events change.  However as the 
auditor general has reminded the government time and again, the 
finance minister does not have the liberty to make the rules up 
as he goes along for his own political purposes.  The federal 
government blatantly ignored standard budget guidelines and tried 
to brush off legitimate criticism by changing the rules for its 
own political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the same line of reasoning in the hepatitis C 
debate that this government is doing what is best and right.  We 
all know how the general Canadian public feels about the 
government's idea of what is best and right in the hepatitis C 
debate.  Here also in the budget what is best and right falls far 
short of the standards set up in the general rules of accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 1 deals largely with the millennium scholarship fund. 
I am happy to support many of the amendments in this group.  I 
would like to spend some of my time talking about the amendments 
proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions proposed by the Bloc Quebecois delete all the 
clauses which establish the millennium scholarship foundation. As 
I mentioned earlier, those in Quebec have made it perfectly clear 
to the federal government that they do not want the federal 
government intruding in matters of provincial jurisdiction.  The 
Quebec government is also worried that this will detrimentally 
affect its system of grants and loans.  I can sympathize with 
Quebec's complaint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also assure the government that there is a growing chorus 
of dissatisfaction from British Columbians. This growing chorus 
must not be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every province has experienced similar problems.  As the 
government has waged its war on the deficit, it did not cut out 
inefficiencies in many government departments and eliminate 
needless grants and programs; rather it cut transfer payments to 
the provinces.  Now that the federal government is continuing to 
meddle in provincial affairs instead of restoring transfers, 
after the millennium fund is spent many students will not benefit 
from it.  The provinces however will still be responsible for all 
these students, even though they lack the money that should be 
theirs to fulfil this responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts to the transfer payments to the provinces over the past few 
years were brutal and swift.  That was money the provinces needed 
and counted on to ensure that their people would receive adequate 
programming in areas such as health and education. We have 
clearly seen the effects of the federal government's approach to 
balancing the books in the province of British Columbia. 
Services have been dramatically reduced due to the reduction of 
these federal payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 67 speaks specifically to the provinces being able to 
opt out of the millennium scholarship fund and to enter into an 
agreement where the foundation pays the province the amount that 
would have been spent in a particular province allowing the 
province to use these funds for their own purposes.  This would 
help the provinces make up for some of the lost funds from the 
cuts to these transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before my time is finished, I would like to touch on several 
other motions which touch on the accountability issues 
surrounding this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 66 from the fifth political party, the Progressive 
Conservatives, would make the millennium scholarship foundation 
subject to the Access to Information Act.  This would be a great 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians demand that the government provide them with value for 
their money. Having federal departments and programs subject to 
Canadians having access to information explaining how each 
department spends its tax dollars in essence makes it more 
accountable to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on several of the amendments put forth 
by the Progressive Conservative Party which deal with the 
appointment of an auditor for the foundation. Motion No. 56 would 
have the auditor general be that auditor of the foundation, 
something which I wholeheartedly support.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the office of the auditor general has 
done a splendid job in evaluating how various departments and 
programs operate and, in cases where value for money is not 
achieved, the office of the auditor general can present that 
program or department with several options on how to improve its 
operations.  That evaluation would surely benefit the operation 
and spending of the millennium scholarship foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government Motions Nos. 55, 57 and 58 are a different story. 
They give all the power of appointing and terminating the auditor 
of the foundation to the government.  Motion No. 55 allows the 
government to appoint the auditor of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulties we have with Bill C-36 are headlined in the 
last <I>Hill Times</I>.  The headline reads “The decline of the 
Canadian Parliament and the escalating deterioration of public 
information and debate in Canada's Parliament”.  This is a 
serious issue that cuts through this debate and the bill that is 
presented here. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join my Bloc Quebecois colleagues who have spoken on 
Bill C-36, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 24, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are primarily dealing with the motions relating to the 
millennium scholarships. More than 40 of these motions were 
tabled by the hon. member for Québec and their overall objective 
is to eliminate the millennium scholarship foundation from Bill 
C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, the Bloc Quebecois is echoing the consensus reached 
among all the Quebec stakeholders who appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Finance and who unanimously condemned 
these scholarships and asked for withdrawal with full 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather difficult to understand the policies of this 
government. After adopting a resolution recognizing the distinct 
character of Quebec society, the Chrétien government is now 
trying to get involved in education, which is a vital component 
in the development of a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for us in the Bloc Quebecois, we know that the flexibility of 
Canadian federalism is nothing but a myth and that what the 
government gives with one hand, it takes back with the other 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships show the true face of federalism as 
a centralizing, if not levelling, force. 
The Chrétien government really does not understand anything 
about Quebeckers' aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member knows she 
must refer to members by using their titles, not their names. I 
hope she will comply with the standing orders in this regard. 
The hon. member for Jonquière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Liberal members from Quebec either do 
not have the Prime Minister's attention or are insensitive to 
their constituents' needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind my colleagues opposite that all the witnesses from 
Quebec who appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance 
were in favour of a withdrawal with full compensation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 14 groups and individuals from the education community came 
to express their disagreement with the Prime Minister's idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put in perspective the outcry caused by this Liberal 
initiative, it is interesting to note that 41% of the witnesses 
who appeared before the standing parliamentary committee to 
express their views on the millennium scholarships were from 
Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, the federal government continues to turn a deaf ear and 
is not proposing any amendments to Bill C-36. The comments made 
by those witnesses from Quebec were very clear to those who 
understand French, one of the two official languages of this 
great country that is Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Coalition des ex-leaders étudiants québécois 
eloquently said that with its millennium scholarships, the 
federal government is proving its ignorance and its incompetence 
in the area of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the president of the Fédération des cégeps, he said just 
as eloquently that Bill C-36 does not take into account what 
Quebec has accomplished over the last 30 years in the area of 
financial assistance to students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder if the government that concocted these 
infamous scholarships lives on the same planet as we do. How 
many times, since Quebec joined the federation, have Quebeckers 
of all parties condemned duplication and overlap between federal 
and provincial programs? Today, with the millennium 
scholarships, the federal government is trying once again to 
invade Quebec's education system by competing directly with the 
province's loans and scholarships program. Has the federal 
government even looked at the needs of Quebeckers in this area? 
Certainly not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After making drastic cuts in transfers to the provinces and 
threatening the balance in Quebec's education system, the 
federal government comes up with a wall to wall solution that 
simply does not suit Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the task force on funding for Quebec universities 
concluded that previous cuts were the main reason for the 
increase in the number of students per classroom and in 
lecturers' workload and for the decrease in the number of 
teaching assistants. These choices led to a decrease in the 
overall supervision of students, which is directly related to 
the quality of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinion of Mrs. Boileau, of the Fédération nationale des 
enseignantes et des enseignants du Québec, a member of the CSN, 
is totally in sync with the suggestion of the Bloc Quebecois to 
opt out of part I of Bill C-36. She said that the only way out is 
for the federal government to give back to the provinces what it 
has cut from the transfers, not to hand out millennium 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As several people said before, Quebec has proven its ability in 
the loans and scholarships area. The way it manages its program 
is quite innovative. 
More needs to be done in order to ensure equal access to 
university studies for young Quebeckers. However, the 
implementation of a parallel system will not help to improve the 
system we now have in Quebec, especially since eligibility for 
the millennium scholarships will be based on an elitist 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, Quebec's loans and scholarships program focuses on 
the needs of students, to promote greater accessibility and 
equal opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to enhance our current system, not create more 
duplication that would only further distort the Quebec loans and 
scholarships program. I therefore urge my colleagues in this 
House to listen to the 1.2 million Quebecers who, through their 
associations, expressed their views on the millennium 
scholarships to the Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like them, and on their behalf, we ask members for nothing 
less than the right to opt out with full financial compensation, 
so that we can spend the money according to the needs and 
realities of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today to discuss this bill which will 
actually implement some of the items that were announced in the 
budget. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT52"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT52"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to members opposite earlier today, in particular 
those of the Reform Party, as they ranted about the fact that the 
government passed time allocation to get some of these items 
through.  Yet time allocation has been used three months almost 
to the day after the budget was introduced.  The budget was 
brought down by our finance minister on February 24.  Here we are 
on May 25 dealing with this bill that will implement the policies 
that were announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite shake their heads as if they do not understand. 
Why do they think we have to bring in time allocation?  This bill 
is part of the government's policy and program.  If they had 
their way they would simply delay and obstruct.  They would 
simply be negative.  I do not hear anything positive coming from 
over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand what members opposite have against a 
scholarship fund being established to help students go to school. 
Explain that to me.  What do they have against students and 
higher education?  What do they have against allowing all 
Canadians to have continuing education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP members chirping from left wing would wipe out all 
tuition.  They would say that everything is free, that life is 
just a bowl of cherries.  They have their heads in the clouds. 
They have no idea of the fiscal realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill shows that for the first time in over 40 years we have 
a government that is fiscally responsible.  We have a government 
that has balanced the books in spite of the ranting from the 
left.  We have a government that has eliminated the deficit and 
has finally put this country on the route to financial 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that will help to build a prosperous Canada is 
access to education.  Yet I hear members talk against greater 
access to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know about opposition politics.  I spent five years opposing 
an NDP government in Ontario.  I understand that it is 
fundamentally the opposition's job to be negative.  It is 
difficult to get up every morning, to look in the mirror and to 
ask “How can I be negative today?”  But they do it.  It is 
their job.  Although I did hear the member for Burnaby—Douglas 
congratulate our fisheries minister in question period today for 
his latest decision on coho salmon.  It took a lot of courage for 
him to do that and I congratulate the member for Burnaby—Douglas 
for his courage to stand and make a positive statement.  In the 
one year I have been in this place that is the first time I have 
heard an opposition member make a positive, constructive 
statement about something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot tell me that every bill and policy that this 
government or any government proposes is without merit.  It is 
simply not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  They go on about the millennium fund. 
Should it come as a surprise?  Let us take a look at our 
electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian electorate sent a majority government here.  They 
said “Fundamentally we like what you stand for.  We like the 
proposals on how the budget will be balanced and on how the 
surplus will be dealt with.  We think it makes sense”.  They 
sent us here.  So we introduced a budget.  We introduced a 
historic millennium scholarship fund of $2.5 billion to help 
young people.  On average it will mean $3,000 per year per 
student.  It will not only be based on merit, it will be based on 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognized that these young people needed help so we 
introduced measures to help with debt repayment which are 
unprecedented.  There will be tax relief for interest on all 
student loans. 
Why would you be opposed to that?  It is unbelievable.  It is 
unthinkable.  It is outrageous.  Phone your constituents. Members 
of the Reform Party always say they are to vote this way unless 
their constituents call and tell them to vote a different way. 
Phone them on this one. I think you will find by and large, they 
will support it.  Check with them.  Maybe just maybe, you might 
change your position.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interest relief extended to more graduates.  We are not talking 
about holus-bolus elimination of all tuition as the NDP in its 
somewhat myopic and naive view of the world would do.  “Just 
wipe out the cost.  Taxpayers will take care of everything. There 
is nothing to worry about.  It is okay”. In the world of 
socialism, they are totally out to lunch on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then on the other extreme, an extended repayment period for 
those who need it. Imagine that the Reform Party is against that. 
Of course the Reform Party's solution and the right wing 
solution to all of this is simply to reduce taxes. They have no 
concern whatsoever for those young people who are struggling 
through school whose last concern is how much they are paying in 
taxes. Their concern is how they can afford their post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe very strongly that the millennium scholarship fund 
will not solve all the problems but it will sure go a long way 
toward helping people have better access, more affordable access 
to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of examples in the world.  The Republic of 
Ireland is one of the most dynamic successful economies in Europe 
with much of it coming I would admit from EU financing.  Why are 
people interested in investing in the Republic of Ireland? It is 
not only because of the historic peace agreement but they have 
been doing it for years in the Republic of Ireland because of the 
quality of the training and the education of the young people in 
that country.  It actually is a model we should look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear members from the Bloc stand up and say 
that we are interfering in provincial jurisdiction.  They are the 
same people who stand up and whine and complain because the 
government will not give them more money, will not give them more 
authority, will not give them more autonomy, will not allow them 
to separate and destroy this country.  They got that right. We 
are not going to let them do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this plan does is it allows for co-operation with the 
provincial governments.  It allows for co-operation.  It actually 
allows for money from the $2.5 billion to be invested and to grow 
and the interest to be used.  It allows for endowments to come 
from the private sector and that can increase the amount of money 
available.  There would be a lot of interest in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the agreements the University of Waterloo has entered 
into in the Kitchener—Waterloo community.  Members opposite 
should look at how the university community works well with the 
private sector.  Why?  Because it has an interest.  It wants to 
turn out good quality graduates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite really should take a serious look at the future 
and the need to help our young people increase their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We are doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  You are doing it because you want to 
give it away in the NDP.  They want to jack up the prices, cut 
the taxes, help the wealthy.  That is all they want.  They are 
absolutely off base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is balanced.  This is good government policy.  It is 
receiptable and it is going to help build a great dynamic country 
for your children and mine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank you for rescuing the member opposite who, near as I can 
tell, did not take a breath for almost 10 minutes.  It was an 
impressive sight. It is like the old saying when a preacher 
dropped his notes and someone said when you are unsure of what 
you are saying, just speak louder and maybe someone will believe 
it. 
I think the hon. member opposite was probably a case in point. 
Lots of volume, lots of rhetoric, no facts and I am not sure he 
is even convinced of his position. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT54"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT54"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1605

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the budget implementation act it is a shame we cannot 
question one another during this period. It would be so much fun 
to debate with a member who relies so much on rhetoric and so 
little on facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, why has the bill taken so long to come to the House 
of Commons?  And why now is there time allocation? Every single 
bill that is brought into the House is brought in by the 
government as it sees fit.  If it does not want to bring the bill 
in until June, then it will run shy of time before the summer 
holidays.  It has had three months in which to run the bill, 
every day since the budget announcement if it had wanted to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill and the budget have been botched in several ways right 
from the word go.  On the grouping we are talking about on the 
millennium fund the minister appointed the person in charge of 
the millennium fund before the legislation was passed in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine something this big.  As the member opposite has said, 
this thing is practically as big as sliced bread.  It is almost 
as miraculous as getting the milk inside the Caramilk bar.  It is 
so huge it is practically a memorial fund for the Prime Minister 
in years to come.  It is such a big thing you would think the 
legislation would come before the House to be debated. Once it 
was debated the minister would move ahead and enact the 
legislation as it was passed.  But no, the Minister of Finance 
chose to appoint the person in charge of the millennium fund 
before parliament had a look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform raised that in the House.  We have this funny little 
quirk on this side of the House. We think that perhaps democracy 
in parliament should have a say in things, not just ministerial 
departments.  The member set an alarming trend on behalf of the 
government and an alarming tendency to ignore parliament to 
legislatively put the cart before the horse.  That was the first 
mistake on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second mistake is in the budget itself in its entirety. The 
focus of the budget was that the government could probably 
continue to tax Canadians at this rate.  Canadians are long 
suffering and fairly patient.  They are not prone to dementia. 
Perhaps the government could continue to tax Canadians at a rate 
that would make most sane people cringe and business people cry 
and they will just put up with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what happened.  The budget continued the time 
honoured tradition of Liberal parliamentarians that the only good 
taxpayer is a well taxed taxpayer.  With this bill we continue to 
have the highest personal income taxes in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today during question period there was a little bit of a 
kerfuffle and a point of order to straighten out the facts by the 
Deputy Prime Minister who was trying to decide whether Italy was 
the fifth biggest economy in the world and Canada was seventh, or 
was it the other way around.  What he did not get into regardless 
of which way it was, and of course Canada is the seventh, is that 
we have the distinction of being number one when it comes to 
personal tax levels in the G-7.  We get taxed higher than anybody 
else, including Italy and the Americans.  That side of the House 
just cannot seem to understand that it affects people's business 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just heard talk a minute ago about Ireland and some other 
bright spots in the world for investment.  Business people look 
at the education levels.  They look at the political stability. 
They look at lots of things.  One of the factors they also look 
at is the tax rate in the economy they are going to build their 
business in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You only have to come out to British Columbia.  Even within a 
small jurisdiction like Canada we can see with a high tax rate 
like that in British Columbia, which is a provincial problem, 
that the people in British Columbia are voting with their feet 
and are moving to Alberta to start up new businesses there.  I 
can tell a litany of sad business stories of people from my 
riding, including people in the farming community who have given 
up on the high taxes in British Columbia and have moved to 
Alberta where there are the lowest taxes overall in Canada. 
There is no PST and Alberta has the lowest income taxes.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes were botched right from the start. The attitude was that 
there was no tax relief needed for Canadians because after all, 
they can take it.  They have not revolted.  There is no rioting 
in the streets, so let them get by on what they are getting by on 
and we will just continue to spend the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has long been my belief and the belief of the Reform Party 
that what taxation means at the federal level is the government 
takes our money, deducts 50% for handling and then gives it back 
to us in services we never asked for and it generally goes to the 
people who did not deserve it or want it to begin with. But the 
government makes sure that everyone is taxed. It is almost 
biblical in nature in that all must go to be taxed. It has been 
going on for a long time.  The Liberal government has perfected 
it. The Liberals never met a taxpayer they did not like. They 
make sure that taxpayers are well fleeced so that they feel as 
lucky as any other Canadian I guess because they are treated 
equally that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unfortunate because dollars left in the hands of people 
in the community, in the hands of homemakers, in the hands of 
business people and students now and in the future are dollars 
that are more likely to be well spent than when the government 
gets its sticky little fingers on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a previous speech about the tax system in Canada I mentioned 
the long chain of books that the tax collector, the hon. Minister 
of Finance has lying out behind him, the long catalogue of 
thousands of pages of tax laws, income tax increments and the 
broken promises of Christmas past, present and future.  It kind 
of streams out behind him like a dead weight on the economy and 
forever must be pulled around like a chain while saying “Woe is 
me and woe is you because this thing is going to drag us down”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if some of the tax burden was relieved from people. 
Imagine if some of that weight was taken off their shoulders. 
Imagine as we discuss this millennium fund if students had the 
prospect that as they earned money they would be able to keep 
more of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not have to make a lot of money to start paying a 
lot of taxes in this country.  I met with someone on Sunday who 
goes to the same church as I do.  This fellow is in his 
mid-fifties, has been on and off social assistance and has held 
down a steady job for the last couple of years.  He is working at 
a machine shop doing clean up and basic chores around the place. 
He makes $17,000 a year which is his total income.  He said 
“What is it about our tax system that I have to send $3,000 a 
year to Ottawa?  What gives in a system that taxes me, a $17,000 
a year guy, and asks me to send money to Ottawa so they can take 
it, deduct 50% for handling and give it out to other people who 
get the services and are just a selected few?” I did not have an 
answer for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could point out the following.  On the millennium fund, who 
does not want to see our children educated?  My goodness sake, I 
have four of them at college age.  I would love to see them all 
educated with somebody else's tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it this millennium fund is going to affect 7 out of 100 
students?  And this is going to turn the world on its ear. A 
student who happens to be one of the seven blessed, a student who 
happens to be chosen will be a happy camper. But for the other 93 
students, what are their prospects? Their prospects are to 
continue to pay GST, continue to pay income tax, continue to pay 
road taxes, tariffs, fees, customs duties, hidden user fees. 
Those students will continue to pay all of that and the 
government will take their money and give it to the 7 out of the 
100 who will receive a benefit. The other 93 will pay and the 7 
will receive a benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is the way it should be.  There would be a 
lot more students with a lot more smiles on their faces, 93 at 
least, saying “Thank you, Mr. Minister, for reducing my taxes. 
Thank you for reducing my debt load. Thank you for giving me some 
prospect for hope for the future”.

<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, many 
members spoke to Bill C-36, a bill aimed at setting up a $2.5 
billion millennium scholarship fund to help students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot has been said about this bill. As far as I am concerned it 
clearly shows that Canada is a failure as a country because, 
with Bill C-36, the government is trying once again to interfere 
in education, which comes under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's history proves that education is critical to Quebec's 
survival. It is at the heart of Quebec's plan for the future. If 
Canada had learned to respect Quebec, the federal government 
would not be pushing pieces of legislation such as Bill C-36. 
Since Duplessis and Lesage, Quebec premiers have been fighting 
to preserve the integrity of Quebec's jurisdiction over 
education. It is essential that Canada recognize the importance 
of education for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that throughout history one of the ways Canada has been 
trying to assimilate francophones has been to attack the 
education system. This is what every province outside Quebec has 
done. They challenged the use and teaching of French, thus 
speeding up assimilation. This is one of the reasons why today 
the assimilation rate is 40% in Ontario and up to 70 % in the 
western provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, just out of respect for Quebec, proposed 
legislation like Bill C-36, which interferes in a field as 
important to Quebec's future as education, should not even be 
introduced. 
One can see, once again, from this bill, that motions that are 
moved in the House to recognize Quebec's distinctiveness are not 
respected. A motion was moved shortly after the last referendum 
to have Quebec's distinctiveness recognized and it was passed in 
the House. But the government introduced Bill C-36, which ignores 
Quebec's uniqueness or distinctiveness yet again. It is to be 
expected that the Calgary declaration will not change much 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, as long as the government introduces legislation such as 
Bill C-36, which heaps scorn on something that is central to what 
Quebec represents, this will only be a further gesture, somewhat 
like what Pierre Elliott Trudeau did in 1982 with the 
constitution in an attempt, which succeeded, to reduce the 
powers of Quebec's national assembly in the area of education. 
It is since the Constitution Act of 1982 was passed that we have 
experienced so many constitutional problems in Canada. Since 
1982, we have had a great number of commissions and some 
referendums in Canada to talk about national unity, and English 
Canada did not learn its lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government comes back, once again, with Bill C-36, which is a 
small copy, so to speak, of the bad gesture made by Mr. Trudeau 
at the time. However, the current Prime Minister probably wants 
to make the same kind of gesture, that is compromise the 
integrity of Quebec's powers in the area of education. In fact, 
this is what is being done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is against better education in Canada. We heard the 
hogwash of Liberal members who told the House that a stand 
against Bill C-36 is a stand against better education. 
Naturally, that is sheer nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want students to benefit from this $2.5 billion. Of course we 
do, but we would rather have the funds paid directly to the 
provinces, which would administer them. Our loans and grants 
system in Quebec is one of the best if not the best system in 
Canada today. The debt load of students in Quebec is one of the 
smallest in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need another federally appointed agency to come to 
solve problems we do not have in Quebec. We want Quebec to get 
back its share of the $2.5 billion, but not this way, not funds 
managed by individuals appointed by the Prime Minister, no doubt 
friends of the party, 12 directors who will sit in private, 
behind closed doors, manage the funds and distribute them as 
they see fit, without being accountable in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, the federal government will be putting money in the 
hands of a private agency that will not be accountable to 
elected representatives. That is contrary to democratic 
principles. After all, why appoint 12 commissioners or board 
members to manage these funds when each province in Canada 
already has a ministry of education managing education funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does this bill dismiss the existing system in Quebec, 
but it shows once again that Canada does not understand a thing 
about the problems in Quebec and Canada. Once again, the 
Constitution is flouted. We know full well that this private 
agency appointed by the Liberal government will be duplicating 
services currently provided by the ministry of education in 
Quebec and the other provinces. This is a blatant case of 
duplication, which entails extra costs of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for example the millennium office to be set up in Ottawa in 
preparation for the year 2000 celebrations. It is estimated that 
the administration costs for managing the $166 million earmarked 
for celebrating Canada and the millennium in the year 2000 will 
amount to 10% of the total budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean, with respect to the $2.5 billion budget for 
the millennium scholarships? 
Does it mean that $250 million will be spent on managing these 
scholarships and not on those who should benefit from it, the 
students? Does it mean that new jobs will be created for the 
friends of the Liberal government? Are we creating a $250 
million slush fund for the friends of the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the right to wonder, because there is no real need for 
these millennium scholarships. They will not necessarily help 
the students, because if we really wanted to help our students, 
we would give the money directly to the provinces, which would 
be a good thing. It would reduce the administration costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who benefits from these millennium scholarships? It is pretty 
obvious that the Prime Minister of Canada is trying to create 
something to be remembered by, and in a rather arrogant way, 
too.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to Bill-36, the Budget Implementation 
Act, which is a culmination of the Minister of Finance's budget 
that he tabled back in February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of issues about the budget which I would like 
to discuss.  Number one, of course, is that the minister 
announced a balanced budget.  However, there was actually a 
surplus of $2.5 billion, because the minister charged $2.5 
billion to this fiscal year to set up his millennium scholarship 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception to the way he has been doing his accounting. 
The auditor general pointed out the previous year that the 
finance minister had made an $800 million charge for an 
expenditure that had not been made.  I would have thought the 
Minister of Finance would have listened to the Auditor General of 
Canada who is the watchdog for all Canadians.  He ensures that 
the books of the Government of Canada are clear and prepared in a 
manner consistent with normal accounting practices and that they 
do not contain misleading information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has unilaterally decided to change the 
accounting policies of the Government of Canada to allow him to 
make a charge when he decides to make an announcement regarding a 
new program, and in this particular case $2.5 billion for the 
millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that we have taken $2.5 billion out of the books for 
the year ending March 31, 1998 and have set the money aside.  We 
have not spent the money.  We have not even set it aside at this 
point in time.  But the Minister of Finance has made this 
expenditure or charge on the financial statements with the idea 
that after the turn of the millennium, which is closer to the 
next election, the government is going to have $2.5 billion to 
spread around to young people in our country who will benefit by 
having assistance with tuition and education expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Reformers have never had a problem helping kids to get their 
education, but we do have a problem with this sleight of hand 
type of accounting that is being proposed by the Minister of 
Finance and being condemned by the Auditor General of Canada who 
says this cannot be the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that for the second time in a row the Minister of 
Finance should listen to the auditor general, rather than 
thumbing his nose at the auditor general, because we need to have 
integrity in our financial statements.  We need to have integrity 
in our government.  Surely, if there is no integrity in the 
financial statements being prepared by the government, then the 
government loses its integrity, and that is not in anybody's best 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Minister of Finance will take the auditor general's 
serious criticisms to heart, that he will recognize the error of 
his ways and will ensure that our financial statements are 
prepared in a manner that is acceptable to the Auditor General of 
Canada.  That way not only Canadians but international investors 
can have faith in our financial statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have a balanced budget, we must remember that we still 
have a debt of almost $600 billion, which is $20,000 for every 
man, woman and child in Canada. That debt is being funded and 
financed by overseas investors, bankers and so on who look at our 
financial statement and if they find that it is qualified by the 
auditor general then we may end up having to pay higher interest 
rates on that debt.  That is also not to anybody's benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to laud the government for achieving a balanced budget. 
With prodding by the Reform Party it has finally got itself 
there.  We take exception to the fact, however, that it got there 
by increasing revenues from taxation rather than by cutting 
expenditures and bringing the government down to a more 
appropriate size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance fund now has a surplus of almost $20 
billion, which is far in excess of any surplus it has ever had 
before.  It is ten times larger than any surplus it ever had 
before.  The government has taxed employment and jobs to balance 
the budget rather than cut the size of government.  Taxing jobs 
seems to be a backward way of trying to achieve economic growth 
so that the government can get its finances in order while 
everybody else has to pay through the nose and find out that 
their personal budgets are being squeezed to pay for extra taxes 
to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That tax revenue comes with a potential price.  We have now had 
seven years of economic expansion.  We know economic expansions 
come to an end.  When that happens, government expenditures go up 
by increased unemployment insurance premiums, reduced taxation 
revenues, additional welfare costs and all other government 
costs.  Since we have relied on increased revenues to balance the 
budget, we run the risk of slipping back into a deficit if 
economic activity slows down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend the Minister of Finance was in Kananaskis, Alberta, 
to enjoy the fine scenery and accommodation of my part of the 
world.  He was at the APEC conference, the Asia Pacific Economic 
Council, dealing with economic issues in the far east. Things are 
not as rosy over there as perhaps they could be or even should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are glad to see the resignation of President Suharto. However 
we have some doubts about his successor who may follow in the 
same vein.  There is an economic crisis there that is already 
impacting on the province of British Columbia.  Alan Greenspan, 
the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, said over the weekend 
that the impact of the economic slowdown in Asia could have a 
small but not negligible impact on North American economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read in the <I>Financial Post</I> today that the Bank of Tokyo 
Mitsubishi reported a loss of $10 billion.  When banks start to 
lose $10 billion we should begin to take a look at what is going 
on in financial markets.  Therefore I point out to the Minister 
of Finance and to all Liberals that although they may have a 
balanced budget today, it may not be as rosy as it could be or 
should be if they had taken this opportune time to cut government 
when the economy was chugging along quite nicely. When the 
economy turns downward is no time to squeeze Canadians with fewer 
and fewer services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be very cautious and careful about 
spending any money it has or any surpluses it has.  It should 
still be vigorous in its efforts to root out waste.  I publish a 
waste report periodically.  I brought one out last week with all 
the different grants.  For example, we gave some money to 
somebody to study dress in 19th century Istanbul.  I wonder what 
benefit that is to Canadians.

had spent $3,500 a month to store furniture, but when we looked 
at the furniture being stored we found it was only worth $1,000. 
We have idiotic expenditures right across government.  We have 
waste, mismanagement and incompetence in many areas.  It requires 
accountability.  It requires to be rooted out, and that is what 
the government has failed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we next see a Budget Implementation Act for which the 
government is asking the approval of the House to implement the 
recommendations of the Minister of Finance, I would find it very 
difficult to do so based on the fact that they have not put their 
own fiscal house in order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Charlotte, hepatitis C; the hon. member for 
Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, employment insurance reform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
unfortunate, but I am not delighted to rise today in this House 
to speak to Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It implements certain provisions in the latest budget of the 
Minister of Finance including the Canada Millennium Scholarship 
Foundation.  I will return to this a little later in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps you would allow me right off to put all the nonsense in 
the latest budget into perspective.  The government opposite is 
continuously heaping praise on the Minister of Finance for his 
work in balancing the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get things clear from the start.  There is no question of 
congratulating a government so irresponsible about the job it 
has to do as to have others do it, namely the provinces.  This, 
in my opinion and that of the Bloc, makes the entire budget 
operation totally unacceptable.  The federal government achieved 
its zero deficit by scandalously dumping its financial 
obligations and responsibilities into the yards of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To eliminate its deficit, the Liberal government has cut 
annually, since 1994, $7.2 billion in transfers to the 
provinces, which represents 52% of all the federal government's 
spending cuts.  In its two terms, the government opposite will 
literally have chopped $42 billion in social transfer payments 
to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the federal government promised, through its finance 
minister, to cut departmental expenditures by 19% over three 
years. 
Once again, it did not do its homework, since it cut only 9%, 
proving yet again that nearly all efforts to improve government 
finances came from elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this year's budget neglects to say, and the public must be 
aware of this, is that there will be an additional $30 billion 
in cuts by 2003 to the health, education and social assistance 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an idea of the size of the cuts, for Quebec alone, 
between 1993 and 2003, a cumulative total of $13 billion will be 
cut from the budget for transfers to Quebec.  It is not for 
nothing that the Quebec minister of state for the economy and 
finance, Bernard Landry, told the federal government that its 
federalism was “predatory and abusive”. 
I will add “irresponsible, centralizing and creating poverty” to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we examine the effects of these cuts in the daily lives of 
people in Quebec and Canada, we will see they are totally 
devastating.  We must keep in mind that, when the Liberals took 
office in 1993, 61% of the unemployed were eligible for 
employment insurance benefits.  Now, five years later, fewer 
than 40% of them are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest employment insurance report states in black and white 
that young workers are the age group most affected by this drop 
in eligibility.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is most objectionable about the employment insurance 
situation is the surplus accumulated in the fund, which is up to 
about $14 billion at this point.  It is expected to hit $25 
billion by the year 2000. Imagine what could be done with all 
that dormant money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, the Bloc Quebecois has been shouting itself hoarse 
about the budget cuts being made at the expense of the 
disadvantaged in our society, and here is proof of it.  I would 
describe these budget practices as fraudulent and a real theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is therefore attuned to the problems of the 
population, unlike the government over there, which keeps its 
head buried in the sand. 
Proof of this is the number of occasions we have begged the 
federal government to stop using the employment insurance fund 
to balance its books.  The Bloc has always maintained that these 
funds are there to support the unemployed and to help get them 
back into the work force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Bloc Quebecois, with the backing of the labour 
movement, businessmen and the general public, has fought 
constantly to get the federal government to substantially cut 
workers' and employers' EI contribution rates, which are 
currently far too high and hamper job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has picked up on the signals coming from the 
public by proposing concrete and practical measures including a 
$3 billion overall reduction in contributions, which represents 
an additional cut of about 35 cents in the contribution rate. 
Compared to the present rate of $2.70, the planned drop to $2.60 
by the year 2000, or a mere 10 cents, will have no significant 
impact on job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the unprecedented room to manoeuvre it has in the 
current budget, the government opposite chose to do nothing to 
stimulate job creation. No tax reform geared to job creation, no 
special budget measure to improve the fate of thousands of 
unemployed Quebeckers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, when it comes to job creation this budget is a 
failure. And yet the unemployment rate is stuck at around 9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of creating jobs, the government prefers to create new 
programs resulting in more duplication and interference in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction, such as the Canada Millennium 
Scholarship Foundation, and keeps on doing what it knows best, 
namely how to spend somebody else's money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is the hasty purchase of submarines to the tune 
of $750 million, a real bargain. After cutting billions of 
dollars from social transfer in the areas of health, education 
and welfare, the federal government is investing in youth and 
job creation by purchasing armament. These are the real 
priorities of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine what we could do with the $750 million it sunk into 
ships. 
I am asking the members opposite: Why not invest this money to 
feed the 1.4 million poor children we have in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one child out of five. Imagine all this money to help 
the five million Canadians who are living below the poverty 
line, which is 17.4% of this country's population. These are the 
priorities of the government across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason people in Quebec and Canada have been getting 
poorer since this government came to power is probably the $30 
billion more they have to pay in taxes to the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to help stop this hemorrhage, the Bloc Quebecois asked 
the finance minister and other ministers to stop creating new 
programs. 
But of course, he did not listen and set up new programs 
including the millennium scholarships, a cornerstone of Bill 
C-36. This $2.5 billion fund, which will only come into force in 
the year 2000, is an unprecedented and blatant intrusion into an 
area of provincial jurisdiction, education.

years, we have had in Quebec the most comprehensive loans and 
scholarships plan in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federalists, sovereignists and the education circles in Quebec 
have voiced strong opposition to this federal visibility 
campaign. This program does not in any way meet the needs of 
Quebec and its quite distinct education system. That is why 
Quebec rejects this program and wants to opt out with full 
financial compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a whimsical demand. It is part of a rational effort 
aimed specifically at meeting the immediate needs of the 
education system in Quebec and compensating for the $10 billion 
in federal cuts to transfers for education, with Quebec's share 
of these cuts amounting to $3 billion between 1993 and 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is outright hypocrisy. But students and the general public 
in Quebec will not be fooled. They know very well that these 
scholarships are a blatant effort to win the support of students 
in Quebec and in Canada. But sooner or later, the government 
will pay for these serious mistakes. Quebekers will understand 
once and for all that the only way out of this federal quagmire 
is Quebec sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to debate Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by expressing my regret that debate on this bill has 
been limited by the government's time allocation motion.  I 
understand this is the fourth time in this parliament alone that 
closure or time allocation has been implemented.  It was done on 
Bill C-2 regarding the Canada pension plan, on Bill C-4 with 
respect to the Canadian Wheat Board, on Bill C-19, the Canadian 
Labour Code amendments which we dealt with before parliament 
broke, and now twice on Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new trend.  The Liberal government, the very same 
party when it was on this side of the House criticized the 
Mulroney government for its habit of invoking closure and time 
allocation, has done so 41 times since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know you have a particular concern for 
parliamentary reform and helped chair a committee dealing with 
reforms to ensure that the closure and time allocation powers of 
government were not abused as they were in parliaments previous 
to 1993.  It is regretful, and I say this as a new member, that 
the government has failed to restrain its excessive use of what 
really should be a very rare lever to limit debate in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is parliament.  The purpose of this place is to deliberate 
on legislation brought forward by the government.  It is not to 
rubber stamp legislation brought forward by the bureaucracy or 
the executive branch.  It is to deliberate, to debate, to amend, 
to consider, to ensure that those who pay the bills for the 
legislation we pass have their concerns fully and exhaustively 
expressed with respect to every single piece of legislation, 
particularly pieces of legislation like Bill C-36 which have such 
an enormous impact on the fiscal and economic condition of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to this place expecting frustration as a member, knowing 
this parliamentary system is dysfunctional, knowing the way it 
has been abused by successive governments, that serious 
substantive debate and deliberation on legislation of this nature 
happens all too rarely.  Even my low expectations as a close 
observer of this place and a keen observer of parliamentary 
history have not been met.  My low expectations for democratic 
deliberation have been exceeded by the government's autocratic 
abuse of the sledge hammer of debate known as time allocation and 
closure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn my comments to the substance of the bill.  The part we 
are dealing with today deals with the establishment of the Canada 
millennium scholarship foundation.  It is a quaint convention in 
democratic countries such as Canada that governments seek consent 
from the voters in an election before they embark on major new 
program initiatives. That is what the concept of a democratic 
mandate is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I review the election literature distributed by candidates 
of the Liberal Party in the federal election conducted a year ago 
I fail to find any mention of the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation. There are all the usual bromides in that election 
literature about how the government is committed the future of 
young people, to education and so forth, but nowhere did I find 
this commitment to spend billions of tax dollars which would 
otherwise be used for tax relief and debt reduction on what 
amounts to a huge political advertisement project for this 
outgoing Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By invoking closure with this bill not only has the government 
run roughshod over democratic conventions of parliament by 
failing to seek a mandate from voters, not only has it 
disrespected a longstanding convention in our system that one 
needs a democratic mandate to proceed with major spending 
programs, it has also run roughshod over the principles of sound, 
transparent public accounting as articulated by the auditor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear. Bill C-36, by establishing the Canada 
millennium scholarship fund in this year for a public expenditure 
which will not be made for at least two fiscal years into the 
future, breaks every single rule and convention of clear, 
transparent and principled public accounting.  That is not my 
view as a member of the opposition.  It is not the view of 
partisans.  It is the view of the non-partisan authority 
appointed by this place to review and comment on the accuracy of 
the public accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general in talking about the change in reporting the 
millennium fund in the current fiscal year as opposed to the year 
in which it will actually be expended said: “I believe the 
change will open the door for governments to influence reported 
results by simply announcing intentions in their budgets and then 
deciding what to include in the deficit or surplus after the end 
of the year once preliminary numbers are known”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say in a letter: “Indeed it is not possible to 
use the contingency reserve for new policy initiatives unless 
parliament has approved them and the amount is included in the 
main or supplementary estimates. In effect, unless parliament has 
voiced its approval neither a program nor an expenditure can 
exist”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely clear what the auditor general told parliament 
and told this government.  It does not have the legislative 
authority to expend the money in two years but to book it on this 
year's budget.  As somebody who has watched public finances very 
closely for a very long time, this is probably the most notorious 
instance of a government's cooking the books and misleading the 
public about how public money is actually being spent that I have 
ever witnessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial governments over the past several years have made 
great strides in improving the transparency of their public 
accounts.  I refer to the Government of Alberta which conducted 
an exhaustive review of what had become very problematic public 
accounts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 Premier Ralph Klein commissioned an independent review 
of the entire public accounts and budgetary practices by a panel 
of experts.  That government adopted almost every single 
recommendation of the independent panel, almost every 
recommendation of its auditor general, and every recommendation 
of the chartered accountants of Alberta to reform the way the 
public accounts are presented and to bring them into compliance 
with generally accepted public sector accounting practices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Government of B.C., famous for its shell games with 
public finances, had an independent commission on public 
accounts.  But the federal government really seems to believe 
that it can just design the books any way it wants and 
essentially mislead the Canadian public about how its money is 
being spent.  That is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the Liberals doing with this $2.5 billion?  They are 
creating the Prime Minister's millennium memorial fund. They have 
decided, in a country with 17% youth unemployment, to say we will 
help as a federal government to further subsidize your higher 
education but we are not going to give you an environment where 
you can work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, my brother went to a Canadian law school with a 
subsidized post-secondary program. It would be further subsidized 
by the Canadian millennium scholarship fund. Because of the taxes 
imposed by this and previous governments, he and tens of 
thousands of other talented Canadian trained young people have 
gone abroad where they can find better economic opportunities 
afforded by lower tax regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will vote against this bill to stand up for democracy.  We 
will vote against time allocation, as we did this morning, and we 
will vote for tax relief to give younger Canadians the real 
economic opportunities they need and deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to this important bill and to the group of motions we 
have introduced, which consist essentially in deleting any 
reference to the existence of millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we introducing this group of motions?  Our reason is a 
good one.  We are doing so because, with these millennium 
scholarships, the federal government is poking its nose into 
other people's business.  During the three weeks of hearings 
held by the Standing Committee on Finance, 14 Quebec 
organizations appeared, all saying the same thing, which was 
that the federal government has no business interfering in an 
area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
According to the very Constitution that these people claim to be 
defending, the federal government does not have the right to 
interfere and the organizations are asking for the right to opt 
out with full compensation for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who appeared before the committee did so on behalf of 
organizations as important as the FTQ, the CSN, and university 
and college student groups.  A group of former student movement 
leaders who presided over the reform in the education sector 
over the last eleven years came to deliver essentially seven 
messages to the committee, and more particularly to the federal 
government.  The first of these messages is that, with these 
millennium scholarships, the federal government is revealing its 
complete lack of familiarity with Quebec's reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government is demonstrating its bad faith.  If 
it had wanted to do the right thing, it would have amended the 
Canada Student Loans Act. 
We know that all that was needed was to add the scholarships to 
that legislation and it would have possible to opt out with full 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first point is this government's bad faith.  My second is 
this.  The negotiations under way could have been given a 
chance, without this rush to pass a bill that, as we know, does 
not give the foundation authority to allow a province to opt out 
with full compensation if it so wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is obvious, the Prime Minister said so himself, that 
the government needed to be visible.  It therefore introduced a 
bill that does not allow opting out with full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board of directors will not have the power to delegate to 
the provinces. 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois will be speaking to Bill C-36 
today, and it is not in favour because the millennium 
scholarships do not reflect the reality of Quebec and of 
Quebeckers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty one per cent of the witnesses heard. This means the 
committee heard 1.2 million people through their associations. 
It means 80,000 owners of small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the business world, including the Conseil du 
patronat du Québec, the Quebec chamber of commerce and the 
Quebec and Canadian association of manufacturers et exporters 
came and told the committee that Quebec should be allowed to 
manage its education sector, and that opting out with full 
compensation should be allowed, so that the money could be used 
based on Quebec's needs and realities. This is very 
disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several student associations from outside Quebec came to tell 
the government to listen to Quebec. They said the federal 
government should, for once, listen to Quebec's demands. 
I attended a few meetings with various representatives, 
associations officials and witnesses, and I can tell you that 
several witnesses realized that the government was acting in bad 
faith on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consensus in Quebec included stakeholders from the education 
sector and union representatives, but polls were also conducted. 
In one of them, 71% of the respondents were more supportive of 
the Canada social transfer. People said it had been very 
difficult for them to go through the period of austerity created 
by the cuts, and they felt that, perhaps, the surpluses were not 
being managed properly, since the government was giving $2.5 
billion to a private foundation which, as we know, will have a 
rather wide mandate. I do not think we should expect a great 
deal of transparency from that foundation, and I am very 
disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I ask the consent of this House to postpone 
consideration of this bill until we have seen the outcome of the 
negotiations between Quebec and Ottawa. 
Why not defer consideration of the bill? Mr. Speaker, I am 
urging you to ask if the House would agree to defer 
consideration of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is acting in bad faith. We sovereignists know 
that many Quebeckers are not acting in bad faith, because they 
still had hopes that the federal system would undergo a reform. 
The millennium foundation, because it arrogantly encroaches on 
the rights of the provinces, has shown the true colours of the 
federal government. We hope that many Quebeckers who did not yet 
realize it will now understand that federalism—regardless of 
which party is in office—cannot be reformed. This government 
showed incredible contempt for Quebeckers when it thought that 
this would go through smoothly and that Quebeckers would quietly 
put up with it, because it is a monetary issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to top it all off, two weeks ago the three main employer 
associations in Quebec, the Conseil du patronat, the Quebec 
chamber of commerce and the Association des manufacturiers et 
des exportateurs du Québec testified before the committee. 
These are not exactly sovereignist people.  The representatives 
of these three associations came to tell the government to stop 
the study of the bill until negotiations were complete.  If an 
agreement is reached, it will be included in the law.  If none 
is reached, the government will assume its responsibility and 
the opposition its.  But there will be no pretence of democracy 
as is being imposed on us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc has presented motions to eliminate 
everything to do with the foundation from this bill. 
Quebec will never allow the government to tromp all over a 
system it has developed, which is the best in the world.  We 
will never let it happen.  We will ensure it does it by gagging 
us at every stage, otherwise this bill will never be passed.

Speaker, it is a privilege again to be able to make some remarks 
on Bill C-36, the Budget Implementation Act, and specifically on 
the amendment with respect to the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four problems the government has created for itself, 
to a large degree, with the bill.  Canadians need to know about 
these problems and need to recognize that the government has not 
handled the issue well at all. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the problems.  The first problem is the whole business 
of the design of the fund.  Not only was it designed in such a 
way that it contravenes a lot of the jurisdictional realties of 
our country but it also causes some heightened interprovincial 
tensions quite unnecessarily.  The second problem is with the 
accounting that was used to fund this initiative. The third 
problem was the trouble we ran into with the legislation and then 
closure being put into place to cut off debate and ramming the 
legislation through, which is a typical Liberal tactic that is 
becoming more typical as time goes on. The fourth problem is that 
the legislation does not go very far in addressing the problems 
of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to touch on each of these problems a bit. With 
respect to the design of the fund, the government after it took 
office slashed funding by 35% to 40% to the provinces for 
programs like post-secondary education.  It wasted the money that 
was to go to the provinces to keep post-secondary education 
services available to our citizens.  That was the first act in 
this drama. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second act in the drama began in February with the budget. 
The 1995 budget was the family budget, the child poverty budget. 
Liberals like to have a theme or a cause.  They like to be able 
to say they care about something.  The theme of the last budget 
before this one was poor children.  There was much violin playing 
about poor children, mostly poor because of the terrible fiscal 
policies of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme of the last budget was education.  Students were to be 
helped.  If we listened to government speakers we could hear them 
going on and on about the value of education and how wonderful it 
was that we looked after our children and their training, et 
cetera.  There was no mention of the fact that the Liberals had 
slashed education funding just shortly before this wonderful 
education budget.  That was all forgotten, but this budget was to 
do something for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are over one million students in the country, many of whom 
are in retraining or upgrading because the economy is changing. 
Yet this so-called program only helps 7% of all people who are 
trying desperately to gain the educational and training skills 
they need to compete in the emergent economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the millennium scholarship fund has all the earmarks of 
a grand gesture by the Prime Minister.  This was the Prime 
Minister's legacy.  This was a memorial to the Prime Minister's 
generosity toward students and concern for youth.  The fact of 
the matter was that the concern was kind of newborn.  It came 
after the slashing of funding to post-secondary education.  Now 
we are to wear education on our heart and the Prime Minister is 
to have a millennium scholarship fund for only 7% of our 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those 7% who get scholarships will find it taxed.  They will 
give part of it back to the federal government.  Their families 
may actually give a whole lot more back to the federal government 
if the student who qualifies for a scholarship loses dependant 
status in the context of the family tax structure.  Here we have 
a few students getting a scholarship who will be taxed on the 
scholarship which may rearrange the family tax status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are the students to be given the gift of a scholarship by 
the federal government?  If the track record of the Liberal 
government holds true, the scholarships will be largely targeted 
as rewards to good and faithful Liberals and Liberal supporters 
and those who the Liberals want to court.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is too unkind to say that this is how the 
Liberals have operated in a whole range of areas and how they are 
very likely to continue to operate.  It will be a nice slush fund 
for Liberals to be able to help other good and deserving Liberals 
for political purposes.  That is a genuine concern of the 
opposition in this whole matter.  It also disrespects provincial 
jurisdiction in the area of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution says that the provinces have control over the 
delivery of post-secondary education services, but the federal 
government as usual feels it knows best.  Did the federal 
government go to the education minister of Manitoba?  Did it go 
to the education minister of New Brunswick and say that due to 
thrift and good management, and maybe due to heavier taxation, it 
has some extra money to spend on education?  Did it ask how 
someone responsible for delivering educational services in the 
provinces on the post-secondary level feel the money should be 
spent?  Did the government do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is no.  There was not a word said to the provincial 
ministers responsible for these services.  The federal government 
just decided it would spend $2.5 billion on this grand gesture to 
show that the Prime Minister was a fine fellow who cares about 
youth and students.  That was the flavour of the day.  The 
government must have done some polling to show that people were 
worried about education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of the millennium scholarship fund was the way it 
was put on the government books.  The government said it was to 
spend the money and therefore deduct it right now from its cash 
flow.  It was not to be spent until the year 2000 but it was to 
be deducted from cash on hand, from the revenue stream right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about this point for a minute.  Suppose a farmer in 
Saskatchewan says his tractor is getting worn out but thinks it 
will do for a couple of more seasons.  In the spring of 2000 he 
plans to buy a new tractor but he wants to deduct that capital 
expense now because he has already made up his mind that he will 
spend the money.  What happens if he tries to count it as an 
expenditure in 1998? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think of the response of Revenue Canada to the farmer who 
intends to spend the money in the year 2000 and would like to use 
it a capital expense today.  The farmer would get a horse laugh 
from the government or the revenue department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about a business person who intends to upgrade facilities 
or any person who intends to make a tax deductible expense in the 
future and tries to claim it today?  That would never be allowed, 
but the government thinks it is not subject to those reasonable 
rules of accounting and is cooking the books to hide a surplus so 
that at the end of the day it can make even more spending 
announcements close to an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see you are cutting me off, Mr. Speaker, and rightly so since 
my time is up.  The government uses closure and cutting off 
debate so that these badly designed measures can be rammed 
through.  It is a shame.  It is a disrespect of parliament.  I 
ask the House not to support the measures the government is 
trying to push through.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the Liberal government wanted to show some goodwill, it 
would have respected Quebec's jurisdiction in the area of 
education by amending the Canada Student Loans Act to include 
scholarships. This would have allowed Quebec to exercise its 
right to withdraw with full compensation, as it is currently 
entitled to do under the Canada Student Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is specifically designed not to allow a province to 
withdraw with full compensation. 
Ottawa puts its need for visibility before the needs expressed 
unanimously by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 30 years, Quebec has had its own loans and 
scholarships system that is infinitely more sophisticated than 
that of any other province. The entire education community in 
Quebec is opposed to this plan. The only way to avoid 
duplication is to recognize the consensus that exists in Quebec 
and give the Quebec government the right to withdraw with full 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at history since it shows clearly the federal 
government's bad habit of wanting to interfere in the area of 
education. In 1953, the Liberal federal government of Louis 
Saint-Laurent tried to subsidize Canadian universities through 
the National Conference of Canadian Universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government of Maurice Duplessis killed the federal 
plan. 
It opposed the federal government, which wanted to replace with 
federal subsidies some financial powers that were essential to 
provinces and, thus, intrude into education, which was an area 
of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1957, in <I>L'Action nationale</I>, Mr. Trudeau wrote, on 
page 438, and I quote: “Consequently, if a government has such 
an overabundance of revenues that it undertakes to provide for a 
part of the common good which is not in its jurisdiction, one 
can assume that this government has taken more than its share of 
taxable capacity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we can say that the Liberal government has done worse 
than taking more than its taxable share. It has found room to 
manoeuver at the expense of the sick, schools and the poor and 
by forcing provinces to do the dirty work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government intrudes into Quebec's jurisdiction and 
refuses to take its responsibilities by compensating all 
hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1964, the federal government led by Mr. Pearson proposed to 
offer loans to students and to repay the interest for them. Jean 
Lesage opposed the proposal because that repayment was a direct 
grant by the federal government to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the statement he made at the end of the federal provincial 
conference held in Quebec, from March 31 to April 2 1964, the 
man whose election campaign slogan was “Maîtres chez nous”, Jean 
Lesage, declared: “As a matter of fact, we will have to go to 
court to ensure the constitutional rights of the province are 
respected, if they do not act on the comments we made”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 16 1964, in a telegram to Jean Lesage, Mr. Pearson 
said: “The federal government intends to propose arrangements 
according to which guaranteed bank loans would be made to 
university students. If a province prefers to go on with its own 
loan program, it will be eligible to equivalent compensation”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the federal government made several unsuccessful 
attempts in the past to invade the education system, and neither 
the PQ nor the BQ were there to oppose this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Fédération des travailleurs du Québec, Bill C-36 
illustrates the Canadian government's ignorance of the Quebec 
loans and grants system and of its priorities in the area of 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the president of the Fédération des cégeps, which 
comprises 48 colleges, Bill C-36 totally ignores what Quebec has 
understood in the past 30 years with regard to student financial 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships are only an excuse. The federal 
government is using the establishment of the fund to encroach on 
the area of education, which comes under Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing so, it is not helping Quebec reduce student debt or 
fund universities and post-secondary educational institutions. It 
is just after additional visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major reasons why we strongly oppose the 
establishment of this fund. Politically, the Bloc Quebecois 
feels that the millennium fund is an unspeakable intrusion in a 
Quebec exclusive jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the government has come up with such a confusing 
formula in order to deny Quebec the right to opt out with full 
compensation that its fund does not achieve the objectives that 
were set. It will only create inequity and confusion, while the 
problems of students and post-secondary institutions will remain 
intact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the federal government recognizes the tough 
financial situation of students, the solutions it puts forward 
ignore the source of the problem, that is the massive cuts in 
transfer payments. In addition, in the case of Quebec, the 
proposals put forward are ineffective, they overlap the measures 
put in place by the Quebec government and they are undoubtedly 
an intrusion in an area that comes under Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the societal choices that Quebec has made over the years, 
the federal strategy is penalizing it. 
Indeed, the budget penalizes Quebec, which over the years has 
made major efforts to keep tuition fees and student debt at 
reasonable levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, tuition fees average about $1,700 a year whereas in 
the rest of Canada they average about $3,200. Likewise, the 
average student debt in Quebec is $11,000, whereas students in 
the rest of Canada owe between $17,000 and $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Quebec suggested that its needs in the 
education area lie elsewhere and are not the same as those 
identified by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec share of the millennium fund could be better used if 
the Quebec government were at liberty to invest this money where 
the needs in the Quebec education system are more pressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Quebec is clear about that: any extra funding 
for education, whatever the means used, must be directed to the 
Quebec government which will redistribute it according to its 
own priorities. The right to opt out with full compensation has 
existed since 1964 in the area of financial help for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has built itself an effective and efficient system of 
scholarships that is the envy of students in the other 
provinces. The government says it is creating this fund to 
address the problem of student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I must point out that it would be up to the 
foundation, which, under Bill C-36, has not even the mandate to 
negotiate with a province, to determine Quebec's fair share.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to debate Bill C-36 although what is not such a 
pleasure is the time allocation aspect of this. 
I want to explain the problems with time allocation from where I 
sit.  A lot of people who are watching and listening do not 
understand it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time allocation is when the government says “We are no longer 
interested in hearing what you have to say in opposition.  We are 
going to limit the number of days and amount of time you have to 
speak on this issue”. In a democratic world that is probably as 
far away from democracy as we can get when time is allocated on 
such an important issue as the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing I want to address before I specifically 
talk about Bill C-36.  It is bad enough we have limited time to 
speak to this but when there are a limited number of people on 
the other side listening it makes it even worse.  I have a good 
mind to call quorum but I will not. The real problem here is 
where is the audience?  It is pretty sad indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Three Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Yes, three.  If they cannot stand the 
heat, get out of the Commons I would say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder why this government would call time allocation 
on a budget. Let us think about that for a minute. According to 
the parliamentary calendar we sit until June 23. We can extend 
days and so on and so forth.  The legislation that is of priority 
to this government is now down to approximately three bills, not 
enough probably for five days work.  We have to question why on 
earth the government would move time allocation when it has 
perhaps three priority bills and well over a month to debate them 
and get them in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to that lies in what has happened in this House in 
the last six months.  Look at the Minister of Health and his 
hepatitis boondoggle and how this government mismanaged that 
whole issue.  Look at the Minister of Justice who said that they 
are going to fix the Young Offenders Act but really it could take 
another two years when the government has already had five years 
and the media has now picked up on that.  The heat is getting on 
the government which basically has no agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to get out of the House early by 
calling time allocation.  I wish Canadians watching this truly 
understood what this is all about.  It is not just about someone 
standing up here for 10 minutes and going on about an issue. 
This is really about the fundamental basis of democracy itself. 
It is too bad we live in these times when governments can 
essentially still do this to the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get on to Bill C-36, budget implementation, and the 
implementation of what the Liberals proudly call the millennium 
fund.  This millennium fund supposedly has approximately $2.5 
billion so that we can provide scholarships to students. There is 
nothing about bursaries.  I do not think the government knows the 
difference between a scholarship and a bursary but I will explain 
that in a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question is where does the money come from.  It came 
from the 1997-98 budget.  The government said we have a balanced 
budget and charged to that budget was $2.5 billion. The fact is 
that the money will not be used until the year 2000 yet the 
government has charged it to the 1997-98 budget rather than the 
year 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To one of the three members opposite in the House—and for 
anyone out there watching, the government virtually has no one 
hear listening to this—it is pretty sick when the government 
says it can justify that.  As an accountant, a CMA, a member of 
the Society of Management Accountants, I fully understand what 
the general accepted principles are in accounting.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically in government accounting one does not charge an 
expenditure in a year in which it is not expended.  The fact is 
that the government should have charged the $2.5 billion to the 
millennium fund in the year in which the costs are to be incurred 
and that is the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I saying that?  The fact of the matter is, the government 
said it had balanced the books.  The real fact of the matter is, 
it would have had a $2.5 billion surplus, but it chose to second 
that money so it would not have to give the taxpayer a break and 
the public would not be able to ask why it did not write down the 
debt or lower taxes.  The government said it had no money, that 
it had balanced the books to zero.  The fact is, there was a 
surplus and the government chose to hide that surplus by 
seconding $2.5 billion into something called a millennium fund 
for which the dollars will not even be used until the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of 175 government members, there are three in the House.  It 
is really disgusting.  I guess I will talk to my colleagues.  Not 
only do they understand it a little better, there are more of 
them in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the millennium fund show that the government is 
putting on here.  It is not just the show that the justice 
minister put on with respect to the changes to the Young 
Offenders Act.  It is not just the show that government members 
are playing out for hepatitis C victims.  The fact is that the 
government's agenda is just show.  There is no depth to it.  It 
is a mile wide and an inch deep.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister the other day commented on the $32 million 
in the budget that the government is planning to spend on 
preventive measures for young offenders.  There is not a red cent 
anywhere.  The provinces do not even know about it, yet 
government members go to the media and say “Guess what we are 
spending on preventive measures for young offenders?  We are 
spending $32 million”.  They have not spent a red cent.  They 
have not even planned to spend it.  It is just amazing when 
people fall into that kind of lunacy, that kind of deceptive 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are down to two.  Since the Speaker is not listening to 
this I might as well say the number of Reform members we have in 
the House.  This is really sick.  I have a good mind to call for 
a quorum and get some of these people in here to listen for a 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing.  We have a multibillion dollar budget and the 
government has not reduced anything.  It has not really spent 
anything on anything meaningful.  It really has not done much at 
all, except that when a little bit of heat gets put on a whole 
bunch of issues it calls time allocation so nobody can really 
speak in detail to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that speaks very loudly to the concern of average 
Canadians.  The Liberal government not only has a very weak 
agenda, but it actually does not have programs that are 
substantive and valuable to most Canadians. 
Finally, since I only have a minute and there are only two 
members opposite, I might as well tell them this— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member knows that it 
is improper to refer to the absence of members in the House.  I 
know he may have been trying to cover it by that age-old 
tradition of referring to the presence of a few, but I, myself, 
have tried that technique and it has been ruled out of order.  I 
know the hon. member would agree with the previous ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will no longer say that 
there are only two Liberals in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the issue of the budget and the issue of crime fall 
on deaf ears in this country because this is a government of 
press releases.  This is a government of rumour, of show, but it 
is not a government of substantive issues.  Meanwhile we are 
still waiting for a national victims bill of rights, for a young 
offenders act, for a real millennium fund.  So those two members 
opposite ought to get with it.

<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
considering Bill C-36. Bill C-36 has a big problem, which is 
called the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scholarships are for the students. In principle, everybody 
will agree that we must help our students complete their 
education while maintaining their debt level as low as possible. 
Therefore again, at first sight, the scholarships are a good 
idea. I will explain in a moment that ideas that are good for 
some people are sometimes bad for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk of the term “millennium”. Why the 
millennium scholarships? 
Because we will soon be in the year 2000 and our Prime Minister 
thought it would be a nice way to go down in history as the 
driving force behind these scholarships to be awarded starting 
in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will agree with me that if Canadian students need 
scholarships, they need them now and not in the year 2000 and 
after, although they will still need them then. It is remarkable 
how the finance minister has deducted from this year's budget 
the $2.5 billion which he intends to spend on this scholarship 
fund in the year 2000. But between now and the year 2000, not 
one Canadian student will see as much as a penny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said earlier that the scholarships are a good idea for 
some but a bad one for others. They are a good idea for Canadian 
students outside Quebec but a bad one for Quebec students. Why? 
A bursary program has been in existence in Quebec for more than 
30 years, since Jean Lesage was premier. We care for our 
students and we help them financially through bursaries and 
loans. It is a system that works well for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elsewhere in Canada, such a program will not come into existence 
until the year 2000. The provinces are admittedly a few years 
behind Quebec. In fact, they are more than 30 years behind 
Quebec. Now, the federal government decides to directly infringe 
upon a provincial area of jurisdiction and offer these 
bursaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although, on the one hand, I am happy for the students in 
Canada, on the other hand, I should point out that Quebec's 
money is being used to provide a service we already have. 
In other words, we are paying twice for the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, with its 30-year-old bursary system, is pursuing some very 
precise objectives. For 30 years, higher education at college or 
university level has been far less expensive in Quebec than in 
the other provinces. Why? Because we in Quebec decided—and this 
is a societal choice based on Quebeckers' values—to make higher 
education more accessible to everyone. Moreover, the number of 
college and university graduates in Quebec is much higher than 
anywhere else in Canada. In this regard, Quebec is a much richer 
country than Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us come back to the scholarship fund. Quebec has its own 
scholarship system where money is given according to the needs 
of the students. Those in need may apply for and receive a 
scholarship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Prime Minister proposes in Bill C-36 is to give 
scholarships on the basis of merit instead of need. The better 
the grades, the more chances of receiving a millennium 
scholarship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good grades are important for sure, but today, we need not only 
excellent but also decent students. 
Successful students all need financial support. It is not only 
the top students, the elite, that need financial support. 
Companies do not need only the students with the best marks. Of 
course, that is important and it is a very good thing, but 
companies also need adequate students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, students have access to scholarships according to 
their needs but this will not be the case in Canada. Canada may 
decide to award scholarships on the basis of merit rather than 
need. However, I cannot accept the fact that someone using 
Quebec money will try to impose on Quebec a system that is 
contrary to its convictions and its values, contrary to what 
Quebec has been doing for more than 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know how much money Quebec will be forced to put into 
that foundation?  In Quebec, everybody is against this 
millennium scholarship system. 
So how much more will be stolen away—pardon the expression—by this 
millennium fund?  Just a bit over $600 million.  That is a lot 
of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six hundred million dollars is almost twice what the province of 
Quebec has been forced to hand over to the municipalities 
because the federal government has cut transfer payments.  Those 
$600 million would solve a lot of health problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six hundred million dollars is the amount that the people of 
Quebec will be forced to pay to fund these millennium 
scholarships which we do not need because we already have our 
own system.  We end up paying twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, here we are with a totally unacceptable duplication 
of effort. 
This is a total intrusion by the federal government into our 
affairs, forcing us into taking on something far less attractive 
than what we already have in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an attitude can only reinforce two feelings in me: first 
pride in being a Quebecker and in sharing these values that have 
been in place for 30 years or more, of encouraging our students 
through a scholarship system when Canada does not even have one 
of its own yet, not until the year 2000.  I am proud to be a 
Quebecker because we are more advanced in a number of areas, 
this being one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I am proud to be a sovereignist, because 
sovereignty will be the only way to stop a federal government, a 
federal system that wants to use our money, my money, the money 
of all Quebeckers, for something we have no need of. 
Six hundred million dollars is a fortune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interest on that amount would pay for about $3,000 in 
scholarship money to some 250 Quebec students.  But there is 
more to it than that.  In Quebec, our bursary system is working 
fine, and so is our loan system. What we do need is money to put 
back into our cegeps, into our universities, so that they can 
provide students with the best quality education possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of having scholarship money in your pocket if 
your educational institution cannot afford to give you a 
top-flight education?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, the federal government has slashed transfer 
payments for post-secondary education and, as a result, our 
universities and colleges have to make do with smaller budgets. 
After slashing our institutions' ability to deliver very high 
quality education, it now wants to give money directly to 
students to enrol in educational institutions that are not as 
good as they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's request, which is supported by the Bloc Quebecois, is 
quite simple: the federal government should give Quebec its $600 
million and let it invest in high quality education. We can 
continue to look after our students as we have been doing so 
successfully for more than 30 years.

<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to debate Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about here is the so-called millennium fund, 
about $2.5 billion set up for scholarships.  I have to question 
this.  No doubt many of us here in the House remember quite well, 
as it was not that long ago, when this same government decided to 
rip the provinces off to the tune of $7 billion right out of 
health and education.  Now it turns around and says it will give 
back $2.5 billion in a millennium fund. That is like ripping your 
arm off and giving you back the finger. This government is very 
good at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have news for the government.  It is not its money.  It is 
taxpayers' money.  We are the most heavily taxed nation in the 
G-7.  It is our money.  It is not the government's money.  When I 
see something like this put in place, I know for a fact it has 
nothing at all to do with education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to do with trying to make the Prime Minister look good. 
It has to do with the members on the opposite side, the so-called 
government of this country, able to pat themselves on the back 
and say look what we have done for you, the people.  We rip it 
out of your education fund.  We rip it out of your health fund. 
But we will give you back peanuts.  We will give you back enough 
that maybe one in seven of your children might qualify for it, 
and if they do we will tax it back off them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this government is so proud of.  That is why this 
government has decided all of a sudden that it will put time 
allocation on this bill, a budget bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that long ago when I felt sorry for the Liberals when 
they were in opposition and the Conservatives decided to put time 
allocation, closure, on everything.  I can well remember the 
pleading and the whining and the crying from the Liberal caucus 
of the day.  Not any more.  These people well learned the fine 
art of dictatorship.  It did not take a trip over to Cuba to 
learn that, I am quite sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at what is going on.  I mentioned taxes.  I would like 
to give a brief outline of where Canada sits now.  Canada has the 
highest tax burden of all the G-7 countries.  Our total tax 
burden is 28% higher than the G-7 average and 48% higher than our 
neighbour next door, the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has a habit of standing up in this House and 
saying we are the greatest country in the world to live in. We 
are the sharing, caring country of the world.  I have news for 
the government.  It is killing everything in this country. It is 
running the entrepreneurs out of this country.  It is forcing 
unemployment.  Unemployment today is at an all time high.  We 
have bankruptcies at record levels.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people who are truly suffering.  What is the 
government's answer to this?  A $2.5 billion millennium fund so 
it and the Prime Minister can feel good in case there is an 
election within a year after that.  Shame on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see from some of the people nodding on the other side that I 
must be hitting a soft spot.  They know it is true.  The people 
out there know it is true.  They know they are being taxed to 
death to supply nothing.  The auditor general has raised grave 
concerns about what is going on with this fund.  What does the 
government do?  Nothing.  It pays no attention to the auditor 
general.  It does not even address his concerns about how this is 
being funded, about the discrepancy and about the argument on how 
the bookkeeping has taken place in order to create this so-called 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say these boys make the James boys look like kids in the 
candy store.  They know full well how to rip off the Canadian 
taxpayer and get away with it.  They have had years of 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have another look at what is going on.  In 1993 when the 
Liberals took office the tax revenue totalled $116.5 billion or 
approximately $8,951 per working Canadian.  This year this 
government will collect $160 billion or $11,335 per working 
Canadian.  That is an increase of 26% in five years.  I know many 
stock promoters who would love to have that kind of increase. I 
know many people who hold investments would love to have that 
kind of increase in their portfolio.  That is what this 
government is doing, 26% in five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it into perspective, the overall result according to 
Statistics Canada is that any improved family earnings acquired 
largely to the government between 1989 and 1995, the real after 
tax income of the average Canadian family fell by $3,461.  Are 
they not proud of that?  It fell from $41,084 to $37,623. Are 
they ever doing a wonderful job over there. They are for 
themselves but certainly not for the law-abiding taxpaying 
citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a continuing process.  It goes on.  In 1977 in the midst 
of the Trudeau years the government collected $7,044 from every 
working Canadian.  By 1986, two years after Mulroney, the take 
was $14,593.  By 1996 after this government took over, it reached 
$22,792.  That is a really a record to be proud of. It takes from 
the poor.  It takes from anybody it can, it keeps on taking and 
it gives back a so-called millennium fund.  Then it has the gall 
to say it is going to help our students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our students want jobs.  They want to be able to work in this 
country.  They want a better education.  They do not like being 
taxed to death when they finally have it.  They do not like the 
debt they owe when they get out.  They have just cause to be 
worried about that.  It is about time the government started to 
worry about what is going on and what is there for these kids 
when they get out.  An education is fine, maybe one of the finest 
things there is.  But if there is nothing out here when they come 
out it is of no use to anybody.  We well know that. Maybe it is 
time this government started to realize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a total farce.  It is a farce on Canadian taxpayers.  It 
is a farce on the people who were elected to come back here and 
have a say when we have a government that decides you will keep 
your mouth shut, sit here and just be quiet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to add my voice in 
praise of the visionary budget tabled in this House on February 
24. On that date Canadians found a reason to have hope and faith 
in a better future.  From that day forward we have begun to 
rebuild Canada from a blueprint based on opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the remarkable achievements outlined in the budget, the 
Canadian opportunities strategy stands out as the hallmark of 
this government's plan for Canada in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget builds on progress achieved in previous budgets 
to provide Canadians with greater opportunities to acquire the 
knowledge and the skills needed for jobs both now and in the 
future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian opportunities strategy, this government 
introduced and promoted measures to help Canadians make the 
transition from school to work, pay off their student loans, 
return to school to upgrade their skills or contribute to the 
education savings plan on behalf of the next generation of 
workers. This strategy takes comprehensive and co-ordinated 
action on seven fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arising from a commitment made by the first ministers to 
implement an action plan for youth employment, the Canadian 
opportunities strategy makes knowledge and skills more readily 
accessible and affordable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation of the strategy is the Canada millennium 
scholarship fund which will provide more than 100,000 low and 
middle income students with scholarships averaging $3,000 a year 
for each year of the first decade in the new millennium. 
Individuals can receive up to $15,000, reducing the debtload many 
recipients would otherwise incur by over half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to 50,000 more students with children or other dependants 
will be able to take advantage of Canada study grants to help 
them cope with rising costs.  These grants will help people who 
are in financial need to continue with their education, 
increasing their own and their children's prospects for 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study grants, in addition to the increased child care tax 
credit that all Canadians now enjoy, will help young parents get 
their children off to a good start in life. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is particularly proud of the measures announced 
in this budget that will help our students gain the knowledge 
they need through strategic investments in science and 
technology, which are the driving force of the new economy and 
can be most attractive to young inquisitive minds. These 
investments are crucial to the competitiveness of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy will provide additional 
funding for advanced research for our graduate students as well 
as for the three granting councils in Canada, the Natural 
Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Medical Research 
Council of Canada and the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council. 
The combined budget of these three granting councils will be 
increased by $400 million over the next three years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally important, this budget increases funding for the 
Canadian network for advancement of research in industry and 
education as well as SchoolNet and the community access program 
to bring the benefits of information technology into more 
classrooms and more communities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of crucial importance to young people is helping 
graduates manage their student debtloads.  Witnesses appearing 
before the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and 
the Status of Persons with Disabilities were unanimous in their 
position that to ensure access to post-secondary education a 
positive system of student financial assistance is paramount.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy provides tax relief on 
student loan interest payments as well as an education credit and 
child care expense deduction for part time students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About one million Canadians will benefit from the improvements 
to the Canada student loan program which will help graduates 
better manage the debt they incur and which will direct grants to 
those in greatest need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countless more of today's children will be able to attend 
colleges, vocational schools or universities because their 
parents can now take advantage of federal incentives under the 
Canada education savings grants program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These government grants will encourage families to start setting 
aside money early for their children's post-secondary education 
under the registered education savings plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity for Canadians to withdraw tax free from their 
registered retirement savings plan to enrol in full time 
education and training is another well thought out innovation 
that will help to ensure that Canadians have easier access to 
professional development. Canadians already in the workforce 
will be able to benefit from this continuous learning process 
throughout their careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, these measures will help Canada to develop a highly 
skilled and competitive workforce for the new world economy 
based on knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever satisfaction I might get from these remarkable reforms, 
I am also very proud of the fact that our government will do 
everything it can to ensure that no one is forgotten. The 
preservation of social peace implies that everyone must have 
equal opportunity to benefit from what our society has to offer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the Canadian opportunities strategy, the February 
budget strengthened other progressive programs which will help 
Canada's children and youth to succeed in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major infusion of new moneys will support youth employment and 
participation in society.  The government has doubled its funding 
for youth at risk, principally those who have not completed high 
school and who lack basic education and job skills.  Through 
partnerships with employers, organizations and non-profit groups 
the new funds will be used for on the job training, career 
counselling, mentoring and literacy upgrading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have a role to play in tackling the issue of youth 
unemployment but clearly we cannot solve the problem alone.  Many 
private sector employers are responding to this challenge by 
providing opportunities for young Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has taken measures to encourage a larger number 
of employers to create new jobs for workers. We will give these 
employers an employment insurance premium holiday for young 
people hired in the years 1999 and 2000. This means that, each 
year, employers will make savings of about $100 million in their 
payroll expenditures. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget speaks to Canadians' profound belief that we can 
build a strong economy by building a secure society.  The two are 
flip sides of the same coin. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balanced approach on which this legislation is based will 
result in sustainable dividends that will benefit Canadians now 
and for decades to come. This is the way to go for Canada, on 
the eve of the new millennium, to have the opportunity to live 
in a more prosperous society that cares about the well-being of 
all its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-36 becomes law, it will be a moment of great pride, 
not only in the life of parliamentarians but of all Canadians.

I have only ten minutes, but I could talk for an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, you will understand that, on the subject of Bill C-36,

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have spoken at length today on various matters 
concerning the bill on the millennium scholarship fund. 
Canadians ask us what Quebeckers want.  It is so simple. 
As part of its values, Quebec decided to establish a loans and 
bursaries system—not a perfect one, I admit—but one that met 
the expectations of many young Quebeckers.  It has been 
operating for years, and a number of students have told me that 
it is one of the most effective systems in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that Quebeckers have values, I mean their values.  We 
have never tried to impose these values on the rest of Canada. 
If another province wants to do what it wants with its loans and 
bursaries system, that is fine with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point, faced with a growing demand probably from the 
rest of Canada, the Prime Minister decided, saying he wanted to 
do his share, to make a bequest. 
He is attacking the problem of student debt.  A very commendable 
thing to do.  I have no complaint up to this point.  Except that 
where things start to get serious, we have to make sure they are 
done responsibly and efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating the millennium scholarship foundation means creating 
duplication.  There will be a system of loans and bursaries in 
Quebec City and another in Ottawa.  This spells a loss of 
efficiency right off, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I recall asking the Prime Minister at one point if 
there was not a certain element of visibility involved.  I think 
the federal government is looking for ways to leave its mark on 
the cheques.  I must say I have no problem with that.  It can 
leave its mark everywhere, so long as the students get help. 
The Prime Minister answered my question by saying that 
visibility was indeed involved. 
He could have pretended he wanted to help students without 
mentioning he wanted visibility, but no, he acknowledged it in 
the House of Commons. I could not believe my ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many points I could talk about. I will discuss some 
which have not been mentioned as often as they should. The 
Millennium Scholarship Foundation will be managed by a board of 
directors. This arm's length body will not be accountable to the 
people. It is as if we, the democratically elected members of 
Parliament, were to say that we are not responsible enough to be 
entrusted with managing such a huge amount of money, that we had 
better bring in people from the private sector who will 
undoubtedly do a much better job than us. But if people do not 
agree with this concept, they cannot go through their MPs, the 
very persons they elected. I have a moral problem with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point. Not only are we delegating our authority to a 
board of directors, but we do not know who they all are. I feel 
like I am signing a blank cheque. I have serious reservations 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point, the issue of equal opportunity. This bill is 
attacking some very basic principles our society is founded 
upon.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said these scholarship will not necessarily be based 
entirely on need, but also on merit. Today I sat on the 
committee studying the bill. I found it ridiculous for the 
committee to review a bill which is not even complete. Today, a 
lot was said against the fact that part of these scholarships 
would be decided on merit and part on need. But what will the 
proportion be? Is it  10%, 50% or 90% of these scholarships 
which will go to the best students? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have several friends who are going to university and who do 
not have much money and have to work. It is tough to work and go 
to university at the same time. 
Of course, working lowers a student's academic performance, but 
it is the last resort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students whose academic performance suffers because they have to 
work need more money, but our very good government came up with 
a plan to help only the best students. But the new reality is 
that our young people need to work to pursue their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know what proportion of these scholarships will be 
based on merit and what proportion will be based on need. The 
government could have said in committee that, for example, 10% 
of the scholarships will be awarded to the elite, to the best 
students. It could have said that it chose to help the best 
students and to encourage them to go as far as they can so they 
can become the future leaders of our society. We could at least 
have debated this, but we cannot. Why? 
Because we do not know what proportion of these scholarships 
will be based on merit and what proportion will be based on 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have serious questions about our work here today, and that 
also goes for the members opposite. After all, as democratically 
elected representatives of the people, we are saying that it is 
not our responsibility to make societal choices, but the 
responsibility of a private board of directors. And we do not 
even know who is going to be on that board. Moreover, we do not 
know the essence and the intent of this plan. We can certainly 
change a few commas and make insignificant revisions but, 
overall, what is this leading to? And there is also the students 
of Quebec who, in the end, will see a reduction in the 
assistance they receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met students from Alberta. Their system of loans and 
scholarships is not as good or perhaps not as generous as 
Quebec's system. 
They see that the federal government will intervene and they are 
very happy. If it wants to proceed in this way, I have no 
problem with that. But I do not want it to intrude into my 
values, in Quebec's values. Then people wonder why we want our 
own country. It seems quite obvious to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would it have bothered the rest of Canada if Parliament had 
said “It is true that in Quebec you have a consensus and 
different values. We do not want to disturb you with that. We 
think this may not be bad in itself. We are giving you the money 
and you may use it as you wish”? But instead the government is 
imposing its rules. Then it wonders why there are sovereignists 
in Ottawa. It seems so simple to me. Then it asks “What does 
Quebec want?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is incredible. When I talk about Quebec's values, I do not 
talk about a political party that took a stand, but about a 
consensus among students and university associations and 
presidents. In short, everyone in Quebec opposes this measure, 
even the national assembly. The Liberal Party of Quebec said 
“No, this is not a good thing”. All this for the sake of the 
federal government's visibility. This disappoints me, because 
education is the future.

<P><A NAME="LINK312"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEPATITIS C 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK313"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased that I will have a little time tonight to continue my 
crusade on the hepatitis C story.  I do not have to remind the 
House that it is a very heart wrenching story.  Many thousands of 
Canadians are waiting to find out whether they are going to be 
compensated.  The only compensation package the federal 
government has agreed to is for the innocent victims between the 
years 1986 and 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House and some of the members from the 
Liberal caucus believe that all victims of hepatitis C should be 
compensated.  A group of people who through no fault of their own 
were infected by tainted blood prior to 1986.  They will receive 
no compensation. There are also victims on the other side of that 
date.  We often talk about the pre-1986 victims but there are 
also victims who were infected through no fault of their own 
after 1990. A constituent of mine has been reminding me of that. 
We often talk in this House of the pre-1986 victims but there are 
many victims who were infected after 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about fairness in the compensation package. 
Canada has been selected by the United Nations as the number one 
country in the world.  I think Canada is more generous than that 
in terms of what the government is offering.  We have the 
capacity and the financial wherewithal to compensate all victims 
of hepatitis C.  I remind the government that we have to do 
something for those victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what we have been reading lately in the 
newspapers, many of us are still pretty distressed by what we are 
hearing from the government.  I was pleased today when I asked 
that question of the health minister.  He is not going to tie 
assistance and research monies into other areas of legitimate 
health concern in this country as was reported by one of our 
national television networks over the weekend.  It reported that 
the government might withhold funding for breast cancer research 
and funding for the AIDS strategy.  That is not the case at all. 
The health minister told me today there will be no change in the 
funding of those two areas and other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking for more generosity on the part of the Minister 
of Health.  We have gone after him pretty rigorously in the House 
and we have to continue to keep the heat on the minister.  We 
know there has been some progress on behalf of some of the 
provinces.  We are looking for a compensation package for all 
those victims outside the prescribed area of 1986 to 1990.  We 
want victims before and after compensated. 
<P><A NAME="LINK314"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, when the 
ministers of health made the announcement on March 27 on how the 
various governments of Canada would be approaching the issue of 
hepatitis C, they did so together sitting at the same table with 
one another and with people who are affected by the virus. 
They did so knowing that some people would not be happy.  They 
sat across from these people, faced them and answered their 
questions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public wants governments to listen to what peoples' thoughts 
are on these issues and has asked that we take responsibility for 
the blood system problems of the past.  We have done so.  It 
wants governments to work together and we did so.  The Canadian 
public prefers that any assistance provided by governments be 
distributed according to need.  This is what we proposed this 
past March 27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 14 health ministers met with representatives from the 
Hepatitis C Society of Canada.  They met and listened to the 
Canadian Hemophilia Society.  Health Canada officials have been 
speaking directly to affected members of the public who have 
called into Health Canada to tell us about their daily lives, the 
problems they face and what they want governments to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has consistently shown that it wants to 
work with all involved but that not everybody involved wants to 
work toward a real solution.  We continue to do so.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REFORM 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK316"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois has launched a large 
scale offensive to bring the federal government to review the 
Employment Insurance Act. We have known for a while that only 41 
per cent of the unemployed receive benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Bloc Quebecois released a black book on the 
employment insurance reform. This book, based on Statistics 
Canada's figures, confirms that only 26 per cent of unemployed 
young people receive benefits. This is totally unacceptable. The 
government must do something about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This black book on employment insurance also shows that, in 
1996, out of $6 billion in cuts, $4.3 billion was due to 
restrictions in the program, while the remaining $1.7 billion 
was attributable to labour market activity. The $4.3 billion was 
due to restraints in eligibility, the duration of benefits and 
the amounts paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we get there? The problem is that, in their latest 
attempt to overhaul the EI system, the Liberals were obsessed 
with fighting the deficit. All the government wanted to do was 
find ways to accumulate as much money as possible at the expense 
of society's most disadvantaged, the people who struggle to make 
ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must go back and abolish the intensity rule, 
which penalizes seasonal workers. It must reduce the number of 
hours required in a first job. 
We must ensure that we have all the information needed to 
correct this reform, which creates social iniquity and also has 
the unfortunate effect of lagging behind society and the labour 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not yet decided what to do about independent 
workers. It does not know exactly how to adapt to the new 
conditions of precarious employment. It is forcing everyone to 
pay contributions from the first hour, but the end result is 
that many people, 74% of young people, are contributing, but not 
getting the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the federal government finally decide to review the 
Employment Insurance Act and give it back its true purpose of 
ensuring a decent income between jobs for people who are 
unemployed? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK317"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
employment insurance system is about supporting individuals who 
have an attachment to the labour force and who need temporary 
assistance before getting back into the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the member's claims that he has made in the past and 
again tonight, the fact is that we do not want individuals moving 
from EI to social assistance.  We want them to move from EI into 
the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us set the record straight.  Since March 1997 social 
assistance case loads have declined in all provinces.  In the 
member's province of Quebec the most recent figures show 436,200 
households were on social assistance, the lowest number of cases 
since January 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that a portion of social assistance recipients has 
always been persons who either did not qualify or who exhausted 
their EI benefits.  Contrary to the hon. member's statement, our 
last EI reform was precisely about trying to help these 
unemployed individuals back into the workforce.

included a number of bold new measures to modernize the system 
and to ensure it could better help Canadians face the challenges 
of our changing economy and help them find and keep jobs.

for as long as possible as the member and his party would like, 
we choose to invest EI dollars in new measures to help Canadians 
return to work as quickly as possible.

these employment measures so that all Canadians who received EI 
or UI in the last three years can benefit from them as can people 
who collected maternity or parental benefits during the last five 
years.

has negotiated labour market development agreements with nearly 
all provincial and territorial governments for the delivery of 
these active measures.
