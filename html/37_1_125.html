	Mr. Speaker, on December 1, thousands of Canadians, including me, travelled to New York City as part of the Canada Loves New York campaign. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From coast to coast 20,000 Canadians joined with the Prime Minister and Mayor Giuliani in a spirited rally supporting New Yorkers and indeed all Americans during these difficult times. In fact  so many Canadians  participated in this event that Mayor Giuliani proclaimed the entire weekend as Canada Loves New York.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage all Canadians to travel to New York and see a city that has dealt with a terrible tragedy and has emerged stronger and more united than ever.  Canada loves New York.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today, December 5, is International Volunteer Day for Economic and Social Development and the official close of the International Year of Volunteers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great day for Canada because at 1 o'clock this afternoon at the General Assembly of the United Nations the hon. minister of public works and the secretary general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, unveiled a special International Year of Volunteers sculpture based on a coin designed by artist Anthony Testa of the Royal Canadian Mint. The sculpture will be displayed at the UN volunteers headquarters in Bonn.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteerism has helped to increase literacy, protect the environment, stimulate cultural activity and promote co-operation with developing countries. Last year 6.5 million Canadians gave over a billion hours of their time volunteering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the 1985 UN resolution I encourage all Canadians to volunteer their time next year. On behalf of all my colleagues in the House I applaud all the thousands of Canadians whose volunteer efforts this year helped make the world a better place.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the appellate body of the World Trade Organization finally brought down a favourable decision on Canadian exports of dairy products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision brings to an end the trade battle that has been going on since 1998 with the U.S. and New Zealand. It reverses the earlier decision by a special WTO group that Canada's milk export pricing practices constituted export subsidies.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, last weekend while in New York City I made my way to Strawberry Fields in Central Park to join a small crowd at a makeshift shrine to the memory of George Harrison. The mound of flowers, pictures and tributes accompanied by strains of Beatles songs gave me pause to reflect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was about 14 when the Beatles exploded on the world. Drawn by the strong, lyrical guitar solos I made a decision that set the course for my life. I bought a used guitar for five bucks and a book of nine basic chords. My parents were not thrilled when a few years and two bands later I took the vice-principal up on his offer and left school for rock and roll on the road rather than get my hair cut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drone of <i>Norwegian Wood</i>, the melding of Indian and western themes in <i>Within You, Without You</i>, the raw emotion of  <i>Something</i> and <i>While My Guitar Gently Weeps</i> will endure. For me personally it is the melodic ring and lyrical optimism of  <i>Here Comes The Sun</i> that defines George Harrison.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from that kid in the early sixties who, influenced by Harrison's brilliant simplicity, picked up a guitar and lived a dream, I say thanks to George.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform hon. members that lawyers associations from all over the world  will be meeting in Paris this Thursday and Friday.    The purpose of this conference is to create an international criminal lawyers' association for the International Criminal Court.  This conference is organized by the International Criminal Defence Attorneys Association, the  headquarters of which is in Montreal.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Criminal Court is a central element  of Canada's human security agenda and Canada has long been a world leader in the creation of the court.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly the Government of Canada is co-sponsoring this conference through the ICC campaign of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  It will bring together over 300 experts from the bar associations of 60 countries, including from the developing nations, and with representatives from foreign affairs and national defence in attendance.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting its commitment to due process and  the rule of law, the Rome statute provides for the provision of legal counsel both   to individuals accused and  the victims of crimes within the court's jurisdiction.  Indeed the conference dramatizes just how close we are to having the ICC, with the Rome statute having received  the 47th of the 60 ratifications needed to create the court just last week.</p>

He was honoured as sportsman of the year. Another famous Lanaudois, Gilles Villeneuve, was the very first winner of this award.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This season, Patrick Carpentier thrilled us and caused a stir of excitement with his first career victory on the Michigan course on July 22. His series of successes continued with  2nd place in Chicago a week later, 3rd place in the Mid-Ohio on August 12, and another rostrum in Germany on September 15.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick Carpentier has distinguished himself both on the track and off and he is considered by his peers and by the sports media to be one of the nicest people in automotive sports. His exploits began in 1984, when he started in go-karting. Since then, he has recorded a championship in Atlantic Formula racing and won the title of recruit of the year in the CART series. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of people of the riding of Joliette and the Bloc Quebecois, I salute the tenacity and the talent of Patrick Carpentier for whom the best is yet  to come, as he said himself at the end of the season. </p>

If it wants to take over the construction of the bridges over the St. Lawrence and the Seaway and 14 kilometres of road, we can move up the timetable for the work”.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday the auditor general reported to the House that the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is routinely ignoring the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her report examined 26 files requiring environmental assessments.  It found that seven of them were approved prior to the completion of the assessments, seven more had assessments done calling for follow up action that never took place and twelve were approved without condition that the recommendations of the assessment be enforced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general called this a worrisome trend, citing the case of a hotel in P.E.I. where an environmental protection plan for the construction period was a requirement of the environmental assessment.  The agency blatantly ignored this requirement and the hotel was built without a plan to protect the fragile environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlantic Canadians, who saw the effects of the collapse of the cod fishery, know very well the importance of environmental protection.  It is shameful that ACOA would become one of the most egregious violators of environmental laws.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the auditor general has given a failing grade to treasury board.  Here are some examples of Liberal misspending:  a $36 billion surplus in the EI account, $20 billion more than required; 7,000 dead people given fuel rebate cheques; 1,600 federal prisoners given fuel rebate cheques; 4,000 people living outside of Canada given fuel rebate cheques; Sea King helicopters that spend 40 hours in repair for every hour of service; millions wasted on ill-conceived and poorly delivered programs at Health Canada; millionaire movie stars paying no tax, zero tax.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military, whenever it has been asked, has done its job. The military should be praised, not denigrated as the member has said. The member should also take into consideration that the auditor general's report was written before  September 11.</p>

So much for the sharing of wealth.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  everyone knows that employment insurance is a government program and that  revenues go into the consolidated revenue fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the employment insurance fund is running a deficit, it is the government that makes up that deficit. This is the way it has been for a very long time and the system works very well.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the surplus is in excess of $42 billion and the auditor general said that a $15 billion surplus is sufficient to meet the needs of the unemployed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She added that the size of the accumulated surpluses in the employment insurance fund is totally unjustified. This is what the auditor general said. Moreover, the government is refusing to improve the program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Prime Minister recognize that the employment insurance program must be used to share the wealth, not to fill the government's coffers, not to divert money that should go to the unemployed?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is at the request of the auditor general himself that we, not our government, but the previous one, stopped having a separate fund and paid into the consolidated revenue fund  employment insurance contributions, which were at $3.07 per $100 of insurable earnings when we took office in 1993 and which are now at $2.20 or $2.25.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member wants to talk about tax cuts, let us look at what we have done for the workers: record tax cuts of $100 billion and the tax cuts which have gone to workers with families,    35%.  That is how we are helping the workers.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EI fund is not a shoebox.  There are many priorities, but the big thing that we have done to help workers is to cut the income taxes of workers with families by 35%.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the softwood lumber negotiations, B.C. forestry workers and communities are being sold out by the B.C. Liberal government  which is caving in to the U.S. government on raw log exports from crown lands.  Exports of raw logs mean exports of good quality Canadian jobs.</p>

His policy to back up that statement and the idea that he floated yesterday was that Air Canada should be given a monopoly for domestic service on major routes. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport minister, rather than blaming September 11 which his government does for everything, needs to look in the mirror and blame himself.  He gave $100 million to Air Canada for its out of pocket costs. It took that money, launched Air Canada Tango and knifed Canada 3000 out of business.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the amount of energy generated by renewable low impact sources, such as water, wind, solar, biogas, biomass and others is increasing every year in Canada. National associations have asked the federal government for a certification program to identify power generated from renewable energy sources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the minister tell the House what the government is doing to help consumers identify eco-friendly power?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the government supports the development of renewable and environmentally sound alternatives to power generation.  The new guidelines will be released on December 8.  They will establish criteria for the certification and the licensing of renewable low impact energy.  That will further encourage the diversity in the marketplace and, of course, renewable, low impact energy sources.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, well, it is hurrah for Hollywood.  It fooled this government, but it certainly did not fool the auditor general. She says that the revenue minister turns a blind eye while American millionaire movie stars evade paying millions of dollars in Canadian income taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the government there is no money for troops, no money for health care, there are billions for boondoggles, but it  forgives taxes for Hollywood movie stars. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took until this June to finally close that loophole, but the question is this.  When will the government bring the curtain down further on all waste and mismanagement?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that problem was there and has been there for decades.  That problem was there when the Conservative government was in power back in the 1980s.  It closed its eyes on that problem, which affected our tax base.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the government have been able to fix the problem in consultation with the finance department and the whole industry.  Actually, those people will have to pay their dues to Canadian society.</p>

	<h5 align="center"><i>[Speaker's Ruling]</i></h5><A NAME="Int-103899"></A><a HREF="#Int-103909"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-103894"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>

	I am now ready to rule on the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Port Moody--Coquitlam--Port Coquitlam on Thursday, November 22,  regarding Bill C-42, an act to amend certain acts of Canada, and to enact measures for implementing the biological and toxin weapons convention in order to enhance public safety, introduced earlier that day.  </p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to thank the hon. member for raising this matter as well as the hon. government House leader for his contribution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his submission, the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam alleges that the contents of Bill C-42 were leaked to the media before it was introduced at first reading in the House.  As proof, he mentioned two newspaper articles, which appeared on Thursday, November 22, 2001, the first in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> and the second in the <i>National Post</i>.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have examined the articles in question and can find no clear evidence that a leak actually occurred.  The articles   make reference to a number of sources, all unnamed, and include both speculations about the bill as well as assertions about its contents.  Nowhere is any source, governmental or non-governmental, quoted with respect to the confidential contents of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reading the text of these articles it is not possible for the Chair to distinguish between information, if any, that was directly communicated to the authors and material that is merely speculation or inference on the part of the authors for there seems to be no lack of ancillary material on which to base such speculations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. government House leader, for  instance, noted that the very title of the bill, namely an act to amend certain acts of Canada, and to enact measures for implementing the biological and toxin weapons convention  in order to enhance public safety, provides an important clue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intrepid journalists ready to invest the time to research the text of the biological and toxin weapons convention itself, not to mention the ongoing work of the international conference now reviewing its provisions, can expect to reap tangible benefits since Bill C-42 is the enabling legislation for Canada's ratification of that convention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere fact that those speculations or inferences accord with the contents of the bill does not by itself constitute a prima facie breach of privilege.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these circumstances it is by no means evident to the Chair, based on the evidence submitted by the hon. member, that any actual disclosure of Bill C-42 has taken place prior to its introduction in the House.  In the absence of such evidence, the Chair can find no basis for a question of privilege. I  thank all hon. members for their attention to this matter.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the  Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and Natural Resources for its thoughtful review of Bill C-27, an act respecting the long-term management of nuclear fuel waste. I also take the opportunity to thank all witnesses who took the time to present their views to the committee on this   important issue for all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely clear that along with the benefits of including the nuclear energy option in Canada's energy supply mix comes the responsibility of properly managing the resulting waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waste in question is solid fuel bundles discharged from reactors built with our own  Candu technology. Existing waste is currently stored safely at reactor sites while it awaits a long term management strategy.  The nature of the waste requires a management approach covering the long term.  Development and control of nuclear energy is a federal responsibility.  It falls within federal jurisdiction. The Government of Canada has a duty to assume its responsibilities in this area which include the critical matter of an oversight function.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-27 is a major step forward for Canada with respect to the management of nuclear fuel waste over the long term.  The bill is the culmination of more than 25 years of research, environmental assessment and extensive consultations with stakeholders including waste owners, the province, the public and aboriginal organizations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of Canadians who voiced their views want a solution to the issue.  They are looking to the Government of Canada to establish a clear, fair and comprehensive strategy to make effective progress.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-27 is entirely consistent with the Government of Canada's radioactive waste policy framework of 1996. That policy framework makes clear that the government's objective is to ensure radioactive waste is disposed of in a safe, environmentally sound, comprehensive, cost effective and integrated manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will  be perfectly clear.  Government oversight of the health, safety, environment and security aspects of long term management of nuclear fuel waste has long been provided through the 1945 Atomic Energy Control Act.  This act was strengthened and replaced by the Nuclear Safety and Control Act which entered into force on May 31, 2000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed nuclear fuel waste act is needed to implement the Government of Canada's radioactive waste policy framework and ensure  waste management operations are carried out in a comprehensive, cost effective and integrated manner which includes financial, social, ethical, socioeconomic and other broader considerations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should parliament assent to Bill C-27 it would be complementary to the Nuclear  Safety and Control Act.  Together both acts would ensure waste management activities are carried out in a safe, environmentally sound, comprehensive and integrated manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the general principles established in the policy framework arose the specific requirements that are the backbone of the legislation  before us.  At the outset we wanted to ensure we  heard the views and interests of stakeholders and  strove to achieve an appropriate balance among competing priorities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a challenging task and not one reached rapidly or in haste, however, an acceptable balance was achieved. I am confident this legislative framework would assist in making effective progress toward the implementation of a solution in the best interest of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-27 would build on the good work of the nuclear fuel waste and disposal concept environmental assessment panel, or the Seaborn panel, and the government's response to it.  The Seaborn panel carried out a comprehensive decade long review and Canada-wide public consultations.  The panel made recommendations to the government, most of which were adopted as outlined in the government's response to the Seaborn report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterate our appreciation for the work carried out by panel members and the chair.  We are thankful for their dedication in listening to all the views Canadians wished to convey.  The government took seriously the work of the panel whose  recommendations impacted significantly on the formation of government policy.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has the public reacted to Bill C-27?  There has been overwhelming support for legislation to deal with  the long term management of nuclear fuel waste. Nonetheless concerns have been raised with respect to some of the details of Bill C-27.  Members of the public have expressed concern that the government did not adopt the Seaborn recommendation to create a crown corporation to carry out the long term management of nuclear fuel waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seaborn panel stated that  various plausible organizational scenarios existed, each with advantages and disadvantages.  It concluded that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Whatever structure is chosen, however, the agency’s purposes, responsibilities and accountability must be spelled out as clearly and explicitly as possible, whether by legislation or in a charter of incorporation.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with past and current Canadian practices Bill C-27 would place primary onus for operations on the industry. This would be accompanied by appropriate government oversight.  The government would exercise general oversight over the waste management organization established by the nuclear industry.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach has been chosen to allow us to move forward effectively.  It would provide for a clear separation between those who carry out operations and those who regulate them, thus avoiding conflicts of interest. Similarly the waste management organization would be responsible for establishing and financing a credible and effective advisory council.  Oversight would be exercised through the bill's transparency requirements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing the oversight provisions of Bill C-27, care was taken to harmonize them with the federal oversight powers of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act which  would be exercised over the long term in managing nuclear fuel waste. Not only did we ensure there would be multiple government oversight mechanisms at play as recommended by the Seaborn pane, we assured ourselves that no undue overlap or duplication would occur among the mechanisms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We   have heard the public's call for transparency.  Members of the public  want to participate in important decisions that affect their lives and those of their children.  Bill C-27 would provide for mandatory transparency.  This was recommended by the Seaborn panel and agreed to by the Government of Canada as an essential condition for increasing public confidence.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, all waste management organization reports submitted to the minister, including the initial study of options, would be made public.  The waste management organization would need to carry out public consultations at every stage of the process.  All the advisory council's comments regarding the waste management organization's reports would need to be made public.  The government would have additional consultation requirements under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How have the affected utilities and provinces received Bill C-27?  The main owners of nuclear fuel waste have conveyed to the government and  the House committee that they welcome the increased regulatory certainty the legislation would provide.  Bill C-27 would provide them with a clear framework to fulfill their responsibilities. The bill would not create an unmanageable financial burden.  Small waste owners noted that the waste management organization would be required to provide them with services at a reasonable cost.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing the legislation the government consulted  Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, which are the affected provinces.  We addressed many of their concerns.  We showed as much flexibility as possible without compromising the Government of Canada's policy objectives for federal oversight. The provinces recognized that development and control of nuclear energy falls under federal jurisdiction. They were all supportive of the bill's principles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How have aboriginal peoples engaged in the process?  Aboriginal peoples have shown considerable interest in this federal initiative.  The Minister of Natural Resources has sought their active participation in future steps regarding the long term management of nuclear fuel waste.  They participated extensively in the Seaborn public hearings. The Minister of Natural Resources has met with a number of aboriginal leaders to discuss how they wish to be consulted on the next steps.  The active involvement of aboriginal peoples would be recognized and ensured by Bill C-27. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to requiring the input of traditional knowledge from affected aboriginal communities during future siting phases, the bill would require the government to continue to carry out parallel consultations pursuant to its fiduciary responsibility.  The Government of Canada recognizes the valuable perspectives and insights of aboriginal peoples.</p>

Amendments were proposed and the committee recommended Bill C-27  be amended to include traditional aboriginal knowledge and expertise on the advisory council before the governor in council selects an approach for the long term management of nuclear fuel waste.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the immediate impact after entry into force of the nuclear fuel waste act? The trust fund would be kick-started and the waste management organization would begin preparing its study. This report must be submitted to the government within three years. The study would include a comparison of risks and benefits of each option.  The waste management organization must examine those options explicitly outlined in Bill C-27 but would not be limited to those options and may propose others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several stakeholders and some members of the House committee doubted whether three years would be enough time for the waste management organization to carry out the required work for the study.  In this regard it should be noted that the Seaborn panel suggested that two years  would be sufficient.  Like Seaborn, the Government of Canada requires the study to contain sufficient information to compare options and decide on the most acceptable long term management approach for Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After consultations, it was concluded that a three year period was  appropriate in view of all the work that has already been done in Canada and elsewhere.  It is now time to move forward.  Utilities have been made aware of potential legislation for several years and have already started work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the administration of the act? The bill indicates that the Minister of Natural Resources would be responsible for the administration of the nuclear fuel waste act.  The department would be the focal point for interdepartmental consideration of technical, financial, social and ethical reviews and for any independent reviews that might be necessary. The department would provide the government's direct and indirect liaison with the waste management organization, the public, the provinces, aboriginal groups and other interested parties.  The department would ensure compliance with the nuclear fuel waste act.  It would manage all auditing, verification, inspection and enforcement measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key aspect of Bill C-27 is its focus on a transparent process.  Modern regulation seeks to involve the active  participation of the public and to make clear the decision making role of the elected government.  The activities of the nuclear utilities, the waste management organization and the minister are to be made transparent. The information should be made easily and promptly available to the public. Operations would be audited effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard the oversight approach taken in the bill is based on strong transparency requirements while leaving the organizing and implementation of the operations with the nuclear industry, combined with effective government oversight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Bill C-27 address the broader nuclear energy policy issues? The nuclear energy option attracts interest on broad matters, for example, the appropriate mix and supply of available energy resources, sustainable development of energy projects, the social impact of high technology and globalization, the export or import of waste, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and, more recently, acts of terrorism.  These are serious issues but all fall outside of the scope of this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the issues I just mentioned, I will highlight one that commanded a lot of attention during the House standing committee review, namely the export and import of nuclear fuel waste.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some talk about Canada becoming the dumping ground of the world for nuclear fuel waste.  Let me assure the House that the government's first concern is to deal with nuclear fuel waste generated in Canada.  There are no plans either to import or to export nuclear fuel waste.  Bill C-27 was not designed to address these practices.  Should they ever be considered in the future, there are existing federal mechanisms which would allow full public consultation and would guarantee that any application would not pose any unreasonable risk to health, safety, security and the environment of Canada. The two main mechanisms are the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing broader  public policy matters must not serve as an excuse for delaying our current responsibilities for the long term management of nuclear fuel waste.  Ensuring appropriate waste management is a laudable objective in its own right.  We already have nuclear fuel waste currently in storage at nuclear  reactor sites.  Storage activities are safe but are not designed to be permanent solutions.  No longer are there any good excuses for delaying what our generation, which benefits from nuclear power, must do to deal with the waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we conclude at this time on Bill C-27? This legislation is the culmination of years of work and was not established in a contextual vacuum. Policy development was guided by extensive consultations with all stakeholders by modern regulatory practices, social justice concepts and by experience gained in other countries.  Policy development was influenced by the invaluable work of the Seaborn panel, including contributions of all those Canadians who actively and conscientiously participated in the public hearings.</p>


	<A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1545)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a phased, step-wise, decision making process allowing for all planned and executed waste management operations to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and for the public to participate effectively at every step along the way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing a solution will take many years and will possibly affect future generations. The focus of legislation is on the responsibility of today's generation while at the same time allowing sufficient flexibility to allow decision making by future generations. Much progress has been made internationally on implementing a solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for the government in developing legislation was to be fair to all stakeholders and to strike an effective balance in the public interest. I firmly believe that the proposed legislation fully meets the challenge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this legislative framework, Canada will be able to move ahead effectively in a reasoned fashion toward the implementation of an appropriate solution for the long term management of nuclear fuel waste and take into account not only the technical matters but incorporate in a central and integral way the social and ethical values of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward very much to parliament's approval of this very important bill.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have this final opportunity to speak on Bill C-27.  I have  been involved in the process of the bill, which  has been in the works for months and years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, it is my position, and the position of my party, that the bill does achieve some important things and certainly is worthy of support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get into the analysis of the bill, I want to express some of my frustration with the process that brought us to this point today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech of the  member on the government side of the House is part of that frustration.  During the hearing  of witnesses who expressed their concerns and on whose concerns we based that amendments,   I never saw that member present.   I very much suspect the speech  he just presented was drafted within the bureaucracy of the department and presented here just as the bill was.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of my frustration is the way the process works and the mockery it makes of democracy.  There are so many better ways to deal with the development of legislation, which  would result in better legislation  that would better reflect the concerns of a broader section of the Canadian public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill came to parliament, then went to committee. At  committee, we went through the process of calling in countless expert witnesses on the issues.  They presented their concerns, their analyses and how the bill could be made better.  Then we went into the  clause by clause process.  Some 70 amendments were proposed  based on what a lot of us heard from those witnesses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  we presented those suggested amendments and  concerns  in committee, the entire government side of the committee sat like a bunch of posts and refused to debate or engage in any discussion about the bill and the rationale for the amendments.  Instead, the bureaucrats from the department, who  wrote the bill and understood what was  in it, sat at the end of the table and  answered those questions.  That was a very frustrating process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be done in other ways that would include all parties of the House in a committee setting, with experts from the various departments,  such as justice, technical, et cetera.  Together we could sit down,  draft a bill and enter into some discussion as to why it should be done this way or that  way and how the bill could be made as good as it possibly could. That just does not happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed as though the members of the government side of the committee table were so arrogant that  felt they did not need to enter into any discussion because, in the interests of time and expediency, they would simply use their majority in  committee and in the House to pass the bill whether we liked it or not.  Perhaps they did  not understand the bill and the implications of the sections for which  we suggested  some amendments and therefore passed off the responsibility to respond to those things to the departmental experts at the end of the table.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the case, it truly was a frustrating process.   I find the same frustration over and over again whenever we get into a bill that falls within my area as critic of natural resources.  It seems to be a practice that repeats itself over and over again.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been here for over eight years. There certainly has not been any demonstrated desire to give elected members of parliament any degree of authority or any real input in the development of legislation which we will all have to live by for many years to come.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having vented my frustrations with all of those things, I will proceed to  discuss  the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of merit in the bill.  It deals with an area that we in Canada have needed  to address for a long time.  As the member opposite suggested, this is a process that has been going on for 25 years in Canada without any resolution. Bill C-27  takes us a little way toward some resolution of the problem of nuclear waste disposal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part the bill is a reflection of the recommendations of the Seaborn panel which did an excellent job in its study and its recommendations on how we should handle this matter.   It did not comply in a number of ways that would have had merit and would have made the bill better.  The  Seaborn panel suggested strongly  to have some kind of outside independent oversight over the waste management organization.    The government for whatever reason chose not to do it that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-27 reflects some of the recommendations made by the disposal concept environmental assessment panel   and presented to the Minister of Natural Resources and the Minister of the Environment in February 1998.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some might imagine that an issue as important as the management and disposal of nuclear fuel waste would have fast tracked its way through the House of Commons. However,  we saw those recommendations back in 1998 and here we are in 2001, almost 2002, and only now are we at third reading  stage of this important bill. Despite the time lag, the bill has a lot of merit.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's nuclear industry has stood alone for many years because of the fact that the industry does not have a producer pay approach to the cleanup of waste products.  Other industries, particularly other industries within natural resources,  have had to concern themselves with the cleanup of potentially dangerous or damaging materials and have similar funds built into a condition of their licensing.  It is  common  within the industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those costs are so well ingrained within most industries that the fact that the nuclear industry has never had that requirement probably has raised concerns in many parts of Canada for many years.  The legislation will finally put the nuclear industry on a par with other resource industries in its requirement to be financially and morally responsible for the disposal of hazardous waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that by using this piece of legislation the government intends to create an accountable management system for the long term management and disposal of nuclear fuel waste.  I would quantify that to restrict it to high level nuclear fuel waste. I can only hope that the road  the government chooses to take is not just paved with good intentions. I hope  that the bill will quickly lead us to some concrete action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to see that the major players in the industry, namely, Atomic Energy  of Canada Limited, or AECL as it is known, Ontario Power Generation, Hydro-Québec and New Brunswick Power Corporation are all involved in the process. The bill will ensure that this collective group will be required to establish a waste management organization that will implement the long term management of nuclear fuel waste.</p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other concerns, which we heard a lot of talk of  in committee and from the previous speaker, is the need for transparency. There is at least the transparency of the requirement to table the studies and the annual reports of the waste management organization, and I was glad to see that.  However any time  it is suggested in the bill that there is a responsibility either to report to, or for the governor in council to make a decision on, it makes me a little nervous. I think it makes a lot of  Canadians nervous. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that only by allowing members of cabinet to make final decisions with no role for parliament in those decisions, especially on something as important as nuclear fuel waste, it opens a decision to Liberal insider trading. Certainly we saw  a lot of that yesterday in the auditor general's report. It is a reasonably common phenomenon. Who knows what friends the governor in council might have in the business of nuclear fuel waste disposal. It could of course present some very lucrative contracts to individuals who are running the right business at the right time and of course have made the right levels of contributions to the Liberal Party of Canada. That is a legitimate concern, a concern backed up as I said by some of the comments of the auditor general yesterday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the major owners and producers of nuclear fuel waste have to establish a trust fund and make set annual payments into that trust fund to finance the long term management of the waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the new waste management organization has the responsibility to determine fiscally responsible, realistic options for the long term management of nuclear fuel waste. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once these options are determined, they will then be presented to the governor in council through the minister, who will then make a choice as to the best approach. That decision having been made, the waste management organization may, and I emphasize the word may, then move forward to waste disposal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most outstanding weaknesses of the bill is that once the report is done, the trust fund is set up, the study is done and the recommendations are made to the minister, there is really no assurance  that will require the waste management organization to proceed with implementation of any of the chosen options.  We could sit on this issue for another 10 years before anything concrete was done. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the waste management organization may identify a technically feasible process for disposing of nuclear fuel waste, it may find, as the Seaborn panel did and as the department has for a number of years, that while technically the idea is acceptable, it simply cannot find a location, a community or a province that will allow such a facility in its backyard. It is a well known fact that it is hard enough in this day and age to find something as simple as a nuisance ground, a non-toxic waste disposal site if you will, for the huge amounts of urban garbage that we produce. It is very difficult to find a site that is acceptable for those kinds of facilities. It is no small feat to find a community anywhere that will jump at the opportunity to accept the kind of facility that we are proposing for the disposal of nuclear fuel waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key recommendations of the Seaborn report that appeared in the legislation is the need for an independent advisory board.  I referred to that suggestion earlier.  In the Seaborn report the advisory council would be given the responsibility of ensuring openness and transparency of nuclear fuel waste management, particularly in areas related to public and aboriginal participation, environmental assessment, monitoring, mediation and dispute settlements.  Furthermore, the Seaborn panel recommended that the agency should be heavily involved in all stages of the agency's work and options for long term management.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to see that the government has incorporated the general idea of an advisory council in the legislation. However it concerns me and others on the committee and others in the public that the original spirit of the council seems to have been lost in the translation into this legislation.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see there is little in the bill that structures the advisory council to be the watchdog of the agency. In fact it seems to me that the council is to be given a much smaller role than what the Seaborn panel recommended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's record on openness and transparency when it comes to governor in council appointments is not good.  There simply is not another word for it.  The Seaborn panel made solid recommendations to enable the agency to be an open, honest, transparent and accountable organization, yet the government seems unwilling to open up its process to that kind of scrutiny or that kind of input. I must confess that it makes me wonder exactly how the government intends to set this whole process up if it is unwilling to ensure transparency and accountability from the very beginning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously a key area of the bill is the process by which a method of disposal of nuclear fuel waste will be chosen.  As described by the bill, within three years of the coming into force of the act, the waste management organization shall submit to the minister a study setting out its proposed approaches for the management of nuclear fuel waste along with the comments of the advisory council on those approaches, as well as the organization's  recommendations as to which of its proposed approaches should be adopted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realistically, and this is reflected in the legislation, there are only three real choices for the disposal of nuclear fuel waste.  The idea that the waste management organization has a broad range of options to study, examine and recommend really is not  realistic. There are three choices, those being deep geological disposal in the Canadian Shield, storage in a nuclear reactor site, or centralized storage either above or below ground. The only feasible one is  the first one, the deep geological disposal in the Canadian Shield, with some variations as to how that is done and whether it is absolutely permanent or  is a type of storage system that will allow reclaiming of that buried fuel waste if technology should come along in the future that would allow for a better method of disposal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly  we already have above ground storage at the nuclear reactor sites. We have   had in the past to some degree some centralized storage at some of those sites as well.  The very fact is that the industry and Canadians and a number of the panels that made recommendations do not deem what is presently taking place as being acceptable in the long term. At  least in my opinion that narrows the choices down to the one that was looked at and the one which the Seaborn panel suggested was technically feasible.  The problem was there was no public support to allow that proposal to go ahead.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Seaborn panel, whichever method the waste management agency chose, the choice had to meet several key safety and acceptability criteria.  To be considered, the concept must have broad public support and, as I suggested, that is not the case. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be safe from both a technical and a social perspective.  That criteria seems to be at least within reach. It has to have been developed within a sound ethical and social assessment framework.  There has been a lot of good work done but   I am not sure that particular criteria has been met at this point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to have the support of aboriginal  people. We heard at committee that this support is certainly not there at this time. Some very stringent conditions  were placed on that support being forthcoming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be  selected after comparison with the risks, costs and benefits of the other options.  As I said, the other options are very limited.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be advanced by a stable and trustworthy proponent and overseen by a trustworthy regulator. I suggest it has yet to be determined if the waste management organization could be deemed to be a trustworthy proponent.  I certainly hope it would.</p>


	<A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those on this side of the House, at least, and I think a fair number of people across the country who would question whether the government is in fact a trustworthy regulator of this system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that in some ways it is the first of those conditions that will be the most difficult to meet. Having broad public support on an issue such as this where there is such a strong sense of “not in my backyard” will be a truly tough obstacle for this  agency to overcome.  Of course there are also a number of other conditions  which,  as I said, will be some challenge to meet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice, according to the Seaborn panel, must:  demonstrate robustness in meeting appropriate regulatory requirements;  be based on thorough and participatory scenario analyses; use realistic data, modelling and natural analogues; incorporate sound science and good practices; and demonstrate flexibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we will not know until the report comes to the minister and then becomes public whether in fact the chosen one will meet those criteria.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly hope that any organization working with nuclear fuel would already have the stringent safety regulations and good practices, but even that is in some question considering the conditions under which Ontario Hydro had to shut down a number of  its nuclear reactors.  That process was forced upon it not by Canada's own industry regulators but by a U.S. industry inspector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There certainly are  a number of concerns about the stringent safety regulations and the compliance with those regulations and good practices and they will remain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key issues this agency will have to contend with is the question of how safe is safe enough, taking into consideration different technical and social perspectives. Nuclear scientists are likely to have views on the issue that are very different  from those on  the environmentalist side of the equation, yet somehow, if the plan is to go forward, both groups must be made to feel comfortable with and  accepting of this plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can tell the only really viable course of action for the long term disposal and management of nuclear fuel waste is that which has been proposed by AECL, that is, the deep geological disposal in the Canadian Shield.  However, as I mentioned, in its study the Seaborn panel  concluded that it seems to meet the requirement from a technical perspective and states that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—safety of the AECL concept has been on balance adequately demonstrated from a conceptual stage of development, but from a social perspective, it has not.  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the study concluded that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—the AECL concept for deep geological disposal has not been demonstrated to have broad public support.  The concept in its current form does not have the required level of acceptability to be adopted as Canada's approach for managing nuclear fuel waste.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know only too well how the government likes to operate when there are contentious matters that do not have public support.  A perfect example is the MOX fuel that was flown into Chalk River without any sort of public support after numerous towns, cities, native communities and the Ontario provincial government raised their opposition to the MOX plutonium test plan. Without any public notice, and showing complete disregard for public concerns, the government went ahead and flew in the MOX for the test.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the government to take a more responsible, measured and, frankly, more reasonable approach to nuclear fuel waste management.  There is simply too much at stake to just put a stranglehold on opponents of the proposal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said at the beginning of my comments, I am pleased that the legislation has finally come to the House and that the government seems to have taken to heart most of the recommendations of the Seaborn report.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee discussions on the bill were certainly interesting and could have been even more interesting if we had had a little more participation from the government side.  Not surprisingly, the government did not allow any opposition amendments to the bill,  which could have been to the benefit of the waste management agency as well as  all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I do have hopes that the good intentions of the bill will actually turn into solid, responsible legislation I am not convinced that the government intends to follow through with total accountability and openness.  The bill certainly has merit, and while I am pleased to see that the government has finally taken action on this issue, I believe more should have been done with the bill.   Consequently,  with some reservations, we will be supporting the passage of Bill C-27.</p>

	Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today to address Bill C-27, an act respecting the long-term management of nuclear fuel waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I spoke on Bill C-10, an act respecting the national marine conservation areas of Canada. My Bloc Quebecois colleagues also addressed Bill C-36, the anti-terrorism act, and Bill C-42, the public safety act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain from the outset   what  issues I will discuss over the next 40 minutes. First, I must point out that this government constantly displayed a confrontational attitude, despite the fact that Bloc Quebecois members were committed to  co-operating regarding this bill,  whether at second reading, during the review in committee, or at report stage. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois, which acted in good faith at all stages of the parliamentary process, was always told by Liberal members opposite no, no, no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, I will again directly address my constituents and all Quebecers and Canadians. We feel that Bill C-27 is incomplete. It lacks transparency and it does not take into account public opinion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, we could have said no right from the beginning and made things complicated for the government, but no, we felt that we had to give our support at second reading in order to improve the bill in committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during the review in committee, when we heard witnesses and when the time came to amend the bill, Liberal members sitting on the committee said no, no, no, without really knowing what the issue was all about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about the management of the country's nuclear fuel waste. I was stunned to the hear the Liberal member for Frontenac—Mégantic say, as he was leaving a meeting, that plutonium and uranium were no more dangerous than asbestos. The chair of the standing committee on natural resources and member for Nickel Belt also made a similar comment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious matter.  We heard many witnesses at the standing committee on natural resources.  My colleague, the hon. member for Sherbrooke and Bloc Quebecois critic in this area, has done an excellent job, with some contribution from myself, in his desire to improve this bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, however, that the Liberal members of the committee did not have any idea what we or the witnesses were talking about.  At that time, and still today, we were addressing nuclear waste, precisely, 24,000 tonnes of uranium and plutonium which will remain radioactive for some 25,000 years.   This has nothing in common  with asbestos.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I hear comments like that, I feel there is no point in talking to the Liberal MPs.  They heard all the same things we did, but understood nothing.  I think they were there with their ears and eyes firmly closed.  The only thing they could say was no, no.  That was all we got out of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore continue to talk to our audience instead.  Despite what the Liberal committee members have said, the taxpayers of Canada and Quebec are very much attuned to what is going on as far as waste in general is concerned, and nuclear waste in particular.  I feel their judgment is far superior to that of the Liberals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Bill C-27 all about?  The whole thing dates back to 1989, when the Minister of the Environment of the day mandated the nuclear fuel waste and disposal environmental assessment commission, known as the  Seaborn panel, from the name of its chair, to  come up with a concept for the permanent storage of this country's nuclear waste. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to digress for a moment. It would be mistaken to mix things and say that the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-27. The Bloc  supports strict management of nuclear waste. This is a matter of huge importance, and the government has not bothered in recent years to resolve it. The situation has continued, and today we realize that problem must be solved, but not at any cost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main recommendations of the Seaborn panel were that an agency be established that would hold public hearings and propose a type of management for this country's nuclear waste. It recommended as well that the cost of this country's waste management be assumed by the nuclear energy industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there in Bill C-27? Does it follow the letter of the recommendations of the Seaborn report? We must remember that the Minister of Natural Resources was drawing on the recommendations of the Seaborn report when he said he was going to draft the bill. This, however, is not what the chair of the standing committee on natural resources said to me. He said that the Seaborn report is outdated. I think the Seaborn report is very important. The Seaborn panel was independent. It lasted 10 years, cost a small fortune, but it has given us guidelines for the successful management of nuclear waste.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management is to be independent of the nuclear energy industry. As the committee studied the matter,  the Bloc Quebecois proposed a number of amendments  to bring Bill C-27 closer to the conclusions of the Seaborn panel. Contrary to what the Minister of Natural Resources said in his speech at second reading, his bill bears no relation to the main recommendations of the panel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Seaborn panel recommended that energy companies be excluded from the management committee that would propose a form of nuclear waste management.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look just at recommendation 6.1.2, which advocates the creation of a nuclear fuel waste management agency. It reads as follows: </p>


	<p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still quoting the Seaborn panel: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—a fresh  start must be made in the form of a new agency. The agency must be at arm's length from the producers and current owners of the waste. Its overall commitment must be to safety.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-27 specifies that energy companies will have to establish a management committee to propose to the minister a long term nuclear fuel waste management concept.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a situation is tantamount to opening the henhouse door wide open to let  the fox  in. As far as the Bloc Quebecois is concerned, recommendation 6.1.2 should be fully implemented. Unfortunately, the Liberal government rejected it out of hand. Incidentally, a number of witnesses who appeared before the standing committee on natural resources also asked that Bill C-27 be amended to reflect that recommendation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote a few.  Irene Kock, a research consultant with the Sierra Club of Canada, testified before the committee on November 8, 2001. She said, and I quote: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Seaborn panel recommended that an independent agency be formed at arm's length from AECL and the nuclear utilities in order to manage the programs related to long-term nuclear fuel waste management, including detailed comparison of waste management options. The waste management organization must be at arm's length from the nuclear industry. This is a very key part of the recommendations from the Seaborn panel. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the Bloc Quebecois who says it. All the witnesses said the same thing to the committee.  Irene Kock added “It was a very well thought out conclusion and must be incorporated in this legislation”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote from another testimony, namely that of Brennain Lloyd, a co-ordinator for Northwatch, who also testified on November 8, 2001:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The context is that there have been a number of experiences on the part of the public with Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, and with the nuclear industries more generally, specific to this issue of nuclear waste management and related siting processes. They've been very negative experiences for the greatest part, and that needs to be kept in mind.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was warning the government about certain past experiences. Ms. Lloyd went on to say that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The resulting mistrust and apprehension on the part of the public must be kept in constant consideration...Third, the waste management organization lacks independence. Given the track record of a number of the agencies that are proposed to be involved, that's particularly problematic. The panel was clear that the waste management organization must be independent and it must be perceived to be independent. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It said an independent agency, not an industry agency. This would be an  industry agency. This in fact is what Bill C-27 proposes: a management committee composed of members of industry. This can only be problematic in terms of delivery, the ability to look more broadly at the issues, and the ability to engender public trust and engagement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois therefore proposed that paragraph 6(2) be amended as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>No nuclear energy corporation may be a member or shareholder of the waste management organization.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what did the Liberal members say? No, no, no.</p>


	<A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not lost our sense of humour or our desire to see the government make this bill into something that would be what the Seaborn panel and the general public wanted. We proposed other amendments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could talk all day about the amendments which the Bloc Quebecois proposed in committee. There were, and the member for Sherbrooke is nodding, between 40 and 45. The New Democratic Party and the Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative Coalition also moved amendments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But each time, the committee, which was chaired by a Liberal member and contained a Liberal majority, said no, no, no. At every stage of the process, they said they were right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the Canadian Alliance member spoke about the fact that the public had to be consulted, but it is plainly written in the bill that the governor in council “may”. In other words, it is not required. When you are told “you may do something”  you always have a choice.  The majority prevails. If one says “I have everything I need” or “I do not have what I need”, I am going to go ahead.  In this case, what it says is that the public may be consulted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of the very moving times we went through in the summer of 2000, when this government wanted to import MOX fuel from Russia and the U.S.  I stood up to this, all five feet, five inches of me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Saguenay--Lac-Saint-Jean, hon. members will recall, were on side with me on this.  A total of 99.9% of my constituents said they were opposed to the  importing of MOX.  Some 120  municipalities throughout Quebec and a number of  regional county municipalities did the same.  The Quebec government and the aboriginal peoples voiced their opposition.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic Energy of Canada officials  came to the region, telling us that this was just a little rod that went into a big cylinder.  They made it out to be such a wonderful and attractive thing that I would have been happy to have it as a decoration in my living room.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away we went to consult people. This is not  an expensive proposition, and it provides us with an opportunity to speak to people concerned by a problem.  We talked to the experts.  We asked their opinions.  We also consulted the Quebec department of health.  We even went to a university, along with our regional environmental committee, and held an information session.  We invited three experts, who told us that the concept of importing MOX and the method planned for its transportation were not safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to U.S. studies, this concept was not acceptable because it was not 100% sure.  Afterward, people were entitled to make comments via the Atomic Energy of Canada website, and this took some 28 days.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So 99.9% of those in our region were opposed. Nevertheless, they went ahead and did it.  One fine evening, I am not sure exactly when, the MOX shipment set out.  Everyone was on the alert.  We have the Bagotville military base in our area.  They said they were going to bring the shipment in via CFB  Bagotville or an Ontario military base.  Let us remember that   the MOX was headed for the Chalk River nuclear facility in Ontario.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night—and I know because I took a stroll near  the military base in Bagotville—there was quite a  flurry of activity. We did not know when the big day would be, but people from national defence, from public safety and from the health sector were there. There was this flurry of activity. And yet, officials from Atomic Energy of Canada  told us, when they came to see us, that there was no danger. </p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was all the commotion about if there was no danger and if it was not serious, as they said at the time? Everyone was on edge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went ahead and they took it to Chalk River. This proves the government's attitude, that they went ahead despite what everyone thought. In my riding, it was a very strong majority. I held my own consultations. Representatives of Atomic Energy of Canada were in one room and I was in another,  that the hotel where the  consultation was taking place graciously let me use.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going into the room with the Atomic Energy of Canada representatives, people came to see me and sign a petition. They would then come back from the consultation and say to me, “Ms. Bujold, if I could, I would sign the petition twice. I am not sure about what they are saying”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can see just how important the issue of nuclear waste is. We must consult with people. But this is not reflected in this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must manage our nuclear waste, because it our waste. We have to store it in a way such that it remains inactive for many years to come. Most of the waste that is currently being stored is at nuclear reactors located in Ontario. There are 24,000 tonnes of nuclear waste being stored there. That is a lot of nuclear waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot count on the goodwill of a management committee that says it is the representative of these companies that are going to manage the storage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, elected members who represent people,  must be kept informed of what is happening. We need to challenge them and say “Show us what you are going to say and do. We will accept it or reject it on behalf of our constituents, because we have been democratically elected.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee we proposed a clause to the government which stated that members would have to be consulted in the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, you are a member like me. When we run for election we say to our constituents “I am going to represent you on all issues. I am able to represent you. If I cannot represent you, I will consult with you and you will give me your opinion”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People know that whether we are talking about domestic, nuclear or other kinds of waste, we must not become the world's dump. Nobody wants to have any kind of wastes in their backyard. We always say “Not in my backyard”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to reassure the public, we had asked the government that the plan be submitted here, in the House of Commons. What did the Liberals say? They said no, no and no. They refuse to be accountable to the people who elected them on a most important issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think this is being very transparent. Since we have been sitting in this House, we have noticed that when introducing bills the government always says that it will listen to us, that it will refer the bill to committee for further study, that it will hear witnesses and be open to amendments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That did not happen for Bill C-27. Nor did it happen for Bill C-36, Bill C-44 or Bill C-42. Who does this government take people for, particularly those people who represent all  those who did not vote for the Liberals and that the Liberals no longer represent? I am talking about opposition parties. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking of people who take the trouble to appear before the committee. I recall that on the last day, before the committee began  to examine the bill clause by clause, the mayors of Ontario municipalities came before it.  They were involved with this issue because there are nuclear plants in their municipalities. They came to say to the committee “We have to be informed and be part of the development of management. We are involved on the front line because we have to protect our people”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member from the Progressive Conservative Democratic Representative Coalition proposed an amendment in this regard, and the members of the Liberal Party once again said no, no, no.</p>


	<A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also pointed out that consideration should be given to having people representing the native communities on the committee. Some witnesses said that it was important that these communities be consulted. There are not just the experts, there are ordinary citizens as well, who have some expertise in this regard. The answer was no, no, no. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should call them the no, no, no gang. This is what comes out as soon as opposition members introduce something intelligent. Initially they suggest that a bill be drafted. Officials then draft it. Then the minister or members representing the Liberal majority in committee must defend it. Most of the time, I think they do not even know what the subject is and this is unfortunate because it is extremely important.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not only yesterday that I started being concerned about nuclear waste and all sorts of waste that we import from the United States and elsewhere. The Bloc Quebecois even asked, through an amendment it put forward, to have the bill provide that we manage our own waste and contain a clause banning the importing of waste from elsewhere. This amendment too was rejected. The Liberal members said no, no, no and yet we know how important this is.     </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seaborn panel was set up by people who wanted to do something about an issue that had been dragging on for years. It took time to write the report. The panel made excellent recommendations. The Minister of Natural Resources, whom I really like, seemed to show goodwill. He had said from the beginning, and I believed him,“I rely on the reports of the Seaborn panel”. But over time he made an about-face.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I cannot  make sense of the bill. There are many Quebecers and Canadians who will also be lost. Why? Because when it is passed, they will no longer be consulted. It will be the governor in council who will consult, because he  “may” do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first recommendation of the Seaborn panel was that the public should be consulted on any nuclear waste management principle. This is what should have been done. That was the panel's first recommendation. This is the one recommendation that should have served as a basis for all the other ones. The government ignored the one recommendation that should have been taken into account with this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had it not been disregarded, I would have told myself “At least the government is taking this issue seriously. It is not doing this to please people who are close to the powers that be. No, it is really presenting a bill that will reassure Canadians and Quebecers”. I would have welcomed this initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat on the Standing Committee on the Environment for two years. When good things were happening, I would always say to the minister and the Liberal members “Yes, we will co-operate, because when it comes to the environment we have to co-operate to advance government initiatives”. That was always my attitude during these two years, and things worked well. When I did not agree with something, I said so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is now at third reading. Yesterday we voted on the last amendments at report stage. The Bloc Quebecois presented four amendments. They were not even examined. They were rejected out of hand. It was time to do something about this issue, but the government should act in the respect of people, of the public.</p>


	<A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what the government is doing. This bill will be studied by the other place, and I hope that they will be able to do what the Liberal government has not done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a bill, such an issue, must not be dealt with casually, as we have seen. I was not present for all of the hearings, but my colleague, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, was. He told me “It makes no sense. There are so many things going on; the witnesses that are appearing are only talking about the Seaborn report. They thought that the government wanted to implement the recommendations”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we bring in witnesses in as a formality, or are we there to listen to them? Most of them are experts. Sometimes, regular citizens can become experts. They came in good faith to warn this government about the problems with this bill. They came and said “We are warning you; listen to us, introduce amendments. It needs to be done properly”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Liberals did what they did to the opposition: they turned a deaf ear. They turned deaf and blind. As far as they were concerned, it was no, no, no. Their  answers were dictated by the minister's instructions and the  overall bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very disappointed for the people of the riding of Jonquière, which I represent, and I am also very disappointed for future generations. I have grandchildren, two boys. My daughter has given me two beautiful grandsons aged 5 and 3. Tomorrow, I do not want to tell my grandsons “You know, grandma could have done something. She tried, but nobody on the other side listened to her”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very disappointed because they are the ones who will have to live with the results of our lack of action on December 5, 2001. We will have failed to convince the government to change Bill C-27 into the bill that we wanted at the outset.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sad situation.  The holiday season is upon us, and in 20 days it will be Christmas.  This is a time of celebration,  a time for enjoyment, for spending good times together, but I will be using that opportunity to tell my constituents “We did everything we could to get the government to listen to us, but to no avail.  It is doing as it pleases, and it is not even interested in consulting you”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this government sees itself as the one possessing the truth.  Of all those listening to us today, there is not one who possesses the whole truth.  When one has an idea in mind, one must take into consideration the opinion of those who want to caution us, who tell us “Take care, there, don't go in that direction.  I have proof of my stand, just listen to me and I will tell you why”.  We need to listen to others if we are members of parliament.  Otherwise, we would be better off elsewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that all members of this House, be they Liberals or opposition members, should have that ability to listen to others, yet  in the standing committee on natural resources, I could see that the government MPs lacked that ability.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a great disappointment to me, because today we are forced to acknowledge that we could have done something worthwhile, something to advance a cause that involves everyone.  Last week, my colleague from Sherbrooke told me that there were people in one region discussing bringing in waste from the United States to bury in their area.  One might also bring up a matter that we settled last year. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember this, Madam Speaker?  At the time, you were not the acting Speaker. They wanted to bury waste from the Toronto area in northern Ontario, near the Témiscamingue area in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, we set up   emergency hearings. The Minister of the Environment arranged for an environmental assessment to be done. People came to tell us that there were many irritants and they were right, so the government said that this would not be done and it was not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the witnesses who appeared before the committee at various times told us the same thing.  The city of Toronto was forced to back down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government could have done the same thing with Bill C-27.  It could have said “Yes, there are irritants”. We never said that this bill was all bad.  We said that there were things that were not what we were looking for and that the bill needed to be improved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are calling for consultation, management and a report to be tabled in the House.  The other day, we suggested the services of the Auditor General of Canada.  Yesterday she told us about what was going on with employment insurance and about the $75 that the government handed out before last year's election to individuals below a certain income. She told us about that. The auditor general is credible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government members refused.  They said that they want an independent auditor appointed by the governor in council.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our request for clarity demanded an answer, ut we can see beyond any doubt, and it is a shame to have to say this, and I am sad to do so, that there is no clarity.  Clarity is not a predominant characteristic of the Liberal government in this issue. I am sorry to see this because I am certain that there are members across the way who would have liked more clarity too, when they realize how little there is, and that they too hear from their constituents on the whole topic of waste. They are going to start looking at the bill and I hope that they will ask themselves what questions their constituents will have for them when they see this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not disappoint the people who elect us. We must ensure that issues as important as nuclear waste management are not relegated to the back burner, as a third, fourth, or fifth priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a top priority. We have done much harm to our planet in the past. Today it suffers from what we humans have inflicted upon it. With this bill, we had an opportunity to lessen the burden that we have placed on the  planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we did not. The  government turned a deaf ear and did not innovate. We hear the word innovate a lot. Today we need to innovate more and more. Since the events of September 11, the world has changed, I believe. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every weekend I meet a great number of constituents who always tell me, “You know, Jocelyne, we have changed since September 11. Our values are different.  We see things more clearly now and we to want to change the little day to day things that we overlooked”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill was an opportunity to change the little day to day things and allow us to finally keep an open mind and consider the winds of change on this very complex and difficult issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Bloc Quebecois can say that it is against this bill and that it will continue to oppose it. I hope that my speech will spark something in the members opposite. That is my wish.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to say that  I enjoy rising to speak to the  bill but that would  be dishonest. All the opposition parties were quite offended by the process  we were put through at committee stage with regard to the conduct around processing the bill. Although I am new to the House, I found this very difficult. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking to other members of other parties who sat on the committee,  the so-called democratic process was a real sham for all of them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have already heard from both the Alliance and the Bloc members,   over 75 amendments  were brought forward, on a bill that is not very  large, and not one, in whole or in part, was accepted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on behalf of all  opposition parties, there were some very appropriate amendments that would have significantly strengthened the bill and made it  more palatable  not only to the opposition parties but, more important, to  citizens of the country. However, not only was every amendment and any part of the amendment rejected,  it was rare to get any response from government members as to why the amendment was not appropriate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to put the conduct of the government in the context of what has happened with nuclear waste. It is not like it is a new field. It is not like we have not been studying this for quite some time as a society. It is not like we are going to come up with a solution tomorrow or anytime in the near future to properly deal with this waste. There is no sense of urgency, real or perceived, that is applicable in these circumstances. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of those bills and one of those issues that needed full consideration through the democratic process but  it did not even come close to that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try to set some of that background. As we all know, we began having a problem with how to deal with nuclear waste from the very inception of the development of nuclear weapons. However, there was a real hiatus during that period of time until we began developing nuclear sites for power purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the early 1970s, in this country and around the world, we knew we had a major problem with this power source in the form of not only radiation but of radioactive fuel waste. Every other country that has nuclear power is in the same situation.  No one has been able to come up with, in any fashion, an adequate means of dealing with nuclear waste. What it has led to, in a number of cases, is that countries have begun phasing out or stopping their use of nuclear power.  However, they still have  no solution for disposing the waste or, for that matter, what to do with the plants as they are decommissioned.</p>


	<A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some interesting research is going on now.  The scientific theory    is that  we may be able to run the fuel back through the process again and significantly reduce its volume or  to perhaps eliminate it completely.  However, we are literally years if not decades away from perfecting that if in fact we ever do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that no one on this planet knows  how to deal with nuclear waste.  We only know how to store it.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Atomic Energy Commission came up with a proposal called  deep geological disposal, or,    what I call it, dumping in the Canadian Shield. When the proposal surfaced it received such a  negative reaction that a further commission was appointed by the federal government.  It was called the Seaborn commission and it did its work over about a two to two and a half year period.    If nothing else came out of that,  it  was   that the  proposal for  deep geological disposal of waste was something that no one in Canada wanted: no community, no matter how small or large, would accept it.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seaborn commission  came to the conclusion that there was no trust in the country for  AECL with regard to a methodology for disposal.  The commission was very clear in its recommendations: that whatever steps we took as a country we had to build consultation into the methodology   so  we would build that trust in whatever community or communities would eventually end up with the waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the bill and the process  we went through.  The bill and the conduct of the committee were supposed to build trust.  Let me assure members it did not do that and it will not do that.  The bill has some major conflicts of interest built right into it.  The industries that create the waste will be the ones investigating and making recommendations to the governor in council on to how  dispose of the waste.  The Seaborn commission specifically recommended against that type of structural institutional setup. It recommended an independent body and we got just the opposite.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seaborn commission recommended extensive consultation processes be built in.  We did not get that in the bill either.  It recommended that whatever was necessary from a time standpoint be allowed both for the recommendations and the process.  We have some very tight time limits that were built in here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also has some very limited parameters for the waste management organization  that  would be set up, the one that would be  entirely controlled by the industry, as to the  methods it would  address.   The way the bill is worded it  basically limits the methods to three types: the one we have already heard about, the deep geological disposal methodology; leaving it the way it is now, which is stored at the sites owned by the plants; or bringing it all together in what is being called a temporary or interim storage site.   </p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically the bill   does not leave  open the possibility of a breakthrough in technology in terms of dealing with this. The bill is all about burying the problem, and   I mean that both figuratively and literally.  The government  just wants to get rid of it by shoving  it through. It is quite clear that the committee's reaction to the witnesses we heard confirmed the statement I just made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to  talk a bit more about some of the other witnesses but I will concentrate on what we heard from the  mayors of three communities in Ontario.  They appeared at the  last minute because  all the witnesses were sort of being rushed through so the committee  could get to the clause by clause debate.   They all showed up but they were given relatively short periods of time to address the bill. They thoroughly impressed members from all parties. Their position was relatively straightforward and simple, but it was also very eloquent and very telling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did they tell us? They told us that they  had lived with the problem for decades,    that they understood what it meant for them but that it did  not make their  lives simple as municipal councillors. They said that they strongly believed  they had the right to be involved in the decision making process as to how the wastes would be disposed of. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were given short shrift by the committee. Although several amendments were brought forward that specifically dealt with their concerns and what they would like to see done with the bill, the amendments  were simply rejected by  members of  the government with  no discussion and  no comment about why we should not give them some representation or why we should not augment the consultation process so they would have some input. There was total silence.  A vote was taken and  the proposed amendments were rejected.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those three mayors had  every right to be angry for  the cavalier fashion in which they were treated and in the total rejection of the proposals  they had put forward in such a simple but eloquent manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consultation process is  meaningless.  There is no funding for it.  In fact, if we look very closely at the bill, the bill proposes to cut out all the  NGOs across the country.  These are people who have followed this issue for over a decade now and  who  participated in the Seaborn commission study and research.  The only people with whom the government will allow any consultation, and that is fairly meaningless, will be the  people in the communities it  picked as proposed sites. A number of the NGOs across the country who have real expertise in this area will not even get any notice and certainly will be extremely limited in their ability to be involved in the process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other  issue we raised, because of the September 11 incidents in New York City and in Washington, D.C., involved  security. The amendments put forward would have  heightened the level of security and the analysis of security  brought forth by the waste management organization,  but  they  were also defeated. If there were some urgency, that was definitely one area but it was rejected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the  amendments  put forward  would have prohibited the importing of waste so that Canada would not become a dumping ground for  the rest of the world, and it is at some risk,  but those proposed amendments were rejected without discussion.   The vote was taken and the proposed  amendments were rejected.  That was the process.</p>


	<A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will finish by saying that at second reading our party indicated its willingness to vote  in principle to pass this over on the basis that there would be serious consideration given to the recommendations that were in the Seaborn report and to try to implement the amendments that came  from the opposition parties. We did not get any of them, nor did any of the other opposition parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of that, perhaps the last chance we had as a government to convince the Canadian populace that we needed to deal with this issue was lost, and it will be lost assuming the majority on the Liberal side pushes this through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be the effect?  Let me do a little prophesying, because I   have heard this already from some of the groups and I think it is going to just flow out automatically. We will have communities across the country, many of them in the Shield, passing resolutions, whether they are first nations or local municipal councils in Ontario and Quebec in particular. They will start passing resolutions to prohibit any consideration of this waste being moved into their communities.  We will have ongoing work done by those groups interested in this issue which  will give no credibility to the government at all and will simply reject it out of hand.  That will be  the result.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois for his question. I also want to say that the Bloc Quebecois proposed a lot of amendments of which I was very proud. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of those  amendments  I would have liked to have made myself, in particular those  around  democratic principles, around review that could be done by a parliamentary committee, again all of which were rejected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address specifically the question about the Seaborn commission, this is part of the sham that is being created by the bill.   As I was preparing for my speech I was reading over some of the material we received from the department and the government about how the bill was carrying out the Seaborn commission recommendations.  That simply is not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of recommendations from the Seaborn commission was  quite lengthy and they were very specific in a number of ways.  I do not think I found one carried out either  literally or at least in its spirit in the bill.  There is not one.  The commission  did a lot of work.  There was a lot of excellent work in reaching out to the community and building that trust  I talked about. There was a real feeling that if in fact the Seaborn commission recommendations were put into law  this issue would be properly addressed and would be accepted by communities across the country.  We did not get that at all.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it had been my intent to split my time with the member for Saint John. Unfortunately it appears there will not be enough time today to split it, so I will continue with the remainder of the time  allowed for debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several issues involved in speaking to third reading of Bill C-27.  The first comment I would like to make is addressed to the member for Windsor--St. Clair, the member for Sherbrooke and the member for Athabasca who sat on the committee. We all worked diligently in attempting to improve this piece of legislation by putting amendments forward but unfortunately we were not successful.  We did manage to get in two amendments.  The member for Athabasca and I were able to get in amendments to   improve this piece of legislation.  They certainly improved it, but unfortunately they did not go far enough to allow the bill to be a workable bill that   our party, the PC/DR coalition, could support.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very unfortunate when  a piece of legislation that is needed and  requested reaches third reading stage and  cannot be supported because it is simply poor legislation.  This bill is not unlike my Christmas tie with a grinch on it,  the difference being that the grinch story is  about evil turning good. The grinch becomes a good member of society and enjoys the fruits and pleasures of the holiday season. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of legislation is just bad legislation, which we attempted to improve so everyone in this nation could enjoy it and benefit from it, but unfortunately we were not able to do that.  Even members in the lobby are wearing their festive stockings and holiday gear at this time when we should be working together in the House to improve legislation and pass legislation that is seriously needed so the country as a whole can benefit. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who spoke earlier raised very cognizant and real points that needed to be raised.  However, there are a number of other points that need to be raised. One of them is the discussion of the significant dollars being put into this waste management organization by industry, and we are not talking about a couple of million dollars.  The initial down payment comes into effect 10 days after the bill is passed.  Ontario Hydro will put up $500 million.  That is   not small change.  New Brunswick Power will put up $20 million.  Hydro-Québec will put up $20 million.  Atomic Energy Canada Ltd., which claims to have  no responsibility for any nuclear fuel waste, and in  fact a lot of responsibility for nuclear fuel waste, I think, and which is the very perpetrator and supporter of the industry,  put up $10 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> That is the Canadian taxpayer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</b> Exactly.  The point was raised and is worth repeating.  It is not Atomic Energy Canada Ltd.  but Canadian taxpayers who are reaching into their jeans pockets to come up with those dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an annual basis, Ontario Hydro will fork over $100 million to keep this waste management organization active.  Hydro-Québec will fork over $4 million.  New Brunswick Power will give $4 million.  Atomic Energy Canada Ltd., with somehow no responsibility for nuclear waste, will still  fork over another $2 million per annum.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about significant dollars going into a waste management organization.  I cannot help but think that we have it backward.  Perhaps  Atomic Energy Canada Limited should be putting in the primary dollars.  The subsidiary dollars should be put in by the industry itself because it certainly is responsible for nuclear waste.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found a number of issues in this  piece of legislation to be  problematic.  The bill pretends to deal with the issue of nuclear waste but it does not satisfy the problem.  Nor does it  completely deal with the issue.  We end up with  a piece of legislation which would allow for on surface or on site management of nuclear fuel waste for perpetuity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is absolutely nothing in the legislation which would force the nuclear energy sector in Canada and Atomic Energy Canada Limited to come up with an option.   We must consider one option which is on site storage if we are  to deal with the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues mentioned earlier  that we could recycle the fuel,  run it through  reactors  so that it  would become inert and  the radioactivity would be  taken out of it.  Perhaps science will find a way of dealing with this through transmutation.  Those are not options that  are  realistic at this time but they are still options.  They are  worthy of debate and that debate was  curtailed in committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted  that  prior to our last debate at report stage on Bill C-27 there was a piece of legislation that was important to the security of Canada.  Bill C-36 was as important to our security  as this  piece of legislation.  Yet the government forced closure on Bill C-36 because it did not have time.  It was an emergency. We did not have time to debate it.  The next day there were not enough government members to continue debate at report stage of Bill C-27.  Debate failed on Bill C-27.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important and what is not important?  Canadian voters will make that decision a few years down the road.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is  true that the issue has been  around for   50 years.  We need to deal with it in a timely manner.  This does not necessarily allow us to deal with nuclear waste in a timely manner because it does not preclude on   surface and on site storage forever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the  issue of accountability  to the public.    It is also important for the bill to establish  a waste management organization and an advisory council that would be reflective of Canadian society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Windsor--St. Clair talked about the amendments that were put forth by Ontario municipalities which have nuclear reactors in their midst. The PC/DR coalition   put forth  amendments on behalf of those municipalities as did other members. There was  unanimous support for the amendments on the opposition side.  That speaks to some  unity that  we found as we  all worked together on this  piece of legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government  claims to represent Ontario because it  has a lot of members from Ontario.  However it does not represent Ontario when push comes to shove and we are trying to get  amendments passed that were proposed on behalf of  the people from Ontario.  They wanted their concerns reflected in legislation that  will affect them more than any other group in Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not mention property values in municipalities that have nuclear reactors  or  on site storage facilities. People tend not to like to be near radioactivity. They tend to have  doubts, concerns and worries about radioactivity. They tend not to buy houses and properties or to build businesses there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a cheap source of power.  We would not see that reflection in the property values if we assured Canadians that it was safe and if we dealt with the issue in a timely fashion. A  municipality that has a nuclear reactor in its midst would benefit from it because it would be an immediate source of electricity and corporations would come to the area for that reason.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about the issue of foreign waste being deposited at some type of a waste management facility in Canada. That issue is neither dealt with  nor precluded in this piece of legislation. Most Canadians do not understand that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  legal authority from the department stated in committee that the intent of the bill did not cover the question of the import of nuclear fuel waste. Another piece of legal advice was that the scope of the bill did not touch upon the importation of nuclear fuel waste from outside the boundaries of Canada. It did not speak to that point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is  important to me and is one of the reasons, if not the main reason, that the PC/DR coalition  will not support the bill. It does not preclude Hydro-Québec, Ontario Power Generation, New Brunswick Power Corporation or any corporation from setting up a plant  in the U.S. It does not preclude them from producing nuclear fuel waste at a foreign owned plant and bringing that waste back to a depository somewhere in Canada. It is unfortunate that the legislation was drafted so poorly that we will not be able to support it.</p>

Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ) </b>

	moved that Bill C-397, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (support payments), be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be allowed to speak to this bill. I want to take a few moments to thank my colleague from Sherbrooke who agreed to support this bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it is with a lot of bitterness that I rise to speak to Bill C-397, an act to amend the Income Tax Act. In fact, my bill is aimed at amending only one section, section 118 of the Income Tax Act dealing with child deductions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed because I believe that this bill should have been votable. I believe so, since the required tests for making a bill votable are, first, that the bill be written clearly and effectively. My bill and I am convinced that you have read it entirely, is very clear and effective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second test is that the bill must be under federal jurisdiction. This is just common sense. If it were not under federal jurisdiction, I would not be here today discussing it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third test is that the bill should deal with a matter that is clearly in the public interest. That will be my main point  in my remarks and, naturally I will emphasize the merits of my bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a clear interest. In this case, it is more than clear because, after I introduced my bill, the justice minister sent to all members and senators a summary of the report of the federal, provincial, territorial family law committee. This report mentioned  child custody, access and support for Canadian children. I will refer to this report several times in my remarks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that this bill is not votable. I have hundreds of cases of Canadian and Quebec citizens, mothers and fathers, who asked me to correct certain injustices in the present legislation. I am all the more sorry because my bill, as I indicated, does exactly what is being requested in the report: parents who share parental responsibility—we no longer say shared custody—should have a tax deduction that is proportional to the number of days they have custody of the child.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a parent to be considered to have parental responsibility, he or she must have custody during at least 100 days in a year before he or she can claim a certain percentage of child care expenses for the days he or she has custody, and benefit from tax deductions in his or her income tax return.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take, for example, my own situation. I have joint custody of my children during weekends. On the basis of 52 weekends, I have custody of my children during 104 days. Therefore, I could deduct 104/365ths of the costs incurred for the custody of my children. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, divorce and separation occur much too frequently these days. We are living in the year 2001. It is a fact that divorce and separation are commonplace occurrences. Frequently when parents divorce or separate they try to avoid litigation, to not traumatize their children and make  them  suffer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, money matters are always the most contentious issues between parents and are often the cause of disputes. This is why I think the Income Tax Act as it now stands is unfair. Why could we not allow a parent who has joint custody of a child or who shares parental responsibility to deduct a portion of the costs incurred for the custody of the children? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, since this bill has not been declared votable, my remarks are only idle chatter. I most sincerely hope that the finance minister, and I intend to pressure him on this,  will in the name of equity and parental responsibility take my bill under his wing and amend section 118 of the present legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will stop here. I know that my 15 minute period is not over, but I nevertheless will stop here because I am very disappointed, of course, that this bill has not been declared votable. Most of all, I am very sad for all the parents who thought that I could succeed in pushing forward this issue and convince the government to forward to the present as in the year 2001 unfortunately divorce and separation occur too frequently.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for having listened so carefully to my speech. I want to take this opportunity to wish you and your family as well as the people of my riding a happy holiday season, much happiness and, most of all, peace.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, some time ago in the House the Prime Minister, while speaking to the downturn in the economy and the need to stimulate some employment, mentioned that perhaps the minister responsible for ACOA would advance some infrastructure funding. I asked a question a few days later whether or not any determination had been made as to  when and how much. The answer I was given related to the amount that was already in the mill, $6 million in the case of Newfoundland, some of which has not been taken up to date. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The needs are severe not only in my  province but I am sure across the country as well.  The more infrastructure funding we can put into the mix  during this present downturn in particular, the better it will be for many reasons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a severe need to address critical freshwater supplies in certain areas. There is a need to address environmental concerns in relation to taking care of sewage disposal. There is also a need to stimulate the economy by getting people back to work. The construction field offers tremendous opportunities for employment. By putting more money into our infrastructure programs we can get people working and solve the problems of fresh water and environmental concerns at the same time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the St. John's region there are a number of major problems in relation to these issues. I will mention a couple to illustrate why it is so important to get money flowing through the infrastructure program. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the  lack of fresh water in the part of the city  called  Goulds which  is now part of the city of St. John's. Many residents in that area do not have access to good clean drinking water. There are also parts of that same section  of the city that do not have sewer services. This causes a major health problem in that immediate area. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the pressure from the people concerned, the city puts the blame on the provincial government. The provincial government puts the blame on the feds. It is everybody's fault and   nobody is focusing on the problems, bringing the agencies together and addressing the overall problems. The one factor that quite often prevents addressing the problem is sufficient funding. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major problem in St. John's is the harbour itself. We have to stop talking about addressing the harbour cleanup and do something, whether it be St. John's,  Halifax, Vancouver or any other harbour, in the same terms as we do general infrastructure funding. These programs to address harbour cleanup have to be separate and specific.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the parliamentary secretary can  tell us there will be more money for infrastructure and that we will focus on priorities. Perhaps he could give us an idea of the route that is taken in order to get such funding flowing.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am certainly happy to respond to the member for St. John's West who quite frankly has been a vociferous candidate for his riding in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased today to speak about the infrastructure Canada program, a Government of Canada initiative that will improve the quality of life for Canadians in rural and urban communities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I gave the answer originally to the member, I talked about the $6 billion which is across the country.  I am happy to note that $153 million of that has been directed toward the province of Newfoundland.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member himself was concerned about drinking water in that area.  A good portion of the infrastructure program was earmarked for environmental and green infrastructure.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrastructure Canada makes green municipal infrastructure a priority.  Why?  Because nothing is more fundamental to communities than clean drinking water, clean air and a healthy environment.  These areas are very fundamental to the vibrant communities.  Without them, Canadians cannot enjoy the high quality of life they have every right to expect in this country.  There are  many other important areas in municipal infrastructure but we believe that investment in green infrastructure comes first.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not reach this conclusion alone.  Partnership with other levels of government is one of infrastructure Canada's unique strengths.  When we designed the program, we consulted broadly with municipalities.  Indeed, I believe that the Federation of Canadian Municipalities originally was the impetus and  the driving force in getting the government way back in 1993 to start the very first infrastructure program.  It told us quite clearly that green infrastructure was an immediate priority.  The member is drawing that to our attention once again. We consulted with the provinces and the territories and they too identified this area as one of  urgent need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We listened and we have responded.  In each infrastructure Canada agreement we took steps to stipulate a minimum level of green municipal infrastructure investment in each jurisdiction.  Newfoundland has agreed with that.  I have noticed that many of its projects have zeroed in on green infrastructure.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the member's real question was that he wanted  to know if we were going to accelerate the program.  The $6 billion is over a five or six year period.  I think a number of our own ministers have mentioned the possibility of accelerating that program, in other words, moving the funding from year three or four into year two and so forth.  The answer is that it requires agreement among three levels of government.  I think those negotiations are in progress but I cannot actually say where they stand at this time.  It is a difficult commitment for some of the provinces and municipalities because they are one-third partners and they have to come up with  the money as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I would say that we have a litany of projects in Newfoundland.  There is a  $1.1 million investment in the Placentia water treatment plant and  a $45,000 upgrade to the Trepassey chlorination system. I think those are in the member's own riding. There is a $3.8 million investment in the Shoal Harbour treatment plant,  a $1 million upgrade of the Victoria sewage system, and  $647,000 toward the Lourdes water system.  We have been committed to solving the member's problem.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, let me thank the parliamentary secretary for his concise answer.  I guess he answered my question  to the best of  the government's ability because if negotiations are under way with the other parties,  I understand fully that all three must come to the table.  I appreciate that and his frankness.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask if he would clearly outline the process.  My understanding is the cities or towns outline their priorities and submit their list to the province which in turn will select its priorities, the priorities of the government members.  They are  then submitted  to the committee representing the feds and the provinces to decide how much funding is available and where it will go. I  wonder if the parliamentary secretary  could clarify if that is the process.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-104129"></A><a HREF="#Int-104130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-104127"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Alex Shepherd: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the member has got it fairly close.  Actually in Canada it is handled differently depending on the province.  In my own province of Ontario it is handled quite differently because the province of Ontario has its own infrastructure apparatus.  What we are trying to do is work through that apparatus.  I think it is similar in Quebec. It has its own apparatus for infrastructure funding. What we are trying to do is not duplicate that structure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In others areas, like Newfoundland, I believe, the province would  apply directly to a body administered by the treasury board.  The member is quite right that the municipalities move forward with, if I can say it, their wish lists.  I know that there are more projects than there is money available and that is unfortunate, but it seems to be the nature of government. There are always more ways to spend money. Then the province goes through a process of approving  those it thinks are priorities to try to put them in some kind of prioritization sequence.  The province then sends that to us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we are trying to do is not pick and choose.  We are trying to ask if it fits within the original concept of green infrastructure.  In other words, if it is a swimming pool and we thought we would improve the water quality of St. John's West,  it probably would be rejected. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what the member is orienting himself to, if it is a water treatment facility--</p>

	Mr. Speaker, this is in relation to a question I put to the Minister of Human Resources Development  about a week ago regarding EI benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been down this road before in question period in the House.  In fact it has been a national case, if you will.  It is basically about abuse of EI recipients by the department itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take exception to some of the questions and techniques used by the department to determine whether or not individual clam diggers are eligible for EI benefits.  What I contend, and I stand by it, is that their right to privacy has been violated on the basis of 42 questions on a questionnaire they are forced to answer. These claimants are forced to answer these questions without any thought to legal counsel or help within the room to do so, which they are entitled to. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, when they are through answering those 42 questions, some of them very personal and having nothing to do with clam digging, they are forced to sign a statement attesting that everything they have said is true. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a place on that form for a witness signature.  It is not interesting that a witness signature never appears on those forms?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, why clam diggers?  Why the lowly clam digger?  Why do they have to be interrogated in this fashion?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example I used, and members are familiar with this, is the billion dollar boondoggle in HRDC a couple of years ago.  We raged  about that in the House.  The question would be how many chief executive officers in companies that were not entitled to benefits from  or contributions by the Government of Canada were subjected to that type of interrogation.  The answer would be none.  Not one of them was interrogated in that way.  If they were, they would have legal counsel with them, which they are entitled to, as  the clam diggers are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same situation with the bureaucrats.  Not one single bureaucrat was questioned by the department without legal counsel.  How many of them lost their paycheques?  Not one of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one reason for this.  It is that these people are poor and they are not quite as articulate as some of the smart,  and I wanted to say smartass, bureaucrats.  That is simply the case.  They are an easy target for this type of interrogation and it has happened time and time again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I showed this 42 part questionnaire to the minister what she told me was “I agree with you, Mr. Thompson, that it is wrong and we should not be asking those types of personal questions”.  Yet when it goes back to the bureaucrats, what do they do?  They convince the minister that it is right, that there is nothing wrong with it and that they will continue to do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something about this country of ours. When we get up and want to rage about the indignities that are passed on and pushed on to the poor people of this country, nobody wants to talk about it.  I guess it is not exciting.  They simply are an easy target for a big government.  That is exactly what the government has been doing.  It has been consistent.  Even some of the tax court judges on P.E.I. agree with my position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wrong and it has to stop.  I think it has to stop right here on the floor of the House of Commons by the minister standing up on her feet and saying that is enough.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest for the question.  It is a very important question for us in government because we want citizens, no matter what level of literacy they are at, to have the same rights as every other citizen. This is an important position that we have relayed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly do not disagree at all with the remarks of my hon. colleague from New Brunswick Southwest. Let me add that the large majority of individuals requesting EI benefits are honest.  We know that.  They are hardworking Canadians who need temporary income support while they are unemployed.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department is responsible for ensuring that those who apply for employment insurance are eligible to receive benefits.  I think everyone can understand that. Unfortunately, there are instances where some people wrongfully claim EI.  That is why HRDC has the mandate to protect the integrity of the EI program by conducting investigations into all allegations of abuse.  When the department receives allegations of abuse, it must investigate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HRDC investigations play a key role in safeguarding the integrity of the EI program by detecting, preventing and deterring abuse. We have several investigation programs that allow us to protect the integrity of the EI program.  In 2000-01 for example, investigation and control activities resulted in total savings of $573 million to the EI fund.  This means that  for every dollar spent on investigations, $9.23 is returned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in light of the details raised by the hon. member opposite, and I want to underline they are important details that we take seriously, the minister has asked her officials to review the way investigations are conducted to ensure that employees are working within the code of conduct that is respectful of individuals and the Privacy Act. All of our investigations are conducted within the authorities legislated by us in the EI Act. Employees are provided with ongoing training and refresher courses to ensure investigations are carried out in a responsible, lawful manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that HRDC investigators must adhere to a very strict code of professional conduct and carry out their duties in a professional manner. Investigators routinely inform individuals of their rights and obligations.  They also inform claimants of their right to legal counsel in cases that are being considered for prosecution. When administrative penalties are considered, clients are advised of their right to appeal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will repeat how important this is to us.  We are committed to protecting the integrity of the employment insurance program so that it continues to be there to support Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I hope that the department is sincere in a follow-up to this. The parliamentary secretary tells me that it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pattern of abuse that has occurred over and over again.  I have to emphasize that the people  I am talking about are poor.  They are not empowered as you and I are, Mr. Speaker.  We have a place here.  We can stand up and rant and take the government to task on these issues.  They only have people like you and me and the other members in the House to defend them. That is what we are trying to do. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should be a sense of fairness within the department. There has to be. I am encouraged by what the parliamentary secretary said this evening, but what we want are results. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has occurred over and over again.  We are looking for real results.  I do not think we want a meanspirited government out on a witch hunt  prosecuting or persecuting people who really need the help and incidentally, who paid into the plan that they now are attempting to get some benefit from.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I could not be more in accord with what my colleague from New Brunswick Southwest has said.  It is the government's role to make sure that  whatever  EI benefits are provided to citizens are done according to their rights and within the Privacy Act as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking into this affair.  If what my parliamentary colleague has said is true, it is totally unacceptable to us. I can assure my colleague and the House that we will continue to investigate the matter. As soon as the investigation is completed, we will report to him and the House as to what the conditions exactly are.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my question this evening arises from a question  I raised in the House on September 21 regarding the issue of a gentleman named Mr. Nabil Al-Marabh, who had been arrested on stabbing charges in Boston, had attempted to illegally enter the United States from Canada, had illegally re-entered Canada and was finally found to be carrying a forged passport, a forged citizenship card and a forged social insurance number and who may have been connected with terrorist organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In raising this question, I was informed by the minister, who responded:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It is wrong to equate all failed refugee claimants with terrorism. That is clearly wrong.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could all have figured that one out. She then went on to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We do not detain people on mere whispers. We do not detain on suspicion</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of Bill C-36, that seems a bit ironic. Of course, the government can now detain without either whisper or suspicion, and moreover has the ability to arrest people who have the misfortune to simply have the same name as someone who is suspected of terrorism. They can find their assets seized, taken away permanently and find no compensation, even if they were completely innocent. That of course just puts the lie to everything she said. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem we face with Mr. Al-Marabh is that he is part of an enormous problem in which we do not have control of our borders. Having failed to assert control of our borders for a number of years, we now find a situation in which we are flooded with a large number of refugee claimants, many of whom are bogus and  a small number of whom may potentially be terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can refer to reports of October 30, 2001, it was reported that confidential immigration documents stated that the number of foreigners claiming refugee status in  Canada was expected to reach 41,250 by the end of this year. That represented a 37% increase over last year and was the biggest 12 month leap ever. That is the kind of problem we face. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that in the face of this the government has no adequate response. I would like to quote from the auditor general's report to make this point. The auditor general writes:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In our 1997 chapter, we concluded that a thorough review of the refugee determination process was needed. The process did not quickly grant Canada's protection to claimants who genuinely needed it, and it did not discourage those who did not need or deserve Canada's protection from claiming refugee status.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report, which came out a few days ago, further states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Citizenship and Immigration Canada could not provide information on removals of failed refugee claimants from the country that would indicate whether (the department's) processes were more effective. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More effective meaning more effective than they had been four years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for  the minister is simply this. Is the minister prepared today in the House to provide the information  the auditor general has been seeking with regard to the effectiveness of determining whether or not people are genuine refugees, deserving of our protection, or not?</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  the hon. member  knows full well that Canada's privacy legislation prohibits the government from discussing details of specific cases like the one he raised. The government would not jeopardize the integrity of its own intelligence or that of our neighbour, the United States.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I can tell the member is that the existing act already contains some of the toughest provisions to deny admission to or deport terrorists regardless of the accusations we have heard in the House. At present we can and do detain whenever we believe someone is a flight risk or a threat to Canadians.  If anyone poses a security risk to Canada we detain and argue for continued detention.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front end security screening coupled with the new enforcement measures of Bill C-11 which was recently passed by parliament would provide immigration officers the tools they need to do their job. They are powerful tools compared to those of the past. They would automatically deny access to our refugee determination system to anyone found to be a security threat.  Bill C-11 gave us the tools to deal with security threats more quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not let terrorists strike at our core values. These values include a commitment to the charter, which we must always keep in mind;   due process, in which  we take great pride in the House; tolerance, which I hope is in the heart of every member of the House; and diversity in our immigration and refugee  protection program which is seen as a model everywhere in the world.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not allow terrorists to push us off course.  Canadians want security but they want us to respect our values and traditions. We are committed to the rule of law. This is why we cannot remove persons from Canada after due process has been served.  Our system works on the basis of evidence.  It consists of checks and balances and due process.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada will not allow persons to take advantage of our generosity by engaging in any kind of terrorism.  We are acting to ensure Canada will never be a safe haven for terrorists. We are doing this in ways that are grounded in the rule of law which is the basis of our democracy. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary was reading from prepared notes. This is unfortunate because he wound up answering a question I did not ask.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked him a question specifically in regard  to a point the auditor general had raised.  She said Citizenship and Immigration Canada had failed to provide information about the removal of failed refugee claimants, not about the process for admitting people  to the country in the first place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were serious inaccuracies in the parliamentary secretary's commentary.  First, he said Canada is a model admired by the rest of the world. That is not so. I used to live in Australia.  I was an immigrant in Australia. They laugh at our system as well they should.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, with regard to implementing and following through on laws, the auditor general says we have failed to follow through on the provisions of existing laws.  When the government does not follow through on   existing laws how can we trust it when it says it will implement new laws?  The problem is the government's failure to implement and act on existing laws.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have prepared notes and we have checked anything we raise in the House.   I wish the opposition would do the same.  What we have seen here are  bogus charges and all kinds of statements that do not stand up to the test of the facts.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member has any information he should give it to us.  He obviously does not.  He must remember  we are in a democratic system where we believe in the rule of law. Regardless of all his statements they will not stand up to the test of the facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member mentioned the auditor general's  report.  Obviously with the new bills we have brought before the House we will improve in this regard.  Nonetheless Canada has a great reputation as a doorway for immigrants from all over the world. We do not want to lose that great advantage.</p>
