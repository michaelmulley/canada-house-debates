I have a number of petitions to present concerning the

in the spring of this year.  Many of us hope that it will be 
stalled for good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People continue to express their opposition to it, particularly 
in light of the decision this summer whereby the government had 
to back down from its ability to legislate in the environmental 
interests of Canadians because of a suit brought against it by 
Ethyl pursuant to chapter 11 of the NAFTA, which would be 
extended under the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians continue to be very concerned about the possibility of 
an MAI, particularly one that contains an investor state 
provision, so I table these petitions.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK15">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency and to amend and repeal other acts as 
a consequence, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today 
to lead off debate on second reading of Bill C-43, an act to 
establish the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill represents a major milestone in the evolution of tax 
administration, customs service and trade administration in 
Canada.  It is an integral part of our government's drive for 
better service for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The genesis of this bill is quite simple.  It is built on five 
simple facts about tax collection.  I would like to discuss those 
facts quite briefly.  Flowing from those facts are five clear 
principles.  Those principles, those values, I would like to 
describe in some detail for they are the principles, the values, 
which are the foundation of the legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number one is easy.  Nobody particularly likes to pay 
taxes.  The truth is that since the Prime Minister named me 
Minister of National Revenue I have not had a Canadian come up to 
me and say “Herb, my taxes are too low.  Can you find a way to 
raise my tax bill?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number two is equally easy.  We live in a country where 
millions upon millions of citizens voluntarily pay taxes. 
Something which we can all be really proud of is that in our 
country citizens voluntarily fill out their tax forms and remit 
the money they owe.  In our society small businesses fill out 
their GST forms and send in the money owing.  In our nation, 
millions upon millions of citizens make their declaration of 
customs openly and honestly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads to fact number three.  The reason Canadians pay their 
taxes is because we understand the imperatives of our democracy. 
We understand that we are rated number one in the world by the 
United Nations because of our health care, our support for young 
people, our support for senior citizens, our commitment to safety 
and security for families and our determination to bring out the 
best in our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understand that meeting those objectives and rising to 
those ideals costs money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number four is the logical corollary of the other facts. 
Canadians want to ensure that the system is fair.  We want to 
ensure that the system is as logical and straightforward as 
possible.  Since we are so amazingly and willingly ready to pay 
taxes voluntarily, we rightly expect the system to be as modern, 
as intelligent, as streamlined and as service oriented as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number five is that there are two ways to improve the tax 
system.  The first way is through changes to the tax law, which 
is something we address annually when the finance minister brings 
down his budget.  The second way is to improve the structure of 
the tax system, to improve the process, to modernize the method 
of service, to modernize the method of management, to simplify 
the means of compliance and to eliminate overlap and duplication 
among the different levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the facts and the realities on which our tax system is 
built.  Those are also the facts which lead to the five 
principles, the five values of this bill.  The principles and 
values are very simple.  Canadians want service and fairness. 
They want to work in partnership.  They want accountability and 
modern management of resources.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill before the House of Commons will deliver what 
Canadians want:  more efficient customs service; less 
federal-provincial overlap; lower compliance costs for 
businesses; more flexibility to meet a changing world; a more 
simplified system for taxpayers; less cost for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about service for over 22 million taxpayers.  We 
are talking about administering over $600 billion in trade.  We 
are talking about serving over 100 million travellers annually. 
We are talking about service for over 75,000 charities, service 
for nine million Canadians who receive GST credits, service for 
over three million parents who receive the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Combining a new form of management structure with strong 
ministerial accountability and strong traditional Canadian 
values, the new agency will ensure better service for all those 
Canadians and for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of this new agency structure will maintain 
parliamentary accountability to clients and to the public.  The 
agency will be accountable to parliament and to all Canadians. 
The new agency will benefit from management practices that are 
characteristic of successful organizations outside of government. 
Yet the Canada customs and revenue agency will be part of the 
public service of Canada. It will be a vital component of our 
democratic parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told by Canadians that it is important that there 
continue to be ministerial accountability for how tax, tariff and 
trade systems operate.  We have listened attentively and 
responded fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue will be fully responsible for 
the agency to parliament.  The Minister of National Revenue will 
still be responsible for the powers, duties and functions vested 
by the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and all other program 
legislation. The Minister of National Revenue will still be able 
to direct how taxes are assessed, to seize and release goods, and 
to determine how import and accounting data should be processed. 
I will still be answerable to all members of parliament and 
through them to the citizens we are all elected to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have always made sure that individual taxpayers 
retain their privacy and are not subject to political influences. 
We have a longstanding practice in this country that the 
Minister of National Revenue does not become involved in 
interpreting the law in individual cases.  The minister may 
however inquire into specific cases in order to guarantee 
fairness for all taxpayers. Questions are often asked in the 
House of the minister.  The power of the minister to inquire into 
these matters and respond to the House will be maintained under 
the new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will continue to have a Minister of National Revenue 
whose primary concern will rightly be to ensure that citizens are 
given the full benefit of the law. In short, Canadians' right 
both to impartial decision making and to redress through the 
minister will be retained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability and fairness are cornerstones of our Canadian 
system of revenue collection.  These vital principles must and 
will remain paramount.  Fairness forms the basis for the millions 
of tax, customs and excise transactions.  It is at the heart of 
every communication Canadians have with tax officials on the 
telephone, or with our employees at the counter, or with customs 
officers while crossing the border.  It underpins all our 
programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding an excellent record, we can and must do more. 
Last March I launched the fairness initiative to consult with 
individual Canadians and businesses on how fairly we administer 
our programs and to identify ways to enhance fairness. 
We have consulted widely and we will shortly have a report 
produced by an independent organization, the Conference Board of 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to issue a fairness action plan that will continue to 
ensure that Canadians continue to receive the fairest customs and 
revenue administration possible.  Fairness is a fundamental 
priority for Revenue Canada and fairness will be a fundamental 
priority for the new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fundamental priority for the new agency will be a true 
spirit of practical partnership with other levels of government 
and all Canadians.  By working even more closely with the 
provinces and the territories, the new agency will be able to 
expand the programs and services that we provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that provincial participation will be 
completely voluntary. This is not a power grab by the federal 
government.  In fact the agency's structure gives for the first 
time ever a real say to the provinces and territories in managing 
how we collect taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we administer social benefit programs for British 
Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, the Northwest 
Territories and Nova Scotia.  We collect personal income taxes 
for nine of the provinces and we collect corporate income taxes 
for seven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the agency we want to create real opportunities for greater 
partnership with the provinces.  We want to reduce overlap and 
duplication.  We want to save money for the provinces.  We want 
to save money for Canadians. What we are trying to build today is 
an organization that will create more win-win situations for 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are currently engaged in joint studies with several provinces 
on the feasibility of the new agency administering more of their 
programs.  There is only one level of taxpayer and that taxpayer 
should only have to deal with one level of tax administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should tell the House that my provincial counterparts 
generally like the concept of an agency.  They see it as an 
important step toward pragmatic forward thinking reform on behalf 
of and for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To guarantee that the provinces and territories truly have a 
central role to play in the new agency, they will nominate 11 of 
the 15 members of the new agency's board of management.  This 
will provide for sensitivity to provincial and regional concerns. 
The members will be appointed by the governor in council. This 
board of management will bring a client oriented approach to the 
provision of services, and a more progressive and businesslike 
approach to management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Operational accountability will not be as diffused under the 
agency as it is now under Revenue Canada. That is because the 
authorities for management and administration which are now 
shared among Treasury Board, the Public Service Commission and 
other government departments and agencies will be united under 
the new agency. The agency will be more directly accountable for 
the results it achieves.  It will be accountable to parliament 
and to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The move to new models in improving the efficiency, 
effectiveness and accountability of government services is a 
worldwide phenomenon.  Countries like the United Kingdom, 
Australia and New Zealand with parliamentary systems similar to 
ours are all pursuing new administrative arrangements to improve 
service delivery to citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the new agency will remain part of the public service, 
we propose to make important changes that will shift certain 
management responsibilities directly to the agency. Specifically, 
a modern tax and customs administration needs the flexibility to 
tailor its human resource systems, such as staffing, 
classification, training and recourse, to meet the needs of 
Canadians and to meet the needs of employees.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently the staffing process at Revenue Canada can take 
between six to twelve months.  That is simply too long. Agency 
status will allow us to develop a staffing system that is faster, 
more flexible and more progressive in providing opportunities for 
employees and rising to the challenges and opportunities of the 
modern technological era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed Canada customs and revenue agency will provide us 
with the flexibility we need to meet the needs of the future head 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more transactions are taking place through electronic 
commerce. Why not have a single, virtual office window for 
federal and provincial tax as well as customs administration? 
Why not employ a single business number approach to increase 
efficiency even further and yes, to enhance compliance as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My roots are in the business community.  Because of this, I know 
firsthand just how important customs, trade and revenue 
administration can be to the well-being of a business.  I believe 
that streamlining and simplifying procedures is a critical issue 
for the growth of Canada's business enterprises, and consequently 
for the growth of the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada is already a leader in areas such as electronic 
tax filing.  We would like to take those initiatives further by 
putting a framework in place that will allow us to expand the 
reach of our service to and for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that this is not an exercise in changing 
departmental organization charts.  This is an exercise in 
changing our approach in how we do business, in how we deal with 
the people we serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to work together with all our partners for the benefit 
of Canadians. Even now, Revenue Canada is highly involved with 
formal and informal consultations that include business people, 
customs brokers and tax professionals among others.  Their input 
was important in the preparation of the legislation that I am 
placing before this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want their system to be user friendly and transparent. 
They want it to be fair, where fairness means equal and efficient 
treatment.  Canadians want us to minimize the costs of compliance 
with the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1998 the Public Policy Forum released an important 
study on the costs of compliance with Canada's tax systems.  The 
forum estimates that with a single administration, there are 
potential annual savings to Canadian business of between $116 
million and $193 million. In addition, the forum estimates 
between $37 million and $62 million in potential savings in 
administration costs for governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transition to agency status is a means to an end.  It marks 
a realization of our commitment to fairness and excellent service 
for all Canadians, our commitment to work with the private sector 
and our commitment to maintain Canada's reputation as a world 
leader in revenue, customs and trade administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something else too: a new model for governance, where 
success builds on the blending of governmental accountability and 
private sector flexibility. The best of both worlds:  one unified 
better way of doing business, one unified better way of serving 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is working with all Canadians to 
address our shared needs and our individual aspirations, and to 
help ensure all of Canada's citizens can reap the benefits of 
building our country for the next millennium. What we have before 
this House is an important stepping stone in that process.  It is 
an opportunity to strengthen bridges among governments and on 
behalf of the Canadians we all seek to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the creation of the Canada customs and revenue 
agency is a positive, a practical and a philosophically sound 
step forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to create is an organization with a state of mind 
that is the state of the art. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency promises to usher in a new era in revenue 
administration and customs administration as we enter into a new 
millennium; a new era of service, fairness, partnership, 
accountability and wise management of our resources; a new era 
that clings fast to values on which our country is built but 
meets the needs of our times and the times to come.

<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise this morning to address Bill C-43. At the end of 
my speech, we will introduce an amendment to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and myself are totally opposed to this bill. 
As you may remember, the government first announced the creation 
of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency in the Speech from the 
Throne delivered in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the government had defined a number of objectives 
for the agency. First, to provide programs and services in a 
more efficient and cost-effective manner, through greater 
autonomy and flexibility. 
Second, to improve services and reduce administration and 
enforcement costs by working with the provinces to eliminate 
duplication and overlap. Third, to strengthen the effectiveness 
of the Canadian federation and to contribute to national unity 
by making the agency responsible for providing federal, 
provincial and even municipal services to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before explaining why we are totally opposed to this bill, let 
us take a look at each of these objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin with the third one. That objective mysteriously 
disappeared when the second progress report was tabled, and it 
is obvious that the agency as proposed will not contribute to 
the effectiveness of the Canadian federation and to Canadian 
unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second objective is doomed from the start, since none of the 
provinces has agreed to enter into any agreement with the 
federal government so far. The provinces are very unenthusiastic 
about the establishment of such an agency. Quebec, for one, is 
formally opposed. While not being totally against the idea of 
the single level of taxation referred to by my hon. colleague, 
the minister, Quebec feels that tax administration should be a 
provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario's opposition is even stronger than that of Quebec. In 
fact, the Minister of Revenue of Ontario recently stated he was 
considering the possibility of taking over personal income tax 
services. As we know, in Ontario, personal income taxes are 
currently collected by the federal government. The minister now 
wants to look after it at the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritimes are very unenthusiastic because the program to 
harmonize the sales tax is not producing the expected results, 
in spite of the fact that this new approach to tax collection 
has cost Canadian taxpayers over $2 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also opposed are all western provinces, except Manitoba, whose 
premier suggested it might be worth looking into. The premier of 
Manitoba may be looking for a job opportunity after he leaves 
politics. After all, the position of agency commissioner is an 
attractive one with an attractive salary. The commissioner would 
be appointed for a term of five years, which is renewable, so 
that he could hold office for several years, making very good 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of this opposition, Revenue Canada's spokesperson, 
Michel Cléroux, explained that the provinces had not said no. 
That is not a very good explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the first objective, which was to provide more 
efficient programs and services at a lesser cost.  First, I do 
not believe the agency will produce the promised savings.  Right 
from the start, those promoting it accepted that the greatest 
savings would come from harmonizing taxation.  I would remind 
you, however, that, as we all know, extension of the harmonized 
sales tax flew like a lead balloon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing, the proposed agency will not require the 
provinces to pay for collection and processing of their taxes if 
the provincial programme is fully harmonized with a federal 
taxation program.  This so-called free service represents an 
increase in agency costs, not a decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency's status will also enable its executives to pay 
themselves salaries comparable to those of business leaders in 
the private sector.  Will the agency commissioner, who will have 
responsibility for hundreds of thousands of people, and billions 
of dollars, demand to earn the same amount as the President of 
the Royal Bank? 
Will his annual salary be up in the millions?  Those are 
questions that need to be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the position one adopts on this, one cannot avoid 
acknowledging that this is a new expenditure coming at a time 
when the morale of public servants who are not in executive 
positions is suffering seriously after a six-year freeze.  It 
must not be lost sight of that, since April 1, the present 
government has awarded its executives raises of up to 19%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency has already cost the taxpayer a fair bit.  Thousands 
of departmental employees have been involved in design teams and 
other internal exercises aimed at turning the dream of senior 
management into reality.  A good part of the focus of Revenue 
Canada has been turned away from more important and more 
pressing matters which the minister ought to have been looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you an example.  You will recall a CBC program, 
which reported that, according to Department of National Revenue 
documents, over 500 of the 1,500 auditor positions in the 
Toronto region were vacant.  This situation would mean a 
shortfall for the federal treasury in this region of over $500 
million in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we apply this to the rest of Canada, we estimate the loss 
would be over $2 billion, due to the lack of Revenue Canada 
auditors.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point I wish to make: the agency would be less 
effective as a solution than the status quo.  The myth 
surrounding the agency is that it could provide tax services 
more cheaply and more effectively.  However, the structure 
proposed for the new agency adds another level of bureaucracy in 
the form of an appointed board of management, which would have 
nothing more than a supervisory role.  Nevertheless, time, money 
and staff must be provided for the board and its staff.  This 
would mean another level of bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency would 
report to Treasury Board on administrative matters, such as its 
activity and human resources plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I wish to address is that this agency would 
seriously weaken the Department of National Revenue.  By 
removing the agency from the direct supervision of the 
minister's office, the bill would seriously weaken the 
Department of National Revenue's bureaucracy.  The minister 
would receive a corporate business plan from the agency in which 
he would have a very small hand, or none at all, making it 
practically a fait accompli.  The minister would be told what to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the agency would upset the balance between tax policy 
and tax collection.  There is, at the present time, a healthy 
balance between the structure and tax policy, which should be 
left up to the department and the Minister of Finance, and 
enforcement of this policy, which is the responsibility of the 
Minister of Revenue and his department, the Department of 
National Revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency's status would upset this balance.  The agency's 
bureaucrats would inevitably launch into a turf war with their 
Department of Finance counterparts. 
This would be a costly and unproductive exercise that would 
serve the interests of no one but the mandarins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the agency would open the door to bureaucratic patronage 
and the abuse of power.  In practice, the agency would have 
carte blanche with respect to contracts, and with respect to the 
management of property, materiel and information, as well as 
technology.  With limited outside oversight, the risk of 
favouritism and abuse of power by bureaucrats is very, very 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, the agency would pose a threat to taxpayers' privacy. My 
colleague, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, mentioned this 
yesterday in a question having to do with the report tabled by 
the auditor general.  If the agency were actually to achieve its 
objectives, personal information would be concentrated in a 
large organization not overseen directly by Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, internal departmental documents indicate that creation 
of a “big brother” raises reservations among some of those 
involved with privacy issues.  We share those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the experts and the business sector think of this 
agency?  Nothing good. In his report of December 1997, the 
auditor general voiced concerns about the responsibility of the 
proposed agency by asking “What assurance will the people of 
Canada and parliamentarians have that the public interest is 
protected?”. I share Mr. Desautels' concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a Public Policy Forum, or PPF, study commissioned by 
Revenue Canada reported that Canadian business had serious 
reservations about the creation of this agency.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PPF report referred to the agency's objective of 
rationalizing and simplifying tax collection.  However, 40% of 
the businesses the foundation surveyed saw no advantage to a new 
national collection agency and over 68% felt that such an agency 
would add to their compliance costs, or have no effect 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen, then, the promise of a single tax collection 
agency did nothing to bring about the harmonization of taxes in 
all provinces.  If this harmonization did take place in the 
three Atlantic provinces, that is because they were paid $2 
billion while Revenue Canada was a department, and not an 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A serious question arises: how many billions will the provinces 
have to be paid to gain their participation in this project? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing with outside commentaries, I quote a Canadian Press 
article by Bruce Cheadle, which appeared in the <I>Halifax 
Chronicle-Herald </I>on February 9, 1998, stating that some observers 
see the agency as a pretext for getting rid of employees or 
increasing executives' salaries, or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Vern Krishna, head of the CGA Tax Research Centre at 
the University of Ottawa, is quoted as having said: “—what are 
the advantages?  Mainly, a little less direct control by 
government, and in particular a little more leeway with employee 
salaries—This is not as fabulous a concept as they would have 
the public believe”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An associate with the Montreal firm of Raymond, Chabot, Martin, 
Paré & Associates—or RCMP, as it is known in Quebec—said that 
the “creation of the customs and revenue agency would, in every 
respect, amount to an abdication of political power”. That 
comment was made in the March 1998 issue of CA Magazine. It was 
not made three years ago, but in March of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder. Why has the government developed this bad and 
even compulsive habit of creating agencies? This is, as the 
spokesperson for RCMP pointed out, an abdication of political 
power. We have a number of examples of that pattern. The new 
Canadian wheat agency just started its operations and people are 
already bickering. Nothing works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And let us not forget Nav Canada, which cost millions of 
dollars. Remember what happened. Nav Canada said that all its 
employees would keep their jobs for at least two years. Now, 30% 
of the employees who were guaranteed a job for two years will 
actually lose their job after just 18 months. 
Will these job cuts jeopardize the safety of airline personnel? 
That is one concern we have regarding Nav Canada. Is this yet 
another meaningless commitment made by the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example that really fires me up is ADM, the Agence des 
aéroports de Montréal. Remember the mess in which the agency 
found itself in February 1997, when it decided to transfer 
international flights from Mirabel to Dorval. That decision was 
made unilaterally by dictators, without any regard for what 
people thought. A year and a half later, it is still a mess and 
nothing works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members put questions to the Minister of 
Transport regarding ADM, but he told us he could not do 
anything, that the agency had total control.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since when do these agencies have the authority to spend 
taxpayers' money without having to answer to anyone?  It is 
highly improper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I think that the government finds the present 
human resources system to be in need of improvement.  Rather 
than make changes to Revenue Canada's present system, it prefers 
to create a completely new external body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of this admission, we can also conclude that the 
government feels that federal employees are being paid at rates 
well below those of the private sector. 
Rather than raising the pay scale for all present positions, the 
government prefers to create a structure within which it will be 
easy to pay salaries that will attract and keep excellent 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following question then arises:  Can two people performing 
the same duties, or doing the same type of job, one employed by 
the agency and the other employed by a department, be paid at 
different rates?  That is what I am asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to move an amendment to the motion for 
seconding reading of the bill. 
<A NAME="LINK18">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be 
amended by deleting all the words after the word ”That” and 
substituting the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>”Bill C-43, An Act to establish the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency and to amend and repeal other Acts as a consequence be not 
now read a second time but that the Order be discharged, the Bill 
withdrawn and the subject-matter thereof referred to the Standing 
Committee on Finance.” 
</UL></UL>

I am pleased to rise in debate on Bill C-43.  I wish to 
congratulate the minister.  It has only taken him 15 months to 
get his major legislative proposal before us.  After saying that 
it would come here last fall and then last spring, it is finally 
here.  If the minister is lucky it will be passed by the end of 
the century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the minister has enormous pull with the government House 
leader as well as with bureaucrats in the finance department who 
we know have been fighting over the loss of control they may face 
as a result of the bill.  I do wish to congratulate the minister 
on finally managing to bring it before us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept was unveiled in the throne speech of February 1996. 
It has taken the government two and a half years to flesh it out. 
It was one of its big ideas, one of the grand schemes, one of the 
great Liberal projects to create this super tax agency, this IRS 
style agency which would be removed from direct oversight and 
accountability to the people's representatives in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when the government took the original versions of the 
bill around for review and input it saw that Canadians actually 
believed in something called parliamentary accountability and 
ministerial responsibility.  We are pleased to see that 
consequently the government made some modifications to its 
earlier legislative proposals and has mentioned the minister in 
the act at least a few times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grand scheme, which the Liberals proposed two and a half 
years ago in the throne speech and which the Minister of National 
Revenue has been out on the road flogging for the past year, has 
turned out to be not such a grand scheme at all.  In fact it is a 
whole series of administrative changes which simply does two 
things:  creates more bureaucracy and less parliamentary 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stated purpose of Bill C-43 and the creation of the Canada 
customs and revenue agency is to create greater efficiency in the 
tax collection process, to create greater administrative 
flexibility, and to strengthen the federation through the 
creation of a single national agency.  These are all marvellous 
motherhood objectives but we have to look closely at whether the 
bill actually achieves them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with respect to efficiency the minister quoted in his 
speech a study conducted by a public policy forum in his 
department which reviewed the efficiency costs and studied 
cutting the cost of tax collection down to size.  It suggested 
that there might be cost savings in compliance of about $170 
million and further potential savings in administrative costs of 
about $100 million.  This was quoted by the minister in his 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister did not quote was that the entire study and 
these cost saving estimates were predicated upon a national 
revenue agency which collects all provincial taxes for all 
provincial governments.  Clearly that will not be the case.  The 
study demonstrates that if there are to be any cost savings they 
will come from the participation of the provinces.  When we 
listen to the provinces what do we hear?  Silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue has been criss-crossing the 
country over the past year.  I actually bumped into him in the 
hallways of one legislature going in to see the finance minister 
of Alberta.  I am sure he has been working very diligently, along 
with his officials, to persuade provincial finance ministers to 
believe that letting federal bureaucrats collect their taxes is a 
good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, sorely the minister's efforts have produced no proof. 
Not a single province at this point has indicated that it is 
prepared to participate in the CCRA, the proposed Canada customs 
revenue agency, and several provinces have stated their outright 
opposition, most notably the province of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec minister of finance, Mr. Landry, said in a letter to 
my office that “Quebec opposes the federal government's 
intention to centralize all of the tax revenue collection 
activities in one cross-Canada agency.  We already have our own 
department of revenue, which collects all taxes in Quebec.  In 
1982, we took over the administration of the federal goods and 
services tax, the GST, and we have proven our efficiency by 
providing a top quality service to Quebec taxpayers”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have received similar responses from the finance ministers of 
British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta, all of whom indicate that 
they have not seen anything compelling in the government's 
proposal for the CCRA which would persuade them to participate. 
The provincial treasurer of Alberta wrote in a letter to me that 
he was “concerned that such a large agency might become 
bureaucratic, unwieldy and aggressive in its dealings with 
taxpayers, and Alberta will want to know how the federal 
government plans to address these issues”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT12"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT12"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1100

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the biggest province, Ontario, which produces about 
40% of the tax revenues in this country has taken the position 
that is almost completely contrary to where the federal 
government is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says it is actually prepared because of federal interference 
to pull out of the federal-provincial income tax collection 
agreement so it can begin to tax directly on income as opposed to 
taxing on federal tax.  It wants greater flexibility, greater 
autonomy and greater accountability to its own provincial 
taxpayers rather than greater centralization in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the minister of finance of the province of Ontario said 
to me in a letter from last year: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is unable—due to a lack of information—to assess 
whether the CCRA will provide improved services, at lower costs, 
to Ontarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 Ontario budget, I indicated that we have significant 
concerns with the current arrangements for setting and collecting 
Ontario's income tax.  Ontario has suggested that the discussion 
about the creation of a new agency should include a review of the 
framework under which the provinces can make policy changes in 
harmonize tax arrangements. The province must have the capacity 
to adjust its tax policies to appropriately reflect the 
provincial needs, regardless of the method of collection and 
administration. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so we see that this grand scheme of the minister and 
government to have all the provinces participate in one mega tax 
collection agency has fallen on cold ears and has not been 
received positively.  Any punitive efficiency costs, 
administrative savings would not be realized without the 
participation particularly of the larger provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is it provincial governments who elect not to 
participate that will create inefficiencies but 40% of businesses 
surveyed in the public policy forum study saw no advantage to a 
single tax collection agency and 68% thought that a single tax 
collection agency would increase, not decrease, compliance costs 
or have no impact at all. The minister has not been able to 
persuade businesses and the business community in Canada that 
this proposal would create efficiencies in terms of compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look further at the other provinces.  Not only are 
Alberta, Ontario and some of the western provinces talking about 
pulling away from their involvement with the federal tax policy 
but so are some of the Atlantic provinces.  The province of Nova 
Scotia is considering removing itself from the HST, the 
harmonized sales tax, or as it is known on the east coast the 
BST, by going back to the original retail sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Prince Edward Island, which never committed to 
the HST, which was seen as a step on the way to a single tax 
collection agency, has committed itself in its election policy 
not to adopt the HST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not hard to understand why the provinces would be so 
sceptical about participation in this grand federal scheme given 
the paternalistic attitude of this government with respect to the 
sovereignty and the democratic responsibilities of the provinces. 
Just look at how this federal government has responded to the 
good faith constructive initiatives taken by the provincial 
governments this summer at their Saskatoon assembly with respect 
to the social union proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of responding positively and affirmatively, engaging in 
a constructive dialogue, the federal government just brushes the 
provinces aside, reminding the provinces and reminding taxpayers 
that this is precisely the same government which pontificates 
about the importance of national policy in matters like health 
care but which proceeded in the last term of government 
unilaterally to cut $7 billion without consultation or 
forewarning social transfers for health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government slaps the provincial governments by 
taking $7 billion away from critical social programs and slaps 
them again by lecturing them about the importance of those very 
programs which it has slashed and then the provinces come up and 
suggest a renovation of social policy between the federal and 
provincial governments through the social union recommendations. 
The federal government slaps them again by saying we don't care 
what recommendations you come up with, we are going to proceed 
unilaterally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that the provincial ministers of finance and 
premiers would be so unenthusiastic in their response to the 
revenue agency proposal? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1105

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with respect to efficiency one could argue that this 
act without the participation of the provinces would in fact 
result in greater inefficiency because what we have here in Bill 
C-43 is an act which creates a new bureaucracy.  It creates a new 
board of governors with no clearly defined role in the governing 
structure of the proposed agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill creates a new commissioner, a new patronage position 
to be appointed by the government.  It creates an entire new 
apparatus for the governance of Revenue Canada without any 
assurance that the provinces will be participating and that 
governance structure is even necessary. We would like to know 
exactly what the costs involved are in the creation of these new 
bureaucratic processes in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second punitive objective of this bill is to create greater 
administrative flexibility.  The minister rightfully points out 
that under the very strict, burdensome and bureaucratic 
employment and management guidelines of Treasury Board, Revenue 
Canada is finding it increasingly difficult to hire and maintain 
high quality, well trained people in an extremely competitive 
labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister points out, as we have heard from recent media 
reports, that this is a particularly critical problem with 
respect to tax auditors in certain regions of the country such as 
southern Ontario.  We have an unacceptably high level of turnover 
with respect to skilled auditors who can find considerably 
greater levels of compensation in the private sector than they 
can working under the unreasonably bureaucratic regulations of 
Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious problem because Revenue Canada is an enormous 
department. It is an enormous bureaucracy with approximately 
40,000 employees who constitute approximately 20% of the public 
service of Canada which raises about $1 billion a day with 
operational expenses approved by parliament of about $2.3 billion 
per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that in such an enormous federal bureaucracy we ought 
to aspire to greater flexibility in the administration of human 
resources and the management of personnel and their compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that government ought to operate more like business and 
less like bureaucracy.  We believe that there ought to be 
incentives for efficiency in the public sector and that good 
people should be paid more.  There should be a greater 
consideration of merit as opposed to bureaucratic schedules in 
the compensation of employees at Revenue Canada and in all other 
government departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very intrigued by the progress made in this respect by the 
governments of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and others, as 
mentioned by the minister in his speech, that have been able to 
achieve greater administrative flexibility and operate in a more 
business like fashion through the adoption of more flexible 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is not necessary for the government to adopt the agency 
or to pass this legislation or to diminish parliamentary 
accountability in order to achieve those savings, efficiencies 
and incentives.  All the government needs to do is pass 
legislation amending the Public Service Employment Act and other 
statutes exempting Revenue Canada from Treasury Board guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We requested and received an opinion from the Library of 
Parliament research branch on this very question.  We said is it 
possible for this parliament to give the minister of revenue the 
flexibility to pay his best people more, to operate in a more 
business like fashion with greater incentives and less 
bureaucracy without adopting an agency superstructure and 
diminishing accountability.  The answer from the Library of 
Parliament was indeed it is possible. From its report of May 29 
of this year: “The Public Service Commission could seek an 
amendment to the Public Service Employment Act to exempt the 
department from the staffing requirements under the act. 
Alternatively, the department could be given authority for its 
own staffing under another act of parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the current time the Treasury Board and the Public Service 
Commission have responsibilities for different aspects of the 
human resources regime in federal government departments, 
including Revenue Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In sum, it simply is a ruse for this minister to argue that he 
needs to create another bureaucracy through the CCRA board and 
commissioner, that he needs to jeopardize parliamentary 
accountability and ministerial oversight in order to achieve New 
Zealand and United Kingdom style efficiency gains.  Those gains 
can and should be made through normal legislative changes without 
jeopardizing accountability and the minister, I think, knows 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason why the Department of National Revenue should 
be isolated in this effort to find greater efficiencies and more 
business like incentives.  If the minister of revenue really has 
a problem with the way the Treasury Board guideline restricts his 
ability to hire people and manage human resources, he ought to go 
before the cabinet and suggest that all these statutes governing 
Treasury Board guidelines for personnel be changed and amended as 
we would strongly support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That takes us to the question of accountability.  This really is 
our central concern.  Originally in the early drafts of this 
legislation the government had really proposed the adoption of an 
IRS style management structure where the revenue agency would 
become a quasi crown corporation responsible in name only to the 
minister and through him to parliament.  But for all intents and 
purposes executive authority in this enormous tax collection 
bureaucracy would be centralized in the hands of a commissioner 
and a board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We and many other Canadians, businesses, provincial governments, 
stakeholders made it clear that we would simply not accept such a 
radical diminishment of parliamentary oversight and democratic 
authority in Revenue Canada or its successor agency.  We are 
pleased again to see that the government responded to some of 
those concerns by bringing the minister back into the scope of 
the act.  But our concern is still that there will be a transfer 
of executive responsibility, of policy making authority to the 
commissioner of the proposed agency and his or her board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something which the auditor general has flagged as an 
absolutely critical issue for this parliament to consider. In his 
report in December of last year the auditor general said that the 
new Canada customs and revenue agency is “an extremely and 
critically important one” to watch because of the nature of 
taxation and revenue collection within a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said also that he is concerned with “substantial amounts of 
money that are being put into the hands of arm's length 
organizations and that new ways of spending may also diminish 
parliamentary control over government activities”.  He pointed 
to the $800 million innovation fund administered by an arm's 
length organization and the millennium fund which could be as 
much as $240 million. The auditor general is worried about the 
effectiveness of parliament's accountability regimes which 
contribute to the overall health of our democratic institutions. 
He said that as the structure of government and the ways it 
functions are modified, it is important to preserve the 
accountability and oversight for elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is about as clear a signal as we can get from the man we 
charge to ensure the government spends and operates in an 
accountable manner.  He is saying we ought to be concerned about 
the potential for diminished accountability here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This really is an important principle because the whole history 
of parliament is a history of the common people rising up against 
the abuse of executive or in the past royal authority principally 
in the collection of taxes.  Historically parliament's central 
raison d'étre was the oversight of the tax collection power of 
government, of the executive branch, because the power to tax is 
the power to destroy.  It is an awesome power.  The powers we 
invest in the Minister of National Revenue are almost police 
powers.  We grant to him and he grants to his officials the 
power, the government's monopoly, the state's monopoly on 
coercive power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often this coercive power is abused.  Even though the 
minister theoretically controls the department and is responsible 
to parliament, every member of this place knows of outrageous and 
scandalous instances where officials of the Department of 
National Revenue have exceeded appropriate bounds in the tax 
collection process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised a number of these cases in the House over the past 
year.  Let me review some of them to remind us why accountability 
is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the minister of the case of Ms. Janice 
Collingridge of Calgary.  Ms. Collingridge is a severely 
handicapped quadriplegic who is unable to speak.  She is in a low 
income situation, such that the government of Alberta provides 
her with a subsidy to contract homecare workers to assist her in 
her daily duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turns out that a couple of years ago Ms. Collingridge managed 
to use some modern technology to type out on a computer a 
schedule for her homecare workers to come by at certain times of 
the day and to give them certain chores and responsibilities. 
The tax dogs at Revenue Canada found out about this terrible act 
on the part of Ms. Collingridge, this work schedule that she had 
produced, and they said “Ms. Collingridge, we are afraid that, 
based on the fact you created this schedule, these homecare 
workers we regard as employees of yours who are now obliged to 
pay payroll taxes and you are now liable for back payroll taxes 
of about $5,000”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A non-verbal, low income quadriplegic gets dragged into the Tax 
Court of Alberta at Calgary by this minister's officials to try 
to force her to give this government $5,000 for supposedly 
withholding payroll taxes for people who were there helping her 
live on a daily basis, supplied by the provincial government.  I 
say shame on this minister and his department and this government 
for allowing that kind of rabid abuse of power to occur.  This is 
what happens when the enormous power of tax collection is abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are dozens of cases like this that I have reviewed in the 
past year alone.  Let me review the case of, for instance, the 
Ethier family of Alberta who was assessed about $2,000 because a 
disability credit was terminated by the minister's tax police. 
Mrs. Ethier was disabled and unable to dress her upper body 
without assistance.  Her doctor wrote in a medical report that 
she was unable to perceive, think or remember to the extent that 
she was limited in the ability to do personal care or manage 
personal affairs.  In other words, she was seriously disabled. 
Medical reports clearly indicated this condition, but despite 
this evidence Revenue Canada officials ignored her medical 
reports and persisted with their re-assessment to deny her 
disability credit.  Revenue Canada ruled that she could work when 
the doctors said she could not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a curious position because her own doctor said “She 
constantly needs supervision”.  This is the kind of 
hard-hearted, cruel tactics sometimes employed by the minister's 
tax cops. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the case of Régent Millette of Laval, Quebec. 
His is a good example of the extraordinary tax collection 
powers of the government.  Mr. Millette wrote my office to tell 
me about the many difficulties he had experienced in recent 
years, when his property was seized and his family and friends, 
including his 91-year-old mother, were harassed.  He had a very 
difficult time coming up with enough money to meet the needs of 
his family. The problems he was facing pushed him to the brink 
of suicide.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When his case came up in court, the judge, Mr. Justice Jean-Louis 
Beaudoin, said “The law is the law, and we must apply it.  This 
is the only reason I support the opinion of my colleague, but I 
deplore the cavalier and clearly abusive fashion—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge himself said that Revenue Canada officials had used 
illegal means to collect the money. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I raise the case of Suzanne and John Thiessen of 
Manitoba.  They had confidential income tax information leaked to 
the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation without their consent. 
We raised this case in the House and the Minister of Revenue said 
“We have provisions to ensure the confidentiality of information 
at Revenue Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case, then why have I received several similar 
reports of leaked tax returns going to a crown corporation in 
Manitoba without the authorization of these taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all reasons we need not to diminish accountability in 
the tax collection process, as the minister proposes to do in the 
bill, but rather to enhance accountability to ensure that cases 
like the Collingridge case, the Millette case and the Thiessen 
case cannot happen, and that if they do happen, somebody, namely 
the minister, is going to be on the hot set and accountable to 
the democratically elected representatives of taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose to do precisely that through the adoption of a 
taxpayer bill of rights.  Let me be clear.  We would be prepared 
to consider supporting the bill because of the potential gains in 
terms of efficiency and flexibility in administration if the 
government were to adopt a taxpayer bill of rights with teeth to 
put the rights of taxpayers ahead of the tactics used by the tax 
collectors in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have released and tabled our draft taxpayer bill of 
rights which would enshrine the rights to due process in the tax 
collection process and the presumption of honesty on the part of 
taxpayers.  Now we have something called the declaration of 
taxpayer rights which is really just a gimmicky slogan that 
people find in brochures which the government distributes.  It 
has no statutory authority.  We are calling upon the government 
to pass a law which would enumerate the rights of taxpayers in 
the audit, assessment and collection processes of the revenue 
department or future agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rights that we would enumerate in the taxpayer bill of 
rights would include the right to understand tax laws.  Lay 
people should have access to the tax laws in plain language, not 
in the kind of incomprehensible gobbledegook which is found in 
the 1,300 page Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would include a right for taxpayers to be treated in a 
professional and courteous manner, for taxpayers to be able to 
complain about poor treatment or service, to receive a written 
response from officials at the agency or department and also the 
ability to appeal such a response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would grant taxpayers the right to pay the amount of tax 
required by law and not a penny more.  Government officials would 
be obligated to inform taxpayers in cases of overpayment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would provide taxpayers with the legislated right to know the 
purpose for which information is being requested and information 
on exactly what penalties are applicable if that information is 
not provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would include the right for taxpayers to represent themselves 
or appoint someone to act in their place in any dealings with 
Revenue Canada or the CCRA, as well as the right to record any 
and all meetings with revenue officials without being required to 
give notice of doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would continue to give taxpayers the right to appeal revenue 
rulings, first administratively through the appeals branch and 
later through the courts.  We would have Revenue Canada waive 
penalties and interest wherever it can be shown that a taxpayer 
acted in good faith and without the intention to evade, or relied 
upon incorrect advice provided by revenue officials.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could mention numerous cases where revenue officials have 
given inaccurate information, taxpayers in good faith have taken 
it and ended up finding themselves being penalized for having 
done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases where penalties and interest can cause severe financial 
hardship or in cases where reassessments can be proven to cause 
severe financial hardship, alternative arrangements should be 
made available through abatement or negotiated repayment 
schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, where fraud or evasion are suspected, Revenue Canada 
officials would be permitted to seize or freeze assets after 
first demonstrating a compelling reason for which such action 
must be taken.  Taxpayers would have the right to complain to the 
office for taxpayer protection, which we would create in this 
taxpayer bill of rights, in cases where the seizing of assets can 
be expected to create serious financial hardship for others, such 
as employees or family members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just a brief summary of some of the rights that we think 
could be incorporated in such a statute, but we would invite 
input from all members, parties and Canadians on how to 
strengthen a statutory protection like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that we propose in terms of a taxpayer bill of rights 
would, as I have mentioned, be enforced by the office for 
taxpayer protection.  He or she would be an officer of 
parliament, similar to the auditor general, who would report to 
parliament and would be asked to provide us with a summary of at 
least 25 of the most serious problems encountered by Revenue 
Canada or the revenue agency in a given year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayer ombudsman would be empowered to issue taxpayer 
protection borders where necessary to protect taxpayers from 
arbitrary treatment that could lead to undue financial hardship. 
He or she could act as an advocate of last resort for taxpayers 
who feel they are being treated unfairly or in an unjust or 
arbitrary manner by revenue officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He or she could assist taxpayers in resolving disputes with the 
revenue department or agency, could identify areas where 
taxpayers have been consistently having problems with the agency 
and could offer some recommendations on how these problems could 
be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the taxpayer protection officer could make 
recommendations to parliament about proposed changes to the 
administrative practices of the revenue agency in order to 
minimize problems incurred by taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a completely novel idea.  Recently many Canadians 
heard about the scandalous revelations before the United States 
Senate finance committee on the operations of the Internal 
Revenue Service.  As a result of the horror stories that were 
told by many taxpayers, the Government of the United States, the 
Congress and the presidency have adopted a new taxpayer bill of 
rights, which includes many excellent ideas which, again, give 
the presumption of innocence to honest taxpayers in the 
collection process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to remind the government that it does not matter how 
much it tinkers with the tax collection process, that unless and 
until we see fundamental reform of tax policy in this country, 
giving the provinces greater flexibility to administer their own 
tax laws and getting this destructive 1,300 page Byzantine tax 
code that nobody understands, under control, and until we provide 
Canadians with real tax relief, people will not have faith in the 
tax collection process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the finance minister to Louis XIV, said 
that tax collection consists of plucking a goose so as to produce 
the most amount of feathers with the least amount of hissing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that that is the objective of this government.  It is 
goose plucking and trying to do so in the most efficient way 
possible.  However, the reality is that Canadians are overtaxed. 
They are overburdened by an enormous tax code, by a department of 
over 40,000 people, sucking up enormous resources that could 
otherwise be directed to productive private sector employment and 
economic activity.  Instead, billions and billions of dollars in 
this economy are wasted by businesses and taxpayers in complying 
with the enormous and out of control Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition will oppose Bill C-43 unless the 
government responds to our call for the adoption of a taxpayer 
bill of rights with teeth and the creation of an office for 
taxpayer protection to enforce that act.

government's plans for continuing to pluck $160 billion out of 
the pockets of Canadian taxpayers.  We want to see tax relief and 
fundamental tax reform.  I call upon the government and this 
minister to start moving in that direction.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK33">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-43, an 
act to establish the Canada customs and revenue agency and to 
amend and repeal other acts as a consequence, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too wish to say a few words on the bill that is before 
the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bill to establish a taxation agency.  In other words, it 
takes the function that Revenue Canada now has away from Revenue 
Canada and establishes a taxation agency which would have 
sweeping powers to administer not just income tax at the federal 
level and to collect that tax, but to collect income tax at the 
provincial level, to collect the federal GST, to collect 
provincial sales taxes, to collect liquor taxes, gasoline taxes 
and eventually down the road to collect taxes from 
municipalities.  That is the purpose of the bill before the House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important and fundamental change in the 
administration of taxes in this country.  It is a bill that 
deserves a lot of attention by members of this House in terms of 
whether or not we want to go in this direction as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke this morning.  He told us that there are a 
couple of important reasons for proposing this legislation.  I 
want to review those very briefly. He said it is important that 
we have a federal-provincial tax agency that the provinces and 
federal government subscribe to in terms of collecting taxes.  He 
said that this agency would be more efficient, would save money 
and so on. I raise a few concerns about this because of what I 
see happening in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of provincial-federal co-operation, if that were 
the case it would be an excellent theory.  As I read the country 
around me, I find there is very adamant opposition to this by the 
provinces of Quebec and Ontario. 
Right there, two provinces representing around two-thirds of the 
population of the country are opposing this bill. Saskatchewan 
and British Columbia are certainly not convinced that this is 
good legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1135

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that there is not a single province to date, 
unless I am out of touch here, that has officially signed on to 
this agency or has even signed a letter of intent.  Maybe the 
minister will get up and correct that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to me to be a very bad start when the provinces are 
in opposition to a bill that is supposed to be there to collect 
taxes for the provinces and the federal government.  The 
provinces see this as an intrusion into their field of 
jurisdiction.  I think that is a serious matter in terms of 
federal-provincial relations.  It is a serious matter of the lack 
of co-operative federalism in a country where we need more 
co-operative federalism and governments working together in 
concert with each other.  I know the minister agrees with that 
but it has not happened so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tells us to be patient.  We can be patient but in 
the long run we are all dead.  How long does he want us to be 
patient?  He tells us to trust him.  Well a lot of people in 
politics have said “Trust me and things will work out”.  The 
minister is a pretty honest and straightforward guy but he cannot 
by himself get the Ontario or Quebec governments or any other 
province to come onside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of Quebec.  I worry about some of the 
national unity consequences of this in terms of the timing.  The 
Quebec government certainly sees this as an intrusion into 
provincial jurisdiction.  Quebec is not talking about ceding more 
power to a federal agency.  In fact most Quebecers, including the 
provincial Liberal Party, talk about a greater devolution of 
power to the province of Quebec.  Whether it is a greater 
devolution to all the provinces or asymmetrical federalism, they 
would like a greater devolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is now coming within months of the writs being dropped 
for a provincial election in Quebec.  It is a very crucial 
election in terms of that province and the future of our country, 
which may or may not result in another referendum about the 
future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I worry about the timing of this bill in terms of the 
federal-provincial consequences and the consequences in the 
province of Quebec.  I question the wisdom of this. If we want to 
make this country work, we need co-operative federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A long time ago we had leaders in this House of Commons who 
talked a lot about co-operative federalism: Lester Pearson when 
he was prime minister of the country; Bob Stanfield, the leader 
of the Conservative Party; Tommy Douglas, the leader of the New 
Democratic Party.  This country was making great progress in 
terms of national unity, in bringing this country together, in 
the sharing of powers and in co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it seems that we have a bill here that is going in the 
opposite direction.  If there were a federal-provincial agreement 
on this and agreement from the provinces, it would be a different 
case, but that is not the case in the bill before us today.  That 
is a major concern I wanted to raise in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to raise the concern about the diminishing power of 
government itself.  This is really the most major privatization 
this government has carried out.  It is quasi-privatization. It 
is taking away 40,000 public servants from the Department of 
National Revenue, which is about 20% of the public servants. It 
is slicing away about $2 billion from the estimates of this 
country to establish an agency that will be run according to the 
business practices that will be arm's length from the Parliament 
of Canada and from the minister himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister assures us that the powers are still there and that 
he is still responsible because that is the way the legislation 
is written.  Even the auditor general was concerned about this in 
his report in December 1997.  He was concerned about the public 
interest and about the arm's length of this agency in terms of 
accountability.  As was mentioned by a member of the Reform 
Party, there is a growing lack of accountability of government 
agencies and government bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about the diminishing role of government and 
of the public sector which has certainly been expedited since the 
Liberal Party took office.  The Liberal Party used to complain 
when the Brian Mulroney government privatized something or 
diminished the role of government, yet that has been expedited 
since the 1993 election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of talk about uniting the right.  I think 
the right is pretty much united.  It sits across the way.  It is 
the Liberal Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is a lot of rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  They say it is rubbish but look what 
has happened.  There has been privatization of the CNR, 
privatization of a lot of companies, the gutting of employment 
insurance, the health plan, all of these things. Going back to 
EI, there are many people who cannot even qualify because of the 
changes to employment insurance which were done not by Brian 
Mulroney and the Tories, but by the Liberal government across the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is another example of that drift to the right.  That 
party over there when in opposition tried to be very progressive 
in the way it talked.  Now that it is in government it is 
extremely conservative.  That is the historical position of the 
Liberal Party of Canada.  I am concerned about that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wanted to mention some of the concerns about business 
itself.  This is supposed to make it more cost efficient and 
easier for business to comply with and so on.  As has already 
been referred to, a study was commissioned by Revenue Canada 
itself from the Public Policy Forum.  What were the results of 
that study? It said 68% of the people who were questioned thought 
that there would either be an increase in the costs of compliance 
or there would be no impact whatsoever in terms of the costs of 
compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two-thirds of the business community said it would not matter 
one way or the other in terms of costs or else their costs would 
go up.  What is the government's reply to that? This is to be 
done to keep down costs, to make things more efficient.  The 
business community does not seem to agree and the study seems to 
verify that so why go ahead with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my third concern.  The first one is the provincial 
opposition, the second one the whole idea of privatization that 
diminishes the role of the public sector in Canada. The third one 
is that the business community itself, small businesses and large 
businesses, are concerned that their costs will either remain the 
same or increase with this new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth thing I am concerned about is the whole question to 
which I already referred, that of accountability.  Right now we 
have a government department and a minister who is accountable 
for Revenue Canada.  That has been the practice in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we establish a new agency that is at arm's length, that 
will have a management board, that will draw up a business plan 
and then report that business plan through a CEO to the Minister 
of National Revenue, I think there will be less accountability in 
terms of the Government of Canada to the people of this country. 
We will have more and more people from the private sector sitting 
on that board, recommended and nominated by the provinces and so 
on.  It will be more of a private sector orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wonder about this new layer of bureaucracy that will be 
established in terms of the management board.  What about the 
salaries of the CEO and senior executives?  Will they reflect the 
salaries in private corporations instead of the salaries of 
senior government officials?  Senior officials have always 
received an increase in salaries but their salaries are nowhere 
near what the CEOs and senior executives in the private sector 
receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agency would employ 40,000 people and would be one of the 
largest corporations in the country, a bit smaller than Canada 
Post at 50,000, but would still be very, very large, and the 
senior management team received compensation comparable to what 
we see in the private sector.  This will be an additional cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder about all these things in terms of accountability.  We 
are getting less and less accountability in our so-called 
democratic parliamentary system as more and more decision making 
is taken away.  In fact we have had in many ways the 
privatization of decision making as more decisions are made 
outside parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability has gone away from this place.  We have 
government backbenchers and MPs all around who have very little 
say over the public policy direction of the country.  This is now 
another example of some power that is being taken away from the 
Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the size of the agency itself.  What we 
have here is a vision of a super tax collection agency if it 
evolves.  It is being given the power to evolve so we should look 
at what might happen in 10 or 15 years. It will collect not just 
federal taxes but will also collect provincial taxes, the gas 
tax, the liquor tax.  It may also collect municipal taxes, 
property taxes, school taxes and so on. It would be like a mega 
tax man, like a Frankenstein.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are concerned about that.  They are concerned about 
evolving into the kind of agency that we see in the United States 
with the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service, in terms of how that 
agency is out of control and is arm's length from the Government 
of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IRS, by the way, is still a government department in the 
United States.  The IRS is not an agency in the United States. It 
operates in a very independent and aggressive fashion.  I do not 
know if we want the kind of tax agency they have in the United 
States in this country, with the Canadian background and 
tradition we have of trying to work things out between the 
provinces, the municipalities and the federal government.   The 
vision of the agency is that of a huge taxation agency which 
collects all taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another concern.  One of the purposes—and the minister 
does not talk about it any more—of establishing the agency was 
to try to blend the GST with the provincial sales tax, the BST or 
the HST, the harmonized sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well the campaign in 1993.  I remember the 
promise made by the prime minister that if the Liberal Party were 
elected it would get rid of the GST.  Do members remember that 
one? There is a member on the backbench hanging his head in 
shame; he is crying.  At least the member from Hamilton had the 
honesty and the integrity to say “yes, that is a promise we 
made”; to resign her seat; and to face her people in a 
byelection campaign. However the GST is still there.  Why has the 
GST not disappeared?  It is a promise the Liberals made and it is 
still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One purpose of the agency was to get around that campaign 
promise by abolishing the GST, rolling it into the provincial 
sales taxes across the country and calling it a harmonized sales 
tax. They floated the idea with the provinces and the only 
provinces that agreed were the three Liberal provinces in 
Atlantic Canada:  Mr. Tobin in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  The sales tax situation in Quebec 
changed a long time before the Liberal Party took office.  It was 
a totally different regime.  It was initiated by the Government 
of Quebec and a deal was made a long time before the Liberals 
took power.  The only people that agreed to the harmonized sales 
tax were in Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One raison d'être of the agency is to push the idea of 
harmonizing sales taxes.  I can say from my trips to Atlantic 
Canada that the blended sales tax, the HST, is very unpopular. It 
almost led to the defeat of the Liberal government in the Nova 
Scotia election just a few months ago.  It did defeat the 
government in Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have about the bill before the House today is 
that once the agency is established the pressure will be there. 
They will put pressure on the provinces to agree to harmonize the 
tax.  Even my friend from Souris—Moose Mountain in Saskatchewan 
would not agree with the BST.  He would not agree with a blended 
sales tax, and he is a member of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of reasons for questioning the bill and I want 
to summarize them again very briefly.  The first is provincial 
opposition.   The provinces do not like an agency that will 
collect federal and provincial taxes.  Ontario has said no. 
Quebec has said no.  The other provinces have not signed on. 
Saskatchewan and British Columbia are unlikely to sign on.  Why 
would we have this agency, which is supposed to be a 
federal-provincial agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of national unity, with the Quebec election 
coming up, this is an agency that is supposed to take power away 
from the provinces rather than give power to them.  That is a 
concern to most members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is the very size of the agency in terms of it developing 
into an agency like the Internal Revenue Service in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is the whole question of privatization, diminishing the 
role of government and downsizing the public service.  The Reform 
Party may agree with that.   It does not really like government. 
It does not really like the public sector.  That is not the 
Canadian way.  That is not the Canadian tradition.  That is one 
reason the Reform Party is going nowhere.  It is taking a stand 
against Canadian tradition that the public sector is extremely 
important, a very important part of what makes the country tick. 
Another reason I want to mention is the lack of accountability. 
Accountability just will not be there once it becomes an arm's 
length agency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are our major concerns as a party.  I close by saying to 
the minister and to government members across the way that if 
four opposition parties have concerns about the bill in these 
areas, surely to goodness there must be government backbenchers 
that have the same concerns.  They talk to their constituents. 
They listen to the people.  They hear from the unions involved 
with Revenue Canada and know the opposition of the majority of 
the unions such as the Public Service Alliance of Canada.  They 
hear from the workers who will be affected directly.  They talk 
to people.  Surely to goodness we can have some independent 
thinking on the Liberal side of the House.  They should get up to 
express some concern that the bill does not go in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time we had a parliamentary system that allowed 
people to take off the muzzle and speak their minds.  Surely to 
goodness we cannot have all the government thinking one way and 
the opposition thinking another.  No wonder people are 
questioning the sanity of this place and the relevance of the 
Parliament of Canada.  Yet the whips will be on to those 
backbenchers who talked to me privately.  They questioned the 
bill and the wisdom of the agency but they will not be allowed to 
say so in the House.  They will not be able to vote that way. Let 
us have a free vote on this issue so that members of the House 
can express their feelings and the feelings of their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not be a confidence vote.  There is no reason it 
should be a confidence vote.  It does not go to the heart of 
government policy.  It does not go to the heart of a government 
budget.  If we have a free vote on this issue we can speak our 
minds and ensure that we are doing the right thing for the 
people.  I am glad the Reformers agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have talked about free votes time and time again, 
but in their five years in the House they have not delivered on 
the promise of a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by making an appeal to the minister across the way.  Let 
us have a beginning of parliamentary reform, a beginning of a 
true democracy in this institution, by allowing a free vote on an 
important bill regarding the collection of Canadian taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important issue.  The collection of taxes is a 
fundamental issue in democracy.  It is the prerogative of the 
state.  The role of the state is to collect taxes.  I do not want 
to see it privatized or evolved away to an agency that will be 
run according to business practices.  I do not want to see it 
turned over to an agency that will not be accountable to the 
government like it has been in the past.  I do not want to see 
that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a free vote.  If I could ask the minister whether or 
not he would agree with that, I would be glad to sit down to hear 
his answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened very intently to the hon. 
colleagues from all three parties and want to address a couple of 
issues they brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have said that they want governments to work together. 
Canadians recognize that we are overgoverned. Canadians recognize 
that a lot of overlap and duplication exists in the country.  We 
have listened to Canadians and we responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I want to point out is that the provinces have an 
option.  This does not in any way force the provinces to let us 
collect more of their taxes.  We already collect a lot of their 
taxes.  In fact in some provinces we collect 80% of their 
revenue; in other provinces we collect 50%.  The agency is a 
vehicle to create new options and new opportunities for 
provinces, territories and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for the NDP talked about the auditor general's 
report.  That report was before some of the changes I made to 
give full accountability to parliament and full accountability to 
the Minister of National Revenue.  The comments the auditor 
general made were regarding the older model without the changes I 
have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses know the paper burden they have to go through. 
They know about overlap and duplication. 
They are asking the government to respond.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one taxpayer in the country.  If we could have one 
tax administration, a single window, we would be better off. 
Canadians do not want us to build parallel systems in every 
province as the member from the Bloc Quebecois wants.  His view 
is that it is good but the provinces must collect all taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business people would respond to that because they do not 
want to be dealing with 10 different jurisdictions across the 
country.  They do not want a different system of tax collection 
in every province.  They want a single window approach.  They 
want to reduce paperwork.  They want to make sure there is less 
burden on the business people.  Why?  It is because we want them 
to do what they do best, which is run their businesses.  We want 
an organization that can respond to the new needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have electronic commerce now.  Someone can sell a good from 
Quebec into British Columbia.  How are we to respond to that? How 
are we to respond to changes?  We need a national agency that can 
work with all provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about co-operative federalism.  This is 
in co-operation with the provinces.  The provinces say in some 
cases we are collecting 80% of their taxes but in some cases they 
do not have any say.  This will provide them with a real say by 
ensuring they can nominate people to the board of the agency. 
They do not have that now.  In some provinces are collecting 50% 
or more of their taxes.  It is really about creating new options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also said this was another way to harmonize. 
Absolutely not.  We are saying that we can collect taxes for the 
provinces which are not harmonized.  Recently I had a discussion 
with the minister of finance from British Columbia who said 
“That is a very good idea.  We should look at how we can reduce 
the burden to small business”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had meetings with ministers of finance across the 
country.  We have officials working right now to identify those 
areas in which we can work together co-operatively when it is a 
benefit to the province, to the business community and to 
Canadians.  That is what this vehicle is about.  It is about 
creating options and better service for Canadians.  It is about 
providing better service to our small business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a trading nation.  We need to ensure that we are 
efficient.  If we are efficient we can be more competitive in the 
new global economy.  This is about reaching a new vision.  This 
is about working together.  This is about responding to 
Canadians.  We will continue to do that as a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I reply to the minister 
by saying that if the agency is such a great thing for the 
provinces, why have the provinces not agreed to come at this 
stage?  Ontario has said no.  Quebec has said no.  There is no 
agreement in British Columbia and no agreement in Saskatchewan. 
If this is such a great thing in terms of co-operative 
federalism, why has there not been a provincial-federal agreement 
or letters of intent from at least a majority of the provinces 
indicating that have signed on at this stage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see why some provinces might not want to agree.  It is 
difficult to get unanimous consent of all provinces.  Ontario and 
Quebec alone represent two-thirds of the population.  If this is 
such a great vehicle of federal-provincial co-operation, why has 
that not happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the provinces 
particularly in western Canada have asked me for such an agency. 
They have been saying they want to play a role in the agency. 
When I met with the ministers from Saskatchewan and Manitoba they 
asked for such an agency, and we are responding to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the HST was signed in the maritimes one of the requests 
those provinces made was to have an agency in which they would 
have a say.  We are responding to the provinces.  Of course we do 
not have an agency until we pass the legislation.  They want to 
see what the final wording is.  They want to make sure they know 
exactly what they are getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had very good meetings with ministers of finance across 
the country.  They have said it is the right direction because 
they understand the needs of the business community.  They 
understand the needs of Canadians. They know we have to respond 
to the changes in Canada.  We have to respond to the new 
realities, and that is what the agency is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if that is the case, I 
wonder whether the minister can table in the House some letters 
from the provinces where they certainly will indicate that in 
principle they agree with the agency, some letters of intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the bill before the House today.  We have a fair number 
of details.  The legislation is there.  It has been talked about. 
We have the bill here in the House at second reading.  My 
experience in this place is that if it is a federal-provincial 
agency or program, we know exactly where the provinces stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the minister can table in the House some proof that 
the provinces are enthused by this, that they like the principle 
of this, that their intention is to sign on, providing the 
details live up to their expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what he is saying to the House.  I wonder if he can 
table some information to document that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Manitoba 
finance minister Eric Stefanson on May 22, 1998, talking about 
the agency, said western provinces have long advocated a national 
agency.  He supports the concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also quote Mr. Ed Blanchard, minister of finance for New 
Brunswick: “Where there are efficiencies to be gained, I am open 
to alternatives.  There may be areas that, yes, some of our 
current taxes can be collected in an efficient way by this agency 
and I have not shut the door on any possibility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, these are quotes in the 
media and we have all seen the media.  We have media scanners and 
so on.  What I am concerned about is where is the beef. Where are 
these letters of intent?  Where are the documents that show these 
provinces are going to sign on, that they like this principle and 
that they will sign on providing all the details and regulations 
are okay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have seen the bill.  They have seen the principles of the 
bill.  They have seen the details of the law.  All that is 
missing are the regulations or any amendments that might be made 
by the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the constitutional debates we had in the House back in 
1980 we knew exactly where the provinces stood in terms of 
letters of intent.  They would be in communication with us. Prime 
Minister Trudeau could get up and say Ontario supports him and 
Manitoba does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the beef?  Where are these letters?  Where is all the 
support the minister is talking about, outside of press 
clippings? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the time for questions 
and comments has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first 
of all I would like to comment on the new entente that seems to 
exist on that side of the House.  Now that Reformers and New 
Democrats are seated together, they seem to be developing a 
certain comfort and a certain respect for the principles of each 
of their parties.  Perhaps in the future we might see a unite the 
light movement in this House in the efforts of co-operative 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on Bill C-43. 
While the minister speaks of the provinces having greater 
opportunities to affect control and to have control over the 
levers of this very important agency than they have now with 
Revenue Canada, I would posit that the provinces' opposition or 
at least their lack of approval and their concern with this new 
agency is an indication that they do not believe that greater 
power and greater authority will be had by the provinces of the 
levers of this new agency, this new, if you will, King John Inc. 
the government is proposing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government offloads responsibilities to the provinces by 
making draconian cuts to health care, for instance, $7 billion in 
the last term.  The minister said there is only one taxpayer. 
The provinces and the municipalities have been faced with an ever 
increasing tax burden as a result of the government's failure to 
lead and the government's failure to take responsibility for 
national matters, including issues like health care funding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is going to be true to his phrase that there is 
only one taxpayer, he should recognize the near toxic levels of 
hypocrisy of his government in effectively reducing spending and 
offloading responsibility to the provinces.  You can offload a 
lot of things but you cannot really offload leadership.  That is 
what this government has tried to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government proposal to transform Revenue Canada from a 
government department into an agency raises some very serious 
questions.  Revenue Canada is the largest government department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At various times of the year it has between 40,000 and 46,000 
employees.  Revenue Canada has many responsibilities including, 
of course, primarily the collecting of federal taxes and various 
fees, harmonized sales tax in three provinces, personal income 
tax on behalf of nine provinces and corporate taxes on behalf of 
seven provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency is to assume all these responsibilities and 
the new agency is supposed to be as efficient as the department 
was without any increased cost to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that unless the provinces buy in, unless the provinces 
support this direction and this new agency, any claims by the 
government that this agency will lead to greater efficiencies and 
save the taxpayer money are specious at best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that we could save between $97 million 
and $162 million per year if all the provinces participate.  That 
is a very big if at this juncture. Currently the provinces have 
not demonstrated a significant interest in having Ottawa collect 
and have more authority in effect over taxes beyond what Revenue 
Canada does currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is looking to attain greater authority over its tax 
levers.  It cannot simply be said to the provinces that someone 
is going to have more authority over their spending without 
providing them with more direct authority over tax policies. Some 
of the provinces feel this agency may ultimately lead to less. If 
the provinces are not interested, obviously the agency will not 
save money or lead to greater efficiencies.  The board of 
management may be yet another bureaucratic layer that will simply 
lead to increased costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is privacy. Too much information on individuals 
will be concentrated with one agency which will, as a private 
agency, be looking to contract out services for auditing and 
collection and ultimately the tax system may become less 
confidential than it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe very strongly in the ability for private agencies 
and/or privatization to provide efficiencies but that has to be 
balanced against the very important delivery of service, 
particularly the confidentiality of this, the most important area 
of government in terms of its direct contact with people and the 
level of authority that an agency, currently Revenue Canada, has 
on people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there is also a significant risk in terms of its use 
of power for this agency.  Currently we have a very direct 
ministerial responsibility with Revenue Canada.  That is a good 
check and balance.  This House is a good check and balance on 
this government department of Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been studies done on the impact to somebody of 
receiving a letter from a tax agency saying they are being 
audited.  A tax audit letter evokes about the same level of 
emotion and fear as— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Gallbladder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  I hear a member opposite speaking of a 
gallbladder attack.  I am not certain whether it has that level 
of medical effect but it evokes the same level of emotion that a 
letter of a death of a close relative would.  That is the level 
of impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one receives a letter from Revenue Canada there is the 
whole idea that as an individual citizen or as the owner of a 
small business they will be taking on this huge omnipotent force 
which ultimately has all the levers. It is extremely frightening 
to Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fear that this agency will become Godzilla the tax 
collector and that it will have greater force and less political 
accountability, which is quite frightening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a small business person I received one of those letters a few 
years ago.  I spent about a year and a half defending myself 
against my own government.  Ultimately the government said I was 
right and it was wrong.  However, during that period I spent 
thousands of dollars on a tax accountant to defend myself.  When 
I consider that, the type of situation which exists with 
small businesses and individuals across Canada, I fear that this 
agency could make it worse because we do not have the political 
accountability of members of this House and the minister who can 
effectively act as a watchdog over that type of activity and 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that while we are dealing with the agency of 
delivery of tax collection in Canada, we should be dealing in a more 
holistic way with the whole nature of taxes in Canada.  I applaud 
the Mintz report on corporate taxation which came out two months 
ago and which I think has some very beneficial and constructive 
public policy positions that can if implemented help simplify, 
ultimately flatten and reduce the bureaucratic nightmare that 
Canadian businesses are subject to in dealing with their own 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of personal taxes we also need to similarly simplify 
and flatten to a certain extent tax policy in Canada because 
currently our tax code is too complicated. There is something 
fundamentally wrong with the whole concept that Canadians need to 
hire a tax accountant or in some cases a tax lawyer to simply 
deal with their own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see this agency going a long way to achieving any of 
these ends.  I see it as a symbolic or band-aid approach that 
arguably will not accomplish a whole lot.  It is based on the 
premise that public servants cannot necessarily provide the same 
level of competency that a private agency might. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we create incentives within all our public agencies or 
departments, incentives that recognize and reward excellence as 
opposed to encouraging mediocrity, i.e. if we introduce market 
incentives within the existing agencies, we can achieve economies 
without necessarily creating new agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new agency may be an indication of the government's trying 
to pander to this whole public sentiment that the public service 
does not do a good job or the public service cannot do a good 
job.  I think that is very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the tragedies or one of the losses that we have seen in 
recent years is that politicians have made gratuitous attacks on 
public servants without really considering the ramifications of 
those attacks.  One of the damages sustained by those types of 
attacks has been the low level of morale we have within our 
public service now.  Our public service I suggest is at an all 
time low in terms of morale.  We simply cannot accept that there 
are not people who want to work within government departments and 
to succeed, to excel, to be proud of what they do and to provide 
the levels of service to their country that are important and 
which in the past have been encouraged. We can make many of the 
changes necessary within the existing department without creating 
this new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are not really interested in having a new agency.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is looking at increased powers for collecting its own 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board of management will be just another bureaucratic layer 
which will add additional costs.  We see too much power 
concentrated in one agency which will have less accountability to 
parliament and to the minister.  The power of authority or 
information on individual Canadians is going to be extremely 
concentrated.  Again, this agency will be less accountable to 
parliament than a department and the minister will not be 
involved in any day to day functioning of the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see current employees who will lose existing rights, 
including job security and the right to bargain on staffing 
matters.  Keep in mind that there will only be a two year job 
guarantee and we are effectively dealing with, I understand, 
about 25% of the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take a look at whether or not this agency would in 
fact not be more flexible than Revenue Canada, but less flexible 
in working with other government departments, including the 
finance department, and the provinces.  Because of the need that 
we have in this country for holistic tax reform, perhaps this is 
simply not the time we should be creating a separate agency. In 
fact we need more federal-provincial co-operation, not just on 
tax enforcement, but on overall tax policy.  We need more 
co-operation between the Department of Finance and Revenue Canada 
and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take away the political element of that I think would be a 
huge mistake at a time when we have an unprecedented need for 
forward thinking tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I think the government is focusing on reforming tax 
enforcement.  Yes, there are reforms that are necessary.  Those 
reforms need to provide greater accountability, not less 
accountability.  In our opinion, this legislation and this new 
agency would provide less accountability.  Therefore it may be 
arguably a step in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, it may actually increase the barriers to co-operation 
between the provinces and the federal government and the 
Department of Finance to effect change and develop a holistic 
approach to tax policy which will result in a fairer, flatter tax 
policy which will be more conducive to economic growth and the 
success of Canadians in the global market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was with great pleasure that I heard my hon. colleague from 
the Reform Party today speaking of a declaration of taxpayer 
rights or a taxpayer bill of rights.  I thought for a moment it 
was Trent Lott speaking or Newt Gingrich with darker hair.  I 
believe that the hon. member is happy with that comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the hon. member does strike a chord in terms of the 
importance of our tax policy in Canada and our tax enforcement 
practices being less intrusive and more respectful of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was one of those Canadians who did receive one of those tax 
audit letters one day.  My only crime at the age of 22 was 
operating a small business that employed young Canadians. 
Ultimately the government agreed with me, but it took me almost 
two years and thousands of dollars to a tax accountant to defend 
myself against my own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my hon. colleague from the Reform Party.  I would 
bring to his attention the declaration of taxpayer rights which 
was part of the work done by a former member of this House and 
former cabinet minister, Perrin Beatty, who is a forward thinking 
member of the Progressive Conservative Party.  He also saw the 
need and in fact had some results in improving the level of 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about issues of privacy and confidentiality, 
impartiality, courtesy and consideration, the presumption of 
innocence, and impartial hearings before payment; all of those 
types of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made progress in the past and we have to continue 
working to make progress in the future on these types of issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see Bill C-43 and this new agency as necessarily being 
conducive to this process.  We need to ensure that we do not 
separate the political will that is necessary to effect change in 
this very important matter from a logistical body that enforces 
tax policy in Canada.  There is a very dangerous separation that 
may result in less ability for elected members of the House or 
the minister to effect change, to control and to have the ability 
to govern things like abuse of power by Revenue Canada agents and 
that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is great to hear the support of members opposite for 
consumption taxes.  We wish they had been more vocal in their 
support of consumption taxes in 1993 when the Conservative 
government replaced the counter-productive manufacturers sales 
tax with the GST, which ultimately was the right tax at that 
time.  It has demonstrated to be a fairer tax than many of the 
income taxes and other taxes that this government seems 
comfortable with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should not criticize the government for having adopted sound 
Conservative polices.  The only thing worse than it having 
shamelessly taken those policies from the previous government 
would have been if it had implemented its own.  The consequences 
of those would have been far more egregious and detrimental to 
Canadians.  I am making a muted criticism of the government for 
taking our policies, but I want to commend it on its judgment for 
having done so.  It took this government longer to learn and 
absorb the benefits of sound economic policy.  Perhaps it did not 
catch on at the time of the 1993 election.  However, it has since 
accepted those measures, including free trade and the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to work very hard to implement many of the 
recommendations of the Mintz report on business taxation.  On the 
personal tax side we need similar reforms that simplify and 
flatten our tax code.  I hope we devote our energies to that type 
of approach and to those types of very important public policy 
initiatives and less time on bureaucratic window dressing changes 
that ultimately will result in King John Inc., but will not 
necessarily make any difference in the way tax policies are 
enforced or implemented, which may result in even larger problems 
in the future.

bill, which is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke about the need for tax reform.  I share 
his concern, as I expressed at the conclusion of my remarks, that 
this government seems to be more concerned about figuring out how 
it can most effectively pluck the goose—that is to say, the 
taxpayer—rather than how it can provide real tax reform to 
create real incentives for people to work, to save, to invest and 
to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member enlighten us as to how he would, in broad 
terms, reform the tax code which right now imposes such an 
enormous burden on Canadian taxpayers?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem with a number of the Pavlovian tax policies of 
this government; the whole idea that government, by picking 
winners and losers, and by encouraging one type of activity and 
discouraging others, will in fact make decisions which cause or 
channel energies and economic focuses in one direction or 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, frankly, that individuals participating in a free 
market can make those decisions best and that government 
intervention in making some activities more profitable, or some 
activities less profitable through a tax code, is in fact 
evidence of government trying to effectively control populations 
and individuals.  I do not have an awful lot of faith in 
politicians when it comes to economic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that we make personal taxes in Canada more 
neutral in terms of their treatment of activities, that we treat 
the tax code as a means to raise revenue, not as a means to 
control Canadians, and that we also look seriously at reducing 
the disincentives that exist currently with the tax brackets 
which actually punish success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we should be trying to encourage success, we actually have 
punitive measures built into our tax code to punish success. 
That is perverse in a country where we are competing globally. 
We should be encouraging our Canadian citizens not only to 
compete, but to succeed globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a tax code in this country that causes people to be less 
competitive, less focused on success and, frankly, more 
frightened of their own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of tax complexity, doing your taxes is the only 
do-it-yourself project that exists where if you do it properly 
you could still end up in jail.  There is an inherent unfairness, 
not just on the enforcement side of it, but in terms of the whole 
nature of the tax code.  I call it the Pavlovian nature of the 
tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to let businesses and individuals make 
their own decisions.  I think that would be a step in the right 
direction.  I also believe that consumption taxes are less 
destructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just criticized the Pavlovian tax policy, but there are some 
public policy initiatives whereby we can ensure that the cost of 
some behaviours are accounted for at the time, in terms of 
internalizing the externalities of people's behaviour.  We can 
use a tax code to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of areas that need to be discussed, but the 
Mintz tax report actually does a lot of it.  The recommendations 
are fairly sound on a business level.  If we were to apply some 
of those principles to the personal side, I think we would go a 
long way to effecting change and to introducing a greater level 
of fairness, equity and incentive for success for Canadians in 
the Canadian tax code.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to speak on a bill which seeks to uphold

</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a world of major economic and technological change. 
We live in a world where citizens rightly expect more creativity,

governments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real reason behind the creation of the Canada 
customs and revenue agency.  We want to preserve the traditions 
of the past but we also want to develop an innovative environment 
that will allow us to be the best for many years to come. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxation, customs and the administration of trade policies 
represent complex areas dependent upon a great many people who 
do many things and do them well. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to improve how we do things, even the things we 
already do well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister indicated so clearly in his speech, this bill is 
about fairness.  It is about partnerships.  It is about 
accountability.  It is about saving money for taxpayers and is 
about modernizing our approach to meet the expectations and 
aspirations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue will be responsible for the 
agency to parliament.  He will continue to be responsible for 
administering and enforcing program legislation such as the 
Income Tax Act and the Customs Act.  The minister will have the 
authority to inquire into issues raised by members of parliament 
on behalf of our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister outlined before this House the structure and duties 
of the board of management.  Having private sector people 
nominated by the provinces and territories will change the system 
for the better.  It will guarantee even more opportunities for 
federal-provincial co-operation.  That is what Canadians expect 
from governments.  That is what Canadians expect from elected 
officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The true measure of success for the new agency will be in its 
operations.  We want, as the minister said, an organization with 
a state of mind that is state of the art.  The real change will 
be in our approach to doing business and our approach to serving 
Canadians and providing them with tax and trade administration 
services that are second to none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency we are proposing is built upon the guiding principles 
of service and fairness.  Canadians have told us what they want. 
They want to deal with a more client oriented tax and customs 
administration.  They want more personal contact and less passing 
the buck.  They want consistent answers. They want to deal with 
an organization that is flexible, one that can accommodate a 
range of human situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want us to make their lives a lot simpler, from 
bulletins issued in plain language to business hours dealing with 
modern realities of working families.  Agency status will allow 
us to improve service to Canadians by affording more flexibility 
in the way we manage resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our generation is one that often embraces technology as a 
panacea for any operational challenge.  In truth, technology has 
been a great partner in improving the way Revenue Canada does 
business.  From electronic filing, to virtual customs approvals, 
to Canpass, the pre-approved pass for frequent travellers, we 
have used technology to improve service and to reduce costs. For 
every technological change though, there are far more important 
and real human values and principles at work. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important of these principles and values are trust and 
honesty. It is also important that complete and transparent 
information be provided to those we serve. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those values and principles require that we show fairness in 
application and of course they require that we show consistency, 
accuracy and efficiency in every single transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that human resources in the new agency will 
determine whether it will be leading edge and world class or just 
another shuffle of organizational charts.  That is why we have 
made the management of human resources a central focus for 
modernization and progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has consulted widely with Revenue Canada's 
employees.  Since April 1997 over 10,000 of them have been 
actively involved in telling him how to create a new human 
resources framework.  These hardworking public servants are 
decent taxpaying citizens like the rest of us.  They have 
stressed the need for human resources management based upon 
values and principles, not complex rules and processes. 
They see the importance of simplicity and flexibility.  And they 
want their own worth to be recognized, appreciated and respected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no surprise that what our employees want, values, 
principles, simplicity, flexibility, recognition and respect, are 
what all Canadians want.  Acting on these human expectations will 
be the true breakthrough for the new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us proposes that the bulk of the human resources 
management functions be assumed by the board of management of the 
new agency.  Under the legislation before the House today it will 
be the board of management of the agency that approves the 
negotiating mandates and collective bargaining agreements with 
unions, not the federal Treasury Board.  It is the agency that 
will negotiate directly with its unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the agency not negotiate with its unions?  Employees 
will be able to tell their representatives what they want, what 
they think is good for them, their futures and their careers.  By 
negotiating face to face with employee representatives, the 
agency's managers will hear firsthand the wishes and concerns of 
their people.  They will be able to act firsthand on those wishes 
and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also the board of management that will establish agency 
staffing procedures, not the Public Service Commission.  The 
agency will have the flexibility to design a staffing system that 
directly meets the needs and rightful expectations of taxpayers 
and the needs and rightful expectations of the employees.  This 
is a vital advance.  A simple example will show why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many in the House will appreciate, the employment market for 
computer systems and data management expertise is highly 
competitive.  Currently it takes Revenue Canada between six and 
12 months to complete a staffing action and make an offer of 
employment.  Under the agency it will be possible to develop new 
staffing systems as well as a classification system and salary 
rates that can compete with the private sector for the 
professionals we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out something else that is very important.  Revenue 
Canada will not be privatized.  The agency will continue to be an 
integral part of the Government of Canada's responsibilities. 
Employees will continue as public servants.  The agency will be 
accountable to parliament for how it treats its overall 
responsibility to employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five human resources design teams made up of managers, employees 
and union participants have completed their work on the details 
of important areas of the people part of the new agency: 
staffing and classification, recourse, training and development 
and employment equity.  Each of these important issues is on the 
table for discussion. It is still too early to report to the 
House on what is essentially a work in progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as a result of the work of the design teams, I can tell 
you what Revenue Canada employees want. They want a staffing 
system with fewer rules.  They want a gender neutral 
classification system.  They want fewer occupational groups and 
levels.  They want the human resource system and the work 
environment to encourage diversity and reflect the Canadian 
public they serve.  They want greater emphasis placed on 
transferable skills and past performance. They want a simple, 
quick and fair system of recourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency structure that we propose will allow us to 
accommodate these demands.  We have to co-ordinate and simplify 
our human resources processes so that the right person is in the 
right place at the right time.  That is not only a matter of 
staffing.  It is also a matter of training and development, of 
improving the way we work, for example, more flexible hours or 
flexible places of work, including work at home.  It means 
finding ways to attract people to the jobs that need doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure you that all Revenue Canada employees will be 
offered a job in the agency.  They will remain public servants 
during and after the transition. Collective agreements in force 
at the time of the start-up of the agency will be carried over 
until they are renegotiated. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

because it is very important and a point that has been brought to 
me quite often by constituents.  Agency employees will retain the 
same access to jobs within the public service that they now enjoy 
through deployment, appointment and competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a human resources standpoint, the operative word is 
opportunity.  The Canada customs and revenue agency will create a 
whole new set of opportunities, new types of programs and 
services, new working relationships and new ways of doing work. 
All of this means better jobs for current employees, jobs that 
will be more responsive to what our clients want, jobs with 
substance, jobs with a future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an effort to downsize the department.  This is not 
the intention and has never been the intention.  Rather, our aim 
is to provide Canadians with better service, the type of service 
they should expect from government, the type of service their 
hard earned tax dollars give them the right to expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public servants who work at Revenue Canada are very 
practical people.  They deal with real life situations every day 
of their working lives.  They know what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know that Canadians want even more effective and efficient 
service.  They know Canadians want more co-operation among 
governments.  They know Canadians want one-stop shopping.  They 
know Canadians want streamlining of administration.  They know 
that Canadians want tax compliance to be easier and less costly. 
They know that Canadians expect promptness and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know that in an era of logarithmic change, governments must 
change the way they serve our citizens. They know that the public 
interest must always come first.  They know governments must 
reduce overlap and duplication.  And they know that the new 
agency will save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of the bill before the House have been endorsed 
by a lot of associations:  the Canadian Importers Association, 
the Tax Executive Institute, the Canadian Institute of Chartered 
Accountants, the Canadian Society of Customs Brokers, the 
Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters, l'Association de 
planification fiscale et financiére, the Canadian Bar 
Association, and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those groups know that the Canada customs and revenue agency can 
be the vehicle for taking a group of highly skilled, highly 
motivated people to an even higher level. Those groups know, as 
our employees know and as all Canadians know, that governments 
must move to provide better service, fairer service and smarter 
service to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge this House to pass this bill without delay so that all 
Canadians can benefit from the opportunities and advantages 
presented by this new agency and the strength of its thousands of 
hard working employees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was interested to hear the hon. member's remarks. She discussed 
the notion that Bill C-43 and the adoption of the revenue agency 
would provide the government with greater flexibility in the 
administration of human resources in Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my remarks I presented an opinion from the Library of 
Parliament.  It indicated that such flexibility in human 
resources administration could be achieved without adopting the 
agency but simply by making statutory changes to the Public 
Service Employment Act and other laws governing the Public 
Service Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member two questions.  If she is so in 
favour of such flexibility for the management of Revenue 
Canada—and I favour such flexibility and do not support the 
burdensome and bureaucratic regulations of the Treasury Board for 
employment—does she not support it for all departments?  If so, 
why does the government not amend the Public Service Employment 
Act and other related statutes to give all government departments 
and all ministers the same kind of marvellous flexibility in 
human resources management of which she speaks in the agency?

not the only expert on tax.  There are many other experts on tax 
who agree with the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting the question the member asked me has to do 
with other departments and not to do with revenue.  I am not sure 
if that means he has no criticism of the agency and is suggesting 
that I talk about other departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make more comments about the bill.  This morning 
when the hon. critic of the official opposition was speaking, he 
suggested, I think somewhat sarcastically, that the minister had 
taken several years to put the bill together and to get it before 
the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This suggests that maybe the member does not think we should be 
consulting Canadians.  That several years was time that we took 
talking to individual Canadian taxpayers.  We talked to 
particular groups concerned about taxation, whether it was 
accountants or tax collectors, et cetera.  We talked to the 
provinces about how they felt about it.  Some of them are using 
the services right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine it, but if the Reform Party were to be in power 
I am sure it would not just draft a bill, put it out there and 
never consult with Canadians.  This is why we needed the two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has changed a lot in the last two years.  It is because 
we listened.  The minister has listened.  We have changed the 
set-up of the bill.  This is where we are now more accountable. 
The minister will now be accountable to all Canadians.  All 
members of parliament will still be able to bring their problems 
to the minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
hon. colleague opposite said she had spoken to representatives 
of all provincial governments. If that is true, why can no 
memorandum of agreement between governments or anything of the 
sort be produced in the House? Our understanding is that the 
Government of Manitoba is the only one to think it might be 
worth looking into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on this and to 
substantiate the claim that the federal government has entered 
into agreements with Ontario, the maritimes, Quebec, and so on. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the minister 
already answered that question today.  He mentioned that in a 
number of provinces we were collecting over 50% of their taxes 
and that in some provinces we are collecting 80%. This practice 
is already being used by some provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be logical to wait until the agency is an 
agency.  Then I think we would see the different areas that want 
good service in collecting their taxes will be coming to the 
federal government and asking us to collect their taxes for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the member's kind words, qualified that they may 
have been.  However, I note that she did not really address the 
question I asked about why the government had decided to adopt 
the agency when it could have achieved the same flexibility 
through statutory changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member made two contradictory statements which have 
been consistent in the government's promotion of the bill. First, 
she said that there would be no job losses, that all 40,000-plus 
Revenue Canada employees would be guaranteed a position. She also 
spoke at length about efficiencies and cost savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since over 80% of the expenditures of the Department of National 
Revenue are in payroll, how will the government achieve cost 
savings and efficiencies without reducing the number of 
positions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be that I only have experience in the private sector, 
but I understand that when we reduce payroll it means there are 
fewer positions and if we do not reduce positions we do not 
reduce payroll.  Perhaps the member could clear that up for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question I have is with regard to her comment that 
Revenue Canada is filled with highly skilled and motivated 
people.  No doubt they are, such as the highly skilled and 
motivated tax collector who decided to drag Janice Collingridge, 
the low income, non-verbal quadriplegic, into the tax court to 
shake her down for $5,000 in back payroll taxes that she did not 
really owe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we be assured that under the structure of the agency 
these kinds of outrageous abuses on the part of Revenue Canada 
officials will not happen again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. gentleman 
has worked a long time with special interest groups on taxation. 
He may have a limited view of what Canadians are expecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of flexibility within the agency.  We have not 
seen it yet because it is not there yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member does not seem to be against the general 
principles of the agency:  better service, fairness, 
accountability, partnership with the provinces and better 
management of our resources.  Since he is not against the 
principles of it, I hope that he will come to committee. A lot of 
consultation has been going on across Canada.  This does not mean 
there are not some little points here or there that do not need 
to be corrected.  It is at the committee that we will correct 
these points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the hon. member will be at the committee to help us 
get the bill through so it can become operational and the 
taxpayers will have the advantage of the flexibility and good 
services that will be provided under the agency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to make some quick 
observations on Bill C-43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking today about Revenue Canada.  It is interesting 
that we have a minister from British Columbia in charge of 
Revenue Canada.  Major financial policy is not set by Revenue 
Canada but by the Minister of Finance in the larger policy 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a revenue minister from British Columbia who could not 
deliver for British Columbia which is looking for some particular 
relief from Revenue Canada, especially in view of the massive 
water damage to the structures of homeowners. The minister in 
charge, when faced with questions on behalf of homeowners, could 
not deliver for British Columbians from the particular agency 
that British Columbians are looking forward to for some help and 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers certainly are committed to streamlining services to 
make government less complicated, more efficient and more 
productive.  Perhaps Bill C-43 is going in the right direction to 
create this Canada customs and revenue agency, but we have to ask 
whether it is being done well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to be constructive when legislation appears to be moving 
in the right direction.  However, when the government was on the 
opposition benches it just seemed to be opposing for the sake of 
opposing.  Reformers have always been different, especially in 
the case of Bill C-43.  We wish to commend and compliment the 
government when it appears to be proposing to change the way it 
does business, for certainly change is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would only change its practices perhaps in the 
larger area of finance policy and maybe justice administration, 
to name a couple, we would be greatly pleased.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the Speaker that I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Calgary Centre.  I underscore the general theme of my 
remarks by saying that the Liberal administration is not a good 
manager of the public trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada serves over 20 million taxpayers. Every Canadian 
is quite familiar with that department.  We have all heard of the 
phrase of the certainty of death and taxes.  Taxes especially 
from an agency like Revenue Canada is not the temporary measure 
once promised to Canadians; it is a certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States revenue is collected by the IRS, the 
Internal Revenue Service.  The mere mention of the name IRS to 
U.S. citizens sends a shiver down their spine.  If a citizen of 
the U.S. gets a letter from the IRS it usually means bad news. We 
have all observed the problems of such an agency that gets out of 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers should not be afraid of the tax collector.  Without 
the co-operative taxpayer our country fails as an economic unit. 
The taxpayer must have some balance of rights and those rights 
should be written down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleague who spoke earlier mentioned the need for a 
taxpayer bill of rights as well as an office for taxpayer 
protection.  Canadians do not want to be bullied around, 
especially not by the tax collector.  It is essential that 
Canadians never be subjected to the type of treatment used by the 
IRS on the citizens of the United States. That government went 
through a heart-rending process to try to rein in an agency out 
of control.  Government institutions should not be feared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue has said at times that he 
believes in taxpayers' rights, and I applaud him for that.  In 
the second progress report on the Canada customs and revenue 
agency the minister stated “In proceeding with these changes I 
want to reassure Canadians that first and foremost the government 
will assure that the basic tenets of revenue administration in 
Canada, the encouragement of voluntary compliance, fairness in 
the way all taxpayers are treated, prompt, reliable service and 
responsible enforcement continue to be respected and observed”. 
I believe that is a laudable statement.  The problem is does it 
ever get delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the minister thinks of fairness in the way taxpayers are 
treated is important.  Now all he has to do is put it in black 
and white.  If the minister wants to put his tax dollars where 
his mouth is, he should implement full accountability.  This 
means accountability on both sides:  the taxpayer must respect 
tax authorities, obey the law, not cheat.  The tax authorities 
must respect the taxpayer.  In other words there is a social 
contract in a fair tax system and we are all part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible for the minister to assume that accountability 
will just happen somehow.  We have to design a system that is 
self-correcting and that works.  Canadians want some guarantee. 
If they purchase a product in the store they want the written 
promise that they will be taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the selection process of voting with dollars is what 
kind of a guarantee comes with what is purchased.  That keeps the 
business in operation.  However, it does not seem to work that 
way with government and the tax agency that takes our money. 
Maybe we should apply that kind of standard to the taxpayer. Each 
taxpayer contributes thousands of dollars to the government 
through Revenue Canada.  The taxpayer is essentially purchasing a 
service and wants government to be responsible with the tax 
dollars taken.  The last thing taxpayers want is to be harassed 
by Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been instances where the best interest of the public 
has not been met.  Tax collection represents delegated authority 
from Canadians, and it must be delivered in a reasonable and 
responsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the department's web site I found a section called questions 
and answers.   One of the answers mentioned that the broader 
interests of cabinet and Treasury Board would continue to be 
fully protected.  What did the document say about taxpayers?  It 
only said “the government is proposing to create an agency in 
order to provide better service to the public, the provinces and 
the Canadian business sector”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mention about fully protecting the taxpayer.  This 
is the part that worries me.  It is great to see that the agency 
will likely create some efficiency.  It is great that the agency 
will reduce costs for business and for taxpayers in general.  But 
where is the protection and the assurance for balance?  Where is 
the guarantee?  Where are the mechanisms to ensure that the rules 
are going to be followed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is committed to standing up for the taxpayer, the man on 
the street.  We are committed to fighting for a taxpayer bill of 
rights and an office for taxpayer protection.  We are committed 
to supporting Bill C-43 if, and only if, we can get the 
commitment from the revenue minister to move forward with these 
measures to protect the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the employees of Revenue Canada?  Their morale is 
likely very low at this point.  They do not know what is going to 
happen to them.  We must speak for them also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the union say?  I have this interesting quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public service is in crisis.  The crisis is 
many-sided.  Taxpayers are increasingly skeptical of the 
government's ability, and even motivation, to deliver a 
particular program or policy.  Recipients of unemployment, 
pension and other social benefits wait longer for less.  Caught 
in the middle are public sector workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deep-rooted structures and present day policies have combined to 
deepen the crisis.  The public service of the 1990s is hobbled by 
administrative practices and legislation largely in place since 
the 1960s.  In many cases, management is at best ill-prepared for 
the role it has been assigned and is, at worst, paternalistic. 
The physical plant, equipment, and tools provided to public 
sector workers are deteriorating at an alarming rate.  Likewise, 
while government programs and services grow increasingly more 
complex and driven by technological advances, the training 
provided many public sector workers is inadequate or 
non-existent. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a quote.  I believe it is somewhat accurate.  Morale in the 
federal public service is at an all-time low.  Union negotiations 
have broken off.  The government says that everything is fine and 
negotiations are carrying on.  We go to the union site on the 
Internet and we get a completely different story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Service to Canadians is suffering directly as a result of 
mishandled downsizing.  The present system of staffing and 
promotions is being abused by managers.  Alliance members are 
trying to provide service to veterans, the unemployed and 
pensioners, but do not have the necessary resources to carry out 
their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on.  I must say that if it is the intent of 
the revenue minister to make the agency the IRS of the north, 
then we know he is malevolent.  If, however, the minister wishes 
to create an agency that draws the respect of the Canadian 
public, then I am certain the Reform proposal of a taxpayer bill 
of rights will properly complement this process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend the hon. member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby 
for his eloquent remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke about the need for a taxpayer bill of rights. 
This is something which the official opposition proposed earlier 
today, the actual adoption of a formal statute which would 
recognize the presumption in favour of taxpayers in the 
collection and auditing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not responded positively to this initiative. 
In his view, why would that be?  Why would it be afraid of 
ensuring greater accountability in tax collection?  It is a hard 
question, but I would like him to try to tackle it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a tradition in 
established governments.  They have a basic assumption that they 
have the divine right to govern.  But there is an inherent 
arrogance that we know best.  Therefore, when particular 
mechanisms are put in place for self-correcting accountability 
they do not like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring the example of one very exasperated taxpayer.  He 
writes:  “How can Revenue Canada in good conscience require 
under their present rules, put me in a position that they require 
that I remit to them an amount greater than my earnings?  This 
may be a regulation under the tax instalment remittance 
requirements, however, being put in this position is grossly 
unfair”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He got a thank you letter from Revenue Canada and a brochure 
and was told to go away.  Where is this fellow to go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of rights and the office that we are suggesting be 
created is not a new tax court to argue over the content and the 
rulings, it is to ensure that the rules are followed, that there 
is basic fairness and that a taxpayer is going to be treated with 
some basic respect.  Also, there will be simplicity in the rules 
so that the public can learn to understand the information that 
is given to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listed a number of general areas that would provide a 
feedback mechanism for this large bureaucracy to make it 
accountable to the average Canadian.  That is what the government 
needs to follow.  It needs to listen to the people and respond to 
that agenda. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to preface my comments by saying that I felt compelled to 
speak to this particular bill because of some instances that have 
happened in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt that it was obligatory to stand and speak in support of 
the taxpayer bill of rights, which has been so wisely put forward 
by my colleague from Calgary Southeast.  I also want to point out 
to the House and to those watching the importance of the taxpayer 
bill of rights in the context of what we are seeing going on 
today with Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin my remarks with a couple of statements to clarify 
where I am coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the state of Revenue Canada today and what I have 
encountered in my short time as a member of parliament with the 
people who have come to my constituency office, I realize that 
what we have is a bureaucracy that is out of control.  As I dug 
into some of these cases it bothered me to see the pain this 
bureaucracy is bringing to many of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting admission on behalf of the government that 
it is a bureaucracy out of control because it is now setting up a 
new entity.  Rather than fixing what is there, it is talking 
about setting up a new entity.  The government feels it might be 
easier to create something new rather than to bring efficiencies 
to the existing government bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is not against efficiency.  Certainly we are all for 
it.  However, if we cannot bring efficiencies to the bureaucracy, 
can we magically bring them to something that is not close to the 
government, that is an arm's length operation?  I am not sure the 
logic follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is selling this on the grounds of some promised 
efficiency gains.  As I understand it, some of these economic 
gains will only occur if the provinces agree, and yet we have not 
had a commitment there.  I understand that some of the Atlantic 
provinces are pondering whether they want to continue with the 
harmonized tax program which the federal government launched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we really going to see these efficiency gains?  That is a 
good question.  I am not saying that the status quo is the 
answer.  It certainly is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight some of the situations that I have 
encountered in my short time as a member of parliament.  I will 
allude to one situation.  If members wish more details, I will 
provide them, although I know that some individuals involved are 
concerned that the details might get out.  The taxpayer bill of 
rights is needed because of the intimidation factor.  These 
people feel there might be repercussions if the details are 
brought out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One particular business was an oil contracting and production 
business owned by a fairly prominent businessman in my riding. 
His company had been through a number of mergers and different 
purchases. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His problem related to GST numbers.  When a merger takes place, 
the old GST number does not die.  People are still required to 
track on the old one and on the new one.  There is a convoluted 
set of rules surrounding it.  But to cut a long story short, they 
tried to maintain the old ones and follow this complicated 
tracking procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They submitted all the required information, as they understood 
it, to the tax department.  Continually, though, they were asked 
to re-submit the information because they were told it had not 
been received or there was something missing.  They continued to 
try to hit the mark and satisfy Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact this gentleman related to me that he was talking to 
someone at Revenue Canada and offered to fax in what they had 
already submitted because there was no record, according to 
Revenue Canada, of having received it.  He was told “We do not 
have a fax number here”.  It was not too much later that he was 
talking to a different person in the bureaucracy and was given 
the fax number for the same department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not casting aspersions on these individuals.  What I am 
saying is that this is symptomatic of a bureaucracy that is out 
of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I checked with this individual they were still 
attempting to demonstrate that they had followed the rules and 
they were looking for some acknowledgement or direction as to 
what they missed in trying to meet the mandate.  It is not easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel, and I am sure that many of the members of this House 
feel, that our tax code and tax laws are just too convoluted. 
The act itself is 600 pages and there are another 600 or 700 
pages of special interpretations and guidelines.  The Ottawa 
phone book does not have as many pages as the tax act.  It is no 
wonder a business person would find it difficult to meet all the 
requirements, even with the best of intentions.  When we add to 
that some of the inefficiencies in the current bureaucracy it is 
really hard to satisfy the demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all the more reason for a taxpayer bill of rights, some 
advocate that a frustrated taxpayer can go to and say “I am 
trying to meet the requirements but I am just not making it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give another example, closer to home, of an East Indian 
couple in my riding who immigrated to Canada.  They have worked 
hard.  They are a very diligent couple.  They started a few small 
businesses.  They tried to adhere to all of our laws and the 
requirements of the tax code.  Yes, they had some professional 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This couple started these small ventures.  They thought, 
according to everything they had filed, that they had complied 
with all the rules.  One day they were contacted by the tax 
department which advised them they had not.  They were in the 
middle of the appeal process with the tax department to make 
their case when the person they were dealing with felt their case 
was not warranted.  The next thing they knew the wife's account 
was garnisheed, locked up and no money was moving in or out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can imagine what this did to this small businessman. 
Suppliers were not getting paid.  Customer relations were 
jeopardized.  It was a tragic situation.  Interestingly enough, 
he continued to appeal to Revenue Canada until he got to a higher 
level than the particular person he was dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of it all, after a separate hearing and looking at 
all the facts, the answer was that the junior person had not 
really seen the whole picture.  Revenue Canada released the 
accounts and everything carried on.  At this point in time they 
are attempting to resolve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the account should not have been locked 
up.  But the damage was done to this gentleman's business and no 
apology was offered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One final example that demonstrates the critical need for a 
taxpayer bill of rights, if we are going to have this new agency, 
is that of a young family I know.  They received a windfall one 
day.  They were told by the tax department that their child tax 
credit had been underpaid.  It was great news.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They took this $1,000 and spent it.  About two months later they 
got another letter from the tax department saying it had made a 
mistake and they really should not have had the overpayment.  The 
next threat was that it was now going to garnishee their wages 
unless they instantly paid it back.  Here was this family under 
great pressure and duress all because of this bureaucratic 
inefficiency.   To add to that story, they were not the only 
ones.  In their encounter to find out what happened they found 
out there were many other families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forward those illustrations and many more just like them 
in our country where taxpayers need and must have a taxpayers 
bill of rights before any changes can be made to the bureaucracy 
that collects the taxes.

like to do a bit of reminiscing but I will try to keep it short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to when I started paying taxes in 1970 and what the 
tax act was like then.  It is interesting to make a comparison 
between the forms we had to fill out then and the ones we fill 
out now.  I began working in depth with the tax act in 1977.  At 
that time the tax act was not too thick. We now have an act that 
is literally a stack. It is impossible for anyone to completely 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complexity of the act is one thing, but the question I want 
to direct to the member for Calgary Centre is regarding the lack 
of respect it has shown toward taxpayers.  Back in 1977 when I 
started working in depth with taxpayers I found many cases where 
taxpayers were considered to be guilty by Revenue Canada even 
when the evidence was not presented. Just on Revenue Canada's say 
so, a letter was sent to a taxpayer saying he or she was guilty 
of underpaying and in some cases beyond that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In about 1984 or 1985 the Conservative government put in tax 
fairness legislation which helped and was a good thing. After 
that time I noticed that taxpayers were given the benefit of the 
doubt.  They were treated much more fairly overall. There was 
less of them being considered guilty before their case was even 
heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST then came in and the same Conservative government, when 
it put the GST in place, did not put the tax fairness legislation 
in place to cover the GST.  With the GST we see the same type of 
treatment of taxpayers that I saw in 1977 as I dealt with 
individuals where people were treated very unfairly and harassed 
in many cases by the GST people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have now been a member of parliament for the last five years 
but in the last couple of years I have noticed this trend toward 
more harassment even in the income tax area which is of great 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member if he sees anything in this 
legislation that will ensure that fair treatment of taxpayers 
will be protected inside this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
This question cuts to the heart of the issue.  When an agency is 
given unchecked power, no critique, no bottom line as to who it 
is accountable to that is a dangerous precedent.  I do not see 
anything in this legislation that protects taxpayers or gives 
them some court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again applaud the initiative of the member for Calgary 
Southeast that there must be an office for taxpayer protection 
before this legislation can go anywhere.  I appeal to all members 
to consider that we must have something like this in the bill. 
His proposal states: “A chief advocate shall be asked to present 
each year a summary of 25 of the most serious problems 
encountered by the office and present recommendations as to how 
these can be avoided in the future”.  That speaks to 
accountability.  Let us see how the thing is working and make 
sure there is some measure of accountability.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To speak directly to the member's question, another component of 
taxpayer protection put forward is that the protection office 
would act as an advocate of last resort for taxpayers who feel 
they are being treated in an unfair, unjust or arbitrary manner. 
A court of appeal is just common sense, nothing to be afraid of. 
But it is incumbent on us to have it be part of this whole 
package if we are really going to serve our constituents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to pay tribute to all the men and women who work at Revenue 
Canada.  Unlike my colleagues, I had the opportunity of serving 
on both sides of the House, on the opposition benches as well as 
on the government side. Throughout the many years I have been 
here my office had nothing but very pleasant experiences in 
dealing with the staff and the people who work at Revenue Canada 
whenever we had an issue dealing with a constituent's concern. 
They were prompt and efficient and they got to the bottom of the 
matter.  They dealt with it in a fair and equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue of trying to create a new agency will deal with many 
of the concerns that some of my colleagues have raised today, but 
it also goes beyond that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada customs and revenue agency is the result of 
extensive consultations with the provinces and territories as 
well as with our interest groups and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government announced its intention to establish a new tax, 
customs and trade agency in its February 1996 Speech from the 
Throne and March 1996 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consulted our interest groups and employees on an 
ongoing basis. 
We consulted not just once but three times with the provinces, 
with tax, customs and trade experts and with business 
associations on what the appropriate framework and 
organizational structure should be for the new agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also consulted our employees and are continuing to welcome 
their input and that of their representatives. In April 1997, 
following initial consultations, we released our first progress 
report. Then, we conducted a second round of consultations that 
led to the establishment of a special advisory committee to seek 
comments and views on the new agency's operational framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee brings together consultants and professionals as 
well as officials from large Canadian corporate interests that 
have dealings with Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January, 1998, we released a second interim report, which 
provided for other changes and improvements based, once again, 
on consultations.  These changes are real changes.  They are 
also significant.  They have enabled us to make an even better 
proposal to Canadians for a new agency, which has had 
considerable support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of the things we have heard from our interest 
groups since the release of the second report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, 
l'Association de planification fiscale et financière wrote the 
minister following 
the release of the second interim report.  In its letter, it 
pointed out that, in the context of the initial proposal and for 
discussion purposes, the agency would not necessarily have 
reported to the minister.  It noted that it had opposed this 
idea and that it was grateful to the minister for taking its 
recommendation into account.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants also wrote the 
minister following the release of the government's second 
interim report.  In its letter, it said that the proposals 
incorporated its suggestion that each province present a list of 
designated individuals rather than a single candidate for the 
agency's board of management.  The institute believes that will 
give the government considerable help in setting up a balanced 
board of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many groups continue to support the proposed creation of the 
agency in the various consultations and have reiterated the key 
benefits they see for their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of example, the Canadian Payroll Association, which 
represents over 5,300 member associations and individuals, 
mentioned certain benefits, including, first, a reduction in the 
number of resource persons employers need to contact for 
information; second, the existence of a single auditor in 
contact with a business for all revenue audits; third, 
simplified administration and less confusion, for example, by 
using common definitions; and, finally, the grouping of debt 
recovery measures for businesses in financial difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paul Cherecwich Jr., international president of the Tax 
Executives Institute, which has a lot of Canadian members, also 
wrote the minister. 
In his letter, he points out that certain new information has 
come to his attention that demonstrates the government's deep 
commitment not just to the concept of the agency, but also to 
the consultation process, which was instrumental in moving the 
concept from the idea stage to an achievable plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter says that the agency has been strengthened because 
the obligation of reporting to the minister has been retained, 
because administration has been simplified, and because the 
links and co-ordination that now exist between the Minister of 
Finance and the Minister of National Revenue will be maintained 
and improved when the agency is formed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study commissioned by the Public Policy Forum served as an 
indirect form of consultation.  The purpose of this study was to 
look at the enforcement and administration savings that a single 
body would produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study targeted a group of small business accountants, a 
sampling of over 1,500 small and medium-sized businesses, and a 
group of non-profit agencies.  Their positions and their 
estimates can be found in the report, which was published in 
December 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is listening.  The opinions of its employees and 
of interest groups throughout the country are very important to 
it.  Revenue Canada employees were another group that deserved 
intensive special consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the summer of 1997, over 7,000 Revenue Canada employees 
were asked for their opinions about a new human resources 
management framework.  In December 1997, the union and 
management signed a memorandum of understanding setting out how 
the new human resources management framework would be developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eight design teams were created.  They include union and 
management representatives, as well as employees from various 
sectors of the department. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT42"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT42"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five teams produced final reports on important human 
resource-related issues, such as staffing, classification, appeal 
mechanisms, training and upgrading, and employment equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others are looking at re-engineering, National Joint Council 
directives, and senior level staff.  These teams are working on 
proposals on these aspects, which are part of the agency's human 
resources management framework, and have submitted their 
proposals to 3,000 other employees for review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, consultation consists in listening, learning, and 
then acting.  We met with thousands of Canadians, singly or in 
groups. 
We learned what was most important to them, and what their 
perceptions of the future of Canadian tax, customs and trade 
administration were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now time to act, and to implement the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency.  I therefore strongly urge this House, 
particularly my colleagues in the opposition parties, to support 
this bill, because it is a well-balanced one which responds to 
the needs of Canadians, as well as a forward-looking proposal, 
one which really gives this agency the opportunity to do better 
in serving the people of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be unequivocally clear that this agency, if anything, 
will improve on the services that we are offering to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my colleagues in the opposition parties raise some 
concerns which may I suggest are not within the virtue of the law 
as it is proposed before parliament. My colleagues should be 
commending the government on this initiative.  They should be 
supporting the government on this initiative because it is going 
to provide the agency with the necessary tools to better serve 
the taxpayers of Canada. It will provide the agency with the 
flexibility to better carry out its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing will change when it comes to the responsibility of the 
agency vis-à-vis the population and the House of Commons. The 
Minister of Revenue will continue to be responsible for the 
agency.  In fact this has been mentioned many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be absolutely no difference between the operation of 
this agency and many other agencies which are operating very 
effectively in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at Statistics Canada for example.  It is the envy of the 
world. It has an extremely efficient operation.  It has the 
necessary flexibility. It can move ahead.  It can provide advice 
not only to us as parliamentarians, to taxpayers, to the 
provinces, but to anyone throughout the world.  It has been 
identified as one of the best agencies in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada as an agency on its own can also provide that 
kind of service, not only to taxpayers, not only at the 
provincial level, not only to territorial governments, but I 
would say it can also provide services elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Service of Canada and those who work for Revenue 
Canada are among the finest public servants anywhere in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are giving this agency the flexibility to carry out its 
duties.  It will have control over its own destiny to a large 
extent while at the same time balancing our needs as a 
parliament, balancing the needs of our constituents, that is, the 
taxpayers of Canada, and serving the interests of the agency 
itself when it comes to hiring, when it comes to classification, 
when it comes to flexibility in its operation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those are extremely important elements.  They are important 
reasons why we should be endorsing this proposal by passing all 
of those small little nitty-gritty things that really are not 
within the purview of the act and can be dealt with outside of 
the act and outside of the proposal before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should give a rousing endorsement to what is before us today. 
This is a historic moment in the way in which the government is 
carrying out its mandate.  We are allowing agencies and 
organizations to flourish and to provide services that Canadians 
want us to offer them efficiently, in a timely manner, in a good 
way as we have been doing and will continue to do for years to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill makes it a happy day for us today. My colleagues 
should stand up and congratulate the Minister of National Revenue 
who has done a marvellous job, his staff, the administration as 
well as the employees of department who continue to provide 
excellent service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  My colleagues, are clapping on the other 
side and they are endorsing the proposal.  That is what I hear. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of questions for the member for 
Ottawa Centre.  When I listen to him, I realize he lives in 
Ottawa, in this august place where parliament is.  He should 
visit the rest of the country once in a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about this being a historic moment.  In 1917 this House 
had another historic moment. We brought in a temporary income tax 
law.  Now we have another historic moment where the government is 
trying to bring in another bill which is not going to do the 
average Canadian any good at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said it was a great consultative process, that the 
government is listening. Why is it after all this time that none 
of the provinces have signed on to this project?  Why is it that 
Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, the majority of 
the people in Canada do not like this project?  Yet this 
government is consulting.  Why did it not wait until it at least 
got the agreement of the provinces?  If this is a country where 
the federal government is going to work with the provinces, 
surely we should not have legislation in this House before the 
provinces or at least the majority of the provinces come to an 
agreement.  Right now we have zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member why he thinks the government had a consultative 
process.  Why does he think the government is listening when it 
does not have provinces signing on to this project? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about Statistics Canada being the envy of the world. 
One would have to live in Ottawa to think that.  He should talk 
to the people in British Columbia or Nova Scotia about Statistics 
Canada and the interference in their private lives if he thinks 
it is the envy of the world.  Perhaps people outside Canada who 
have never been here think it is the envy of the world, but not 
the people who live here and pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, why is this bill so good when not one province 
has signed on to it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, frankly it is true.  I am the 
member of all members because the House of Commons happens to be 
in my constituency of Ottawa Centre.  Most of my colleagues live 
in my riding, including yourself, Mr. Speaker, and I am honoured. 
It is a heavy responsibility for me to be the MP of all MPs, 
including the Leader of the Opposition as well as the Prime 
Minister.  It is a challenge for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the House to know that not everything I hear in this 
House pleases me.  I look at the statement made by my colleague 
on the other side in trying to attack Statistics Canada.  I am 
not the one who said it.  I have repeated what others have said, 
that Statistics Canada is one of the finest agencies in the 
world.  I do not know the name of the organization, but 
Statistics Canada over and over again has been identified as a 
lead agency when it comes to the efficiency of operation, when it 
comes to passing on information to the government, to members of 
parliament including my colleague on the other side, as well as 
to others. I would say that Statistics Canada has done nothing 
intrusive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the member's question, consultations are ongoing. 
He wanted my opinion.  It is imperative to proceed with what we 
have now.  Provinces will be onboard.  Those who are not onboard 
will be onboard sooner or later. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast would like to 
advise the hon. member for Ottawa Centre that he can take him off 
his mailing list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Ottawa Centre got himself into such a frenzy 
stroking the ego of his colleague, the minister of revenue.  It 
looked as if that was the most pathetic attempt to become 
parliamentary secretary I have seen here in a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member does not think StatsCan is intrusive. Apparently 
he thinks it is a model for Revenue Canada.  Let me suggest there 
is one slight difference.  Revenue Canada is vested by this 
parliament with police powers, with the monopoly and coercive 
power of the government to forcibly extract from people the 
fruits of their own labours and to get into their most private 
matters, to find out everything about their financial 
arrangements, how much they make, where they save it and how they 
spend it.  Those are extraordinary powers which are all too often 
abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member heard my speech he would have heard me relate 
several stories, as have other members, about this kind of 
extraordinary abuse.  For instance, Janice Collingridge, a low 
income quadriplegic from Calgary, was dragged into tax court by 
this government's tax cops to pay $5,000 in back payroll taxes 
which she should never have had to pay.  It was thrown out by the 
tax court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know of case upon case of abuse by Revenue Canada 
officials.  What exists in Bill C-43 to prevent this kind of 
abuse of the power we give the tax cops?  Why will the minister 
and the member not accept a strengthening of accountability 
through the adoption of a taxpayer bill of rights which would be 
appended to Bill C-43? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have never in my life seen 
so much lack of understanding in terms of how Revenue Canada 
works.  The member is complaining about a specific case.  I 
cannot comment on a specific case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member needs a situation addressed, there are at least 
four steps I know of that he can go through in Revenue Canada 
before coming to parliament.  Revenue Canada has a fairness 
committee.  If you disagree with your tax assessment you can go 
there.  And you can go higher and higher within the 
administration to the point where if you are not happy, you can 
go to the minister or you can go to court in order to find a way 
to resolve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this gentleman is not suggesting to Canadians that they 
should not give their revenue information to Revenue Canada, that 
they should not tell Revenue Canada about some of their income. 
We live in a society where the only mechanism we have to support 
our social programs like health care is through our revenues.  It 
is not an easy job collecting taxes.  How would anyone like it? 
Tax and debt, everybody wants to run away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact of life and the gentleman had better get used to 
it.  We have to pay taxes for as long as we have social programs 
to support, for as long as we have to operate the government, for 
as long as we need roads to drive on and for as long as we have 
to move from one end of the country to the other.  We have to 
have taxes.  I do not like it but that is the way it is and we 
have to live with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to inform the member for Ottawa Centre that I 
have moved out of his riding.  I am now in the riding of the 
Minister of Industry, but I will stay on his mailing list because 
I enjoy his publications.  They are well informed and he always 
goes into great depth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Ottawa Centre started out on a personal note as 
he talked about people who work in the tax department who are his 
constituents.  They are people we deal with every day as members 
of parliament when we are trying to help people through the maze 
of problems they get not just with taxes but with many things. I 
have had to deal with the tax department myself and the only good 
part of it was that the lady's name was Hope.  That was about all 
I had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to comment further on some of his experiences 
with the employees of Revenue Canada and the good work they do 
for us as members of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, sometimes the public service 
is an easy target.  These people are like all of us, with one 
exception.  They are always on the other end of the telephone and 
they hear complaints day after day, day in and day out. They go 
the extra mile to provide the most efficient and most timely 
information to those who call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experience, as well as that of my staff and of many 
colleagues on both sides of the House, with public servants has 
been very positive.  I pay tribute to each one of them, 
particularly those behind the telephone.  They are the ones who 
are taking the public calls and hearing the complaints from time 
to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people handle millions of tax forms throughout the year, 
not only around tax time.  They handle them in an efficient and 
positive manner.  They deal with millions of forms.  They are 
bound to make mistakes.  No one is perfect, including yourself, 
Mr. Speaker, and all my colleagues on both sides of the House.  I 
ask anybody who thinks he is perfect to stand and say so.  Nobody 
is standing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague on the other side, the revenue critic, does not 
like to pay taxes but he better get used to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am obliged to 
stand but I want to assure everyone I am not suggesting that I am 
perfect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will begin 
my speech now and finish it after Oral Question Period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to address Bill C-43, an act to establish the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency. Let me say from the outset that I am 
opposed to the creation of this new federal agency, primarily 
because of the attitude and actions of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot take a chance and support a bill which only seeks to 
centralize the collection of taxes in Canada, reduce the number 
of jobs at the Department of National Revenue and, more 
importantly, create an agency that will, yet again, interfere 
with the Quebec department of revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill shows that the Liberal government is finding it 
increasingly difficult to fulfil its responsibilities as 
administrator and manager of the state. The government is, once 
again, about to abdicate its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency could make it possible for the minister to avoid 
fulfilling his duty, which is to protect taxpayers against any 
abuse of power. We are all familiar with the Liberals' habit of 
creating independent agencies and then avoid answering questions 
by using the excuse that we must respect the agency's 
independence and autonomy, and that the government does not want 
to interfere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Lotbinière is among the Quebec ridings where sheep 
farmers are at odds with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 
which is following some obscure directives to systematically 
destroy sheep that may be infected with scrapie. That agency is 
directly accountable to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. For the past two weeks, the Bloc Quebecois has been 
asking the minister to take action and put a stop to this 
carnage which imperils the sheep industry in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the minister does not answer our questions. He too hides 
behind the agency to shirk his responsibilities. Meanwhile, the 
problem persists and our sheep farmers live in fear that an 
inspector or a veterinarian from the agency will call to inform 
them of the tragic news that some or all of their sheep will 
have to be destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an agency which definitely lacks transparency and which 
refuses to provide information to Quebec elected officials who 
are desperately trying to save an industry that was thriving 
before the carnage began, in January 1997, and that has now lost 
11,000 sheep.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before our eyes an example which shows that the Liberal 
approach is not working. Yet, our questions are simple. How many 
sheep were identified as being infected with scrapie? Where are 
these infected animals? How does the agency diagnose the 
disease? What are the criteria used to determine whether or not 
the sheep must be destroyed? What is the agency's budget for 
research? What stage has the agency reached in its work? We have 
no idea. What is currently going on in Quebec is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you think that after going through this experience we will 
support Bill C-43? No, especially not with a Minister of Finance 
who does not even care about the real purpose of the employment 
insurance fund. 
I would rather not think about having an independent agency 
collecting our taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance ignores accounting principles. He 
ignores the repeated warnings of the auditor general, and he 
cannot even submit realistic estimates to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a 60% difference between the forecasts and the actual 
figures. Do you know any business that would keep such an 
incompetent accountant? There is only the Prime Minister, the 
new dictator of the Canadian economy, who called on the police 
to use force against peaceful students who simply wanted to 
protest against an international situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is again trying to show its good will by 
proposing the creation of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
However, we see what is behind this legislation: an anti-labour 
manoeuvre.  In other words, 20% of the employees of Revenue 
Canada will no longer be covered by the public service act. The 
new agency will therefore have full latitude in two years' time 
to raise and lower salaries and hire and fire employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the federal Liberals are increasingly revealing 
their lack of social conscience and their lack of compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the example of the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, who remains insensitive to the suffering of lamb 
producers in Quebec.  The Minister of Finance, whose behaviour 
is unspeakable, wants to legalize his misappropriation of funds 
from the employment insurance fund, which belongs to workers and 
to employers. 
In the private sector, this sort of misappropriation would mean 
a trip to court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is prepared to do anything to satisfy its need 
to centralize.  The Liberals consider simplification synonymous 
with duplication and harmonization to them means meddling.  The 
problem is that Quebec can guess what lies behind this new 
agency.  Ontario is on the lookout as well, and with this new 
threat of centralization, is even considering setting up its own 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the principle of a single collector, but in 
Quebec, it should be the Quebec department of revenue that 
collects all federal taxes, as it does the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have another look at the officials who would be affected 
by the creation of this agency. 
A while ago, the President of Treasury Board said the following 
about the agency: “Creation of the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency is an essential component of the government's commitment 
to modernize the federal public service”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is mention of 40,000 public servants, or 20% of the whole 
public service, who will from now on be at the mercy of the 
agency's board, made up of good little Liberals prepared to 
follow the Prime Minister's orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about the executives of this new agency?  Who will they 
be? They will be better paid than the senior executives of the 
present Department of National Revenue.  Who will foot the bill 
for this?  The support staff, the record processing clerks, in 
short all the grassroots employees of the department.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I would like to explain how the Revenue 
Canada employee union sees the Minister of Revenue's plan.  The 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is a federal creation, 
inspired by top taxation people in Ottawa, who want to create a 
sort of monstrous octopus, the tentacles of which will reach not 
only as far as the provincial governments, but right up to the 
municipal and local ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their intent is to administer everything, from provincial sales 
taxes to gasoline and alcohol taxes.  Are we going to take that 
risk with a Liberal government, a voracious and centralist 
government that respects nothing?  No.  And whom is this agency 
going to be answerable to? 
What power will the elected representatives in this House have 
for getting any explanations about its administration, its 
results, and its mistakes as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, in its present structure, Revenue Canada provides 
Parliament and the taxpaying public with the necessary 
accounting, via the Department of National Revenue.  The 
government cannot sidestep embarrassing questions like the 
family trust scandal and the little perks the Minister of 
Finance is giving to his ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fear that the new agency will be subject to a less stringent 
parliamentary scrutiny than the one currently imposed on the 
Department of Revenue. 
I can see it already.  The minister will rise and answer a 
question about the agency as follows: “Mr. Speaker, we have 
asked for an inquiry into this independent agency and as soon as 
we have any information, we will communicate it to the House”. 
In other words, while the inquiry is going on, we will find a 
way to get our party out of this embarrassing situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, opposition parties called for explanations of the 
Prime Minister's conduct in what is now known as the Peppergate 
affair.  The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the 
solicitor general all sought refuge behind the RCMP commission 
of inquiry.  Imagine an embarrassing question about the 
operations of the agency.  The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime 
Minister and the Minister of National Revenue have already got 
their script ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister give the 
impression of having spent the summer preparing a series of 
30-second cassettes devoid of information.  Something is not 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not be long before the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime 
Minister and other ministers will be lip-synching to a soundtrack 
of 150 applauding MPs, all bowing before their great leader. 
One thing is certain: I hope these cassettes will not be sold to 
the public, because the distributor—

disabilities in the world.  Approximately 23% of the Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>For these Canadians dyslexia presents an enormous struggle. 
Reading the paper, making a grocery list or reading a bedtime

myths and promote facts regarding dyslexia.  Dyslexia can occur 
at any level of intellectual ability.  It can be alleviated by 
specialist teaching and committed learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour for Canada to host the first International 
Conference on Dyslexia.  This conference will help to dispel some 
of the myths about dyslexia, as well as offer some guidance to 
those affected and their family.  I am sure all members will join 
me in wishing the participants of this conference well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This complaint was filed on behalf of grain producers by the 
Canadian Wheat Board and included a complaint against CN rail as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board estimates that this failure to provide adequate 
service cost farmers $50 million and the board is now expected to 
sue CP for a portion of those damages.  This poor service is a 
direct result of the effective monopoly by CN and CP on shipping 
western grain.  Yet these same railways argue that the system 
should now be totally deregulated so that they alone can decide 
what to haul, when to haul it and at what tariff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be a disaster for western Canadian farmers. 
Yesterday's ruling proves that in order to protect farmers the 
federal government must continue to play a key role in regulating 
grain transportation in Canada.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last month the Liberals fired Bernard Dussault, the 
Canada pension plan's top actuary.  Why?  Because he was about to 
reveal how the Liberals had mismanaged the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not once, but twice, Mr. Dussault was told to alter his reports 
because otherwise it would “embarrass the Minister of Finance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Why does he permit 
blatant political interference in the running of the Canada 
pension plan? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions today 
categorically denied that allegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read from the superintendent's statement 
yesterday: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—there was no political interference in my decision to ask him 
to leave. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is Mr. Dussault.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not by the Minister of Finance, nor by any other Minister.  I am 
responsible for OSFI, and this was my decision as the 
superintendent. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> You 
can bet, Mr. Speaker, that if he had not said that, he would have 
been fired today as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bernard Dussault was fired because his report would have 
embarrassed the Prime Minister.  He was fired because his report 
would have shown that the Liberal CPP plan was in deep trouble, 
that the premiums being charged were not enough to cover the 
miscalculations of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister reinstate Dussault so that he can give 
us the honest report that he would have prepared? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the single most important thing in all of this is the 
integrity of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the federal Minister of Finance nor the 10 provincial 
ministers of finance, all of whom are involved, would be 
embarrassed by whatever numbers come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again quote from the superintendent's statement of 
yesterday: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The team of competent professionals who worked under Mr. Dussault 
remains in place.  Mr. Hafeman, who is replacing Mr. Dussault is 
a competent, experienced actuary— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he goes on to say that the superintendent— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Leader of the Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems that the government will go to any lengths to 
protect itself from embarrassment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somalia, an embarrassment:  shred the documents.  Krever, an 
embarrassment:  take him to court.  Students, an embarrassment: 
use the pepper spray.  EI fund surplus, an embarrassment:  steal 
it.  Now this actuary, an embarrassment:  fire him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Is there any ethical 
guideline he will not violate in order to protect his government 
from embarrassment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very, very proud of the record of my government on 
integrity in the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very, very surprised that the Leader of the Reform Party 
would get up in the House with so many Reformers at his back. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is a very serious matter.  The confidence of 
Canadians in their pension plan has been seriously shaken because 
the independent chief actuary of the Canada pension plan, a man 
held in the highest regard in his profession, has stated 
categorically that he was asked to fudge the figures about the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister simply going to sit here and tell the House that 
he will do nothing at all to deal with these serious allegations? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, as I have just mentioned, the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions has categorically denied that allegation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us understand what the superintendent has done.  Not 
only is Mr. Hafeman, who worked under Mr. Dussault, now 
completing the report, but I will quote again from the 
superintendent “to provide an extra layer of assurance”, along 
the lines the member is talking about, “I will be seeking the 
help of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries.  OSFI has been 
working with the CIA on an important new initiative, the 
development of a system of practised review”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the fact is that Mr. Dussault's report, his five year 
review of the CPP that he has been working on, will never see the 
light of day.  Some other figures, some other calculations, some 
other projections will come forward from goodness knows which 
sources.  Apparently the minister has not even made up his mind 
yet.  It could be this.  It could be that.  It could be someone 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know what the man who worked on this for seven years 
thinks about the plan.  Are we going to see that report? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is simply nonsense.  First, Mr. Hafeman worked 
under Mr. Dussault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what has happened is that the superintendent has asked 
the Canadian Institute of Actuaries to come in and do a practised 
review of OSFI's “actuarial services division early in the new 
year”.  He has asked them to do it with special emphasis on the 
report of the CPP.  There will not be one report; there will be 
two and it will be approved by the Canadian Institute of 
Actuaries.

<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning the Canadian dollar is in free fall.  For the fourth 
consecutive month, the economy and all the economic indicators 
are declining.  The Prime Minister, however, continues to say 
all is well.

economy, before the country plunges into another recession? 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
clear that we live in a volatile world.  The meeting of the 
Commonwealth countries has just concluded.  We have just seen 
the projections of the International Monetary Fund: two-thirds of 
the world's economies are in recession.  There is no doubt that 
Canada will be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, Canada, fortunately, has taken precautions in order 
to weather these storms.  That is what counts most. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
experts are saying, the economists are saying, the opposition is 
saying, everybody is saying that there is a problem.  For the 
fourth consecutive month, the indicators are dropping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, however, says everything is fine.  The king 
is happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not time the Prime Minister recognized that the first 
responsible step he should take is to return to workers, to the 
unemployed and to business the $7 billion he took from their 
pockets and to inject this money into the economy?  That 
represents $500 million a month. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us look at what the Bloc is asking.  If we followed every 
suggestion, we would be back in a deficit situation by the end 
of the year, and interest rates would be on the rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to quote the president of the Bank of Hong Kong, who 
said “Canada is being affected by events largely beyond its 
control”.  I thank God every day that our financial situation is 
better than it was five years ago.  Imagine what it would be

like.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
the government pocketed a $7 billion surplus over a four-month 
period, experts are increasingly talking about a recession: the 
GDP is declining, the dollar is plunging and consumer confidence 
is being eroded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister. Does the Prime 
Minister—who is stubbornly refusing to take any initiative to 
get the economy back on track—not realize that the outrageous 
cuts he continues to make in the economy could bring about a 
recession within a year? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all 
the economists unanimously agree that, if there is a problem

exists because there is a problem in Russia and Asia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a GDP 
on the decline for four consecutive months is not the result of 
an international problem, but a domestic one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past two months, the Bloc Quebecois has been warning the 
Prime Minister that we are slowly sinking into a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I put the question to him: Will he continue to watch the 
train go by until next spring's budget, or will he have the 
courage to immediately take the actions he can and must take to 
get the economy back on track, without running a deficit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt that there are problems outside our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Bloc Quebecois, if the government of Russia 
cannot collect taxes, it is Ottawa's fault. According to the 
Bloc, if there is a problem with Japanese banks, it is Ottawa's 
problem. According to the Bloc, if there are problems with 
emerging economies, it is Ottawa's fault. The Bloc's position is

</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time now we have had preached to us the virtues of an 
unregulated global economy and getting the fundamentals right

<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

projections we have been told that we have been too prudent, that 
we have been too cautious.  We have said that eventually there 
will be a downturn, that eventually the kind of storm we are 
going through in fact will occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason we have been prudent.  It is for that 
reason we have put in place a plan that will enable us to take 
advantage of the opportunities of an upturn and ride through the

<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I say to the Minister of Finance that when there is a 
storm coming you generally take some kind of precautions, 
especially when you know the storm is coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that workers are the ones most likely to be hurt 
by this coming economic storm, would the minister consider, in 
the debate he wants about the EI surplus, whether or not 
restoring benefits and eligibility in EI would be one of the 
options, given that workers are the ones to be most affected if 
the storm is as bad as we think it might be?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr.

the EI issue, but in the kind of storm we are looking at we also 
happen to believe that lowering taxes for seniors and lowering 
taxes for self-employed workers is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe there is no excuse not to make sure that the 
health care system in the country is in as good shape as it can 
possibly be.  We believe that debt should be retired.  We also 
believe that EI premiums should be reduced.  We will do all this

</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state is hiding behind the infrastructure

key sectors, helping Montreal position itself and helping to 
maintain or create nearly 26,000 jobs.

the finance minister yesterday at a conference lend credence to

is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting December 21, the Canadian Coast Guard will be charging 
a new icebreaking fee in eastern Canada. By imposing this 
service charge on the whole region, the government is putting 
Quebec in the same boat as the Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that 80% of marine traffic is on the St. Lawrence

the recovery of less than 20% of the costs of providing the 
ice-breaking service will be based on the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be of interest to the hon. member that to get to the 
Quebec ports and to the St. Lawrence River one sometimes has to 
go through ice which is around Newfoundland.  The result is that 
some of the costs affecting the ships going to the St. Lawrence 
ports are sometimes borne by ice-breakers in the Newfoundland 
region.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
Canada is launching its participation in the International Year 
of Older Persons.  Yet following 14 years of battle, more than 
50,000 retired public service workers, most of whom are women 
receiving pensions based on the lowest salaries, are still 
fighting for pay equity.  Twenty of these women are in parliament 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Will the government 
honour these older women by paying them retroactive pay equity 
and recalculating their pensions as ordered by the human rights 
tribunal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the judgment of the tribunal on human rights has been appealed. 
It has been appealed for a very clear reason, for the reason of 
equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a previous judgment by the federal court concerning 
about 20,000 women and Bell Canada which used a certain 
methodology to determine what the payment should be.  The 
tribunal has used a totally different methodology which our legal 
experts say is incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to use two different standards to pay two groups of 
women, one for the private sector and one for the public sector? 
Obviously that would be inequitable and that is why we asked the 
court to address the question.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK182">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-43, an 
act to establish the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and to 
amend and repeal other acts as a consequence, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member for 
Lotbinière had eight and a half minutes remaining in his speech. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will do 
my best not to go over eight and a half minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to backtrack a little, because my speech was 
interrupted for oral questions, and say it is my pleasure to 
rise in this House today to speak on Bill C-43, to establish the 
Canada customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was telling the House that I oppose this bill, mainly on 
account of the actions and behaviour of this government. We have 
no intention of taking any chances by passing a bill whose sole 
purpose is to centralize the collection of taxes across the 
country, to downsize Revenue Canada and, above all, to establish 
an agency that will clash with the Quebec Ministry of Revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agency, which, in my opinion, is a real governmental tax 
collection monster, will have powers vested in it that will give 
it access to all sorts of information on our private lives. 
What will this agency do with this huge amount of personal 
information concentrated in its hands? I would rather not think 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency is a relative of Big Brother, the computer that could 
run and rule the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, this new bill is doomed to fail. The rationale for 
establishing the Canada customs and revenue agency is to have a 
single agency in charge of collecting all the money and to 
convince the provinces to get on board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had not even signed a single agreement when he 
introduced Bill C-43. That shows how ridiculous this whole idea 
is. Quebec and Ontario categorically refused to consider using 
the agency. The initial support from several western provinces 
has all but died down in the past few weeks, and even Prince 
Edward Island has expressed concerns about the establishment of 
this new agency. 
Who are the ones who will pay the way for this agency?  The 
users, but at what cost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, the federal agency will attempt to demonstrate the 
savings its establishment will bring about, but before long it 
will be raising the charges to satisfy the greediness of the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the millennium bug is concerned, will all the changes 
which are being announced at this time and which Revenue Canada 
employees will have to face make it any easier for them to 
prepare for this transition in informatics, which is already 
demanding much energy?  What stage has Revenue Canada reached in 
its preparations for the year 2000?  No one knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to focus the House's attention on some of the 
clauses of Bill C-43, clauses 6 and 8 to be specific. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency is placed under the responsibility of the Minister of 
National Revenue, yet clause 8 stipulates: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>8.(1) The Minister may authorize the Commissioner or any other 
person employed or engaged by the Agency—to exercise or 
perform on the Minister's behalf any power, duty or function of 
the Minister under any act of Parliament— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the agency could fall into the hands of a 
super-bureaucrat, possibly a good Liberal, who is neither elected 
nor accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I would like to summarize the reasons why I am proposing 
that Bill C-43 be withdrawn: the centralizing obsession of the 
Liberal government; the danger this agency represents for the 
Quebec Department of Revenue; the anti-union attitude of the 
government in this bill as it affects Revenue employees; the 
intrusion on the privacy of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not remind the House of the performance of the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency in its current handling of the scrapie 
crisis with Quebec sheep, where there is such an administrative 
muddle that the minister and the agency cannot even figure out 
where they are at.  Do you think we are going to give this 
government another chance to create an agency?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying no to the Liberals' plans, I am saying no to this 
bill and I am calling for its immediate withdrawal, in 
accordance with the amendment moved this morning. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil—Soulanges, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
one of the most important features of the bill to establish the 
Canada customs and revenue agency is without a doubt the 
increased participation of the provinces and territories.  The 
framework for their participation is an important part of the 
proposal to create the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada is already providing them with a number of 
services and has taken steps to further increase co-ordination of 
fiscal administration.  By creating appropriate conditions for 
improved co-ordination, the agency will be able to serve national 
and provincial interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the new agency will make it possible to reduce 
duplication and overlap in the administration of federal and 
provincial revenue.  There is only one taxpayer. 
Why, therefore, is there not just one tax collection agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach will enable government to reduce its 
administrative costs and lower enforcement costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel it is important to mention that the new agency will not 
be taking over provincial or territorial powers.  No action will 
be taken until the provinces and territories agree that it is 
cost-effective for the agency to provide a particular service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also wish to point out that this fundamental attitude is not 
new in Canada.  Right now, Revenue Canada collects individual 
income taxes for nine provinces and corporate taxes for seven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada administers social benefit programs for British 
Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, the Northwest 
Territories and Nova Scotia.  It also collects sales taxes and 
taxes on alcohol and tobacco products for many provinces at 
border points.  Revenue Canada also administers the national 
child benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is therefore no lack of precedents for this co-ordination 
and pooling of services.  The proposed agency's structure could 
lead to even greater co-operation and, at the same time, 
increased provincial participation in fiscal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For their part, the provinces and territories will be able to 
submit lists of candidates from the private sector for 11 of the 
15 director positions on the board of management, which will be 
responsible for planning the agency's activities. 
These directors will not represent the interests of their own 
province; they will instead help the agency take into account 
the special characteristics of provinces and regions in its 
management activities.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will have fairly broad powers to enable it to 
conclude agreements on the provision of services with each 
province, such as on the collection of an unharmonized 
provincial tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, Revenue Canada has administered only those provincial 
taxes that were harmonized with federal taxes.  Thus the number 
of programs Revenue Canada could administer was limited.  Under 
Bill C-43, the agency will have the power to administer taxes 
that are not harmonized, such as a provincial sales tax that is 
not harmonized.  There are, nevertheless, economies of scale to 
be achieved with a single administration, even with an 
unharmonized tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will conclude an agreement with a province to 
administer a tax, but all agreements reached will be governed by 
the guidelines established by the ministers of finance of the 
federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These guidelines will ensure that all taxes collected by the 
agency for the provinces and territories will first be legally 
valid, will not interfere with the self-assessment system, will 
not result in double taxation, will be fair and, finally, will 
be collected in the context of contractual agreements acceptable 
to all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This last criterion reflects an important aspect of these 
agreements.  They are service contracts.  The agency will 
provide a service to a province or a territory according to the 
specific terms of a contract between the two parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the province or territory will continue to enjoy 
full powers to apply the tax and will be accountable to its 
taxpayers in this regard.  The agency will have to consolidate 
its obligation to report to the provinces with respect to the 
administration of programs on their behalf, so that they in turn 
may provide an accounting to their own taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a year, the agency commissioner will have to report to the 
provincial and territorial ministers on the programs and 
services administered on their behalf.  In addition, he will 
offer to meet the ministers annually as well in order to obtain 
their feedback on the agency's performance with respect to their 
programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reinforcement of the obligation of accountability and of 
performance guarantees between the agency and the provinces and 
territories will make it possible to ensure that programs and 
services remain innovative, client-focused and, above all, 
cost-effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study by the Public Policy Forum estimates that Revenue Canada 
could administer current provincial taxes at a saving of between 
$97 and $162 million over what it costs today.  This represents 
an overall drop of 6% over today's costs, if all provinces 
participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, a good number of the provinces adopted a wait-and-see 
attitude.  They wanted to see the agency fully operational 
before giving unconditional support.  This attitude changed as 
the information about the agency became clearer and the 
consultation process advanced. 
In fact, the attitude of several of the provinces was very 
positive and they are now prepared to give serious consideration 
to handing some of their activities over to the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, we are undertaking joint studies with 
certain provinces in order to examine specific possibilities. 
The more provinces and territories participate, the more savings 
there will be for individuals, businesses and governments.  It 
is, therefore, in the interest of all Canadians to have as much 
provincial and territorial participation as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of New Brunswick Minister of Finance Edmond 
Blanchard is a typical example of this.  In a recent Canadian 
Press article dated March 20, 1998, he expressed his agreement 
for the agency to handle more of New Brunswick's taxation 
operations.  According to Mr. Blanchard, “If efficiency can be 
enhanced, I am prepared to look at the options”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 will put the Canada customs and revenue agency into 
concrete form.  This agency will be structured and positioned in 
such a way as to obtain the support of the provinces and 
territories.  All provinces and territories, as well as the 
federal government, have worked hard to put their finances in 
order.  The Canada customs and revenue agency now represents an 
opportunity to reduce costly duplication and overlap between the 
various levels of government still further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of provincial participation in this new agency, 
there is one particular question that crops up once again: How 
can a true national agency be set up without the participation 
of Quebec? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is not 
dependent on the participation of all provinces and territories. 
In fact, participation in the agency's activities is optional. 
The purpose of the agency is to provide a platform that would 
help the provinces. The agency will not appropriate provincial 
powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consulted Quebec, and the other provinces, since the 
beginning of the process. Quebec told us that, while it does not 
want the new agency to administer its programs, it wants to be 
kept informed of the agency's progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation establishing the agency proposes a framework 
based on closer co-operation. 
The provinces, including Quebec, do not have to give to the 
agency the responsibility of administering a larger number of 
programs on their behalf. That decision is made by each 
individual province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that Quebec's participation would increase 
the benefits of having a single tax agency. However, even if 
Quebec does not participate, Canadian businesses will benefit 
from annual savings of $116 million to $193 million. Moreover, 
annual savings of between $37 million and $62 million will be 
achieved in terms of the administrative costs for all 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any new program administered by the agency will have been 
subjected to a cost-benefit analysis. This will apply to Quebec, 
as well as to other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that even if Quebec decides not to have the 
agency administer one of its programs, it could still be 
represented on the board of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are many issues on which the parties and 
regions may disagree. However, if we want all Canadians to 
achieve substantial savings, regardless of their province or 
origin, all of us in this House must remember that we represent 
one person, the taxpayer, and that we must do our utmost to make 
that person save money. I do hope that all members will support 
this initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to be in the House today to speak on 
the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians have expressed the basic fear of the 
concentration of too much power in one place.  In developing the 
Canada customs and revenue agency, we have been sensitive to this 
concern as well.  Tax, customs and trade administration affect 
the lives and livelihood of all Canadians.  They want to be sure 
they are dealt with fairly and that their rights are protected. 
It is our intention to create a super agency, one with unlimited 
power and unlimited scope.  In fact, in the design of the new 
agency we have maintained the essential checks and balances that 
govern the activities and ensure the accountability of Revenue 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the enforcement powers of the new agency will be 
the same as those currently provided to Revenue Canada through 
legislation like the Income Tax Act or the Customs Act.  If there 
is a problem or if there is a complaint, the minister will be 
fully accountable to parliament and the public for the 
administration and enforcement of this specific legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the minister will have the authority, as the case is 
now, to answer questions in the House and to ensure that the 
agency is acting properly in its dealings with the Canadian 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The confidentiality of taxpayers' personal information will be 
protected under this new agency, just as it is currently 
protected with Revenue Canada.  The authorities governing 
confidentiality are clearly set out in the legislation and they 
will not be changed or compromised by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada has decades of experience in handling highly 
confidential information for millions of individuals and 
organizations.  There is absolutely no reason to believe that 
this commitment to confidentiality would change under the 
departmental agency status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the legislation before this House will specifically 
restrict the board of management of the new agency from directing 
the commissioner or any agency employee to exercise authorities 
under programs legislation of provincial statute.  This will 
effectively ensure that the board will not have access to 
confidential tax, customs or trade information for individual 
Canadians or businesses. 
From an overall operational standpoint, the agency will have to 
develop a corporate business plan every year.  This plan will 
have to be submitted to the minister who will in turn recommend 
its approval by the Treasury Board.  A summary of this plan will 
also be tabled in parliament.  So any new or unusual plans by the 
agency that would unreasonably extend its powers would be nipped 
in the bud.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner of the agency will have to offer to meet with 
provincial and territorial representatives annually to report on 
how programs have been delivered on their behalf.  This will 
provide yet another check on the power of the new agency.  The 
raison d'être of the Canadian customs and revenue agency is not 
to create a larger entity.  Revenue Canada already employs 
between 40,000 and 46,000 permanent and temporary employees. 
Instead, the rationale is to expand the efficiency of the 
programs and services, to reduce overlap and duplication and to 
provide greater saving to Canadians. Doing something better is 
not necessarily an expansion of power but an extension of 
service, service to Canadians, service to businesses and services 
to the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of Bill C-43 is not to create a super agency. 
Rather, it is to establish a framework with all the checks and 
balances for a super agency. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my question pertains to privatization.  In 
Saskatchewan where I come from we have experienced privatization 
in spades.  Every time something was privatized it resulted in 
larger debt for taxpayers, fewer jobs for people living in that 
province and the jobs that were left were lower paying jobs.  It 
also resulted in reduced services, higher costs for those 
services and in many cases reduced services with a higher cost 
attached. Wherever you go in Saskatchewan when people say we are 
going to privatize something, it is like a four letter word. 
People spit that word out.  Every single time something has been 
privatized they have screwed up the service, the utility or the 
product they have been marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member opposite explain to Saskatchewan people how 
privatization of our taxation collection system is going to be 
any better for them?  Given the bad vibes and the bad results of 
privatization in Saskatchewan, and the member telling us that 
they will have all this confidential information for Canadians, 
what assurances can he give us that this privatization will not 
be like all the others that have happened in Saskatchewan and 
that there will be some sense of security for those people filing 
their income taxes, paying their taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question but I believe he is wrong.  This is not a bill 
about privatization.  I know the minister of revenue has been in 
consultation with all finance ministers of the provinces and 
territories. He has had detailed discussions with the minister of 
finance from the member's home province as he has had with the 
minister from my province of Manitoba. Those discussions have 
gone very well.  The provinces recognize properly that in forming 
this new agency we are going to save Canadian taxpayers some 
money.  Instead of two sets of books, two auditors and two 
processes, we can do it one time through this agency.  We have 
the database and we are capable of doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing inherent in this bill that would suggest it is 
going to be privatized, that information will be divulged to 
people who ought not to have it.  I just finished saying that 
this is one of the guarantees that will be worked out in the bill 
with the participants in this province.  There may be even more 
jobs created so I do not accept the hon. member's premise that 
there is some deep dark luring process in here that will send 
Canadian taxation and revenue employees scrambling to the streets 
looking for jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have two questions for my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all he mentioned the streamlining of this agency. It 
seems as though the provinces are not onboard with this super 
agency which he referred to therefore reducing the probability 
that there will be cost savings if there are in fact to be two 
agencies collecting taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also mentioned the handling of highly 
confidential information.  I am wondering if the member can 
explain how the current system is able to give information. In a 
case that was mentioned in a speech earlier today by my hon. 
colleague, information from a person within his own province of 
Manitoba was given to an insurance agency.  It was highly 
confidential information and ended up in the wrong hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that this super agency with unlimited power can ensure 
that there is going to be any confidentiality?  What specifics in 
this bill point to the fact that Canadians can be assured that 
information regarding their taxes will not be shared with others 
who are not privy to that information? How can that be so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the principles and the pillar of this new agency will be 
that it will be fully accountable to the minister and therefore 
to parliament. That linkage, that trust relationship, that 
fiduciary relationship between the Canadian taxpayer and 
parliament will not be broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention for the record that the Minister of 
Finance from Manitoba as reported in the Winnipeg <I>Free 
Press</I> has supported this agency and I believe is eager to be 
part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the member's question, it is a legitimate one but 
I think we have the necessary checks and balances to make sure 
that does not occur. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have the opportunity today to speak on behalf 
of the NDP caucus on Bill C-43.  I would like to say at the 
outset that the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle outlined very well 
why members of the NDP are opposed to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very significant bill that the House is debating 
today. It deals with the importance of the national collection of 
taxes and revenue in Canada.  Certainly from the government 
perspective, from the House of Commons perspective, this is 
probably the fundamental purpose we are here, to ensure there is 
a fair and equitable collection system as well as a process and 
formula whereby we do collect taxes from the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the public point of view this is also a very significant 
issue. If we talk to Canadians about the taxation system, people 
obviously do not like paying taxes but I think Canadians 
understand that the process of doing that is something that must 
be transparent.  It is something that must have a measure of 
accountability because it really is the most fundamental purpose 
and issue of why we are here in this House. From that point of 
view this bill is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue arises then as to whether or not this bill is good 
public policy or whether it takes us in another direction. Having 
examined the bill and having looked at the various commentaries 
about this bill, I and my colleagues have come to the conclusion 
that this bill represents bad public policy.  I would like to 
give a number of reasons why we have come to this conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all the bill is premised on the fact that bigger is 
better.  When we look at the provisions that are contained in 
Bill C-43, it is quite alarming and scary to think that this 
bill, if it is approved by this House, will put into motion a 
mega tax collection agency in Canada that will go from the 
national to the provincial and even the municipal levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agency could be in a position where it ends up collecting 
provincial sales taxes, gasoline taxes, liquor taxes, municipal 
property taxes and on and on.  It raises the question of do we 
want this mega tax agency to be involved with such concentration 
in collecting taxes across the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a municipal background. 
I understand as do other municipal representatives that the 
people of Canada, whether they are voting at the municipal, 
provincial or federal levels, believe very much in the old adage 
of no taxation without representation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT67"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT67"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know at the municipal level when decisions are made about 
municipal taxes, and the same is true at the provincial and 
federal levels, that there is an expectation that elected 
representatives are accountable for the decisions they make. That 
is not only decisions in terms of process and where taxes are 
spent, but also how taxes are collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very alarming measures and proposals in this bill is 
it creates this mega tax agency and we will lose the sense of 
accountability at other levels of government in terms of tax 
collection.  This is something we should be seriously concerned 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes very strongly in a strong federal government. 
In terms of national unity, in terms of what it is that holds 
Canada together, we believe there have to be national standards. 
It may seem contradictory that on this issue we are arguing 
against some kind of national agency that collects taxes from 
even other levels of government. I think the difference here is 
that because taxation is something that is involved in different 
levels of government, it is really important that those levels of 
government be responsible not just for the decisions they make 
but also for their tax collection and the accountability for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point of view we are very concerned about the 
rationale put forward in this bill that bigger is better. It 
leaves us open to all kinds of abuses.  It leaves us open to a 
distance in terms of decisions that are made and the 
accountability that needs to be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dealing with the issue of accountability, as a member of 
parliament, like other MPs, a lot of my case work in my 
constituency involves Revenue Canada.  We get queries and 
complaints from constituents who feel lost in the maze of Revenue 
Canada. One of the fundamental concerns I have about this bill 
and I hope that other members of the House would have about this 
bill is that we lose the sense of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day it is we as members of this House who have 
to provide the role of watchdog and monitor what happens in 
Revenue Canada or any other federal government department. I hold 
that responsibility for my constituents.  I try to do the best I 
can when they raise complaints and concerns about Revenue Canada 
or any other department. That is a hard enough job, but it is a 
role we hold in this House and I believe that members take that 
role seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me about Bill C-43 is that the government is 
poised to create a super agency that will now have a greater 
distance in terms of the relationship of the minister.  It sets 
up sort of a private sector board and no doubt there will be 
Liberal appointees on it. It takes us one step further from the 
accountability that comes from this House of Commons and the 
members who are here in terms of providing that role of 
monitoring Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons alone we should be speaking out against the 
creation of this super agency.  We want to have departments and 
operations of the government that are fully accountable to the 
Parliament of Canada.  I think there is enough in this bill to 
cause us concern that that will not be the case if this bill is 
approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also some very serious concerns around issues to do 
with personal privacy.  When I talk to my constituents in the 
riding, one of the issues that comes up continually is people's 
concern about the loss of privacy involving government 
operations.  This is something that comes up in dealing with 
departments and government operations, such as Revenue Canada.  I 
know that others as well have raised this as a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is creating this super agency of tax collection and 
concentrating the powers in a massive bureaucracy.  It will have 
such wide sweeping powers for collection, potentially at every 
level of government.  That is what the aim is of this bill and of 
the mandate that is being put before us. What will be eroded is 
an individual's right to privacy and confidentiality as people 
find themselves dealing with a huge bureaucracy where 
information, perhaps inadvertently or through whatever process, 
may end up in the wrong hands. 
That is another reason why we should be very concerned about the 
creation of this agency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little while ago in the debate we heard one of the government 
members give some of the reasons that the government believes 
this tax collection agency is a good thing.  One of the reasons 
cited was that there would be greater savings.  We were told that 
there will be less overlap.  We were told there is one taxpayer 
so why not one agency.  We were told that there will be increased 
participation by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at this bill and at the dangers that are inherent 
in the creation of this super agency, I think the alleged 
benefits that are created become very suspect.  I doubt that 
there will be greater savings.  Even the work that has been done 
so far has created costs but the creation of new layers of 
bureaucracy in terms of this super agency is something that is 
costing us money. However, if there are greater savings, then I 
think we have to ask at what cost.  At what cost in terms of the 
privacy loss that may be involved and in terms of the lack and 
lessening of accountability that will accrue as we move into this 
one agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are very serious issues that we have to debate in this 
House and challenge the government to answer.  So far it has not 
provided answers to the questions that have been raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of overlap and duplication, I would again like to 
express the concerns that we on this side of the House have about 
this mega agency becoming all-encompassing.  We will lose the 
sense of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also been told that provincial governments are very much 
in favour of the potential cost savings and in handing over the 
collection to this mega agency.  When we look at the record, as 
my colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle outlined, we can see that 
there are two major provinces with major populations that are 
opposed to this agency.  Now there are other provinces 
particularly in western Canada that are expressing concerns. 
There is a lot of doubt that there will be any sign on as 
envisioned by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposition is being put forward that this is a sold thing 
and that it is well on its way, but from day one this proposal 
has been in trouble.  I think a lot of doubt has been created and 
some of it has come from the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that should cause us concern is the prospect that 
this agency will have the ability to levy user fees.  This is 
something that has not come out very much and something which is 
not well understood.  It is very important for us to understand 
that if this bill is approved and this agency is set up, it would 
have the potential to bring in user fees for certain client 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to examine that very carefully and see the warning 
signals of what that means.  We look at that kind of measure 
along the lines of privatization.  Privatization and user fees go 
hand in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my next concern, the massive privatization of 
Revenue Canada.  Something like 40,000 workers are involved. Most 
of the unions that are involved in Revenue Canada have been very 
opposed to this proposal.  It is easy for the government or other 
opposition parties to discount the comments of the workers at 
Revenue Canada or any other government department and say “Well, 
they just have a vested interest and we should not consider 
seriously what they have to say”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years I have learned that people who work on the front 
line, who understand the operation intimately of any department, 
whether Revenue Canada, the pension plan, EI or whatever, have 
very valid legitimate things to say. They have the real 
experience of what makes a department work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear from the representation of workers in Revenue 
Canada that they have serious concerns about the privatization of 
this agency it sounds a warning bell to members of the House of 
Commons to take serious note.  We should consider their 
arguments.  We are not in favour of privatization.  The NDP 
believes strongly that these core government services should 
remain as departments of the government.  They should be 
accountable to the House of Commons.  Look at Canada Post and the 
relationship that has deteriorated between the people of Canada, 
the customers, and the corporation.  One need only look at other 
privatized services to see the sense of distrust that develops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this becomes a very strong reason why we should reject 
this bill and say that this is taking us down the wrong road.  We 
do not want to go down the road of privatization.  We want to 
ensure that this department remains within government services, 
that it is clearly mandated, that there is accountability to the 
House so that we do not end up in a scenario of user fees where 
this agency is used to pressure, for example, the harmonized 
sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from day one that one of the purposes of this agency was 
to promote that kind of idea.  The fact is that idea fell flat. 
It was a resounding failure in the maritimes. With the creation 
of this agency under Bill C-43 the potential exists that there 
will be pressure from this agency to move ahead with the 
harmonized sales tax which Canadians are increasingly rejecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the financial community there has been debate about this 
bill.  People have looked at the proposal and have tried to 
decide whether there actually is a public benefit, whether there 
are economic reasons for moving ahead at this, whether there are 
public policy reasons for moving ahead with this, whether this is 
in the interests of Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been very clear that even the auditor general has 
expressed concerns about this proposal.  This was raised in the 
auditor general's report of December 1997.  He asked how 
Canadians and parliamentarians will have assurances that the 
public interest is protected.  That is a very good question. How 
will we be provided with that assurance?  The government has not 
given us any indication or substantial answer that the creation 
of this super agency will protect the public interest, that 
Canadians will be better off under this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have comments from other people.  For example, Professor 
Vern Krishna from the University of Ottawa's CGA taxation 
research centre asked what really are the benefits.  He clearly 
raised a number of doubts about the real public benefits of 
moving ahead with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of bill that is not on the front pages of the 
newspapers.  It is not on the national news at night. 
Nevertheless, it is a significant proposal.  It has been a long 
time in the works.  It is a proposal that has gone wrong. It is a 
proposal that does not serve the public interest.  It is a 
proposal that raises serious questions about accountability of 
what is a core function of the federal government and other 
governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day I and other members of my caucus believe 
that when it comes to taxes and revenue collection we have to 
ensure there is a clear line of responsibility and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us that means saying no to privatization.  It means saying 
no to user fees and it means saying we believe in a system that 
ensures a responsibility and an involvement of local governments. 
That means saying no to a mega organization, a mega new 
bureaucracy that will be more distant from this House, more 
distant from members of parliament, more distant from the 
Canadian public. For those reasons we are opposed to Bill C-43. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Chair, I can only conclude that the member 
unfortunately has not read the material and is not aware of some 
of the points.  Perhaps I can correct her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, moving to the agency is creating a vehicle for 
options.  I do not know why the member is against creating new 
options so that we can work with the provinces, so that we can 
sit down and say let us see what the benefits are, let us see how 
we can work together.  It is about creating new options for 
Canadians as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the hon. member a good example.  In the last tax 
return we asked Canadians if they would like to be on the 
electoral list.  We asked them to checkmark the electoral list. 
Eighty-one per cent of Canadians chose to be on the electoral 
list. That means for Canadians we are going to save $30 million 
for every election because we do not have to do an enumeration. 
That is about working together for the benefit of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the hon. member another example, the child tax 
benefit. When the Government of British Columbia wanted to carry 
out a child tax benefit, it came to Revenue Canada and said can 
you perform this service for us. Because we have the computer 
system, the data, we were able to provide the service, to deliver 
a very important benefit for the Government of British Columbia 
at millions of dollars less than if it had to build a parallel 
system to deliver that program. We worked with British Columbia. 
Creating the agency is about creating a vehicle for choices.  It 
does not force the provinces to do anything.  In fact, it 
includes them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has mistakenly said that we can put anybody on the 
board.  Clearly the legislation says that each province will be 
able to nominate. The NDP government in British Columbia will be 
able to nominate people to sit on the board of management to make 
sure there is accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill surely talks about accountability.  I know many members 
have quoted the auditor general.  The auditor general's quote was 
referring to the old model.  I have made the changes because of 
the consultation I have done over the last year to make sure we 
have full accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is that in the last finance minister's meeting, 
one of the items on the agenda was the agency.  In fact, all the 
finance ministers agreed to the guidelines regarding what the 
agencies could collect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Petter, the former finance minister of British Columbia, at 
that time said this is the right direction, it is about reducing 
overlap, about reducing duplication, about making sure we reduce 
the compliance cost to business and about giving better service. 
The ministers agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about user fees.  It is simply not true. That 
is totally erroneous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of harmonized sales tax, the agency says you do not 
have to harmonize.  Let us sit together and see if there is 
opportunity to work together on collecting non-harmonized taxes. 
If you want to talk about harmonization that is something that 
the finance people do.  We are in the business of tax 
administration.  We have said part of this is to be able to 
collect non-harmonized taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the quote from Mr. Krishna, he was referring to the 
former model.  Mr. Krishna is a member of an advisory committee 
to me as Minister of National Revenue.  I have discussed this 
matter and he was referring to the original model which we have 
changed to create greater political accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Really what we are talking about are choices.  What we are 
talking about is opportunity.  What we are talking about is 
bringing the federal and provincial governments together. 
Canadians want us to work in co-operation.  They want to make 
sure we get rid of overlap and duplication to simplify and 
streamline.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments.  I am surprised when we are told that this is 
simply a vehicle for creating options and that it is a pretty 
soft approach and we should not worry about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there has to be an acknowledgement that there have been 
serious concerns raised about this proposal.  If it is simply a 
vehicle for creating options and choices then where are the 
provinces lined up all raring for this to go? That does not 
appear to be evident.  It is quite the contrary. There is 
opposition.  There are serious doubts about whether this, as the 
minister has said, would simplify and streamline the system. 
What does that mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the downside of that, what are the costs of creating a 
massive new bureaucracy that allegedly will simplify and 
streamline the collection of these revenues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that there are questions of accountability raised by 
the provinces and by experts in the field who are still saying to 
the government that there needs to be further review and there 
needs to further work before this proposal is moved on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the minister can escape the reality that the 
provinces are not lining up at the door to move ahead with this 
proposal.  On the contrary, they are casting doubt and they have 
many questions and concerns about this proposal which I think 
should cause the government to go back to square one, back to its 
advisory committees or whatever processes are in place to look at 
the fundamentals of this bill and look at where it went wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the remarks of my hon. colleague, who 
raised some very important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When any bill is introduced, we must first consider how it will 
affect individuals and their privacy. Does the bill affect 
privacy? Does it affect individuals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague mentioned she was from a rural riding; so am I. It 
is well known that, in rural ridings in particular, services 
provided to the public are extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance saying the Minister of Finance has said this and the 
Minister of Finance had said that. The minister says many 
things; on the subject of the employment insurance, he has said 
some pretty incredible things, so this may not be the best 
yardstick. In my opinion, the yardstick is our constituents, 
individuals. We also heard that savings would be made. But on 
whose backs will these savings be made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague to elaborate a little on how this could 
interfere with someone's privacy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his very thoughtful comments and questions. I agree that 
there are very serious concerns about the impact of this proposal 
on the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the minister that this is about streamlining, 
about simplifying.  Even if we take that at face value that may 
be good for governments in terms of huge bureaucracies but there 
are very real questions about how that does affect individual 
Canadians who then have to find their way through an increasing 
maze of a massive bureaucracy, to try to retrieve information, to 
find out what happened to their income tax return or any other 
matter that may be before the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the individual's point of view, from the taxpayer's point 
of view, there has not been a thorough examination to really 
answer whether this is in the public's interest, which is not 
necessarily the same as the government's interest in terms of the 
bureaucracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question here is the public interest and I think for 
individual Canadians that question has not been answered.  In 
fact, there are serious concerns that it is not in the public 
interest and, therefore, it should not go ahead. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to follow the previous speaker.  The prepared text that I 
had has disappeared because of the many issues raised in her 
speech and throughout the day and I think it is necessary to 
debunk some of these myths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the piece in the proposed legislation which takes away 
the privacy conditions of the Income Tax Act?  It is just not 
there.  The sections of the Income Tax Act will be the same. 
They prevent people from getting personal taxpayer information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the best revenue collection in the world.  We have 
over 97% voluntary compliance.  People sitting in the gallery and 
watching on TV know that every year they sit down, gather their 
information, calculate, self-assess, send in the information to 
the government and, in large part, do it correctly.  They get a 
refund or they submit their taxes.  Nobody comes pounding on the 
door.  People in this country are responsible.  It is the 
responsible citizens of this country who will be best served by 
this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this legislation we are not in a transition to some 
private company.  Private companies do not have cabinet ministers 
answerable to parliament.  The citizens demand accountability and 
citizens across this country, no matter whether they are in one 
province or another province across the land, are taxpayers. 
They pay taxes to different levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, these citizens have not had the best service 
because they have had to answer to different auditors at 
different levels of government, and not only individuals but 
businesses as well.  The small businesses that drive the engine 
of our economy could have a provincial tax auditor come in one 
day, a federal auditor the next and an income tax auditor the 
next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about is the potential for better service to 
Canadians and the potential for new partnerships with Canadians, 
new partnerships between levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if any government, any finance minister, 
any province has definitively slammed the door and said “We do 
not even want to listen to what you are talking about”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance ministers, as the minister just told us, got 
together and came up with guidelines on what is potentially 
available.  There would be a range of services and options 
available both at the provincial and federal levels.  For 
instance, the Atlantic region was promised a range at the time of 
harmonization.  It is another step, another potential choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be accountability.  In the speech we talked about 
representation and accountability if you have representation in 
your population.  What better method of accountability to the 
different levels of jurisdiction, that is, provincial, federal 
and territorial, than allowing those levels of government—in 
fact, we do work with many of them right now—to have input and to 
give to the federal government nominees to fill the positions on 
the board that will form a new body of management? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will be approved at the federal level.  That is in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be a new approach to public service management.  Are we 
unique?  Are we the only people in the world who have dreamed up 
this scheme?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the privilege over the last couple of years of 
serving as the parliamentary secretary and I have worked with the 
men and women in this department.  I am very pleased that we have 
a new parliamentary secretary in the department of revenue, but I 
still believe firmly that the employees and the public are well 
served.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked at some of the models that are out there in the 
world, models such as those in the United Kingdom, Australia and 
New Zealand which have similar mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that some of the things we have 
heard today are things that would concern Canadians.  They would 
concern me as a taxpayer if they were true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating this legislation at second reading.  It will go 
to a committee.  There will be hearings and it will come back to 
the House for another debate.  It will go through the normal 
process of the House.  It will go through the scrutiny and there 
will be further input.  To pretend that there has been no process 
or consultation is erroneous.  There has been a process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will spend a bit of time debunking some of the myths I have 
heard today and try to place before the House and the Canadian 
public some of what I believe are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard and seen material that says the agency is being 
developed behind a closed door and that there have not been any 
public consultations.  That is just not true.  Revenue Canada, 
the Minister of National Revenue and the officials from the 
department have consulted on this proposal.  In fact the proposal 
has changed over time.  There have been two progress reports, one 
in April of 1997 and one in January of 1998, on the development 
of the proposal.  These reports were published and distributed. 
Views were sought by the minister from all the people who were 
concerned and interested, from a wide spectrum of the public, 
including the provincial and territorial governments, private 
sector stakeholders and various members of parliament who let us 
know their feelings and those of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended some of the meetings.  I was there last summer when 
the minister went across the country and met with certain finance 
ministers, when he went to editorial boardrooms, when he appeared 
on TV and radio talk shows to answer questions.  I was there when 
he spoke to different members of our own employee groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we have to look for further advice.  There is the private 
sector advisory committee.  It has and will continue to give 
advice, and we will listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to talk about what has gone on with our own 
employees and the unions involved with Revenue Canada.  There 
have been good attempts at broad consultation with both unions 
and employees.  The unions have been provided with all the 
information that has been used for the consultation purposes. 
They have received private briefings on the details of the 
proposal on an ongoing basis from the very beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the summer of 1997 the department created working groups to 
include employees, managers and unions to obtain suggestions, 
ideas and considerations in the development of a new human 
resources framework for the agency.  More than 7,000 of our 
employees were heard during that particular consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December of 1997 the deputy minister of Revenue Canada 
committed to a process of working with the unions and employees 
to develop the requirements for a new human resources regime. 
The union for taxation employees, the customs and excise union, 
Douanes et Accises, the Professional Institute of the Public 
Service of Canada and the Association of Public Service Financial 
Administrators signed a document of intent to participate in a 
design team process using the working group report as the 
starting point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of these unions have subsequently withdrawn from the design 
team process, but the door always remains open for their 
participation in further development work.  I think that is an 
important point, especially for our employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five of the design teams have completed their work now and their 
recommendations are under review.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the fears I have heard, especially within the employee 
group, which is a very large group, is that the agency creation 
means job losses for Revenue Canada employees.  There is the 
feeling that there is some hidden agenda that maybe management 
does not want to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear once and for all.  The agency is not about 
downsizing.  There is no hidden agenda.  It is about service. 
Every member of the department will be transferred to the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to comprehend how one organizational structure, which 
will become a super organizational structure, will be unequal in 
size.  That is part of the myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, all the work that has come to the department over the 
last couple of years, on a cost-recovery basis, from some of the 
provinces which have given us non-traditional tasks to do has 
actually increased the workforce because there has been more 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency is clearly about improving service to clients: 
Canadians, businesses, the provinces.  It is not about laying off 
employees.  We want to build a new human resources framework with 
the full participation of employees and their unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It represents a new start.  It is a change.  People resist 
change.  It is natural.  But Revenue Canada needs change because 
the world is changing.  That is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine yourself in a global economy trying to do business with 
us.  We have a number of provinces spread out over a large 
geographical area and they each have their own tax rules.  They 
each have their own auditors.  They are not the same from one 
province to another.  It is not like dealing with one Canada, it 
is like dealing with different levels, different people, 
different systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the potential to simplify it.  Are we forcing it? 
Absolutely not.  Is this another way to get at harmonization 
through the back door?  Absolutely not.  However, it will allow 
us to collect non-harmonized taxes, something we could not do 
before for the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That option will not be forced on anybody and not on any level 
of government.  It will be a choice.  Are there user fees?  Not 
in any section of the legislation I have read, and I have read 
every section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is cost recovery available if a province uses some of our 
systems?  Certainly.  Cost recovery is not a user fee.  They are 
two different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about some of the other myths I have heard today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will benefit management at the expense of the employees.  I 
do not think so.  In fact I know that is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is enabling legislation and it represents a significant 
improvement over the current framework for both employees and 
management at Revenue Canada.  Management I hope will benefit by 
having a system that is much easier to manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the staffing, the classification and the 
administrative systems being developed will be more responsive. 
They will concentrate less on process and more on results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system will also benefit employees in a number of ways. 
There will be direct negotiations between agency management and 
the unions which will lead to in-house solutions, inside the 
revenue agency, designed by persons who understand the agency's 
business and are committed to the agency's success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with that?  A simplified classification system, a 
group structure for the agency would respond and in fact give a 
focus to the employees' suggestions for broader jobs and career 
opportunities for employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult time-wise to get a person sitting in the 
department doing one job that really does not need doing any more 
over to this job that desperately needs doing because of the maze 
that we have to go through.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have qualified people who want more opportunity and it takes 
us far too long to put them in the positions to do the jobs they 
want to do and which we need doing. A more streamlined 
classification and staffing system would result in employees 
being placed in jobs faster.  We believe this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new approach to recourse would focus on alternate dispute 
resolution mechanisms such as fact finding and mediation, yet 
incorporate access to independent third party review.  The 
possibility of additional provincial workloads would mean 
increased stability of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the agency, the big winner is always the person most 
important to the government, the Canadian public.  Canadians will 
benefit when any process is more efficient, responsive and 
accountable, whether it is customs administration or revenue 
administration.  That is the goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some that have argued today in this House that the 
agency will reduce accountability to the public we serve in this 
parliament where we sit today.  In fact, the full ministerial 
accountability for program legislation and overall government 
control of the agency has to be maintained and will be 
maintained. The federal government will remain firmly in control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, there will be no change in the ability of the 
members who sit in this House, the federal members of parliament 
who are accountable to their constituents when they come to them 
with problems.  There will be access in exactly the same manner 
that we have today.  With the consent of the individual 
constituent, the member can deal with the problem for the people 
the member represents. That is far different than open.  Consent 
forms are needed. Nobody in Revenue Canada is going to give the 
member one iota of information unless the member has the full and 
informed consent of the constituent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue will retain all current 
authorities he has under the act.  There are multiple references 
to different authorities under the various acts that he 
administers, whether it is the Customs Act, the Income Tax Act, 
or many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The broader interest of the cabinet will continue to be fully 
protected.  The bill provides that Treasury Board must approve 
the agency's corporate business plan, including its strategies 
regarding human resources.  The minister will also have the 
authority to direct the agency on matters that are within the 
management authority of the board and that affect public policy 
or could materially affect public finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So where is this idea of privatization?  It certainly does not 
go hand in hand with what I have just stated.  It cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will have the ability to investigate any matter 
brought to his or her attention. Furthermore, the minister will 
continue to be responsible for providing answers to those MPs who 
make queries on behalf of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the personal privacy issue being jeopardized?  Personal 
privacy will not, should not, and will never be privatized 
knowingly.  Accidents are possible, but accidents are rare and 
they are not intentional.  The law of Canada has the fundamental 
principle that the taxpayer information of Canadians is 
sacrosanct.  It is private.  It is not communicated.  The 
barriers are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have rules governing confidentiality of information.  We have 
rules governing access of private information. We have rules 
governing fairness.  We have the declaration of taxpayers' rights 
and that will apply the day after the legislation is passed, as 
it does today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enforcement powers will not change through the creation of 
the agency.  These powers are limited by the authority given in 
the tax and customs legislation.  The opposition likes to use the 
new label of super agency, but that does not give it new super 
powers. The powers that are there and the definite checks and 
balances in the system will remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is in its evolution.  We have a framework on which we 
can build.  We have a system that may in time create a less 
complex environment.  We have a system that we believe will be 
better for our own employees and will give them the challenges 
and rewards they deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my question for the member opposite concerns a point I 
made when I spoke on behalf of my party this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that there is a lot of opposition right now in the 
provinces. Ontario has said definitely no.  Quebec has said 
definitely no. Certainly Saskatchewan and British Columbia are 
leaning that way.  No other province I know of has signed a 
letter of intent to join the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought we lived in a federation.  Here we have something that 
deals with both federal and provincial jurisdictions.  I believe 
very strongly in co-operative federalism.  I noticed that the 
member did not comment on that although it is a very important 
aspect of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting to the time when the Quebec election writ will be 
dropped very shortly.  That gets into the question of national 
unity and perceptions in the province of Quebec about this super 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member opposite to comment on whether or not 
she is satisfied with the enthusiasm, or lack thereof, of the 
provinces.  None have joined this and the two biggest provinces 
which represent about two-thirds of the population have said 
that they will not be part of this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond 
to the question of the hon. member opposite.  It is a fair 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to join something that has not yet been 
created.  That is the bottom line.  But the structure is there. I 
will give an example by quoting directly from a statement made by 
the minister of finance for New Brunswick, the hon. Mr. 
Blanchard:  “Where there are efficiencies to be gained, I am 
open to alternatives.  There may be areas that yes, some of our 
current taxes can be collected in an efficient way by this 
agency.  I have not shut the door on any possibility”.  He is 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is such that if we went across the country and 
looked at how collections are made and the current functions of 
Revenue Canada, some provinces were already up in the high 80% of 
collecting revenues.  That is already status quo. We are doing 
some things, like the child tax benefit in British Columbia. 
There are many things Revenue Canada is currently doing under 
different agreements where the provinces do not have a direct 
input in the board situation that we are offering.  This will 
provide for that input.  When people have some input into board 
management, I am sure over time they will sign on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to follow up on my colleague's 
question in the same area.  In her speech the member said that 
this is not about downsizing.  We can all agree with that.  There 
is nothing the past two governments have done in this country 
over the last 15 years that has been downsizing.  Everything they 
have done has created more jobs for people in the bureaucracy so 
I am not too concerned about that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that it is not harmonizing through the back 
door, that it is not being forced and that it is a choice.  She 
quoted a minister from one of our smaller provinces who said that 
where efficiencies were to be gained they would look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has been looking at it with the provinces for 
over 18 months.  It does not have the definite agreement of 
Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta, which is the 
overwhelming majority of this country.  The government will not 
get those agreements even once the act is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said in his question, with the election coming 
up in Quebec, this is another little thing we can throw in the 
fire to show that this country is not working in the way the 
people and the provinces want it to work.  They do not want a 
bigger federal government with bigger federal government 
agencies.  The provinces want to run their own business.  They do 
not want these kinds of agencies and they have told the 
government that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had a consultative process. The government 
says that it is listening. 
When the majority of provinces are saying they do not want this, 
why is the government proceeding with a bill that is going to 
change the face of this thing, probably create a lot more jobs in 
the federal bureaucracy, but not solve any problems for Canadians 
and the provinces?  It will not give any more power to the 
provinces which is what the provinces want.

of us what we should be doing in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know the hon. member 
was sitting in his seat and listening attentively a couple of 
minutes ago when the minister emphasized that at the finance 
ministers meeting there was an agreement on the outline of those 
taxes that could be covered under this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask to be shown anywhere where they emphatically say 
“We do not want to have discussion.  We want this process to 
stop.  We are not engaged”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is even though the Government of Quebec has a 
different system than the rest of Canada in its revenue 
collection, there is day to day co-operation.  There is day to 
day co-operation, consultation and communication between the 
systems of tax and revenue collection.  That is why we do work 
together and will continue to work together and seek more 
co-operation.  We will not halt the potential for more 
co-operation because that would not be in the best interests of 
Canadians.

have three brief comments to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill says the headquarters of the agency must be in Ottawa, 
but, as we know, the financial community is concentrated in 
Toronto and Montreal, but not necessarily in Ottawa. So what is 
the advantage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will be responsible for contracting with the 
provinces or for implementing agreements between the federal 
government and the provinces. How many of these tax agreements 
does the government intend to ask the agency to look after? 
None, so what is the point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue will be responsible for the 
agency. 
But the minister may delegate his powers, except the power to 
make regulations. So a non-elected person who is not accountable 
to this House could be acting on his behalf. The minister would 
actually be going through this person. I would like the hon. 
member to comment on this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank the hon. member for his question. It is a good question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the federal and provincial finance ministers have 
agreed to standards for administering provincial taxes.  In other 
words if there is an agreement on standards, there could be an 
agreement in the different collections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the point which is a political one I understand 
about the location of a head office per se, to my understanding 
the minister and the department location will not change.  The 
minister works here in the capital of the country.  I have every 
expectation that will remain.  I certainly have not seen or heard 
anything different.  I think the hon. member should be more 
concerned about the co-operation as opposed to the geographic 
location of this agency.

Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments and know that 
she as the parliamentary secretary spent a great deal of time on 
this bill and was very dedicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary knows, while the vast majority of 
Revenue Canada agents are hardworking and treat taxpayers fairly, 
from time to time we see some really extraordinary abuses of 
their power, as I have outlined in various interventions today. 
What is in this bill that would strengthen accountability to 
preclude the possibility of these types of abuses of power and to 
treat taxpayers as innocent until they are proven guilty by the 
tax system?

the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At Revenue Canada we have what is called the fairness principle 
and as the hon. member knows there is a taxpayers' bill of rights 
in place.  Those things would continue, but we need to have the 
culture of fairness understood by Canadians citizens.  I believe 
our workers already understand the principle.  They have the 
training in the principle and they work every day in this 
principle.  It is a system of due process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I do not have the time to go into the details, but I 
would like to direct the member to one of the speeches I gave 
specifically on this point which I think was at least 10 or 15 
minutes in length.  It was in the last session of parliament.  It 
goes through the different processes available to the Canadian 
taxpayer.  If the member approaches me I can get that to him at a 
later date. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am glad to speak to Bill C-43, the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency Act, an act that affects all Canadians and is extremely 
important to the House as taxation is the primary reason for the 
existence of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to change the direction of the debate a little to 
how the legislation itself will be considered.  It is being 
debated in the lower House and will probably be passed by the 
Liberal majority.  After it goes through second reading, it 
leaves the House and goes to the other place, a place of unbiased 
sober second thought which is not in any sense subject to 
partisan consideration.  We do not really believe that.  We know 
the only piece of equipment required over there is the rubber 
stamp that is issued without any delay when a senator is 
appointed and not elected to that place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it may seem an aside in the discussion of Bill C-43, I 
would like members of the House to consider that for the last two 
federal elections there has not been a single Progressive 
Conservative elected west of the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border. 
Yet the Prime Minister recently appointed a senator for Alberta 
who was not from the Reform Party, which has the bulk of support 
in Alberta, and not from the Liberal Party which has marginal 
support but from the PC Party which has no support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone believe that a place of sober second thought will 
represent the so-called regions, the regions being the provinces? 
Several provinces have already indicated they do not support the 
legislation.  How are their concerns to be heard in that place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they have at the present time?  They have members of 
parliament, the bulk of whom are Liberals, who will vote for the 
legislation, probably denying any proposed amendments set out by 
any of the opposition parties.  They have premiers who have moral 
suasion but do not have legislative power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament needs a triple-E Senate that has the power which 
flows from elections, the people's choice, effected senators able 
to act independent of the Prime Minister and equal in that each 
province has its own senators who will represent the province's 
point of view in debates like this one and others.  They will 
represent their provinces in parliament. They will not represent 
the governing party in the House of Commons.  That is some of the 
background I wanted to set.  As we consider this matter we know 
the provinces will not be heard in this place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to consideration of the actual bill, we understand that 
debate is important in that various perspectives on tax 
collection policy are at issue.  The balance is between increased 
efficiency in the collection of taxes owed to the government and 
the potential for abuse by the government of the centralized tax 
collection power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few people would admit to being happy to pay taxes.  The 
dissatisfaction with paying taxes is largely due to perceived 
government waste and the inefficiencies in the use of the tax 
dollars collected.  In a civilized society no one would 
acknowledge that a world without taxes is possible since taxes 
are used to provide services of benefit to all as well as 
services that benefit those particularly in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dissatisfaction with paying taxes should lead. though, to 
actions to lower tax levels and to make the government more 
accountable for the use of tax dollars.  Dissatisfaction with 
paying taxes cannot justify the evasion of taxes properly owed. 
Dissatisfaction with paying taxes should also not lead to 
unreasonable delays in paying taxes properly owed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the official opposition on Bill C-43 is 
essentially that there should be greater safeguards for citizens 
with respect to the centralized tax collection power of 
government.  It must acknowledge that concerns about the tax 
collection practices of government assumed public prominence in 
the early 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some in the House will remember that the Conservatives then in 
opposition conducted public hearings into the fairness of tax 
collection policies.  The parliamentarian conducting those 
hearings, Mr. Perrin Beatty, later became the Minister of 
National Revenue during the Conservatives' term of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time comparisons were made between tax collection 
policies in the United States and Canada.  I believe it is fair 
to state that tax collection policies in the United States, 
notably through the actions of the IRS, have always been regarded 
as significantly more aggressive than they are in Canada, perhaps 
due to national differences in perspective as much as to the 
benevolence of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States the government and its citizenry often 
assume adversarial roles whereas in Canada the consensus appears 
to be that citizens are less inclined to regard government as the 
enemy.  We must be very cautious with respect to any criticism of 
initiatives to make tax collection more efficient.  After all, it 
is well known that those least able to avoid paying taxes are the 
salaried employees throughout Canada.  Those most able to avoid 
paying taxes are self-employed persons and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone should pay taxes justly owed.  The requirement for 
instalment tax payments on the part of business and the 
self-employed is to avoid unwelcome tax liabilities and 
collection difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a further difficulty that the government faces in 
collecting taxes and that is the elimination of its priority 
under the Bankruptcy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For better or for worse it was determined that the government 
did not merit the status of preferred creditor under the 
Bankruptcy Act, meaning that for many people the easiest answer 
to tax collection problems is simply to go bankrupt.  Given this 
trend some might argue that it is in the larger public interest 
that tax debts survive a bankruptcy, not unlike family support 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this is important can be seen in the experiences of 
countries where there is widespread public contempt for tax 
collection, which is usually tied to great public lack of 
confidence in government.  Our most recent example is that of 
Russia where the outgoing head of tax collection has predicted 
this week that his successor will soon fail, given that the 
government is bankrupt and likely to fall within weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of attitudes cannot gain a strong foothold in Canada 
lest it be to widespread resistance to paying taxes justly owed. 
The appropriate response in a civilized society is political 
action to change dimensions of the tax system considered to be 
objectionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add again that political action should involve creating 
a House of Commons and a Senate that are workable.  The proposals 
of my colleague from Calgary Southeast, who is also the official 
opposition critic for national revenue, appear to be aimed at 
balancing the need for the efficient collection of taxes justly 
owed with protections to curb the potential for abuse of the 
collection power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This balancing of interests would occur through the legislative 
enactment of a taxpayers' bill of rights combined with the 
creation of an office for taxpayer protection.  This office for 
taxpayer protection would involve an independent taxpayer 
advocate who would report to parliament in a similar fashion to 
that of the auditor general. 
We have recently seen why the need for independence in reporting 
is important in terms of the assertions now made by the recently 
dismissed chief actuary of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may ask why a taxpayer's bill of rights.  We know that the 
tax department collection policies are generally asserted to be 
far more considerate of taxpayer concerns than in years 
previously.  There is a similar bill of rights approach 
communicated by the tax department to taxpayers.  However, with 
the centralized collection power of the new agency the position 
of the official opposition is that Canadians should never be 
subjected to the abuses of power and summary treatment that has 
made the internal revenue service the most feared institution in 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a primary constraint on the abuse of a centralized tax 
collection power?  As proposed by my colleague from Calgary 
Southeast, the office for taxpayer protection represented by a 
chief advocate would have the power to issue taxpayer protection 
orders to protect taxpayers from arbitrary treatment or treatment 
that could lead to undue financial hardship.  The office of 
taxpayer protection would also have an ombudsman-like role with 
respect to assisting taxpayers in resolving disputes with the 
Canada customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who are concerned that this proposal would increase 
costs without any demonstrated benefit in terms of increased 
efficiencies in tax collection, I wish to point out that there is 
no intention to create another government bureaucracy in the 
office for taxpayer protection.  Rather, this office would be 
funded primarily from an appropriation to general revenues from 
Revenue Canada's current budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the taxpayer rights that are being referenced in the 
proposed taxpayer's bill of rights some of the more important 
dimensions concern circumstances where a taxpayer acted in good 
faith and without the intention to evade taxes, which are more or 
less synonymous terms.  Another circumstance is where a taxpayer 
relied upon incorrect advice provided by a Revenue Canada 
official or an official of the Canada customs and revenue agency. 
In these circumstances penalties and interest otherwise payable 
must be waived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in cases where penalties and interest may cause 
severe financial hardship or in cases where reassessments can be 
proven to cause severe financial hardship, the Canada customs and 
revenue agency must make alternative payment arrangements.  This 
could be by way of negotiated repayment schedules or in certain 
cases abatements of amounts owed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many will argue that current tax practice incorporates these 
elements in any event.  So what is the problem?  The fact that 
tax collection practices in Canada are not regarded with great 
disfavour does not minimize the potential for future abuse.  By 
formalizing a good practice as a taxpayer right one is ensuring 
that a social good will be preserved, notwithstanding changes in 
governments or government debt positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area involving a particular compassion relates to the 
effects of the seizure of assets on employees or family members 
not involved with a particular tax transgression.  We know the 
actions of wrongdoers frequently have negative consequences far 
beyond their own persons.  Families can be destroyed by wrongful 
acts over which they have little or no control.  The sensitivity 
of the tax department in this area is a matter of discretion on 
the part of particular officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is proposed under the taxpayer's bill of rights is that the 
office of taxpayer protection can advocate fairness in seizure 
practices, making a protection order, for example, in cases where 
undue hardship is caused to third parties.  In a general sense 
the office of taxpayer protection acts as an intervener and 
moderator with respect to government seizure practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that the official opposition's concerns primarily 
relate to the protection of individual taxpayer rights. No one, 
absolutely no one, can be seen to be an advocate of letting those 
who justly owe taxes to the government avoid their obligations to 
pay such tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate the hon. member for Prince Albert on his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke about the need for greater accountability. 
Has he, in his now 14 months as a member of this place, received 
any case files or complaints from constituents that would lead 
him to believe there is a need for greater accountability of 
Revenue Canada?  Or, do his constituents believe that everything 
is just hunky-dory over there and that we can just plough along 
with the status quo with a mega-tax collection bureaucracy that 
has really no presumption of innocence for taxpayers and which 
tends to shoot first and then ask questions?

thoughts of his constituents with respect to the accountability 
of Revenue Canada and whether it does indeed overreach its very 
considerable police powers in occasionally harassing law-abiding 
and well intentioned taxpaying citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have had bad 
experiences.  Some have had better experiences and some have not, 
which illustrates the need for taxpayer protection provision in 
the new act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because these responsibilities are going to be transferred to an 
arm's length agency, we are certain to see cases increasing where 
arbitrary decisions are going to happen.  Rather than having some 
on and some off, we should have legislation in place that allows 
the individual taxpayer to know what his or her rights are and to 
know that there is an ombudsman like person there to interpret 
his rights and to make sure they are fairly and evenly applied 
across the board. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was in the House earlier today and heard the Minister 
of National Revenue talk about Canadians gladly and voluntarily 
complying with the tax forms they have to fill out and the wise 
management of the taxes collected by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quickly ask my colleague whether he would agree 
with the Minister of National Revenue that the government is 
currently managing the tax dollars taken from Canadians in a wise 
way?  Would this lead us to believe that this super agency with 
extensive powers being contemplated would in any way be a wiser 
way to manage Canadian hard earned tax dollars that the 
government continues to take? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party puts out 
a frequent publication called “The Waste Report” which talks 
about how our tax dollars are handled. I bring to the attention 
of every member of this House that it is available from our 
revenue critic.  Members can supply them to all their 
constituencies.  Liberal members are also welcome to have them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The collection of tax dollars is one thing which really 
frustrates people when the get “The Waste Report” or reports 
from the Canadian Taxpayers' Federation outlining how their tax 
dollars are frequently abused. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest all day to members talking on 
this bill.  It was a little humourous to hear some members 
talking about how Canadians cheerfully pay their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was thinking about my last trip home when somebody opened a 
letter from Revenue Canada at the post office.  They owed 
something like an addition $600.  I assure members they did not 
say “goody, I owe the government another $600”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address this point in particular to the member for 
Ottawa West who spoke earlier.  She said we need better service. 
I believe she used the word service about eight times while she 
was speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Service has a connotation of servant.  The IRS in the United 
States had to look at its whole department and say it has to 
become more humane in dealing with people.  If there is one 
lesson that human resources needs, even if this bill goes 
through, it is to treat the taxpayers of this country with a 
great deal more respect than it does at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fallacy beyond comparison for members of the government 
to say they handle people and it is cheerfully done.

take a lesson in public relations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague.  I do not think it is up to the government to be 
delivering lectures to its people on arrogance when we see the 
arrogance of the Liberal government at the top.  It flows down. 
It does not come up.  It comes down.  Leadership starts at the 
top in that chair over there.  We can see it in what I said 
earlier about the appointment of a Progressive Conservative from 
a province that does not know what a federal Progressive 
Conservative looks like. They have forgotten their faces and 
names.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to lend my support to Bill C-43, an act to establish 
the Canada customs and revenue agency and to amend and repeal 
other acts as a consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked to speak on this because I want to talk a little about 
the finance and administration aspects of the proposal to create 
this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada customs and revenue agency, while acquiring many new 
powers and responsibilities in areas such as human resources 
management, will still be a department from a standpoint of 
financial management.  That is a very important aspect.  What is 
happening is that a government department is becoming a 
government agency.  Yet the controls and the many other aspects 
of it are identical to what was in place as a department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will operate under the authority of the Financial 
Administration Act.  It will be governed by the policies and 
procedures of the Treasury Board and the receiver general with 
respect to matters of financial management and the treatment of 
public money. The agency's financial statements will also be 
prepared in accordance with standard government accounting 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget of the Canada customs and revenue agency will still 
have to be approved by part of the government's overall 
expenditures management system.  It will be subject to the normal 
Treasury Board approval process and will be subsequently approved 
by parliament. That is very important for Canadians to 
understand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament will continue to receive the same level of detail 
from this agency as it does from Revenue Canada and although the 
board of management of the agency will be responsible for 
determining terms and conditions of employment at the agency, the 
overall human resource cost will still have to remain within 
Treasury Board approved financial levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To repeat, although the human resources component will be 
centred within the agency, the same scrutiny and criteria will be 
applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The obvious question about the new agency is what about the new 
sources of revenue such as user fees?  I think it is an area of 
concern to Canadians whenever they hear user fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple answer is there will be no change in the way user 
fees will be prescribed and administered.  I think Canadians 
should be assured by the fact that there will be no new user fees 
as a result of this change, that the fundamental reasons for this 
change are directed at efficiency, productivity and cost 
effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, user fees that are charged now represent less than 1% 
of the department's overall budget and the new agency will 
continue to charge these user fees.  It is not the intention of 
the agency to convert into one that is totally or even 
considerably reliant on this form of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is not to take more money out of the pockets of 
Canadians but rather to return it to them in the form of lower 
costs for compliance and through other forms of savings.  The 
agency will be funded in a way that Revenue Canada is funded 
today, namely by parliamentary appropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One possible new source of income for the agency could be some 
form of financial arrangement with a province or territory to 
administer a particular program or to institute a new process or 
procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the composition and skill of the board of 
management which is proposed under the act will come into play in 
terms of negotiating appropriate financial arrangements for new 
programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces and territories will obviously invest their money 
where they can achieve real savings from central administration 
of a program.  Program results will have to be monitored, 
including, most important to Canadians, levels of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new one time costs of moving the agency status will be 
included in the overall cost structure of the agency so that 
Canadians should be assured that there is no significant 
additional cost in establishing this agency and that it will be 
done within the overall cost structure being proposed for the 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is anticipated that these costs will be minimal 
relative to the overall operating budget of the existing 
department and will be offset with planned savings of the new 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with transferring a function from a department of 
government to an agency of government.  We are dealing with the 
concepts of accessibility, responsiveness, reliability of 
service, efficiency and effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two main points are that this agency will more effectively 
co-ordinate federal and provincial revenue collection programs, 
reduce overlap and duplication and therefore reduce costs and 
reduce taxpayer costs of complying with the tax laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second theme is that it will modernize its internal 
management to be more responsive to the needs and requirements of 
Canadians.  This board of management will ensure a client 
oriented approach and still maintain accountability to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In brief, I believe this fairly and accurately reflects the 
intent and the effect of Bill C-43 with regard to this new 
agency.  I hope all hon. members will support conceptually the 
principles being offered here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really would like to make some comments with regard to the 
previous speaker's statements about the Senate of Canada, 
certainly an area which has been under much scrutiny for many 
years. I would like to pose for him some facts I have thought 
about quite a bit, about what happens if we did move to an 
elected Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is interesting that although the Senate is an 
integral part of parliament, the concern about whether it is an 
elected body and whether it is able to discharge its 
responsibilities continues to come up.  It is a subject of 
debate. I would pose this as a rhetorical question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was an election, as there was previously in Alberta and 
which I understand cost the Alberta taxpayers $2 million, there 
would be a significant cost of conducting the election which 
would be borne ostensibly by the taxpayers through taxpayers 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all hon. members know, senators do not have constituency 
offices across the country.  They do have offices here.  If they 
were elected and had a constituency, would we have to provide 
constituency offices for them as well as the support staff and 
all the other costs associated with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question I have is how we would differentiate between 
the responsibilities of members of parliament and senators if 
they are elected from within the same geographic area.  Since 
there are 301 members of parliament and just over 100 senators, 
it means a senator's geographic area or population coverage would 
be three times that of an MP.  Would that mean that the senator 
would have to handle three times the workload that we handle 
right now?  I am not sure whether it is really possible. Those 
are some of my thoughts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is an important aspect but I think at this point with 
regard to Bill C-43, the important thing is that we do have a 
parliamentary system and we do have a committee that is going to 
deal with this.  All members will have an opportunity to debate 
again at report stage and third reading as well as to have input 
on other aspects through the committee process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To dwell on the possibility that the Senate is somehow going to 
act in some particular way, this is our system of parliament. One 
way to deal with it is to complain about it.  The other way is 
perhaps to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to end my comments because I have a feeling there may 
be a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will go now to 
questions and comments.  Just before we do, I would like to take 
a moment to point out that we are talking about the Revenue 
Canada bill.  Although there has been a fair amount of latitude 
in this debate, let us try to keep our comments about the Senate 
to an absolute minimum.  We are talking about this bill.  I 
appreciate the fact that it was not the member for Mississauga 
South that introduced it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without any further adieu we will go now to the member for 
Calgary Southeast and then to the Bloc. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will take your words of caution with respect to relevance 
advisedly as you did of course allow the hon. member to pose 
certain rhetorical questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply say that the member suggests that rather than 
talking about parliamentary reform, one ought to do something 
about it. This is precisely what the people of Alberta are doing 
in the process of selecting their next senator.  With respect to 
the cost objection that the member raises, yes democracy does 
cost something. I know the people of Alberta, 92% of them, are 
prepared to incur some small cost to be able to hold their 
representative accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason they want their representatives accountable in the 
Senate and in this place is precisely because we have enormous 
powers, powers such as the power to tax which is really the power 
to destroy.  Too often it is a power that is abused.  Too often 
the tax collection agents at Revenue Canada treat taxpayers as 
though they are guilty until proven innocent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not support a statute which would more 
clearly define the rights under due process of taxpayers to be 
given the presumption of innocence in the collection and 
assessment process?  Would the member not think it would be a 
worthwhile complement to this bill for such a taxpayer bill of 
rights to be passed, essentially to enshrine in law the current 
declaration of taxpayers' rights which is really a statement of 
good intentions?  Does the member not think this would be a 
worthwhile proposition to support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting point. 
We do have laws in Canada, tax laws and other laws. What we 
expect of our various departments which are responsible for the 
administration and enforcement of those laws is that the laws are 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most members know that when a case comes to our office, it is 
not people who have filed clean returns or who have done 
something in accordance with the tax provisions, it is usually 
people who have been assessed for legitimate reasons. 
I think the most important job we do is to ensure that they are 
put in the position that they should have been in, had all things 
been done the way they should be done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised 
to hear government members describing Bill C-43 as a change of 
very little consequence overall.  We are told that it merely 
involves transferring certain applications to collection and 
certain functions from a department to an agency, with no real 
impact on individual members of the public, on workers and 
public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In late August, I was fortunate to be able to meet with tax 
collection employees in Shawinigan, Quebec, to talk about a 
completely different area in which the government has outdone 
itself with its incompetence, namely pay equity.  The public 
servants described the position in which they found themselves. 
Some employees came to see me and reminded me of the upcoming 
Bill C-43 and how they were counting on the Bloc Quebecois to 
intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member opposite is aware that 20% of 
public servants will no longer be covered by the Public Service 
Employment Act, meaning that, in two years, the agency will have 
carte blanche to raise or lower salaries, to hire or fire 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if this is not the real reason that the 
government created the agency.  Does the government prefer 
strong-arm tactics that will ultimately crush employees' 
collective demands? That is my question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with regard to the pay 
equity component, that is not a fair reflection of the government 
position. In fact, the government not only has offered some 
moneys but also has already paid additional moneys into the pay 
equity settlement.  The issue right now is the final amount and 
whether or not it is equitable relative to private sector 
settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the human resources component of the new agency, 
I do not share the member's cynicism.  This is a joint program 
between the federal government and the provinces.  We are working 
together, co-operating and collaborating so that we can achieve a 
number of things, not only efficiency in the whole system but 
more importantly, to provide more cost effective service, at 
lower cost to Canadians with regard to Revenue Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are many reasons for 
moving to a departmental agency, none more important than the 
demands of our clients, the constituents of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Streamlined and more responsive tax, customs and trade 
administration services will provide more effectiveness with this 
new agency.  Few Canadians appreciate that in a time of economic 
expansion the demand for tax, customs and trade services also 
increases.  A million new jobs in Canada since 1993 mean many 
more tax filers and hopefully more in the future. An 8.6% 
increase in real exports in 1997 coupled with a 13.4% increase in 
real imports means a substantial increase in the demand for trade 
administration and customs and border services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resources at Revenue Canada have remained relatively stable 
during this period of economic expansion and steep increases in 
business volumes. Much of the new demand has been accommodated by 
internal operating efficiencies.  But as everybody knows, 
everything has a limit.  Hence the new framework for this agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency model we are proposing for the Canada customs and 
revenue agency is unique since it combines the strengths of both 
the public and private sectors while remaining fully accountable 
to parliament and the Canadian people.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 will permit the agency to offer new and better 
services to the provinces and territories.  For example, at the 
present time Revenue Canada can only collect provincial taxes 
that are harmonized with federal taxes.  The new agency would be 
able to collect non-harmonized taxes.  This would expand the 
potential for single window tax collection with considerable 
savings for businesses and individual Canadians. Greater 
co-ordination between the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments will simplify tax administration for Canadians and 
reduce the overlap and duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the various needs of Canadians are given full 
consideration, a board of management of the agency will direct 
its management activities and oversee its business planning. The 
board will include 10 directors nominated by the provinces and 
one director nominated by the territories, all from the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major change that would allow the new agency to adopt a 
more client oriented approach is increased operational 
flexibility in the management of internal resources.  The new 
legislation will allow the proposed agency to tailor its human 
resources and administrative functions to meet the changing needs 
of the client as well as those of its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, under the current status as a department, Treasury 
Board negotiates collective agreements and determines 
classifications for personnel.  The Public Service Commission is 
responsible for the staffing process.  Under departmental agency 
status, the Canada customs and revenue agency will assume 
responsibility for these critical functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change will offer the agency more flexibility in attracting 
certain in demand skills such as auditors and computer systems 
experts, training, retraining and keeping these experts. It will 
significantly reduce hiring times and allow the agency to match 
resources to work demands whether created by policy or by program 
changes, seasonal factors or general economic conditions.  All of 
this means improved service to the provinces and territories, to 
businesses and to individual Canadians. An improved service means 
savings in time and money, savings in compliance costs for 
businesses and savings in administrative costs for the government 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In creating the Canada customs and revenue agency, we are 
encouraged by the experience of many other countries such as the 
United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.  Organizations that 
have been given greater managerial autonomy and operational 
flexibility provide improved service to the public even while 
retaining accountability to the public and its elected 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a world that is competitive at many levels.  We live 
in a world that is changing.  Businesses and individuals need 
their governments to support their activities rather than to set 
up roadblocks.  The Canada customs and revenue agency is an 
important step in the process of providing the best tax, customs 
and trade administration services in the world.  This will mean 
more business and more benefits for all Canadians and looking to 
the future, to make it even better.

the member is coming from with respect to the various reports 
that were compiled during the consultation periods.  That is one 
of the reasons this government has taken excessive consultation 
time to meet and review with people and to hear what people are 
saying about the reports.  When we have a chance to present 
legislation we take all of these items into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the member opposite that a number of people,

has taken to consult on this bill that perhaps they have not done 
a good job of selling the proposals?   Today, with the bill in 
its current form, the majority of the provinces have not 
definitely said whether they will be on board.  We have not heard 
from the largest provinces as to whether they will be coming on 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that perhaps what we have to do is 
call in some super salesmen to sell it to the provinces now, 
before the legislation is put in place, to avoid each province 
having to negotiate changes within the act to suit it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Madam Speaker, I understand where the 
member is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind this House that provincial ministers of finance 
were a part of the consultation process.  Many provinces have 
provided input.  The member opposite will be able to provide 
input.  There is always room to make improvements.  That is why 
we are here debating the bill.  We are here to look at the 
legislation as well as other things.  It is not a one way street. 
One cannot just sit over there and oppose everything.  One has 
to be constructive from time to time.  That is what committees 
are for.

Canada customs and revenue agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start, I know I will probably not have enough time to 
finish my remarks.  I hope to have the opportunity to continue 
when we next examine this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would begin by congratulating my colleague, the member for 
Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, for his good work.  I heard his speech this 
morning, in which he presented a whole series of arguments.  I 
felt the agency served some purpose, but was not relevant 
because a department of revenue already exists.  My colleague's 
arguments were well founded. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the member for Rivière-des-Mille-Îles has shown how 
attuned he is to his constituents and to the groups concerned by 
these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us talk of the government's objectives in the 1996 
throne speech.  The first objective was to provide programs and 
services more effectively and cost efficiently through greater 
autonomy and flexibility.  I want to focus on the words “more 
effectively and cost efficiently”.  I think everyone agrees on 
“cost efficiently”.  The more it brings in, the more it is in 
the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have a few questions about the “more effectively”. 
The understanding is more effectively than at present. 
At the present time, those responsible for tax collection are 
employees of Revenue and Customs, in other words public 
servants.  I am told there are about 18,000.  There is a message 
in this.  Is it being implied that the 18,000 people assigned to 
taxation are not efficient and are not doing their job properly 
so that it will be cost-effective?  The government has presented 
this as its first objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not surprising, when one realizes that the tendency 
within this government is a desire to privatize.  This is 
something to be considered per se, but what is involved is a 
service that is already provided.  It is not a new service, but 
one already being provided.  The agency will not be totally 
privatized, but it will not be covered by the legislation which 
governs, and will continue to govern, all other public servants 
at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to worry people needlessly.  I do not even need to 
do so, anyway, because I have seen a letter to the hon. member 
for Rivière-des-Milles-Îles by the taxation employees' union.  They 
are all worried about this.  They wonder what might happen to 
them.  Behind it all lies the fear of being shunted aside. 
Perhaps a number of them may be hired again by the new agency, 
but they do need reassurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second was to improve services—and who could be against 
that—and to reduce the cost of administering revenue and 
compliance by working in conjunction with the provinces in order 
to eliminate duplication and overlap.  The key words in this are 
“working in conjunction with the provinces”.  The concept of 
“co-operation” is understood.  Generally, the purpose is 
harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Working in co-operation” is all very fine-sounding and is a good 
objective as far as it goes.  But what is actually happening? 
When we check with each of the provinces, not just Quebec, they 
say they are not in agreement and that, before they sign on, 
they will want to give it some thought because they are not at 
all sure this is a good thing.  How can the government get away 
with saying in the throne speech that it will be done in 
co-operation with the provinces, when the provinces are not in 
fact interested in working together in this context, since they 
are apparently going to lose their powers, especially Quebec, 
because Quebec has its own revenue ministry.  Moreover, it is 
the only province that does, having had one for a very long 
time.  In this regard, Quebec wants to keep its powers and its 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third objective was mentioned, which we no longer hear 
anything about today, but which was in the throne speech: 
“Strengthen the federation's effectiveness and enhance national 
unity by making the agency an organization responsible for 
providing Canadians with federal and provincial services”.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this was first announced, it obviously resulted in some 
discussion here in the House and elsewhere.  We in the Bloc 
Quebecois, and Quebeckers in general, reacted back then, and we 
feel no differently now. Except that we notice that the 
government members no longer mention this objective.  But once 
bitten, twice shy.  Just because the government no longer 
mentions this third objective from the throne speech does not 
mean it is no longer guided by it.  These were statements of 
principle, the government's intentions and policies until the 
next throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This objective no doubt remains.  In my opinion, it is part of 
the current Liberal government's plan A, because, while it is a 
gentle approach and not a stick, it remains a tendency of the 
current federal government, which tries to meddle in provincial 
matters and increasingly expand its control over them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But with the creation of this agency, it is not doing so 
directly, but indirectly, rather as it did with the millennium 
scholarships.  Members remember the famous millennium 
scholarship fund.  The federal government could not do it 
directly, so it set up a private foundation, an agency of sorts, 
to do indirectly what it could not do directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am no lawyer, but I know the public is discouraged from 
indirectly contravening legal provisions.  The same is not true 
for the government.  It sets up agencies, it takes an indirect 
and convoluted approach to achieve its ends. 
Even though it is no longer raising the issue of so called 
national unity, the federal government, in the end, wants to 
collect taxes and take over the mechanisms that bring in new 
revenues with an independent agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a sovereignist.  I do not hide the fact.  Neither do the 
member for Rivière-des-Mille-Îles or the members of the Bloc. 
However, we are still in the federal system.  The people in the 
other parties, whom I respect, have another opinion. They are 
federalists and want to stay within the federal system.  They 
often consult the Constitution.  I too have read it.  We know 
about the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know its history and the facts surrounding it.  In 1867, 
when Canada's Constitution was drafted and passed, those who 
have studied it will recall that the federal government did not 
collect taxes from either individuals or companies.  The 
provincial governments did. 
It was during the two world wars—the 1914-18 one and the 1939-45 
one—that the federal government asked the provincial 
governments, in the light of the exceptional circumstances, to 
allow it to collect income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently, having tasted the pleasure of collecting taxes, 
the government wanted to continue.  Ontario finally agreed, but 
Mr. Duplessis, who was then Premier of Quebec, created his own 
department of revenue.  That is the history of the two tax 
returns: one for the federal government and one for Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 1 consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member for 
Prince George—Peace River has six minutes remaining. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, how did I manage that?  I have never spoken to this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would ask the hon. 
member to start the debate right away.  In the meantime the clerk 
will check the records for the last session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to 
rise this afternoon and briefly address Motion No. 318 placed 
before the House by my colleague from Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 318 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation making the tax deduction for contributions to 
charitable organizations no less than the tax deduction for 
contributions to political parties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to flip that motion around and stand it on its head, 
it would really state that gifts to political parties should not 
be given more favourable treatment than donations to charities. 
That is how we need to look at this motion. The intent is clear. 
It is to level the playing field between donations to political 
parties and those which accrued to charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compare this motion to the Reform blue book policy that deals 
with political donations. There has been some concern expressed 
about that and why my esteemed colleague would bring forward a 
motion that on the surface would seem to be contrary to Reform's 
blue book policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform policy in the blue book under the heading of electoral 
reform states: “The Reform Party opposes any assistance to 
political parties and political lobbies from public funds 
including—” and it lists a number of things.  In that list is 
tax credits for contributions to federal political parties.  That 
is the policy of the Reform Party.  Certainly it is a policy that 
my Reform colleague adheres to, as do I.  If we were ever to 
become government, or when we become government, we will enact 
that as well as a number of other policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, it has become painfully clear to charities that 
this government does not intend to address the inequity between 
the donations to political parties and those to charities by 
removing the tax incentive to donate to political parties, as the 
Reform Party would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore my colleague took it on himself to bring forward 
Motion No. 318 which would level the playing field between the 
two and treat them the same. Unfortunately we see that in some 
cases people who are looking at making a donation might be 
encouraged to make a donation to political party rather than to 
the charity of their choice.  It is very unfortunate that they 
might tempted to do that because the tax incentive is so much 
greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How unfair is the present system?  It was noted in the debate 
last spring that for a $100 dollar contribution to a political 
party a donor will receive a $75 federal tax credit. For a $100 
donation we have a 75% tax credit.  For a $100 gift to a charity 
the donor will receive a $17 federal charitable donation tax 
credit.  That is $17 versus $75.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To receive a tax credit of $500 for a donation to a federal 
political party an individual would have to give $1,150, and to 
receive that same $500 tax credit a donation to a registered 
charity would have to be in the amount of $1,807.90. Clearly a 
gross inequity exists.  My colleague is attempting to address 
that by putting forward Motion No. 318. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would interest the viewing public at this point in 
the debate to ask what are we talking about here.  How many 
charities are we talking about?  There are roughly 80,000 
registered charities in Canada and in 1996, 5,451,860 donors gave 
approximately $4 billion.  We are talking about a substantial 
industry, as it were, in the sense of charitable organizations. 
They employ a lot of people and they certainly do lots of good 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Chair is telling me I have one minute left.  I must 
have spoken on this issue previously.  I thank the Chair for the 
correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On such an important motion I could go on at great length but I 
will sum up by stating the obvious.  This motion is votable.  It 
is not too often that members of this place have a great 
opportunity to right an injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we come to vote on Motion No. 318 we can seize the 
opportunity and vote to level the playing field and treat both 
these things the same.  I urge all members of the House to do 
exactly that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this motion put 
forward by my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion provides us with an opportunity to make a number of 
appropriate comments around the whole issue of charities.  As the 
previous speaker indicated, we are talking about 80,000 
organizations which have been identified as legitimate charities 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of a charity needs some work.  I think the 
definition we use goes back many decades and I suspect that the 
nature of charity and charity work in Canada has changed 
significantly from the 1920s and 1930s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we can say is the recent years of government deficit 
fighting efforts have really hit charities hard. Charities in 
Canada now unfortunately have to designate an inappropriate 
amount work by volunteers simply pursuing fundraising activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all appreciate that those who volunteer and those who 
work for charities are really those people who weave the social 
fabric of which we are so proud in our country.  These are the 
people who donate their time, effort, energy, talents and in many 
cases money to enable these charities to provide the services 
that hitherto governments often provided. Because of the 
reduction in government services, because of the downsizing of 
government, because of the trimming of government budgets, we now 
are looking toward charity organizations to pick up that void and 
to provide more services than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit disappointing to read the information that has been 
provided in terms of charitable donations.  They are at a virtual 
standstill. The growth simply is not there. The Canadian Centre 
for Philanthropy says that we have to find ways and means to 
encourage more Canadians to participate in the development of the 
social and supportive caring fabric of our country through 
charity giving.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Standing Committee on Finance made the following 
recommendation: “Government should consider enhancing the 
charitable tax credit for donations to charities currently funded 
by government to make it as generous as the current political tax 
credit for small donations to political parties”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us acknowledge the fact that in our effort as a country, 
which I support enthusiastically and which I endorse, we 
encourage people to participate in the democratic process.  There 
is no question that for a democracy to work effectively, people 
have to participate as directly as possible.  Therefore, as we 
all know, for a $100 contribution to a political party in Canada 
the donor will receive a $75 tax credit.  That is a real 
incentive for average men and women across the country to make 
donations to the political party of their choice.  We endorse 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, I think it is fair to say that when we look at the 
political contributions to at least some of the political 
parties, a massive number of Canadians participate in supporting 
the political party of their choice as a result of this rather 
encouraging tax write-off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation making the tax deduction for contributions to 
charitable organizations no less than the tax deduction for 
contributions to political parties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support that principle.  As other speakers have indicated, 
Motion No. 318 does not specifically recommend that the 
government increase the tax credit for donations to charities 
from 17% as it is now to 75%, although this is an option. 
Rather, it allows the government to use its discretion to choose 
the optimal tax credit rates, making sure the charity tax credit 
is no less than the political tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to flag a concern at this point.  I know this is votable. 
I want to indicate an area that I think deserves consideration. 
Representing the voices of the New Democratic Party, we are not 
suggesting that the level of political contribution should be 
reduced, but we are saying that the deduction for giving to 
charities should be increased to that same level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about those that are the weavers of our social 
fabric and now we look more and more to those in the charity 
sector and the volunteer sector to provide that level of service. 
We think it is appropriate to re-examine this whole issue.  I 
think all of us would say that 17% is simply inadequate, that it 
does not reflect the reality of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it appropriate that people who donate their energies to the 
charity of their choice spend such an inappropriate amount of 
time raising funds? I do not think an evening goes past now when 
in our places of residence here in the nation's capital or back 
in our own constituencies there is not a knock at the door from 
someone raising money.  Sometimes three or four times in the 
evening there is a knock on the door and somebody is asking for a 
donation to a particularly worthy cause or a worthy initiative or 
a worthy endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You make the contributions because you realize that if you do 
not, that person will not be able to carry out the charitable 
work they wish to do.  But it troubles me that that person has to 
spend that evening going door to door raising funds and not out 
providing the service or doing the charitable work that person is 
actually interested in.  They do not join these organizations to 
go on fundraising activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a step forward.  I think it is a step in the 
right direction.  That is why I say on behalf of those of us in 
the New Democratic Party that we are pleased to support this 
initiative by my colleague for Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not suggesting that we reduce the tax deductions 
available for political contributions but that we enhance those 
associated with charitable giving.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about the simplicity of the matter.  We 
have to acknowledge that there are two sets of rules: one for 
charities and one for political parties.  Therefore, if the tax 
system treated political parties and charities equally the system 
would be simpler to explain, certainly a lot simpler to write and 
a lot simpler to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing we should strive for as parliamentarians 
during these complex and changing times.  We look at tax forms 
and shudder and dread the day we have to sit down at a table to 
try to figure them out, fill them out, or dread the day we have 
to hire an accountant to do that on our behalf.  We have to 
struggle to make such forms simpler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would move us in the direction of simplifying the tax 
return and making it equivalent in terms of whether one is making 
a political contribution or a contribution to one of Canada's 
worthy charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a big business.  It is a $4 billion business annually.  We 
are talking about a considerable amount of money relatively 
speaking.  We have to acknowledge that this unfortunately is a 
growing trend, that more and more the realities of our fiscal 
programs suggest that charities will be providing those necessary 
and crucial services in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always relied on charities, but changing times make them 
even more important today.  It is with enthusiasm that we support 
the motion.  We are looking forward to the vote and we are 
looking forward to seeing legislation move through this House and 
subsequently on to the other place, and the sooner the better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate 
on Motion No. 318.  I will begin by taking a few minutes to 
respond on behalf of the government to the motion put forward by 
the member for Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The government recognizes the motivation for 
the hon. member's motion and fully supports the principle of 
offering generous tax assistance to charitable giving.  The 
purpose of the present tax regime with respect to charitable 
giving is to encourage larger donations.  The current tax regime 
was put into place in consultation with the charity industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the work and assistance of the Standing Committee on 
Finance stemming over a period of four years of prebudget 
hearings, the tax treatment of charitable donations has evolved 
to the point where we are now beginning to see a stronger and 
more vibrant charity industry.  That is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the government has provided additional incentives to 
charitable giving in four of the last five federal budgets. 
Measures have been included and adopted.  The first is lowering 
the threshold for eligibility for the 29% level of the tax credit 
to $200 from $150.  The second is raising the annual income limit 
for the use of charitable donations to most charities from 20% 
when the government took office to 75%.  The third is reducing 
the income inclusion rate for capital gains arising from the 
donation of appreciated publicly traded securities to 37.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures are very important.  The hon. member should 
recognize that the differences in the treatment of political 
contributions and charitable donations reflect the different 
policy intentions of the two measures.  The design of the federal 
political contributions tax credit reflects the desire to 
encourage greater grassroots involvement by all Canadians in the 
political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason generous tax assistance is given to small 
political contributions.  This tax assistance is reduced by 
incremental amounts to the point that federal tax assistance is 
eliminated for amounts contributed to federal political parties 
in excess of $1,150 per contributor per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, tax assistance for charitable donations is greater 
for amounts in excess of $200 in order to encourage larger 
donations to charities.  This type of larger scale giving allows 
for a greater measure of stability and predictability for those 
charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed in the case of very large donations tax credits may be 
claimed for donations up to 75% of the taxpayer's income in any 
given year.  Tax credits then may be carried forward to future 
years should the 75% limit be exceeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we have witnessed the important role the present tax 
regime has played in charitable giving. 
The charitable industry has reported seeing more large scale 
donations from individuals than ever before.  In particular, it 
has witnessed this trend following the implementation of the 1997 
budget which contained provisions allowing for reduced taxation 
of capital gains on publicly traded shares given to registered 
charities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested recently in reading in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
that they called this tax change, which effectively cut in half 
the capital gains tax that donors pay on such gifts, a bonanza 
for the charity industry.  The University of Toronto, for 
example, has received more than 70 individual contributions of $1 
million or greater during its current fundraising drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gorden Floyd, director of public affairs at the Canadian Centre 
for Philanthropy, recently stated that the charities have “all 
seen a real surge in major gifts or stock since the legislation 
change.  It is important to see that take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meg Beckel, executive director of the Royal Ontario Museum 
Foundation, has also noted an increase in tax driven gifts to 
charities, particularly from new beneficiaries.  He states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997 we have received gifts from individuals in the form of 
shares that we would not have otherwise received. It has made a 
real difference. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incentives for large scale giving also have borne fruit in 
terms of a new community foundation movement which is a 
collection of endowment funds committed to local projects.  A 
coalition of leaders heading up this movement recently announced 
in Calgary that its collective assets are now worth more than $1 
billion.  This announcement is clearly good news for communities. 
I think that is something with which all of us in the House can 
agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These foundations tend to fill a unique need in that they are 
funded locally in their base projects in the community and in the 
country in almost every province.  Gifts to such foundations can 
be allocated in many ways including a general community fund or a 
specific cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little more than a week ago members of a youth advisory 
committee from the Calgary Foundation announced a series of 
grants that they were being awarded including $1,000 to a high 
school program that helps with the integration of immigrants and 
$500 to a Hispanic youth centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of community action by these foundations is very 
encouraging, helping to reinforce in our collective notion the 
relevance and importance of community in an increased and ever 
globalized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see from these examples the tax regime that has been put 
into place has been working to maximize the benefits of 
charitable giving both for individuals and for charities in the 
important work that they carry out.  Charities have mushroomed 
into an $88 billion affair spreading through 76,000 organizations 
ranging from hospitals to houses of worship, to social services. 
There are another 100,000 not for profit agencies as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By any measurement that we might choose this industry has been 
growing more important and stronger every year under the present 
tax structure.  While we have seen that large scale giving has 
been greatly affected by tax incentives, we have also found that 
the donation of small amounts to charities has not been strongly 
motivated by the availability of tax assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently the greatest effect of this proposal before the 
House would be to increase the fiscal cost of tax assistance 
according to donations that would in all likelihood have been 
made in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one further and important note: the level of tax 
assistance accorded most charitable donations results in a 
roughly 50:50 partnership between government and the private 
sector in support of charities.  That is important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is consistent with the principle that although charities 
promote the public good they have direct control over their 
activities in these areas and their priorities will not generally 
be identical to those of government.  Increasingly tax assistance 
for small donations would not have been in accordance with this 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot support the motion for the following 
central reason.  The current design of the current charitable 
donations tax credit acts to encourage larger donations while 
recognizing the value of smaller donations.  The greatest impact 
of the motion would be to increase tax assistance accorded to 
donations that would have been made in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to simply say that tax assistance accorded 
charitable donations as we have seen by the growth of the 
industry is already very generous.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member opposite for bringing forward the motion

In that we all benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam, 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure to rise on behalf of my party to 
speak to Motion No. 318. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current Liberal government in power personal income 
taxes are among the highest in the industrialized world.  Quite 
frankly Canadian people are being taxed to death.  Even on such 
things as individual charitable donations the Canadian public is 
not given a break.  In the meantime the government has been 
cutting and slashing social investment grants and funding to 
charitable institutions to the extent that many have difficulty 
keeping their heads above water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of the motion before us is worth looking at.  The 
motion calls for the government to bring in legislation making 
the tax deduction for contributions to charitable organization no 
less than the tax deduction for contributions to political 
parties.  Presently, as has been stated by others this evening, 
if a donor contributes $100 to a political party he or she would 
receive a $75 federal tax credit.  The same individual who 
contributes $100 to the cancer society would only receive a $17 
federal tax credit.  That is the problem that the motion is 
attempting to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is cleverly worded, for the lack of a better 
expression.  Motion No. 318 does not specifically recommend that 
the government should increase the tax credit for donations to 
charities from 17% to 75% although this would be an option. 
Rather, it allows the government to use its discretion to choose 
optimal tax credit rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bit of a cop-out in terms of the motion before us. The 
motion is laudable and worth consideration, but it is obviously 
putting the onus back on the government.  Any motion should 
clearly define exactly what it is going to do, for obvious 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fashionable and almost honourable given the political 
atmosphere out there to attack politicians and political parties. 
We have a pretty good system of tax relief and tax credits for 
individuals who want to contribute to political parties.  The 
$100 donation winds up giving a $75 tax credit.  There is a lot 
of good in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another side of the argument says that could be and possibly 
should be reduced.  We do not want to fall into the same kind of 
political financing as has happened in the United States of 
America where $1 million campaigns are the order of the day and 
there is basically no limit on political financing.  In this 
country it is possible for ordinary Canadians to get elected and 
to contribute to political parties.  There is complete 
transparency in the process.  I do not want to see that 
diminished in any way and that is part of the consideration this 
evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A speaker from my party debated this issue a few months back. 
However, one component we do not want to overlook in this 
equation is the clambering for special tax status if this change 
ever came about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my Quebec colleague would agree with me.  How many of us 
in this House of Commons regardless of political party have been 
approached by groups that want special tax status as a charitable 
donation.  They want to be recognized as a charitable 
organization.  The line up would be endless if we changed the 
system significantly.  There would be so much clambering it would 
be unmanageable for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a danger in a wholesale change of the system.  That 
leads into the argument, and of course this was on debate today 
as well, about the Canadian tax system and the complexity of the 
Canadian tax code.  If the Canadian tax code were laid here next 
to me, it would dwarf me.  It is much taller than my six foot two 
inches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Canadian tax code is overly complex.  I do not think there 
is any one of us in this House that does not use the services of 
a professional accountant to do our income taxes at the end of 
the year.  I certainly have been using one for years.  Most of us 
do because of the complexity of it.  It is one of those things we 
no longer want to do ourselves for obvious reasons.  It goes 
right back to the word complexity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is interesting and quite humourous. It is an interesting 
reflection on the complexity of our tax code and why we are 
forced into hiring professionals to compile our taxes. I lent 
this line to the member for Kings—Hants who used it today in the 
House but I am taking credit for it as if I invented it.  The 
complexity of the tax code forces us to use professionals to 
compile our taxes for us.  They say that compiling our own tax 
returns is the only do it yourself project that could land us in 
jail if it is not done to perfection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we want any more complexity in the tax code. I 
think we would like to see a levelling of the playing field in 
the sense of charitable donations versus political donations, but 
it has to be thought through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts of the member have to be commended.  This goes 
beyond partisan politics.  I do not think there is a member on 
either side of this House who thinks government can be the be all 
and end all, the sort of blanket approach to curing all the ills 
of society.  We have to leave part of it up to charitable 
organizations in our hometowns, our churches, all the various 
organizations that do good across Canada each and every day.  We 
do not want to see that end.  We want to see that enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value in this member's motion is that if charitable 
associations were given better tax treatment, the resources and 
the money these organizations would have to help our friends, 
neighbours and often ourselves through those charitable donations 
would most likely increase.  That would be a good thing. It would 
take some of the onus off the government to do the very things 
that governments today are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the programs governments are engaged in from time to 
time in that blanket approach, and this government is no 
different, sometimes do not work.  What is good for Newfoundland 
sometimes is not good for British Columbia.  That is on any given 
day of the week.  That happens.  Quebec, Ontario or the rest of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organizations that deliver services best are usually the 
ones in our backyards.  We have to do everything possible to 
enhance that type of giving and that type of ownership of our 
hometowns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We commend the member.  He is on the right track. I would like 
to see this idea carried forward and the government come up with 
legislation that would address this inequity in our tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are prepared to support the motion.  The onus then goes back 
on the government to take this motion seriously and introduce tax 
law that would change the status quo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate in the second 
hour of our consideration of Motion No. M-318 introduced by the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley.  I remind the House of the motion 
we are debating, that in the opinion of this House the government 
should bring in legislation for making the tax deduction for 
contributions to charitable organizations no less than the tax 
deduction for contributions to political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a part of the charitable sector of our country for a 
lot longer than I have been a part of the political sector, so I 
speak to this motion with a degree of personal conviction and I 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of the history of our country and the large part 
charitable organizations have played in that history, for 
example, in the growth of hospitals and schools.  The community 
charity sector and the churches provided relief and assistance to 
those who were beyond their own means to look after themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all well aware of the enormous benefits all of our 
country derives from the generous contributions and the generous 
efforts of various charities and the people who support them.  To 
say these are not important is nonsense.  We cannot diminish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, St. Paul's hospital in Vancouver is a hospital that 
belongs to the Roman Catholic Church.  I am sure the church does 
not wish to do this but if it did it could remove those services. 
Here is an organization that has provided hospital care and 
educational facilities like schools for the full duration of our 
country's history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give a snapshot of charities in Canada, in 1996 nearly five 
and a half million people gave about $4 billion to the nearly 
80,000 registered charities in this country.  That is a lot of 
money.  Charitable organizations are major employers in Canada as 
well as major contributors.  They employ approximately a million 
people. We are not talking about an insignificant sector of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot fail to mention what it meant to charities when the 
government decided to cut back on the value of contributions by 
limiting the tax deductions available.  Speakers have mentioned a 
number of times that you get $75 out of $100 on your tax receipt 
for political purposes and a $17 receipt for a $100 contribution 
to a charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not speaking against political parties and the need for 
people to participate in the political life of our country.  This 
is important.  I do believe the Canadian people put a lot more 
emphasis upon the need for people to participate voluntarily in 
the lives of our communities. Tonight we are discussing an issue 
of participation, the avenues of participating and the 
willingness of the government to facilitate that participation 
through gifts and activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded that charities may be around knocking on doors for 
the money they need.  Often the money they use is simply to 
operate the machinery that provides an avenue for other people to 
contribute their time in large numbers of hours in a whole 
variety of ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities support a wide range of activities and provide a wide 
range of services, everything from health and welfare to 
athletics.  Their contribution to the quality of life of 
individuals and the community is greatly appreciated and proven.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would it be without those services that are given freely 
and generously by Canadians?  This is even more the case in 
today's world as most of us have had to tighten our belts.  We 
have seen this not only in our individual lives but governments 
in particular have had to change the way they spend public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a minister looking after a church and the needs of 
people in Vancouver, I was well aware of the consequences of the 
government's decision to take people out of the mental health 
institutions and move them supposedly to community based care. 
However, there was no community based care.  We found large 
numbers of people walking on the sidewalks unable to care for 
themselves.  And who but people like the volunteers, the Canadian 
Mental Health Association, the hospitals and the churches were 
able to look after these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that more people can give more money to charities. It 
has been mentioned that 75% of a person's income can be 
contributed to a charitable organization for a tax credit. 
However, how many people have it in their ability to contribute 
75% of their income? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who can, but these are not the people who get up 
in the morning and go to work every day. These are not the people 
who need to have all that they have to care for their children 
and families, to pay the mortgage and to look after their own 
immediate needs and if they are lucky, have a little bit left 
over to contribute to their favourite charity. Many people 
because they cannot contribute money, contribute time, but the 
time and the money go together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a red herring to suggest that the government has 
provided opportunities for people to contribute more and more 
generously, when in fact the government has limited these 
opportunities and provided opportunities for people who are 
wealthy and can do this.  In fact, the wealthier one is, the more 
one can contribute and the more benefits one can get for 
contributing.  However, this does not speak to the needs of the 
average man and woman, their families and their desire to 
participate freely and voluntarily in contributing their time and 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities have to work harder to ensure that people do not fall 
through the cracks.  With the lack of adequate funds, it is 
becoming increasingly difficult for them to do this.  This is why 
we see charities resorting to bingos and lotteries.  As well they 
send vehicles from door to door to pick recyclable items and use 
this as a means of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that for every 1% the government cuts from 
social service programs it takes an increase in donations to 
charities of nearly 6% to maintain the level of services. This 
increase is not happening.  The charities are not getting this 
kind of increase.  As a result, those who most require these 
services are not getting the assistance they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals who donate to specific charities also want to have a 
say in where their money is going.  This is not the same as when 
we hand over our money to the income tax department.  It takes it 
with very long teeth and with the threat that if we do not do it, 
we may go to jail or it may raid our bank accounts.  However, by 
giving to a specific charity we are supporting a self-approved 
activity and supporting a cause personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, governments must identify needs to allocate 
the necessary resources to meet those needs.  We know that needs 
to happen.  We also know that political parties need to have 
money for their members to participate in the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we are asking this House to approve this motion is 
that this type of participation is just as important in the 
charitable sector as it is in the political sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage hon. members in the House to vote for this 
motion, particularly those members of the government party who 
are thinking that they should vote against it because it is going 
to cut back on government resources for their programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, at 
first blush my constituents are probably sitting in their living 
rooms right now saying “This is a heck of a good idea”. I was 
sitting in the lobby and thinking, at first blush, “This is a 
really good idea.  Let us give those charitable donations more of 
a tax break than they currently get”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I looked at the proposal.  The proposal is being put 
forward by the member for Fraser Valley, a member of the Reform 
Party.  The bells started going off.  I began to think “What is 
it they want to do?”  At first blush my constituents would say 
to me “What they want to do is make the tax credit for 
charitable donations at least as generous as the credit accorded 
political contributions.  That is exactly what they want to do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not look at the mirror image of what they are 
proposing?  The Reform Party's selective use of the facts in any 
particular issue is what any opposition party relies on.  They 
rely on only telling so much.  If they tell more it makes things 
very difficult and they do not get the support they need on a 
particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the whole story, the whole situation when it 
comes to a tax credit, whether it is political or charitable.  I 
will tell this to my constituents because it is important.  Let 
us say that Stan Keyes received a $100,000 donation to his 
political campaign.  That is very generous.  I would appreciate 
it.  But the only tax relief they would receive on that $100,000, 
to a maximum, would be $1,150.  That is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same constituent could say that it was not enough to give 
money to Stan, that they would also like to give $100,000 to the 
St. Joseph's Hospital Foundation in my riding.  The Reform Party 
will not tell us that the tax credit they would receive on that 
donation would be far greater than they would receive giving the 
$100,000 to me.  That is right.  Even the members of the Reform 
Party are puzzled by this.  It is true.  A political donation of 
$100,000 gets a maximum tax credit of $1,150.  A $100,000 
donation to a charitable organization gets a far greater tax 
credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  It is because we encourage grassroots Canadians to 
donate money to their political parties on a much broader 
spectrum.  Let us get more people donating to political 
parties and friends in smaller amounts.  Let us ensure that 
people who are generous toward charitable organizations, like the 
St. Joseph's Hospital Foundation in my riding, are encouraged to 
give larger amounts so they also get a larger tax credit for 
doing that.  Does that not make sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the alarm bells go off in my head.  Why do we suppose that a 
party like Reform, which claims to be grassroots—and the Bloc 
can be lumped into this as well—said from the beginning that 
they wanted a lot of small donations?  They want those $10, $20 
and $30 donations from their grassroots supporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a motion from the Reform Party that proposes to make 
the tax credits for charitable donations as least as generous as 
political tax credits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at that mirror image I spoke of.  Now we see that 
the Reform Party is really after some equality with charitable 
donations in those bigger amounts of cash coming into its 
political coffers.  Now we get the picture. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not talking about “Let us help out those people”.  We 
are only talking about donations of up to $200.  That is all they 
are talking about.  That is suspicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the mirror effect of this?  The mirror effect is, if 
they are looking to have equality and simplify the tax system, 
they are looking for, dare I say on behalf of the Reform, larger 
political donations.  No, I would not want to say that, but let 
us have a look at exactly what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has always been supportive of enhancing 
tax assistance to the charitable sector.  He has always been 
there for them.  Consequently, the assistance given to the 
charitable sector has been enhanced.  I tell that to the hon. 
member from the Reform Party who has nothing better to do than 
stand in the House and yell at me.  During his speech I was 
quiet, but he has chosen to be very agitated about this.  I 
understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were out there asking the public to increase the amount of 
money they were going to give to me, and for that they would get 
a bigger tax break at the end of the day, I would be kind of 
embarrassed too.  I would be yelling at members opposite for 
pointing that out to my constituents who are watching tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the minister done?  The Minister of Finance has 
enhanced and assisted the charitable sector in every budget:  in 
the 1994 budget, in the 1995 budget, right up until this year's 
budget in 1998.  The relationship between government and the 
private sector in support of charities can be described as a 
50:50 partnership, although the level for tax assistance to 
donations by individuals is generally somewhat larger than 50% 
for cash donations, again I say above $200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I think many taxpaying Canadians out there would 
say that is very generous support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are saying the tax assistance provided through a 
federal tax credit of 17% on donations up to $200 and 29% on 
amounts in excess of $200 is generous.  They are quite satisfied. 
The application of the credit reduces basic federal tax, which in 
turn reduces a donor's provincial tax liabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the proposal being put forward by the member for 
Fraser Valley, I say it looks very level headed and it looks as 
though they really care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard some terrific speeches in the House tonight during 
Private Members' Business.  Those members are absolutely correct. 
Those charitable organizations out there doing the good work in 
our communities are most valued.  There is no question of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything this government can do to help those charitable 
donors it will do.  We are going to give them every assistance 
that we can possibly give them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Make the tax credit the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  The member opposite from the Reform Party 
says to make the tax credit the same.  He just did not get it, 
did he? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Reform Party, the government on this side of the 
House is trying to ensure that there is a balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  He laughs because he does not understand. 
I can understand that.  The Income Tax Act is a very complicated 
thing and the hon. member opposite is only going to look at this 
thing on the surface.  All he wants to see is a tax credit for 
everybody, whether it is a political or a charitable donation, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of this House to look a little deeper.  Look a 
little deeper at exactly what this bill proposes and look at the 
ramifications it would have if it were to be implemented, not at 
the up to $250, $300 or $500 range that the hon. members opposite 
are proposing, but at the larger end where the Reform really 
wants the big money, tax credited, coming into their pockets.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to make a couple of remarks that will be appropriate 
for the previous speaker, the member for Hamilton West.  He said 
we will help them.  Yet I read in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of 
February 6, 1996 that grants and other support from governments 
have been sharply reduced and sometimes eliminated entirely. We 
will help them all right. That is some help. That was the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons finance committee which tabled its 
prebudget report last month endorsed the viewpoint that growth in 
charitable donations is at a virtual standstill and new 
incentives are needed.  The finance committee which is chaired by 
a Liberal asked that the government consider enhancing the 
charitable tax credit for donations to charities currently funded 
by governments to make them as generous as the current political 
tax credit for small donations to political parties. We see that 
the Liberals' own committees are against what the previous 
speaker had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are the biggest beneficiaries of the current 
system, but I can assure members of one thing.  In my riding the 
Liberals will be the big losers under any system as they 
supported Bill C-68 in the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question now is who do we want to help in this country, the 
political system or the charitable system? I have worked with 
charities.  I have worked in government, as now, and I am not 
entirely convinced that we are doing the good that many of the 
charities do.  One thing is for certain.  I hear a lot of 
complaints about MP paycheques and other perks available to them 
but I do not hear anyone complaining about what charities get and 
do.  That says a lot to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are voting with their pocketbooks. They are voting to 
support charities at an extremely high level.  Why should 
charities be subject to discriminatory tax treatment?  Should 
this country not have one law for those who support volunteers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three out of fifty-two awards for caring Canadians were made to 
people from the riding of Prince Albert. That left only 49 for 
the entire rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes requested in the motion would do a lot of good in a 
constituency like mine which is a rather low income constituency 
but very generous in giving to support fellow Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Caring costs money. The government should not be hindering. It 
should be helping charities to get ahead.  I am sure those who 
make the large donations appreciate the large tax credits on 
donations.  But many Canadians give smaller donations because it 
is all they have left after the government has finished taxing 
them out of existence.  Many charities, in particular pro-family 
charities, need help and they are key to Canada's way of life in 
the 20th century.  As we go through redefinitions of family and 
the family is under attack, those pro-family groups need to have 
their charitable status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the case of Peppergate is becoming more and more complex as we 
have the solicitor general continuing his cover-up for the Prime 
Minister by using a body that was never designed for this 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people in Canada who make a very good living at 
building two or three or four houses a year.  They are 
contractors, very reputable people who build those homes. 
However, I would never ever use any of those contractors to build 
a 60 storey skyscraper because they lack experience.  They are 
totally lacking in expertise.  They just simply do not have the 
ability to get the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make a comparison between the Public Complaints Commission of 
the RCMP and a small contractor.  The purpose of the Public 
Complaints Commission is clearly set out in section 45.35(1) of 
the RCMP Act: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any member of the public having a complaint concerning the 
conduct, in the performance of any duty or function under this 
act of any member or other person appointed or employed under the 
authority of this act, may, whether or not that member of the 
public is affected by the subject matter of the complaint make a 
complaint. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is to get to the bottom of any alleged misdeeds by the 
RCMP.  What we are talking about here very clearly and 
specifically is alleged misdeeds of the prime minister, of the 
foreign affairs minister and of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, any evidence taken under this act will be taken 
under section 37(1) of the Canada Evidence Act which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minister of the crown or other person interested may object to 
the disclosure of information on the grounds of the specified 
public interest. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, this board, this commission, is not an inquiry. 
It is a Public Complaints Commission capable of building houses, 
not skyscrapers, and truly we have a skyscraper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To underscore the point that this body does not have the 
expertise, I am not questioning any of the board members or their 
integrity.  That is not the issue.  The issue is their expertise 
and their ability to get the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to the finding of Justice Reed on the matter of whether 
the board should have called for the funding of the students.  In 
that he came up with two reasons, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board said that the commission's duty of impartiality would 
be compromised by advocating for a benefit in favour of only one

</I></B></P><P align=left>Submissions by the commission of the federal government for the 
funding requested would intrude on the exclusive power of 
parliament to legislate the entitlement which is sought.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not me speaking; this is the judge speaking.  She says 
with respect to the first ground on which the commission based 
its decision “the conclusion is inaccurate”.  Also she says 
with respect to the assertion that the recommendations would 
intrude on parliament's executive power to legislate “that is 
also incorrect”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the key.  She says that the commission was operating on 
misunderstandings of the law.  This is the board that is supposed 
to be looking into whether the foreign affairs minister and the 
prime minister were indeed involved in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest—as a matter of fact I charge—that this board is 
being used as a cover-up for the prime minister and for the 
misdeeds of he and his foreign minister with respect to APEC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my assertion and I say this on the basis of the fact 
that the board unfortunately in the judgment of Justice Reed is 
incompetent.

I am going to read it word for word from the Royal Canadian

for it to hear citizen complaints against the RCMP.
