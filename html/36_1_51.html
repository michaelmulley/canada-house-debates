to draw to your attention the wooden mace that is on the table. 
We put it here every February 3 in commemoration of when our 
House of Commons, that is to say all of our House of Commons for 
all Canadians, was destroyed in the fire.  The wooden mace of 
course will still be our symbol.  In case some of you are 
wondering, it is absolutely legal. I wanted you to notice it as 
it is a part of our tradition.

is my pleasure today to table a petition on behalf of the 
residents of my riding of Bruce—Grey and in particular the 
Wiarton area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petition reads as follows:  “We, the undersigned residents 
of Canada, draw attention to the following:  That our nation 
honours our common legacies through national holidays. That our 
natural heritage is of paramount importance to all Canadians. 
That our long Canadian winter is in need of a mid-winter 
celebration.  That in many of our composite cultures February 2, 
the midpoint between the solstice and the vernal equinox is a 
traditional mid-winter festival.  Therefore, your petitioners 
call upon Parliament to enact legislation declaring February 2 as 
a national holiday, to be known as Natural Heritage Day”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me pleasure to table two petitions today from natives, 
grassroots people from the Stoney reserve in Morley, Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are calling on Parliament to enact legislation 
to remove employees who are non-native being paid approximately 
$300,000 from the tribal affairs.  They feel that the financial 
mismanagement is contributing a great deal to the problems that 
are occurring on the reserve and their state of affairs.  They 
feel that the removal of these individuals and a reduction in the 
cost of this thing would be of value to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second petition, the petitioners are calling on 
Parliament to conduct a thorough internal investigation including 
an extended forensic audit going back to the 1980s on the 
illegal, immoral and corrupt political practices and injustices 
which are being committed by some Nakoda Stony tribal leaders on 
the reserve population, especially those who have dominated since 
the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners state that this assistance would be appreciated 
and would help immensely in initiating remedial actions and 
measures into the dismal affairs that exist on the Stoney reserve 
in Morley.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the first 
petition I have the honour to present is from a number of 
petitioners from various communities throughout British Columbia 
who are concerned about their future retirement.  These are 
people who are not yet at the retirement age but who are 
concerned about what they are hearing about the government's 
intention to change the pension system.  They are simply asking 
that a thorough review is done which I understand is now 
basically in the works.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
another petition signed by petitioners from various communities 
throughout Alberta and British Columbia who point out a whole 
variety of concerns with Canada's tax system.  They have some 
specific recommendations which I will table.  By and large the 
petitioners are calling for a complete examination of our tax 
system and are proposing a major overhaul. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present a petition 
signed by a number of Canadians including many Canadians from my 
own riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children 
is an honourable profession that has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also share the view that the gravest 
social injustice of all time has to be the abandonment of the 
political system and taxation system for parents who provide care 
in the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also agree with the National Forum on Health 
report stating that the Income Tax Act does not take into account 
the real cost of raising children even when one does it at home 
by oneself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives such as caregiver tax credits or income splitting to 
assist families who choose to provide care in the home to 
preschool children.

Question No. 61 will be answered today.

<Question No. 61—<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the recent relocation of the Lake Megantic Human 
Resources Development Centre, can the government: (<I>a</I>) describe 
the bidding procedure; (<I>b</I>) specify the number of bidders; and 
(<I>c</I>) indicate the amounts covered in each of the bids, including 
the services offered and the costs involved in occupying the 
premises concerned? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services):</B> (a) For this requirement, a partnership with the 
Centre Travail Québec was considered as well as one with the 
Société d'aide au développement de la collectivité, SADC, of 
Lac-Mégantic, a partner of Human Resources Development Canada, 
HRDC.  On October 24, 1997 it was decided that the Human Resource 
Centre of Canada would relocate with the SADC. Public Works and 
Government Services Canada, PWGSC, then began a direct negotiation 
with the lessor of the building at 5127 Frontenac Street, 
Lac-Mégantic, SADC offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 12, 1997 the Human Resource Centre of Canada moved 
to its new address, 5127 Frontenac Street, Lac-Mégantic, where 
the offices of the SADC-Lac-Mégantic are located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No tender process was held in view of the client department's 
requirements and the short time delay for project delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) See answer to (a). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Once it had been decided that HRDC would co-locate with SADC 
fit-up plans were drawn up and the landlord was informed of its 
responsibilities for the lease as well as for the fit-up phase of 
the project.  Rates were discussed.  However no formal offer to 
lease has been remitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A meeting will take place between the landlord's representative 
for the Lac-Mégantic office and the PWGSC project manager to 
discuss the rental rate for the premises as well as the cost of 
the fit-up work.  Once these negotiations are completed a 
recommendation with the final rental rate will be submitted for 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interim HRDC is occupying the premises based on an 
agreement with the landlord that once the lease negotiations are 
completed a formal lease agreement will be drawn up and all 
arrears for rental payments will be made at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lease start date was January 1, 1998 for a three year term for 75

make changes to transfer payments to the provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I propose to do in this address to the House is to 
attempt to set out the facts relating to federal government support 
for health, social assistance and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have made much of the announced new CHST cash 
floor, as it is called, the $12.5 billion to be paid to the 
provinces for health, social assistance and education under the 
Canada Health and Social Transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a press release dated December 8, 1997, the Minister of 
Finance stated as follows: “Governing is about choices, priorities 
and values. 
Our choice is clear: health care is a priority for this 
Government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Martin has said nothing about the fact that, since 1993, 
the Liberals have reduced the amount of cash transfers for health, 
education and social assistance by some $6.3 billion, that is, from 
$18.8 billion to $12.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is also not mentioning the fact that the Liberals reduced 
cash transfers to 1984 levels.  These transfers, which the 
Conservatives had increased by $6 billion, have dropped by almost 
the same amount since the arrival of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Mr. Martin also neglected to say that, for seven 
of the ten provinces, cash transfers will continue to decrease over 
the next five years. 
Yes, you have understood correctly.  Every province, except 
Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, will be receiving less money 
under these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the announcement of a new floor simply means that all 
cash transfers to the provinces will not be further reduced.  As 
payments are proportional to a province's population, all 
provinces, except Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, will be 
getting less over the years.  In other words, the seven less well 
off provinces will be getting $384 million less annually between 
now and 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look back for a moment at the context in which transfer 
payments are made.  Prior to 1996, Ottawa helped the provinces pay 
for health care and education under the established programs 
financing or EPF arrangement.  Payments were proportional to the 
population of a province less the tax point value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax points were exchanged in 1977, when Ottawa agreed to reduce 
its tax rates to allow the provinces to increase theirs. This formula 
replaced part of the cash transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The per capita payments under the EPF were frozen for a five-year 
period that was to end in 1995. Otherwise, these payments would have 
increased by an amount equal to the growth of the nominal gross domestic 
product, less 3%. Ottawa was also helping the provinces to fund social 
assistance programs, through the Canada Assistance Plan, or CAP. 
Payments made under the CAP program amounted to 50% of eligible 
provincial expenditures. The increase in payments made to the richest 
provinces, namely Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, was capped at 
5% per year, for a five-year period that was to end in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These restrictions curtailed the increase in payments, but they did 
not reduce their volume. 
Total transfers increased every year, without exception, while the 
Conservative Party was in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the Liberals pledged to renegotiate the financial 
arrangements to improve funding stability. They never said 
anything about reducing payments by one-third before stabilizing 
them. In its 1994 budget, the Liberal government announced that, 
in 1996-97, total payments paid under the CAP and EPF programs 
would not exceed the 1993-94 level. This cut would replace the 
social reforms that were to be negotiated with the provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reforms in question never saw the light of day.  The green 
paper was finally published after several delays and was quickly 
forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1995 budget, the Liberal government announced that EPF 
and CAP would be replaced by the Canada Health and Social Transfer, 
or CHST, starting in 1996-97.  By 1997, total payments under CHST 
would be cut by just under $5 billion with respect to 1995 levels. 
The amount to be paid each province would be announced in the 1996 
budget, following discussions with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 budget contains funding levels by province up until 
2002. 
The calculation formula irritates the poorer provinces, because it 
forces them to shoulder a greater share of cuts per inhabitant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also announced in the budget that the cash portion of 
payments would not drop below the $11 billion mark, which 
represents almost $8 billion less than the cash payments in effect 
when the government tabled its green paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there is a better solution.  We believe that health 
care is one of Canadians' fundamental values.  It is too important 
a part of our way of life to be held hostage to the political and 
budgetary imperatives of the hour.  We must adopt an approach that 
will ensure the future of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the federal government should relinquish part of its 
taxation power to the provinces and territories so that they can 
fund their own health systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the federal government should recognize that it is 
quite possible to exercise leadership with respect to health care 
without being paternalistic.  The federal government's role should 
never again be linked with taxation power.  We need an approach 
that emphasizes co-ordination and co-operation.  This can be done 
by replacing the $12.5 billion the federal government now pays the 
provinces with tax points, which would be subject to equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transferring tax points simply means that the federal 
government will relinquish part of its taxation power to the 
provinces.  This approach would not change the total taxes paid by 
Canadian taxpayers. 
Instead, the portion of taxes necessary to fund health care would 
be collected directly by the provinces and territories rather than 
by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the value of tax points is tied to provincial economies, 
we would establish an equalization fund ensuring that all regions 
of the country are able to provide care and services of comparable 
quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose that there be a Canadian pact for the purpose of 
creating a new framework promoting health and education.  As part 
of this pact, the federal and provincial governments would agree on 
common health care standards.

<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member may be aware of the National Forum on Health in which 
eminent Canadians in the health and other professional fields 
reviewed Canada's health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report delivered to parliament indicated that the $11.5 
billion level of funding was an adequate and appropriate amount 
for health care funding and that the issue was not so much the 
amount of dollars but rather how we were spending our health care 
dollars.  I would point that out to the member.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should also know or may be aware that in the province 
of Ontario the amount of reduction in transfers under the Canada 
health and social transfer was in the range of about $1.2 
billion.  Also the government concurrently cut personal income 
taxes to the tune of about $4.3 billion, a little more than three 
times the amount of reduction in health care funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member believe that it is appropriate for the provinces 
to declare that the federal government has somehow impinged upon 
its ability to deliver on the health care system and at the same 
time reduce taxes or spend in other areas substantially more than 
the amounts we are talking about in terms of the reduction of 
transfers to the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to answer the hon. member's 
question, we visited constituents specifically in my riding who 
have faced the drastic cuts imposed because of the cuts in 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are on long extended waiting lists to get basic essential 
services, or people are dying because the health care system has 
been cut to a point where this type of problem exists.  I have to 
say the cuts that have been made are drastic, are not acceptable 
and should not continue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
comments this morning, but I have somewhat of a disagreement with 
respect to the approach he is taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee went across the country and consulted 
Canadians on what type of role the federal government should play 
specifically in health care and other such programs. 
Overwhelmingly Canadians said they wanted a strong role for the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program being proposing to eliminate the cash component and 
go with tax points would remove the ability of the federal 
government to enforce the Canada Health Act.  In fact we could 
use the word paternalistic.  I would tend to disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to ensure levers are in place so that the federal 
government can ensure the Canada Health Act is enforced.  I go 
back to the example of Alberta.  When Alberta attempted to put in 
place user fees in private clinics the government held back those 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal the member is promoting would eliminate the role of 
the federal government.  If the member were to put that to his 
constituents they would respond by saying “We want to ensure 
that there is a federal government to enforce the Canada Health 
Act”.  The program the member is proposing, as was the case in 
the last election campaign, does not resonate with Canadians.  It 
really has no place with respect to the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I beg to differ with my hon. 
colleague across the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with cutting excesses to the system.  The necessities 
should be kept there and certainly those necessities have not 
been kept.  I cannot agree with the hon. member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hope the hon. member 
would agree with the fact that the finances of the country are 
now somewhat in order.  We inherited a $42 billion deficit from 
the last government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians said that we should put our house in order.  That is 
what we did.  Had we not taken the measures we did, perhaps we 
would have been here today asking the House for further cuts.  In 
fact today we are hoping the House will support a bill that will 
reinvest in the priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's province along with the rest of the country will 
begin to receive additional moneys with respect to the Canada 
health transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the hon. member, for the sake of his constituents, would 
support the fact that there is a reinvestment in the Canada 
Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member across the 
way has a very selective memory when it comes to pointing out the 
last government's shortfall.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to him that the last government was 
the Liberal government. Come on, do not throw it back. The hon. 
member mentioned that now that we have a balanced budget or close 
to it, they are going to be reviewing. Is the hon. member saying 
that they will be spending more money to transfers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to my hon. colleague's presentation and I could not 
help but cast back my recollection to when the Conservatives were 
in government and introduced the massive transfer cuts. At that 
time it seemed to me that if the cuts were allowed to continue as 
the government had planned, we would reach a point soon where 
there would be actually no more transfers financially at all and 
there would be no opportunity for a federal government to request 
or expect any federal standards in health care whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can my hon. friend tell me if my memory is correct and that was 
the case and, if so, does he now stand by his previous 
government's decision to curtail transfers to the point where at 
one point in the near future there would be no financial transfer 
of money from Ottawa to the provinces for health care at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is totally 
incorrect. 
Cuts were needed. The hon. member from across the way just said 
that when the previous government was there spending was 
rampant. I think there is disagreement between both parties 
here and I am not sure where they are coming from. But I would 
like to ask the hon. member what the NDP stand would be. Excess 
spending seems to be the order of the day for the NDP. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to comment on the transfer of tax points 
that was undertaken in massive form by the previous Conservative 
government. That is a singular erosion of national unity because 
when you give federal tax points to the provinces, you lose 
control. I think that the Conservatives played right into the 
hands of the separatist Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois 
when they transferred tax points to the provinces, and this is 
something this government stands firmly against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are just debating bill 
C-28 and health care, not the national unity issue. I will leave 
it at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps I will try another 
tack with my hon. friends. The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance yesterday in his presentation went on at some 
length about the value of the transfer of tax points, which seems 
to be quite contradictory to the previous speaker's question. The 
parliamentary secretary went on to say this was good for enabling 
the provinces to fund health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. friend acknowledge that when you look for funding 
health care through a transfer of tax points it benefits have 
provinces, those which obviously have a much better opportunity 
to generate wealth through their economies, and really penalizes 
have not provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my belief that the 
hon. member does not fully understand the tax point system. It 
does not give the advantage to the provinces that have more. It 
gives the appropriate amount to the provinces and it gives them 
the control where, at the present time, basically they do not 
have that control.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
really is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-28.  I can recall not 
very long ago that we were debating what we had to cut, how we 
had to cut these programs, where we were going in the future, and 
everything looked dim and abysmal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a very different position financially in this country 
today than we were eight years ago, seven years ago, six years 
ago.  It has been a very difficult struggle for all Canadians, 
for everyone in this House and for the government. By putting the 
information that we had to work for Canadians and by working with 
our finances we have been able to change the direction of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no question when we look at financial 
institutions around the world and we hear other countries comment 
on Canada's move forward, we know that we as Canadians have done 
a tremendous task. We have brought the fiscal order of this 
country into a much better condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, we have a very large debt.  That debt is the next major 
struggle that this government is going to have to handle.  There 
is no question that we have to look at business operations in 
this country.  We have to look at all social programs and social 
transfers as we are doing in this bill.  We have to look at the 
whole operation of this country and monitor it on a very regular 
and steady basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very good though that we can stand here today and not 
argue about what is to be cut and what we have to do to alter the 
development of our programs.  We can say yes, we are moving in 
the right direction and now we need adjustments to those 
directions.  That is what this debate today is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about Canada social transfers, transfers for 
health payments and moneys that we are going to move from the 
federal coffers to support provincial programs which are most 
important for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there is one person in this House who opposes 
that the federal government must do what it can to help provinces 
carry out their plans for social assistance and health.  I 
believe every member of the House is consistent on that, but I 
guess we all have differences on how it should be done.  The 
outline that has been placed here is clearly the government's 
position on how these transfers should occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have set a floor for the cash transfers to the provinces by 
the federal government this year and for the next five years of 
$12.5 billion.  We have also suggested that there are going to be 
other transfers to the provinces of tax points.  Those tax point 
transfers will be in the neighbourhood of $12.7 billion.   The 
total transfers from the federal government to provincial 
governments will be over $25 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have to understand what tax point transfers are before 
they can understand how that money is sent to the provinces. When 
we talk about social programs we realize that those programs are 
supported by provincial and federal coffers. Provincial 
governments and the federal government have worked together on 
personal and corporate income taxes since this country was 
founded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government decides that it will lower its tax 
revenue and allow the provinces to increase their tax revenue, at 
a percentage point, the provinces actually get more of our income 
tax, with the federal government getting less. 
A balance occurs to the taxpayer, but the number of dollars going 
to the provincial governments is higher and the number of dollars 
going to the federal government is lower.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always maintained that we will support the provincial 
governments through tax point transfers, allowing an adjustment 
at income tax time for the provinces to get more dollars and the 
federal government to get a few less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have looked on the cash transfers as an 
additional balance.  We have suggested to the province that they 
are going to be guaranteed over the next few years $25 billion in 
health and social transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the campaign we heard time after time from the Reform Party 
and from the Conservative Party that we have cut the cash 
transfers to the provinces.  They never once talked about the tax 
point credits that were maintained, the tax point credits that 
the provincial government got. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They took one side of the story and one side only and did not 
deal with it in a fair and reasonable way, which I find has been 
the case by both those parties over the years. They take one part 
and dwell on it.  They are very adamant about one part of the 
whole equation without dealing with the whole issue, the total 
number of dollars available to the provinces from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, that total number of dollars is there to make 
sure that our health programs and our social transfers are there 
for Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that in the last while one of the major 
issues in Ontario as well as in all the provinces of Canada has 
been what is happening to our health care system, where are we 
going with that health care system and where will we end up in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do and what we have done with this legislation 
is make certain the provinces know what the funding will be for 
the future.  The provinces can plan and look exactly at where 
they are going with that funding.  They know the programs they 
can carry out and they know the dollars that will be flowing in 
for that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no question, when I start looking at making dollar 
amounts, base levels there, that we are following the 
recommendations that were brought forth by the national forum on 
health.  We are following the recommendation of health care 
specialists across this country.  We are following the 
recommendations brought forward to the federal government and the 
finance minister to make certain that the health care system 
stands well in this country and will stand well in the next 
several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also realize that when we come to looking at what we are 
doing with setting a balance of floor value of $12.5 billion on 
the base, that does not mean those transfer payments may not 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite different from that, it is saying that there will be a 
base level.  There may well be increases to those programs as 
required.  There may well be increased funding.  We are 
projecting at this point in time a 2.5% per annum increase from 
present day until the year 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at transfer payments to the provinces, I think it 
is important to understand what I am talking about with regard to 
these tax points. I have an estimate of the transfers that would 
go to the provinces. The province of Ontario would receive tax 
credits under this legislation of $5 billion.  They would also 
receive cash transfers of $4 billion which, to the province of 
Ontario, gives a total of just over $9 billion for health and 
social programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is quite a sum of money.  It is there to make sure that 
those programs are maintained at the highest level.  All 
Canadians can be assured we will have programs today and in the 
future that will meet the needs of each and every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care system, as it is administered today, does not 
make differences in Canadians.  It does not act in the same way 
that we might find the system doing in the United States or in 
other countries where those with a lot of money are able to 
access the services and those who are less fortunate, less 
wealthy, are unable to access the services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system is blind to wealth.  It is blind to other factors 
outside the risk of the patient.  The more the need of the 
patient for an operation, the more the need of the patient for 
service, those are the patients who are treated first.  It is a 
priority list of the health needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly feel as a federal government that it is the only 
way to go about making certain that Canadians have services 
available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other issues with regard to the bill which may have 
been neglected.  Charitable donations is one area that has been 
included.  There are amendments in the legislation to help with 
gifts and donations that will help more charitable organizations 
and other groups which need cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can think about what just happened in this region of Canada 
when tremendous problems were caused by the ice storm of recent 
weeks.  There are people who contributed gifts to those areas. 
The increase in support for those who make charitable donations 
is very important to the operation not only of disaster funds but 
of the heart association and all other groups that go to the 
public on a regular basis to support the people who need extra 
support in our communities.  There is thought given to helping 
those individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, proposals have been made in the area of registered 
educational savings plans to help the families who wish to send 
their children to school.  They know the costs of education will 
be going up astronomically over the years.  There is an 
opportunity for families to put more money into educational 
savings plans which will over time help society to better educate 
young people.  It certainly will help families to send their 
children to school.  It will help to finance education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard young people complain a great deal about the costs 
of education today and the future costs of education.  In a small 
way the bill will help young people to cope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are key important points in the bill that will help the 
underprivileged and people requiring health care and that will 
improve our social programs.  I would like to make certain that 
each and every Canadian understands that the bill is doing a 
great deal to bolster our funding to the provinces and to make 
certain the provinces are able to handle those most important 
costs, those most important programs of the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary talked about how the government inherited 
such a problem and did such a good job at managing to bring down 
the deficit.  I remind the parliamentary secretary that a good 
deal of the so-called good management was as a result of the 
growth in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will recognize that over $25 billion of new revenue came into 
the government per year over the last several years, largely due 
to exports and a very rapidly expanding economy in the United 
States, our major trading partner. 
When that is coupled with the $6 billion in cuts to transfer 
payments to the provinces it goes a long way toward contributing 
to the difference between the current position we have 
financially and the deficit the Liberals inherited.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary talks about how they will restore 
funding in the areas of health care, advanced education and 
welfare, the so-called capped block funding to the provinces. 
They will restore funding from $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.  I 
remind him that it was his government that cut those transfers to 
the provinces from $18.5 billion down to $11.5 billion, a cut of 
some 35%.  Now the Liberals will restore funding by $1 billion, 
bringing the level up to $12.5 billion.  There is still a $6 
billion difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people blame the provinces for the difficulties they have 
had during the last few years with programs such as health care, 
in particular the cost of health care.  They could not deliver 
services as adequately as they would have liked.  Those problems 
have mostly been associated with the provinces balancing their 
own budgets.  I remind people watching the debate today that a 
good portion of the pain suffered was due to cuts made by the 
federal government to transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the parliamentary secretary recognize there is still only 
one taxpayer in the country?  Provinces have the job of 
administering health care but the federal government has been 
steadily reducing its commitment from the time the Canada Health 
Act came into effect some 30 years ago.  The federal government 
commitment has gone from about 67% down to a low of 18%.  The 
provinces administer the health care system largely on the basis 
of raising revenue themselves for funding.  Several provinces 
like my home province of Alberta still have premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are the provinces to handle this problem if the federal 
government commitment continues to be less and less every year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question.  Many facets of it have been brought forward and need 
some response.  I said we were getting our fiscal house in order. 
I talked about the direction we have taken as a Canadian 
government.  Those remarks were well reflected in my colleague's 
comments.  He suggested that the growth of the economy has been 
very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did growth of the economy occur?  We have to stop and think 
about the trade missions the prime minister put in place.  He has 
involved the provincial premiers and the business community of 
Canada.  He did whatever he could to make sure Canadian companies 
could expand, become stronger, make more profit and pay higher 
taxes.  All these things were actual accomplishments of the 
direction of the government.  For someone to complain about the 
growth of the economy bringing in more funding to the federal 
government seems a little ludicrous to me. It seems a little off 
base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we all know we have not increased personal income tax. 
We have not made the increases that these folks thrived on year 
after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat here in 1988 and I watched taxes go up and up.  We stopped 
that.  I watched how they went about with programs they were 
putting in place.  Now they are complaining that we have made the 
economy grow, that we have held interest rates down, and that we 
have done things that have principally put Canadian business in a 
very competitive position worldwide.  We have increased our trade 
dramatically.  There has been a one-third total increase in trade 
over the last few years, thanks to good government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does that affect taxes?  Without increases we have increased 
the dollar flow coming in.  Most Canadians would respect that is 
the best way to go about this issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also mentioned that there were some cuts in dollar transfer 
payments to the provinces.  Yes, that is true, but he did not 
mention the fact that the tax points the provincial governments 
were getting were increasing because of the increase in the 
economy.  We cut some of the tax dollar transfers but we also 
increased our economic value which meant that more dollars were 
coming in to the provinces through tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result I think everyone in this room has to fundamentally 
agree that we have taken a tremendous direction.  It is a very 
positive step for Canadians.  It is a positive step for Canadian 
businesses.  It has been a positive step for governments and it 
will definitely be a positive step for the programs we are 
carrying out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we followed the right wing agenda over there, the difficulty 
we would be in today would be further slash and burn policies and 
further increases in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember Michael Wilson saying year after year after year “We 
missed the target by $10 billion this year.  We missed it by $8 
billion last year”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is trying to say “Now that you guys have 
straightened out a lot of the economy in the country we are going 
to tell you how to spend your profits”.  All I have heard the 
leader of that party say in the last six months is how he would 
manage the new situation.  That is pretty ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to where the Reform Party is going now and how it is 
going to give tax cuts.  It is going to give this and it is going 
to give that.  Giveaways do not work.  Getting the basics right 
is the important thing to do.  The Reform Party has missed the 
basis of getting the fundamentals right.  It would love to take 
credit for it all.  As a matter of fact its members say that 
because they have pushed us hard we have done a good job.  That 
is kind of a sidestep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  I specifically asked the parliamentary 
secretary a question about transfers to provinces and what is 
their intent— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member knows 
that is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If by asking a question he has set off a minefield, those are 
the breaks we take under questions and comments.  It is clear 
that in this case he has stirred the parliamentary secretary to 
his depths.  He is in the midst of an answer.  Perhaps he is 
finished now and we can move on to another question.  Or, does 
the parliamentary secretary still have something to say in answer 
to the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will quickly wrap up. 
It was not a specific question.  He went through the growth of 
the economy as a problem that we are putting more dollars into. 
He laid that whole agenda open to be questioned.  Quite frankly 
this is a pretty bad approach to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done a great job.  I believe that is the 
basis under which my response came. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is time for one more brief 
question.  I caution that the answer as well as the question will 
have to be brief. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member in his remarks spoke about assistance to families to 
help with education through the changes to the RESPs.  While this 
may be a laudable move, I remind the hon. member that many 
families cannot afford to have RESPs.  There are many families in 
Canada who are living at a subsistence level, yet their children 
are worthy of education as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government considered anything very substantial in terms 
of transfer payments to assist many young people who are in need 
of help with their education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard earlier and it is well known that many young people are 
coming out of university with a debtload of $25,000 or more 
before they even have the opportunity of obtaining a job.  We are 
very concerned about this and we feel that the recent cuts in the 
transfer payments have seriously affected education and have 
caused a lot of problems for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anything more substantial that the government plans to 
assist with education other than helping those who are already 
able to help themselves?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very serious 
question which has been raised by my colleague.  It requires a 
proper response in light of the fact that he is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about people putting money away, there are folks in 
this country who really do not have that extra capital to put 
away for educational funding.  How do we deal with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have millennium funding that is being put in place to help 
those low income families pay for educational programs on the 
basis of need.  I will have either the parliamentary secretary or 
someone from the department comment on that.  That would be an 
important area for the member to raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at student loans, there is no question that student 
loans are in place to help students.  Some students are 
graduating with astronomical debts.  I believe that we do have to 
look carefully at what we can do to help students in the best 
possible way to overcome the tremendous debt load they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key issues is getting the fundamentals in place and 
keeping interest rates as low as we possibly can. Remember that 
interest on student loans does not start until a minimum of six 
months after the student graduates and if the student does not 
get a job, that time period can be extended.  But with the large 
debt students have, it is important we make certain that we 
fundamentally handle this correctly.  When people are young that 
is the time when they need a relatively good amount of income to 
purchase the basics they have not been able to have as students. 
In the workforce they have to see those benefits come about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that the issues the member has raised are important. 
They are ones this government is looking at.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to rise to speak on Bill C-28, amendments to 
the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said many times before, we have here a very complex 
income tax bill which is 464 pages in length.  It deals with nine 
particular subjects according to the preamble.  Is it any wonder 
that Canadians are losing faith with their tax system and the 
complexity of the Income Tax Act when it takes 464 pages of 
amendments to deal with some changes the Minister of Finance has 
announced to nine particular areas of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of things that Canadians throw up their 
hands about and say “We have no idea how the Income Tax Act is 
administered, we do not understand it, all we know is we are 
getting taxed to death”.  This type of bill and the complexity 
of it add credence to their argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also quoted before some of the paragraphs in these 
amendments.  Let me quote paragraph 196(1) which deals with 
subparagraph 181.3(3)(d)(i) of the act.  This is how it reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subparagraph 181.3(3)(d)(i) of the Act is replaced by the 
following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) the amount that is the greater of 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(A)  the amount, if any, by which 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(I) the corporation's surplus funds derived from operations (as 
defined in subsection 138(12)) as of the end of the year, 
computed as if no tax were payable under this part or part VI for 
the year. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on.  That kind of gobbledegook loses the taxpayer 
completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are ever to regain the confidence of the Canadian public 
when it comes to income tax and their faith in the system and 
that they are being treated fairly and properly, we have to 
realize that a complete rewrite of the Income Tax Act is long 
overdue.  Its simplification and understanding by the ordinary 
person has to take precedence over this type of complexity that 
even challenges the best minds in the accounting and legal 
professions. 
This is why of course we have tax cases and tax courts wrangling 
over issues ad infinitum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember too the famous case about two years ago where $2 
billion left this country without taxes. The Department of 
Finance and the Department of National Revenue flip-flopped on 
advance tax rulings.  They gave out misleading information to one 
person and gave a favourable tax ruling to somebody else. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars escaped taxation. As a result, 
people again lost confidence in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance should seriously think about 
simplification rather than adding more and more complexity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the speech of the parliamentary secretary, 
the previous speaker.  Not all of it was really focused on the 
the details of the Income Tax Act.  He got more on to the 
government's record and I would like to respond to the issues he 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was taking great pride in the Team Canada approach whereby 
the federal government took trade missions around the world at 
great expense to the Canadian taxpayer.  And sunscreen too.  The 
premier of Alberta left his at home at great pain to himself.  At 
great expense to the taxpayer, the trade missions went to 
different parts of the world to drum up business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance would 
have us believe that these trade missions added significantly to 
the economic growth of this country, to the well-being and to the 
fact that we have dug ourselves out of the fiscal mess by 
balancing the budget. He failed to tell us that the countries 
they visited with Team Canada, the total exports to those 
countries, not the ones that Team Canada generated, but the total 
exports to those countries represented only 5% of the exports of 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we say that our exports represent only 40% of our gross 
domestic product, then the total exports to those countries would 
represent at best 2% of our gross domestic product.  Team Canada 
may have increased that 2% to 2.1% or maybe 2.05%. However, for 
the parliamentary secretary to stand up here and claim that these 
trade missions were the formula for success and have caused this 
country to be able to dig itself out of the debt hole it was in 
and to balance the budget is absolutely false and misleading. The 
$42 billion deficit which was number one in this country when the 
government took over in 1993 is significantly in excess of the 
exports we generated by these Team Canada junkets abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that the government will evaluate the benefits of 
these Team Canada junkets, even if they do not take the sunscreen 
along with them.  They will find that many of these junkets are 
not worth the effort when it comes to a return on taxpayers' 
dollars and investment. I do hope that the parliamentary 
secretary will refrain from the hype that carried him away to 
make these extraordinary claims about the benefits of the Team 
Canada junkets abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk about health care.  He talked about 
health care.  He talked about how the Liberal government said 
that it was protecting health care with the cash transfers. He 
said the fact was that they were putting more money back into 
Health Canada and into health for Canadians by putting in a floor 
of $12.5 billion in cash investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This floor, as my hon. colleague from Peace River pointed out, 
is 30% less than the cash that was going to the provinces when 
this government took over in 1993. They had intended to reduce it 
to $11.5 billion. 
In the last election in order to counter the lack of faith 
Canadians had in what the government was saying, I remember not 
just the Minister of Health but the Prime Minister saying there 
was going to be an absolute guarantee that the government would 
put $12.5 billion cash into health care. Unfortunately the 
Canadian public bought that line. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Late in the fall of 1997 the Liberal government tabled the 
supplementary estimates (A).  On page 48 under 
“Statutory—Canada Health and Social Transfer” it states that 
it has been reduced from $12.5 billion to $12.328 billion. That 
is a reduction of $172 million below the fundamental floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Prime Minister and this government committed to Canadians 
that they would not under any circumstances transfer less than 
$12.5 billion to the provinces to pay for health care. Within a 
few months in the supplementary estimates, where the government 
normally asks for more money, we find out it is taking money away 
from Health Canada, from the transfers to the provinces, and is 
using that money in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public have been misled.  The Canadian public have 
been sold down the drain.  Obviously a commitment by the Prime 
Minister and the Liberal government to Canadians at election time 
is meaningless and worthless.  We have the proof here.  The $12.5 
billion was a commitment that Canadians could take to the bank. A 
very short few months later it was reduced by $171 million as per 
the supplementary estimates (A) which were tabled in the fall. 
It is an absolute disgrace that this government should deceive 
the Canadian public in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health and the Prime Minister should be standing 
in the House to explain to Canadians how their unconditional 
guarantee of $12.5 billion has already been eroded.  And we can 
expect to see it being eroded even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is an important issue.  As my colleague from Peace 
River has said, while Canadians have talked about the erosion of 
health care and blamed the provinces because they are in charge 
of delivering health care, it is a fact that the federal 
government has cut and cut and continues to cut the amount of 
money that is put into health care.  That is the major cause of 
the crisis in health care today.  It has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Reform Party has said it would change.  We said 
during the election campaign that we would put money back into 
health care and would not surreptitiously cut beyond the floor 
which we committed ourselves to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let Canadians be warned that what they hear from this government 
is not necessarily what they get.  There is proof in the pudding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 in part deals with education by the fact that it 
allows for contributions to registered education savings plans to 
be increased from $2,000 to $4,000 per beneficiary.  This is an 
acknowledgement that education is becoming more and more 
expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, education is expensive.  Demonstrations were held across 
the country last week by students who told us they are being 
buried under a mountain of debt.  By the time they get their 
degree and find a job they are mortgaged to the hilt. Their 
capacity to start building a life of their own by starting 
families, acquiring houses, cars and so on is seriously 
compromised by virtue of the fact that they have a mountain of 
debt.  Some of them are $20,000, $30,000 and even $40,000 in debt 
by the time they graduate from university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is not necessarily to just give another $2,000 to 
those who can put money into an education fund for their 
children. 
Many families cannot afford to save that money in advance or in 
anticipation of their children going to university.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has to take a serious look at the cost of 
education in this country and the way money is being spent in 
this country.  It needs to ensure we are getting some kind of 
value for the education dollars we spend.  Surely when we spend 
money on education the concept is that an educated child will be 
produced, that when a child goes to school for grades one through 
twelve, by the end of twelve years we will have an educated child 
who meets a minimum standard.  When that child goes on to 
university he should be capable of meeting the challenges of the 
university because the prior school education has provided him 
with the tools necessary to survive and to thrive at university 
rather than the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past weekend I read an article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
about the fact that one university in Ontario was having severe 
financial problems in paying its bills.  Therefore it reduced the 
minimum standard for eligibility into the university.  It 
accepted a large number of students who were guaranteed to fail, 
and they were failing.  We were giving these people a false hope, 
we were wasting a year of their time, we were spending money on 
education they could not absorb because they had not acquired the 
skills from school.  This was all because the university needed 
the bodies on the student roll in order to generate the finds to 
flow from the province and the federal government so it could pay 
its bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a funny methodology for ensuring you can balance your 
books.  It guarantees waste of millions of dollars of university 
education because it accomplishes nothing except that it turns 
people away and shows they cannot be a success in this world. 
This government can rethink the way education is done in this 
country.  It is time we started to put the onus on the 
educational industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the objective is to produce an educated child.  If we 
start with that premise, then the focus for where the money 
should flow will surely improve.  In the private sector it is 
only businesses that provide good quality products that will 
prosper and thrive.  This is because they know they have a market 
that is prepared to buy their products.  If they do not provide 
quality products they will not continue to be around.  Yet we 
have universities and other schools that are not providing 
anything close to a quality product and we keep them afloat and 
continue to give them raises, increases, more money and bigger 
budgets while we get nothing in return. Much can be done to 
rethink how we spend education dollars in this country and 
universities are a good place to start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a look at Bill C-28 in its complexity and the way we are 
trying to nickel and dime the Canadian taxpayer into paying more 
taxes.  The thrust of most of Bill C-28 is to close little 
loopholes so we can get more tax from this person and more tax 
from that corporation and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, now we have a balanced budget.  The November <I>Fiscal 
Monitor</I> showed that we have a fairly significant surplus so 
far this year.  I know the Minister of Finance will add on his 
$800 million extra accounting charge, which really is not an 
accounting charge but he will want to stick it on anyway as he 
did it last year. The auditor general pointed that out.  He did 
that the year before with $960 million while the auditor general 
said he could not.  But the Minister of Finance said that he 
wanted to do it anyway.  After this kind of smoke and mirrors I 
think the Minister of Finance will tell us that we have a 
balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question now before Canadians is what to do with this 
balanced budget or with any excess cash that is available.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that our hon. friends on the other side of the 
House are just itching to get their hands on that money to spend 
it on their own little pet projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely after 30 years of deficit financing, where we have run 
our credit card up to $600 billion, $20,000 per Canadian, which 
includes newborns, we should try to resist the concept of saying 
my goodness, now it is my chance to buy some more goodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have four simple choices for what to do with a balanced 
budget and any excess.  First, we can pay down the debt.  Many 
Canadians want to pay down the debt.  Second, we can reduce 
taxation.  We are grossly overtaxed in this country and we can 
reduce taxation. Third, there is a need for strategic 
reinvestment in some areas. I can think of health care as being 
one.  Regardless of what the Minister of Health thinks about 
taking more money out of health care, we in the Reform Party 
think that health care needs some reinvestment.  The fourth is to 
invest in more goodies. Unfortunately this government feels that 
buying more goodies, more things it can woo the voters with, is 
more important than tax relief, debt reduction and strategic 
reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that in the next short little while this government 
will come to its senses and not flagrantly waste the wonderful 
opportunity that this country has to once and for all put 
ourselves in a sound fiscal situation where we can get our 
finances in order and ensure that this country continues to grow 
to become one of the great countries in the world. Unfortunately 
it will not be with this government at the helm. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a brief comment and then 
a couple of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the point made by the hon. member pertaining to 
the supplementary estimates, the $12.328 billion, that is what 
the transfers would be in 1997-98 if the floor were not 
established.  With this floor and this bill going forward it will 
be $12.5 billion.  According to law we certainly must publish 
what the entitlements will be.  Now the law is changing with Bill 
C-28 and the provinces know the amount will be topped up once the 
law is in place.  Therefore the rhetoric we heard on the other 
side is nothing more than just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the comment about student debt and the 
importance of dealing with the plight of students and that RESPs 
are not good enough and that the cost of education is rising and 
that governments need to look at education and the cost of 
education, I find it somewhat ironic that the Reform Party, in 
particular this member, is now saying the federal government 
should be responsible for education and that we should control 
curriculum.  That is the only way we would be able to control the 
outcome which is what the hon. member is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a party that puts forward the concept that we need to 
weaken the federation, that the federal government does not need 
to be in the face of Canadians or the provinces.  Now we have the 
comment that we should be responsible for education.  I find that 
somewhat ironic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member then talks about the tax aspect of this bill, that 
this is nothing more than a tax grab.  Is this hon. member then 
saying he would support the practice going on out there by some 
corporations with respect to transfer pricing?  Is he saying the 
legislation in front of us today would not allow corporations to 
manipulate the tax system by setting prices within their 
multinationals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that the transfer price cannot be artificial or 
arbitrary with this bill and he calls that a tax grab.  He calls 
a tax grab the fact that individuals will not be able to transfer 
losses between unaffiliated companies.  Companies are not in the 
business of transferring losses.  Companies should be in the 
business of earning a profit and creating wealth, not 
manipulating the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is merely reflecting what professionals have said in 
this country.  Accounting professionals who have looked at these 
things have said this is what is going on and it should be 
tightened up, rules to apply when a corporation becomes or ceases 
to become exempt from income tax. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member would support this.  A tax exempt crown 
corporation is not able to store up tax deductions or credits it 
does not need.  When it does become commercialized, if that be 
the case, it cannot use those tax credits and cannot store up 
those tax credits so it could circumvent the tax system. That is 
what this bill is all about. That is I think a reflection of what 
Canadians talk about when they say they want a fair tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the comments that are made somewhat ironic, but I 
certainly hope the hon. member will answer the question with 
respect to education and those particular changes to the tax 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member covered a 
lot of ground in those few minutes, just as the government has 
covered in 464 pages of this bill with complex wording that very 
few Canadians can understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the issues.  The complexity of the Income Tax Act 
makes it unintelligible to all but a few people.  If the 
government feels that is what Canadians want in the tax act, I 
suggest that is not the case.  Canadians cannot understand the 
Income Tax Act.  If people cannot understand the basis on which 
they are being asked to pay taxes they lose confidence in the 
system and that is what has happening.  Not only are they losing 
confidence in the system because they cannot understand it, they 
are losing confidence in the system because every time they turn 
around they are absolutely aghast at the amount of taxes they 
have to pay. That is the centre core of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may talk about tax losses and transfer pricing 
and so on.  He may have a legitimate point.  But the fact that 
Canadians cannot understand their own Income Tax Act is a greater 
point and that is the point I am trying to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to education yes, I said it is the responsibility of 
the educational institutions and the educational industry to 
produce educated people.  That surely is not much to ask for. The 
private sector produces goods and services.  We provide minimum 
regulations that say automobiles must meet safety requirements, 
otherwise a company cannot produce these automobiles.  If it does 
not meet the safety requirements we shut the place down or we ask 
it to recall its product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not ask the educational industry to recall the defective 
products it produces, students who cannot do math and who cannot 
even read the certificate they are given in grade 12.  The point 
is we can ask for accountability. We do not have to set the 
curriculum and so on, but surely we can ask for accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a university would bump up its student intake with people 
it knows right off the bat have no hope of graduating or even 
passing the exams just so it can fill its coffers with extra 
money because it is paid on the number of students it accepts 
surely is a false premise and false hope for the students and a 
total and absolute waste of taxpayer dollars.  It knows and we 
know that many of these students who are accepted with less than 
minimum requirements will not graduate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member cannot understand that, he has a serious 
problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member mentioned hundreds of millions of dollars leaving our 
country, escaping taxes and not being available to our economy. 
I agree with him that it is happening. I think that points to the 
need for tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is really only scratching the surface when we talk 
about tax reform.  Although there are some good things in this 
bill, in reality this bill is an attempt to cover over the 
massive cuts that have been made affecting our social programs, 
our educational programs and our health programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need tax reform to meet the education and training needs of 
our youth.  When I say that I mean not just the youth in our 
affluent societies but I am talking about rural youth and youth 
in our small fishing villages.  I am talking aboriginal youth who 
through historical wrongs have not been able to obtain the 
education required to compete in today's society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member be in favour of tax reform that would 
incorporate for example an excess profit tax that would get at 
some of the astronomical profits that are being reaped by the 
huge bank mergers that we see today and by the large 
corporations, whereby some of that profit could be reinvested in 
our communities in a way that would help our young people obtain 
their education?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member be in support of a true tax reform which would 
lessen the disparity that we see in society so that some of those 
tax dollars he talked about that are leaving the country could be 
reinvested in our youth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. 
member's question, the NDP always seem to be envious of the 
successful.  That envy tends to cloud its judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the banks.  I am not sure if the member is aware 
that banks actually earn money abroad.  Over 50% of the profits 
of some large Canadian banks are earned abroad and come to 
Canada.  Therefore they pay Canadian tax.  That money is 
distributed to Canadian shareholders.  That money also reduces 
the cost of banking in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not arguing for the banks; I am just setting out the facts. 
To talk about an excess profits tax is a standard line of the 
NDP, which is envious of the successful.  It feels that by taking 
from them and giving to the poor somehow we would resolve the 
problem. In thousands of years we have yet to resolve the problem 
and I do not think the NDP has the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not absolve the education industry from its obligation 
to produce an educated child.  Surely that is what it is in 
business to accomplish.  If the industry cannot do it we should 
ask serious questions about why.  Why is it still in business if 
it continues to produce children who cannot read or operate in a 
complex world, as the member has so readily admitted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to advise hon. members that 
the time for questions and comments has now expired.  Also the 
time for 20 minute speeches has now expired.  We are now into 10 
minute speeches without questions or comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, inasmuch as this is my first opportunity to speak to the 
Chamber in 1998 I wish you and my colleagues in the House the 
very best for 1998.  I look forward to a very productive year in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 is another example of a caring Liberal government.  In 
the measures included we see numerous initiatives to make our tax 
system fairer.  We agree we have a way to go, but it is under the 
leadership of the prime minister and the government that we are 
able to bring forward effective changes which little by little 
will bring us to a point where Canadians will feel their tax 
system is fair.  All participants in the economy will be giving 
what they can and receiving what they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bigger message in the legislation is that the government is 
prepared to show leadership despite some very mixed messages that 
we hear from the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but notice, in listening to the previous 
speaker, that on the one hand the Reform Party might want the 
federal government to get out of many areas of jurisdiction in 
which it has traditionally been involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the social system, the health system and the 
post-secondary education system as Canadians know are funded 
partially by federal transfers to the provinces.  The Reform 
Party would begrudge any involvement by the federal government in 
any of those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says that sometimes but I also hear that the federal 
government should be involved.  I happen to be one who believes 
the federal government has a rightful place in the three great 
pillars which constitute the social aspect and the social 
democracy in which we live:  education, the social welfare system 
and health. 
I would in fact rather see us more involved than less involved.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28, in exhibiting our desire to be fairer with all 
Canadians, is an indication that we would like to be fairer in 
our relationship with the provinces and ideally with 
municipalities in delivering very important social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the announcement late last fall wherein the 
federal government offered to the provinces an increase in what 
is called the Canadian health and social transfer.  The amount of 
funds to be transferred under the cash transfer to the provinces 
was to be increased to $12.5 billion.  In combination with the 
tax points the provinces have it would certainly give the 
provinces the flexibility and the funds they need to deliver 
effective health, education and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I travel quite a bit across my large riding of 
Algoma—Manitoulin.  I know, speaking for a moment about the 
health system, that great change is taking place in Ontario which 
is being felt very graphically in rural Ontario.  Small rural 
hospitals of varying sizes in places like Elliot Lake, Thessalon, 
Wawa, Hornepayne and elsewhere certainly need the province of 
Ontario to come forward with a vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without wanting to criticize any province, it is important that 
the vision at the provincial level be guided by a national vision 
so that Canadians from coast to coast can feel that they are 
indeed Canadian regardless of where they live.  The services to 
which they have access should be the same regardless of income 
level or the region in which they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I had a chance to travel in central and northern 
British Columbia.  Some of the rural health issues there are 
almost identical to the health issues faced by smaller 
communities in rural northern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues and I believe the federal government 
should have a stronger place in the areas of education, health 
and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that we should take away any authority from 
the provinces, but initiatives such as the prime minister's 
millennium scholarship fund are examples of how the federal 
government can show leadership in partnership with students in 
this case and with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many challenges are facing the country for us not to have a 
national vision in such important areas as health, education and 
social services.  Citizens around the world look at Canada and 
wish their countries were like Canada.  First they see how we 
have traditionally cared for each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot stay still.  We have to keep improving our nation.  We 
have to keep improving the place that each of our citizens has in 
this great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When any federal government in Canada looks to the future—and 
in this case it is the Liberal government—it has to be a future 
where the national vision is reflected appropriately throughout 
the regions and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases there must be special recognition of particular 
circumstances in a region.  However no citizen, be they of Nova 
Scotia or British Columbia, should feel they do not have adequate 
and full access to the values and benefits of being Canadian.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about health we must first talk about the health of 
the economy.  If it were not for the fact the government was 
capable of dealing with a massive deficit that it inherited when 
it was first elected in 1993, there would be no opportunity or 
reason today to be debating what we can do with our health, 
educational and social services systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ground all these programs, all these values, in a 
strong and healthy economy.  The federal government at all times 
must show leadership.  In showing that leadership we have been 
able, in partnership with Canadians who have joined in the 
sacrifice, to turn an important corner in the history of our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When interest rates remain at historic lows it is a benefit to 
citizens, to consumers.  It is also a benefit to the provinces 
which in their own right are dealing with their deficits.  As my 
colleague suggested, and rightly so, the best tax break we can 
provide to Canadians is low interest rates.  Those who need it 
the most will benefit the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize the government has exhibited month in and month out 
that it is a caring government.  It displayed that throughout the 
last parliament and will continue to do so throughout this 
parliament as we approach the next millennium.  A caring 
government attempts to balance the needs of all citizens 
regardless of their station in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my colleagues on all sides of the House as we enter 
the first months of this new parliament to consider that 
Canadians want a strong central government.  My constituents have 
told me that time and again.  They do not want an overbearing 
federal government which dictates to the provinces and to others 
what it thinks is right.  They want a strong central government 
which is willing to lead, willing to listen, and willing to act 
on a consensus when a consensus is reached.  They do not want a 
government which sits around, dithers, hems and haws, and waits 
for something to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the best country in the world because past 
governments, mostly Liberal governments, have responded to the 
best of what is Canada and to the very best of what it is to be 
Canadian.  We will continue to do that.  Certainly there will be 
a few bumps along the road.  From time to time we will make 
mistakes.  I am sure we would all agree with that.  By and large 
the greatest thrust of our progress will be for the benefit of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly support the prime minister in his initiative on the 
millennium scholarship fund.  I believe we need to be directly 
involved more and more with Canadians when it comes to health, 
education and social services.  I do not want to take anything 
away from the provinces, but I believe the provinces need a 
strong federal government that is willing to guide, lead and 
preserve from coast to coast to coast the best of what is Canada.

Témiscouata et cetera. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the name of my riding is indeed quite long. 
It is Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. It is the 
name of an area in the lower St. Lawrence region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak on Bill C-28. Since it deals with measures 
announced in last year's budget, we are already in a position to assess 
how effective this budget has been. 
In Canada and Quebec today, I think that what matters most to taxpayers 
in assessing their governments' effectiveness is whether the government 
measures put in place to fight the pervasive spread of poverty in every 
province are working.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of some kind of arbitrary division, the gap is growing 
between the higher income earners and the people left on the scrap heap 
at the bottom of the income ladder, those who are affected by the 
measures contained in this budget, those who must face the so-called 
spring gap when EI benefits run out. Having decided that seasonal 
workers become unemployed by choice, this good government figured that 
cutting their benefits and benefit periods would automatically make them 
find work and increase their availability for work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that has nothing to do with real life. In Quebec and Canada, 
there are seasonal industries that will remain seasonal, and workers 
whose expertise is in these industries are not necessarily prepared to 
switch overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our society, if there is a way to fight poverty, it is through 
employment. To say that this is the key does not mean much. Everyone 
knows that it is the key. But to make things happen today, in our 
society where a rather significant number of jobs are created for people 
with the right education and training, who even take the jobs of their 
less educated fellow citizens, we must admit that this creates a 
shortfall of jobs for individuals with much less formal education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point, we can say that clearly the current government 
and its budgetary measures fail to meet people's needs.  We have 
all seen in our riding offices an increase in the number of people 
coming to see us who have reached a point of desperation because of 
the federal government's restraint programs.  People are not always 
aware that cuts to provincial programs are caused by provincial 
transfer payments.  However, we members of Parliament all know that 
the fight against the deficit took place primarily on the backs of 
the unemployed, low income earners and people who need the services 
provided, such as health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member preceding me cited the importance of respecting the 
five criteria in the Canada Health Act, but there is no need to be 
hypocritical about it. 
One cannot ask that certain criteria be respected while 
systematically cutting the funding available for such things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government had planned to cut over $48 billion in 
all forms of transfer payments, from the early 1990s.  Last year, 
they decided to make a big deal of the fact that they would be 
cutting only $42 billion.  However, $42 billion in cuts is $42 
billion in cuts.  It means that the people who benefit from the 
various forms of transfer payments will do so no longer.  It means 
that provincial governments are forced to make do with less money 
and to make financial choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In judging the actions of the federal government, therefore, 
one can say that, yes, the deficit must be attacked.  Perhaps it 
ought to have been done differently.  Perhaps there are places 
cuts could have been made in a far more worthwhile way.  Looking at 
decisions like the one on the helicopters, we how to wonder why, a 
few years down the road, we have come back to solutions very 
similar to the ones the Conservatives opted for.  The taxpayers of 
Quebec and of Canada end up footing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, looking at what it cost to buy silence in the Pearson 
airport affair, we have expenses that could have been avoided if 
more effective policy decisions had been made. 
When money is spent like that to buy peace, for compensation, it 
means that less is available to put into the marketplace, less of 
the government's wealth is available to share around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That function of our system is, unfortunately, very 
complicated.  If there is one shortcoming in the Canadian federal 
system, this is it.  Despite what may be said in Canada, the 
federal government has always been a kind of distributor of wealth. 
It has, particularly, been the one behind the deal giving Ontario 
most of the industrial and manufacturing sector, while the Atlantic 
provinces and Quebec had far more of the transfer payments. 
A few years ago, this sort of tacit agreement that had been 
maintained by the federal government for a number of years was no 
longer able to stand up to financial pressures, and a solution to 
the problem was found.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than deciding to boost regional economies by means of 
transfer payments, they opted to simply pull the plug, leaving 
people in the regions with the most primary industries in a crisis 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in the maritimes, people are wondering if they will 
have enough money to get through the fall. 
We have had to make representations, to the fisheries committee in 
particular, to extend the TAGS, because what had been set up by the 
federal government as a means to diversify the regional economy had 
become nothing more than a subsistence program.  Nobody is saying 
that people do not need money to survive, but the federal 
government has not yet looked into the solution of diversifying the 
economy.  The best way of doing so is for it to get out of areas of 
jurisdiction that do not concern it and allow the governments with 
responsibility in these sectors to take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one piece of advice to give the federal government for 
the next budget, as a result of the prebudget consultation I did in 
my riding.  All told, 500 people responded to the survey I had 
conducted. 
A number of community groups representing various sectors came to see 
us. A spokesperson for the KRTB community development corporation said: 
“The danger after a period of economic restraint is that the government 
will start spending again to please the electorate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we do not want the federal government to add new 
programs to those already in place, merely to raise its profile, to get 
exposure, or to look good. What we want is the money to be given back 
through transfer payments, so that the provinces, which have 
jurisdiction over education and health, can act efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard the following comment from someone representing the 
unemployed: “We ask that the EI benefit period and amount no longer 
depend on the financial needs of the government but rather on those of 
the workers, who pay for insurance in case they lose their jobs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in our region clearly understood that the employment 
insurance program has become the federal government's most effective 
tool to collect money in order to reduce the deficit. This has nothing 
to do with the program's objective. It is merely a way to collect money 
through regular source deductions, which are great for raising funds. 
The government has not yet taken measures to set up a separate account, 
as asked by the Auditor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who have to draw on employment insurance, who make 
contributions to entitle them to do so, are asking that the plan 
serve as it was intended.  In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois made 
a major contribution in the fall.  It was very well received all 
round and even received the support of the NDP, especially the NDP 
members from the Atlantic region, where people are affected by this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the Minister of Human Resources Development will 
consider the six bills we introduced so that the reform may be 
changed.  It may have been appropriate to go from weeks to hours, 
under the reform, but there are a lot of negative elements to the 
reform, things that must be changed, including monitoring of the 
fund in order to ensure that the money is really being used as 
intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the eve of a new budget, which will be presented at 
the end of February. 
The message from the people was clear during consultations.  I 
asked my constituents the following question in the survey: What 
should the federal government do with the expected budget surplus? 
Here is how they responded: 12% wanted lower employment insurance 
premiums; 20% wanted improvement to the situation of seasonal 
workers and those starting to work; 28% wanted funds transferred to 
Quebec and the other provinces in Canada for health and education 
and 18% wanted reduced taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents recommend, and I will conclude on this point, 
that the budget surplus go primarily to those who contributed most 
to the fight against the deficit for their efforts and that we 
return as quickly and as best we can to fairness in the way 
government distributes wealth within Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
surprised by the comments of the previous speaker, my friend from 
Riviere-du-Loup. I know the member quite well. We served on 
several committees together and I know him to be very thoughtful 
on policy.  But he may have been mistaken when he came into the 
House. The bill we are debating today is Bill C-28, an act to 
amend the Income Tax Act, not legislation referring to employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reflect a bit on the all of the debate I have 
heard here. I was not necessarily going to speak on this bill 
when it first came forward because I assumed that it would slip 
through this House very quickly because of what it contains. I am 
surprised by the speeches that have been made by the Reform Party 
and the Bloc and the New Democrats when they look at this piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Riviere-du-Loup has just taken some time to tell 
us about a series of other very important issues of concern to 
him and his constituents. But I would ask him and I would ask 
other members, when it comes to the substance of this piece of 
legislation, exactly what part of it they are against. Are they 
opposed to the increase in funding for health care and education 
and social programs? Are they opposed to the improvements in the 
registered education savings plan that allow people who can 
contribute to registered education savings plans to have greater 
ability and greater flexibility in the management of those plans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the only answer for education savings. There need to 
be other strategies and other supports brought to bear, because 
people in Canada have differing levels of ability or differing 
levels of economic capacity. But for those who can save, the 
registered education savings plan is a very legitimate strategy. 
To make that more reflective of today's costs and to make that a 
more efficient instrument strikes me as a very positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps they are opposed to the changes in transfer 
pricing. This has been an argument that as the economy has 
globalized I have certainly heard raised by the New Democrats and 
others in this House, the concern about companies being able 
to shift their profits across borders by the way in which they 
price internal services within their corporation.  We have 
changed that. Is that not an improvement? Is that not something 
that if the member for Riviere-du-Loup went back to his 500 
constituents and asked them what they thought about it that they 
would support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have increased the tax credits for film and video production 
services. We have introduced a new refundable 11% tax credit to 
provide economic development assistance to film and video 
productions produced in Canada. For those of us who are concerned 
about our cultural industries in this country and for those of us 
who see those industries as extremely important in terms of job 
creation and skill development and in terms of the economic 
strength they bring to this country and our ability to celebrate 
our own culture, is that not a good thing? If the Reform Party 
were doing what it claims to do, representing its constituents, 
would the constituents who have asked about that not feel that 
was a pretty positive move? Certainly the strength of the film 
industry in British Columbia and Alberta is well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go down to the other major changes, they are all changes 
designed to do something I have heard people on the other side of 
the House talk about repeatedly: make the tax system more fair, 
take out some of the inequities, prevent people from manipulating 
the system to gain additional benefit they would not normally be 
entitled to. That is what this bill talks about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to stand up today in the end to thank and to 
congratulate the Minister of Finance. I was part of the SSR 
committee that first looked at changes in social service, as was 
the member for Riviere-du-Loup. When the question of the CHST was 
first raised, a lot of us were extremely concerned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were concerned both about the cut and the reduction in 
support for important and necessary social programs in Canada. We 
were also concerned about the loss of control, the loss of 
position, the loss of authority on the part of the Government of 
Canada to set a framework for social services across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time it was pointed out to us by others, including the 
Minister of Finance, that we were in danger certainly in my 
province and the province of Quebec and some others of seeing the 
cash portions of our payments go to zero in health care and 
losing all of our ability to enforce the principles of health 
care.  It was felt that by bringing all of these programs 
together under one legislative umbrella it would give us more 
strength to maintain a national presence and national standards 
in these important services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a long argument in our caucus the Minister of Finance 
agreed to set a floor of $11 billion.  I am delighted to be able 
to stand here today after four years of very, very tough 
decisions by this government, courageous decisions.  It is easy 
to make the spending decisions but it is tough to make the 
decisions to cut and this government has done that.  It has taken 
the tough decisions and tough action to get its spending under 
control.  Finally we are beginning to see some modest benefit 
from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  You have got to be kidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  The member across the floor says “you 
have to be kidding”.  Well of course he is not well known for 
his ability to do math. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we had a $42 billion deficit.  We are on the verge 
of no deficit.  We are on the verge of a balanced budget.  For 
the first time in more than two decades we are going to benefit 
from that.  For the first time we are going to see an increase, 
an ability to put some strength back into our health care system 
and put it on a firmer foundation.  That is a direct result of 
the actions of this government which was prepared to make the 
tough decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will have to be very careful, very cautious and 
very judicious in the decisions that need to be made in this 
coming budget.  Everybody in this House has a list of the things 
they would like to see the government spend on.  My personal 
advice to the minister is to be cautious.  We have not seen that 
surplus yet.  We have not seen a balanced budget yet.  We do not 
know how long it is going to be balanced for.  We want to make 
sure that we have made that change absolutely solid.  Then let us 
make some judicious investments in our collective future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Rivière-du-Loup and I worked on a committee that 
produced a report for the Minister of Finance on education 
financing, particularly on the support for students.  We have a 
problem in this country that faces every student who attends 
university now.  It has reached the point that the costs and the 
debt load students are having to take on in order to attend 
university have simply become so large that many of them have to 
contemplate postponing or not going ahead with post-secondary 
education.  That situation certainly is not in our best 
interests. There are a number of programs like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concerns about research and development and the need to 
strengthen the councils that fund the essential research that 
builds the quality of life 20 years out.  It is the core research 
that is done today which our quality of life is built on, as we 
reach the age of retirement in my case, or my children reach the 
age of majority.  I would like to see some more investment in 
that.  However they all have to be done in the context of fiscal 
responsibility, something that this government knows about better 
than any other party in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply like to close by thanking the Prime Minister and 
the finance minister after four years of very hard work for this 
first reinvestment in health and social programs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
really tough to follow that stand up comedy act by the member for 
Winnipeg South but I will try to do my best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely incredible. The Liberals have it down to an art 
how to communicate that they are wonderful when in fact they are 
doing exactly the opposite. 
They say “We are the defenders of health care”, and at the same 
time they cut and burn and slash the transfers to provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a simple strategy.  I have to congratulate them. If we 
were fighting a war, they would be on my team because they know 
how to win a war by making everybody else take the hits. Their 
own soldiers stand up and don't get touched at all because they 
are somehow able to communicate that misinformation by saying 
“We are not responsible, it was not us.  We cut $7 billion out 
of health care and transfers to the provinces for education and 
welfare.  We cut that but no, it was not us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial governments landed up taking the heat for it. 
Then the Liberals have the gall to stand up in this House and 
criticize governments like the Harris government in Ontario 
because of the cuts to health care and education that government 
has found it necessary to make as a result of the fact that the 
funds from the federal government have been drastically cut.  Now 
gingerly a little bit is being put back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow the Liberals have the ability to spin it in such a way 
that the Canadian people do not look to the real depth of the 
message. They buy into it and say “Let us send those Liberals 
back to Ottawa. They really know how to manage the economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the facts.  This government claims to be so 
wonderful and talks about having brought the deficit under 
control.  That is only one part.  I will put it this way, it is 
one leg of a four-legged stool.  The stool is tottering but they 
finally got that one leg and I will gingerly applaud them for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the Liberals are borrowing less than the Conservatives 
were borrowing.  Had we still been borrowing at $42 billion per 
year, our fiscal picture would be much more bleak than it is now. 
Yes, they have slowed down the rate of borrowing to the pace 
where they are now borrowing only about $9 billion a year instead 
of $40 billion a year.  While these Liberals have been in power 
since 1993 our debt has gone up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started this political thing.  I was one of those people who 
was not involved in politics at all.  I never belonged to a 
political party until I joined Reform.  But I got so 
cotton-picking upset about the mismanagement of the Government of 
Canada since Trudeau took power way back, spending more money 
than we were taking in, adding to the debt and transferring the 
taxpayers' hard earned dollars not into programs that were needed 
by Canadians but to lending institutions because of the debt and 
the interest payments on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got involved.  I remember when I first started.  It was in the 
fall of 1991.  When I was first thinking of running as a 
candidate I gave a speech and said that it was deplorable that 
our debt was $420 billion.  The Conservatives took it from the 
$320 billion which the previous Liberals had left them to $420 
billion. In nine years they added $100 billion to the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this government since 1993, in four and a half 
years, has added almost $100 billion to the debt.  The Liberals 
are twice as good as the Conservatives.  While they stand up and 
say that they are wonderful, that they are not borrowing so much, 
the fact of the matter is that still, because of the accumulated 
debt and the large interest payments, the Government of Canada, 
on behalf of the hard working taxpayer of this country, has 
driven us into debt $100 billion in round figures more than when 
the Liberals took office in 1993. And like I said, they have the 
gall to stand up in front of Canadians and say “Vote for us 
again because we are wonderful, we are really solving this 
problem”.  I find that unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to say something else about this whole system.  We 
are talking today about a tax bill.  What are taxes?  In the 
olden days as we used to say, it was a king or a lord who had 
power over the subjects in his little kingdom.  He could say 
“For me to have my castle, my gold and to run my armies and so 
on, you will each pay a certain portion of what you earned, a 
certain part of your crops, or whatever”.  They gave it as a 
law.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a bit of a symbiotic relationship. Those subjects 
benefited from the protection of the king or the lord.  The 
armies were really there to protect the king's or the lord's 
investment in those people since they were the source of his 
wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a democracy taxes are really a contribution made by hard 
working, risk-taking workers and entrepreneurs.  They are saying 
that they will pay into a public purse the amount required to run 
their governments.  The taxes in this country are killing 
families and poor people.  It is incredible.  The Liberal 
government says over and over that it is wonderful and cares for 
the poor people. There are people who make $18,000 or $20,000 a 
year, some of whom are single moms, and they still have a tax 
bill to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last Parliament there was a big controversy over who 
should pay the taxes on the child support paid by a supporting 
spouse to a custodial parent.  This government had the gall again 
to increase the taxes when it said that the person paying the 
money will pay the taxes instead of transferring the taxes to the 
spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have had the person pay a deduction in 
advance which the lower paying taxpayer could get back in the 
case of an overpayment.  Instead the government said no, that it 
would just do it.  The government ended up taking millions of 
dollars away from the poorest in our society.  Yet they stand up 
and say “We are the Liberals who look after the needs of the 
needy in this country”. Pardon me for being sarcastic but the 
truth and what the message is are on opposite sides of the 
spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be so bold as to suggest that taxation in this country 
has become a form of legalized theft.  If someone came into my 
house and took half of everything I had in my house, including 
the left speaker of my stereo system which is worth $20 and my 
old black and white television, I would phone the RCMP and ask 
them to get there tout de suite to arrest the guy who was taking 
half of my stuff.  Yet I allow the federal, provincial and 
municipal governments to take from me by the coercion of 
taxation, which I call a form of theft, 50% of my earnings every 
year.  If I do not co-operate with the system I am told by 
government bigwigs that I am not a good citizen. Why should I? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly willing to help those in need, absolutely.  I do 
it voluntarily.  On a number of occasions I have come across 
people with needs.  Whenever I am able to with my after tax 
dollars I love to help people.  But for me to send it to Ottawa, 
have this government twirl it around in its centrifuge, have 70% 
of the money I have contributed spill over in government waste 
and inefficiency, have some of it doled out to its political 
friends, and if there is some left over it may go to the poor, I 
am not content with that.  That is theft and it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I would like to see in a taxation system.  We 
should fix the tax system so Canadians get to keep some of their 
hard earned money and use it the way they see fit, which includes 
helping their neighbours and others who need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely absurd the way this and other governments 
impose tax upon tax upon tax.  We get taxed with income tax and 
we pay our municipal taxes with the money left over.  My 
municipal tax bill is around $2,500 a year and I have to earn 
$4,000 to pay it because the federal and provincial governments 
first take 35% or 40%.  With the money I have left I write a 
cheque to my municipality and my $4,000 is gone. 
It goes on and on and on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of Bill C-28.  It is an axiom in government that 
what you do right you do not sell to get credit for, yet when we 
are giving $1.5 billion back to the system the opposition still 
criticizes us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are receiving this fiscal dividend today because of good 
fiscal management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the years 1993-94 the choice was to raise taxes or cut 
programs and transfers.  It was apparent then, as it is now, that 
Canadians wanted a mature and balanced approach to government 
finances.  Balance addresses program spending, provincial 
transfers, tax cuts and debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fiscal year 1997-98 the Government of Canada reduced 
market debt by approximately $16 billion.  It also passed on a 
tax cut of $1.4 billion with the reduction of EI payments, 
approximately 1% of government revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it added $850 million to a tax credit, which is 
about a half-point in government revenues.  For the first time in 
30 years it actually reduced the GDP to debt ratio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a tax cut, a tax credit and a paydown on the debt all 
within one fiscal year.  That is pretty good government which the 
people of this country saw fit to re-elect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses the issue of continuing devolution of 
authority under the CHST.  It is clear that Canadians do not want 
their bureaucrats falling all over each other to administer 
programs.  Surely we can agree that it is simply silly for a food 
processing plant to have a federal meat inspector, a federal 
health inspector and a federal fish inspector, not to mention the 
provincial health inspector, the provincial food inspector, et 
cetera, et cetera.  Sometimes they even arrive on the same day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What small business has not had the experience of the federal 
income tax auditor, followed by the federal sales tax auditor, 
followed by the retail sales tax auditor, et cetera, et cetera, 
all asking for the same material, only organized in a different 
way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians spoke about this sort of duplication and their message 
was loud and clear.  By withdrawing from a number of these 
services in these overlapping jurisdictions the government put an 
end to this kind of waste.  It was a clear message from Canadians 
to which this government responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to properly fund the devolution of authority and yet 
still see that government services are provided, the government 
entered into the CHST.  Cash and tax points will approximate $25 
billion this year.  They are roughly equal.  All the provinces 
budgeted this year on the basis of $11 billion in cash.  However, 
with the passage of this legislation the provinces will 
anticipate an additional $1.5 billion in cash.  For the province 
of Ontario, the impact of raising the cash floor will be 
approximately $2.5 billion over the course of the next five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fiscal year 1997-98 Ontario will receive about $9.1 
billion, or 19% of its operating budget.  For each man, woman and 
child the federal government will send to the province of Ontario 
$800. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the more sanguine question is can Canadians from 
Ontario truly trust that the Government of Ontario will apply 
this increased money to the needs of the vulnerable people in the 
province of Ontario?  Will the CHST go to the 7,000 homeless 
people in the GTA?  Will the money help those who need help and 
those who are being removed from their beds in mental 
institutions in the province?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can refugees expect that the settlement moneys will arrive while 
they settle in our country?  Or will we be surprised when the 
money goes to fund the $5 billion deficit primarily created by 
the ill advised tax cut of the province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario will have a greater fiscal deficit this year than the 
entire federal government. Does this make sense?  A tax cut for 
someone earning $250,000 results in a $15,000 cheque coming back 
from the province of Ontario.  A tax cut for the average or 
medium taxpayer in the province, that is $33,000, means $250 in 
his or her pocket. In some respects this is a tail about how to 
govern and how not to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario's government under Premier Mike Harris and its hand 
maiden, the Reform Party in this House, would urge us to do a tax 
cut in priority to all else.  Mr. Harris has increased Ontario's 
debt each year and I, if I were a member of the Reform Party, 
would not be too enthusiastic about claiming credit while the 
debt of Ontario goes up from $88 billion to $108 billion and is 
expected to increase by $30 billion over the course of Mr. 
Harris' mandate.  If this is common sense, I for one would prefer 
that we absent ourselves from a common sense revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two-thirds of the $30 billion debt increase will be attributed 
to this ill advised tax cut.  Mr. Harris has turned homelessness 
into a growth industry in our province.  Mayor Lastman has seen 
fit to create a task force on homelessness but the premier, 
feeling the political pressure no doubt, has also created his 
task force on homelessness, which will be funded by and created 
by parliamentary assistance.  I will not be overly sanguine as to 
the report itself as those lapdogs report to the premier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding of Scarborough East homelessness is such an 
exaggerated and exacerbated problem that we are now shipping 
people off to St. Catharines and Peterborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, the tax cut for a person in the province of 
Ontario who earns $250,000 is $15,000.  So Mr. Harris receives an 
A+ for that tax credit from that individual.  Mr. Harris' 
perverse policies are putting Canada's largest province in the 
debt hole faster than the Canadian government can get the rest of 
the country out of it.  Canada cuts debt and Ontario increases 
debt.  Canada restores necessary program financing and Ontario 
turns program cutting into a fiscal mantra. Canada targets tax 
cuts and Ontario targets tax cuts for the wealthy. Ontario is 
trashing the best of times while this government struggles to 
include everyone in the rising prosperity of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have given a very clear message: apply this money to 
health care and education.  They are not asking for a tax cut. 
They want their health care systems and education systems 
restored to being the best in the world.  They want to be 
confident that when they go to a doctor they will receive the 
service in a timely fashion, accessible, publicly administered 
and of the highest quality.  They do not want to do a wallet 
biopsy every time they need a medical service. They want to know 
that their children will be the best educated children in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when this government reduces transfers those reductions 
only represent 2% to 3% of provincial revenues. Even with these 
reductions a number of provinces have been able to balance their 
budgets.  Sadly Ontario too would have had a balanced budget 
except for this ill advised and foolish tax cut.

money will go directly to fund this tax cut.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, on a point 
of order, I regret to do this but I would like to plead the rule 
of relevancy.  We are talking about the federal government and 
federal taxes.  This member has spoken about nothing but 
provincial systems to this point.  I would like to ask you to 
have him brought back on topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I must remind the 
members that there is a rule of relevancy in our debate today, as 
always. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, given the rule of relevance I will address the bill, but 
I would like to begin by commenting some of the remarks of the 
hon. member for Scarborough—Rouge River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and other members of his party seem to have taken the 
occasion of this debate on a technical tax bill to comment at 
length on the fiscal policies of the Government of Ontario.  And 
well they should. The fiscal policies of the Government of 
Ontario have been deeply affected by the fiscal policies of the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the hon. members of the government have spoken about how 
the government is now offering a cash floor for transfers under 
the Canada health and social transfer to the provinces and what a 
wonderful commitment this is to our social programs, to health 
care, higher education, welfare and so forth.  Rarely have I 
heard such duplicity in this place from a government which has 
just proceeded from four years of hacking and slashing those very 
same transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government ran in 1993 on a commitment to increase those 
transfers and proceeded to cut them from over $18 billion to 
under $12 billion in cumulative annual cash transfers to the 
provinces. These cuts had to be absorbed by the provinces without 
forewarning and without adequate consultation.  It was the worst 
kind of downloading.  For these Liberals to stand up in this 
debate in this place and proceed to criticize the very 
governments that had to absorb their cuts, the cuts they lied 
about in the 1993 election, I find really quite offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I would not suggest that any particular member mislead 
anybody. I am simply saying the Liberal party mislead Canadians 
in the 1993 election. It is a matter of record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario government had to absorb those cuts, as did my 
province of Alberta.  It is very interesting because this 
government is going to have to see the chiropractor, it has been 
slapping itself on the back so much about its fiscal policy, a 
fiscal policy which saw the government cut transfers to the 
provinces by nearly 35%, while cutting its Ottawa federal 
government program spending by only 9.3% . 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not balance the budget, taxpayers balanced 
the budget by working harder and paying more taxes while seeing 
federal revenues grow by $26 billion in the last three fiscal 
years.  At least $8 billion or $9 billion of those new dollars 
came about through tax increase imposed by this government in 
this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not include the huge hidden tax burden of deindexation 
of the tax brackets which was imposed by the Mulroney government 
in 1986 and which has been a destructive economic policy 
continued by this government.  The tax deindexation has sucked a 
cumulative $13.4 billion out of taxpayers since 1993. It has 
pushed tens of thousands of low income people on to the tax rolls 
because we have not indexed the basic personal exemptions and the 
marginal rates. 
People who should not be paying any taxes are paying them today 
because of the callous tax policy of the Mulroney Tories and the 
Chrétien Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to directly address the hon. member's assertions 
regarding the fiscal policy of the Government of Ontario.  He 
criticized the Ontario government by saying that Canada was 
cutting debt while Ontario was increasing its debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the hon. member has ever seen the public 
accounts of Canada or if he has read any of the budgets of his 
Minister of Finance.  I have and what I see is that since the 
Liberal Party came to power in 1993 it has added nearly $100 
billion to the stock of the national debt.  The scandalous $500 
billion left to us by the Tories is now nearly $600 billion. That 
is not a subtraction but an addition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Liberals should be assigned to a mandatory remedial math 
course because they think adding to the debt means subtracting 
from the debt.  They added $100 billion to it, taking our debt 
servicing cost up to $47 billion a year.  They pontificate about 
their commitment to social programs but they are spending more on 
the interest on the debt, the equivalent in tax revenues of 
$6,000 per family of four.  That is how much they spend on debt 
interest.  That is the amount of money spent altogether in the 
government on health care, education and old age security 
combined.  Just what the government is spending in interest on 
the national debt, which it has increased by $100 billion, is 
almost equivalent to the entire annual budget of the Government 
of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest fraud in what we have heard in terms of the fiscal 
policy of Ontario is that it has made cruel, hard hearted cuts to 
social services for Ontarians to fund its tax giveaways to the 
rich.  The tax cuts supported by Ontarians and laid out in the 
1995 election in Ontario are steeply progressive.  People at the 
bottom end of the tax brackets will feel the biggest proportional 
impact of the tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members will listen to me because this is the most 
important fiscal lesson of the Harris miracle.  The revenues in 
the Government of Ontario have increased since 1995 faster than 
they were projected to.  Yes, it is true, the Ontario government 
cut the tax rates but the revenues went up because more people 
are working and paying taxes.  The government has not had to cut 
a dime from any program to finance the tax cuts because the tax 
cuts have financed themselves through increased economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a Tory government in Ontario but it is unfortunate that 
the Tory Party here, the red Tory Party here, has publicly 
criticized Mike Harris' fiscal policy.  The hon. member for 
Markham has publicly said that if the Harris government continues 
with its hard hearted policies it could affect the federal Tory 
Party.  Imagine a member whose party is at 12% in Ontario saying 
that the Mike Harris' party at 35% might negatively affect their 
electoral outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that Ontario government's revenues have gone up as 
the taxes have gone down.  That is why the fiscal policy of the 
government is not working.  As it pushes tax rates up it 
continues to stagnate economic growth.  We continue to see nearly 
9% unemployment, 16% youth unemployment and shrinking family 
incomes.  Now we see that our GDP for the last quarter is down 
for each of the last three months.  We now see that our standard 
of living has declined faster than that of any other country in 
the OECD over the past 20 years.  The government may call that a 
fiscal record to be proud of but I call it a fiscal record to be 
ashamed of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to emulate a fiscal record it should 
look to the Government of Alberta which cut its own program 
spending not by 9% but by 20% and did not complain one whit about 
the transfer cuts, the hundreds of millions of dollars in 
transfer cuts imposed on it by the Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to speak in favour of Bill C-28 today because 
the bill is about the basic values of all Canadians.  It is about 
people helping other people.  It is about Canadians helping 
Canadians.  It is about encouraging donations to registered 
charities.  It is about encouraging and facilitating further 
investment in higher education.  It is about the government's 
commitment to move forward together as a society without leaving 
anyone behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Bill C-28 is a very lengthy and detailed bill touching many 
aspects of the Canadian economy, I will briefly summarize each of 
the major clauses of the bill before I focus my remarks on what I 
consider to be the more notable components of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Touching most Canadians are the provisions of the bill to 
increase the cash floor for the Canada health and social transfer 
to the province from $11 billion to $12.5 billion.  This would 
put close to $7 billion more over five years into the hands of 
provincial governments that are tasked with administering key 
social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 also provides greater incentives to contribute to 
registered charities, providing their donors with the same level 
of tax relief as those who contribute to federal organizations 
and crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are encouraging investment in education by increasing the 
annual RESP contribution limit from $2,000 to $4,000 per 
beneficiary.  We are changing the rules to allow parents whose 
children do not eventually pursue higher education to transfer 
the money into RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also included in the bill is the introduction of a new 11% tax 
credit for Canadian film and video production services.  This 
provision is designed to provide much needed assistance to the 
Canadian film makers with labour costs associated with producing 
a film or a video. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the legislation the government is also providing a guarantee 
that there will be no change in the income tax treatment of 
recipients of disability benefits when the insurance company 
paying the benefits becomes insolvent and employers take 
responsibility for continuing the level of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 changes the rules regarding loss trading.  It 
eliminates the double deduction of personal tax credits for 
bankrupt individuals in the year of bankruptcy.  It provides 
rules that apply when a corporation ceases to be exempt from 
income tax.  It implements earlier announced measures concerning 
inventory held as an adventure of trade and how they must be 
valued for income tax purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said at the beginning of my remarks that I was truly pleased 
to stand here in support of the bill today.  The years of deficit 
cutting were not easy for Canadians and they were not easy for 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew that we could not continue borrowing on the future of 
our younger generations by spending beyond our means.  Canadians 
knew this well and supported our efforts to bring the deficit 
under control.  They knew there would be sacrifices but they also 
knew that the deficit was destroying the future of the country 
and that it had to be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP will argue that we gave up on the most vulnerable in our 
society, that we broke the deficit on the backs of the poor and 
the unemployed.  The reality is that the deficit was destroying 
our ability and our capacity to care for the very people about 
whom the NDP says it is so concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is a good day.  Canadians are now beginning to see the 
rewards of making that commitment, which brings me to what I 
first considered to be the most important part of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I noted earlier, Bill C-28 provides for an increase in the 
cash floor to Canada health and social transfer to the province 
to $12.5 billion from the $11 billion.  The rise in the Canada 
health and social transfer cash floor will put close to $7 
billion in additional funding into the hands of the provinces 
over the next five years to support key programs. 
The CHST consists of a combination of cash and tax points.  Tax 
points are simply a reduction of federal tax rates, allowing 
provinces to raise additional revenues without increasing the 
overall tax burden.  The value of tax points increases as the 
economy grows.  CHST transfers, a combination of cash transfers 
and tax points, will total more than $25 billion in 1997-98. They 
will grow by at least 2.5% a year to reach more than $28 billion 
in 2002-03.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer was introduced in the 1995 
budget to reform the system of federal transfers to the provinces 
and territories as part of the Liberal government's efforts to 
improve the effectiveness of the Canadian federation.  The CHST 
replaced federal transfers for social assistance and social 
services under the Canada assistance plan and for health and 
post-secondary education under established programs financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CHST provides provinces with greater flexibility to develop 
and administer programs of provincial responsibility.  The end of 
cost sharing rules has opened the door for provincial innovation 
in service delivery.  Provinces have the flexibility to tailor 
services to their populations, allowing for more innovation such 
as community health centres in Quebec, for extramural hospitals 
or hospital services provided in homes in New Brunswick, and for 
quick response medical teams in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Key protections remain.  The federal government continues to 
uphold the principles of the Canada Health Act with the power to 
deduct from cash transfers if provinces fail to meet federal 
criteria.  Social assistance must continue to be accessible 
without provincial residency requirements to ensure Canadians are 
free to move unrestricted within the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another advantage for the provinces of the CHST over its 
predecessors is its stability and predictability.  CHST levels 
have been legislated over a five year period so that provincial 
governments may plan their budgets accordingly.  Cash transfers 
are guaranteed not to fall below the $12.5 billion per year 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CHST is also fair.  In the first year CHST levels are 
calculated based on provincial shares of former transfers.  They 
are gradually being adjusted to more accurately reflect the 
population distribution among the provinces.  By 2002-03 per 
capita disparities will be reduced by about half.  Equalization 
transfers continue to be paid to provinces with greater need, to 
ensure that comparable services are available to Canadians no 
matter where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his last budget the Minister of Finance reminded us that a 
government relieved of the deficit burden is not a government 
relieved of its obligations.  It is a government able to exercise 
its obligations.  We have an obligation to encourage 
post-secondary education.  Most business leaders will say that 
the key to success is to identify what we do best and then do it 
better than anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the capacity to turn out the world's most highly 
trained workforce.  We are already doing so in the area of 
computer animation.  Canada produces the best computer animators 
in the world.  In particular the program at Sheridan College in 
Mississauga has been so successful that Walt Disney Studios has 
decided to build an animation studio in the greater Toronto area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can realize similar successes in other areas such as the high 
tech and telecommunications sectors, but we have to stress and 
continue to encourage post-secondary education with a focus on 
high technology areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes this and I am pleased to see the 
increase in the registered education savings plan contributions 
contained in the bill.  This is the second concrete move by the 
government toward securing a world class education system, with 
the creation of the millennium scholarship fund recently 
announced in the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to Reform Party members criticize the bill over 
the course of the debate.  It has been difficult to determine 
exactly where the Reform Party stands.  One member criticizes the 
government for high taxes and high spending.  Another Reform 
member will tell us that we have to spend more on health and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I wanted to know exactly where Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition stood on what I consider to be the general direction 
of the government, I paid a visit to the official Reform Party of 
Canada web site.  I did not find anything there to help.  In fact 
it became more confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one press release the member for Yellowhead criticized the 
government for not spending enough on education.  In another the 
Leader of the Opposition called for 100% of any surplus to be 
spent on tax and debt reduction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in the Reform Party's “Beyond a Balanced Budget” the 
party across the way says it will reduce government spending to 
$94 billion.  That is a $6 billion cut. The reality is the 
Reform Party has no clear vision for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision in the bill encouraging contributions to 
registered charities is further evidence of this government's 
commitment to the core values of Canadians.  Canadians want to 
help others in times of need.  It is, in fact, the sentiment 
which unites us as a country, which results in the moving scenes 
we witnessed when the Saguenay and Red River Valley were ravaged 
by flooding or when so many communities were devastated in the 
recent ice storms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-28 is a 
rather large bill containing more than 300 clauses. It is a real grab 
bag of provisions dealing with a variety of topics from employment 
insurance to transfer payments to the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of what my government colleagues might think or say, it 
is obvious that the Minister of Finance is trying to pull a fast one on 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 10 minutes allotted to me, I will focus on two main 
points: the measures relating to federal transfer payments and certain 
provisions regarding the Income Tax Act. 
Hon. members will see for themselves how bad Bill C-28 is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let us look at transfer payments to the provinces. 
These past few years, the federal government saved huge amounts of money 
at the expense of the provinces and the workers, both employed and 
unemployed. Bill C-28 could have been an opportunity for the Liberals to 
alleviate the sacrifices it has asked of them so far and for the coming 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of its second mandate, the Liberal government will have 
cut $42 billion in social transfers to the provinces. These transfers 
would normally be used to fund hospitals, postsecondary education and 
social assistance. These savings enable the federal government to play 
the knight in shining armour, while the provinces have to do the dirty 
job of implementing cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board spoke eloquently when he stated 
in the March 8, 1996, edition of <I>Le Soleil</I>: “When Bouchard will have to 
cut, we in Ottawa will be able to show that we can afford to preserve 
social programs for the future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, cash transfers for social programs totalled $18.8 billion 
a year. This year, even after including the changes proposed in Bill 
C-28, they will amount to a mere $12.5 billion. This is small 
consolation because the same calculation for Quebec alone shows a total 
cut of approximately $13 billion instead of $15 billion between 1993 and 
2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us take a look at how the Liberals have been dipping into 
the EI fund. Besides making cuts, the federal government literally 
steals from workers and employers who make contributions to the 
employment insurance fund, claiming that the surpluses are used to 
absorb the deficit, while the unemployed must contend with reduced 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the unemployment insurance fund had a $1.2 billion 
annual deficit, and a cumulative deficit of $5.9 billion. In 1997, 
following the Liberal reforms, the fund posted a $7 billion annual 
surplus and a cumulative surplus of close to $13 billion. Let us 
keep in mind that there is not one cent of the government's money 
in this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, the unemployed have less and less access to the 
meagre benefits, even in a crisis situation, as was the case for 
thousands of people in recent weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has also presented us with highly 
inflated deficit targets in order to dodge around the debates on 
the necessity for cuts in transfers for health, education and 
unemployment insurance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last March, the hon. member for Roberval asked the following 
question: “Today, after ten months, the cumulative deficit is 
reported to be $7.3 billion, which could mean a real deficit of 
$10 billion to $12 billion in 1996-97 instead of the $19 billion he 
announced—Is the Minister of Finance sneaky or incompetent?” 
The Minister of Finance's response to this: “But where does this 
$12 billion figure come from?  I do not know.  I think it is a 
figure pulled out of the air”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether sneaky or incompetent, the question is a legitimate 
one and, in all honesty, both answers may be right.  One thing is 
certain, he does not deserve any of the credit. 
The provincial finance ministers were the ones who had to do the 
dirty work for him.  With Bill C-28, the minister is missing a 
great opportunity to show a bit of gratitude toward those who have 
really been the ones to make the sacrifices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us speak of the taxation system.  Honest citizens who pay 
their taxes to Ottawa are asking, demanding, of the government that 
everyone at least pay his fair share.  That is the least that can 
be asked, but it seems to me that it is already too much for this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his May 1996 report, the Auditor General indicated his 
“serious concerns about the administration of the Income Tax Act 
involving the movement out of Canada of at least $2 billion of 
assets held in family trusts”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 2, 1996, the Minister of Finance tabled a ways and 
means motion intended, he said, to plug this loophole.  Over a year 
later, even with Bill C-28, we are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is going to amend the tax rules with Bill C-28, the 
Minister of Finance should have followed the lead of the Bloc 
Quebecois, which, in the fall of 1996, introduced concrete 
proposals with respect to corporate taxation, two of them 
concerning the use of tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the deductibility of interest expenses—this 
is the first measure we suggested to the government—when a 
Canadian company has a subsidiary in a tax haven, first of all it 
benefits from very low tax rates on profits realized outside the 
country, but in addition it can deduct from its Canadian revenues 
the interest on loans used to invest in its subsidiary.  We think 
that, in this particular case, the tax expenditure is too generous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the deduction of intercorporate dividends, when a 
Canadian company has a subsidiary in a country with which Canada 
has a tax convention, the dividends paid by the subsidiary to head 
office are not taxed in Canada, under certain conditions.  This 
Canadian rule is more generous than the practice in the United 
States.  We are asking the federal government to amend the Income 
Tax Act so as to tax dividends from foreign subsidiaries in Canada 
and to grant a credit for tax already paid by a foreign subsidiary. 
These are proposals the government would do very well to bear in 
mind for its next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, although they say they want to put 
a stop to tax havens, the Liberals are in no hurry.  Each year, the 
government loses billions of dollars because of loopholes in the 
present tax system. 
These shameless tax avoidance schemes deprive the government of huge 
amounts that could indirectly benefit Quebec and Canadian taxpayers. 
Bill C-28 raises once again, but in a negative way, the infamous issue 
of tax havens, particularly as regards the taxation of capital goods in 
the context of the foreign accrual property income, or FAPI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking here about subsidiaries or companies whose primary 
activity is to generate revenues from the ownership of goods or stocks. 
These non-active ventures must pay taxes to Canada on the revenues 
generated through their goods or stocks, unlike the companies that are 
actually involved in and making profits from shipping operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 241 of Bill C-28 would amend subsection 250(6) of the Income 
Tax Act to allow a Canadian corporation that owns but does not operate 
shipping subsidiaries to have these treated as the equivalent of an 
actual shipping company.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, instead of telling companies involved in shipping activities 
abroad that they will now have to pay taxes to Canada like any other 
corporation, the government is saying to those currently paying taxes 
that they will no longer have to do so. The minister has a rather 
strange notion of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder what is in it for ordinary taxpayers. The federal 
government keeps asking them to tighten their belts and put up with the 
savage cuts in transfers for health, education and social assistance, 
but it makes it even easier to move capital abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, and for many others that will be raised by my 
colleagues, I cannot support Bill C-28. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to speak on behalf of the government in 
support of Bill C-28.  This legislation has many components, but 
they are all tied together in a way which is consistent with a 
strong and dynamic economy and, by extension, a strong and 
dynamic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we committed ourselves to a historic turnaround 
in Canada's federal finances because we understood that sustained 
deficit reduction was a key to lower interest rates and higher 
economic growth.  We also understood and made it perfectly clear 
that lower rates and higher growth are not ends in themselves. 
Instead they are the best way to achieve the real bottom line 
benefits which Canadians deserve, more jobs and the national 
resources to make strategic social investments where and when 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move into 1998 Canadians are close to the threshold of a 
major change in our economic history, the day when the federal 
government is deficit free.  This progress, coming much faster 
than we originally dared hope, is indeed delivering the benefits 
we always expected and always wanted.  It has created the 
conditions for lower interest rates and sustained economic 
growth, growth unheard of since the 1950s and 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, 363,000 new jobs were created.  That is the best record 
since 1994.  In December the unemployment rate of 8.6% was the 
lowest in seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is now in a position to make key social 
investments, investments which respond directly and concretely to 
the concerns of Canadians.  Just as important, we can make these 
investments without jeopardizing our continued advance to a 
balanced budget.  That is an important consideration in Bill 
C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important and significant part of this legislation 
clearly is the measure to increase the cash floor of funding to 
the provinces under the Canada health and social transfer.  Bill 
C-28 increases this guaranteed amount of federal cash funding for 
health care, post-secondary education and social assistance and 
services from $11 billion to $12.5 billion a year through to the 
year 2002-2003.  It starts applying this higher cash floor one 
year earlier than was originally slated and planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the provinces will receive close to an extra $7 
billion over six years.  That is by far the largest new spending 
commitment we have made since first coming to office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer measure represents by far 
the most financially substantive measure in Bill C-28 and the one 
ultimately which affects a great many, indeed most, Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cash floor of $12.5 billion is the precise amount 
recommended by the national forum on health and it is important 
to note that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect to the Canada health and social transfer 
which demonstrates our commitment to fairness and to positive 
partnership with the provinces.  In response to the provinces' 
request for flexibility, we restructured the previous system with 
its separate targeted components into a single Canada health and 
social transfer.  This addressed longstanding provincial concerns 
that the inflexible conditions associated with the previous 
transfer system did not allow them to meet specific regional 
needs and opportunities.  We instituted the Canada health and 
social transfer to deliver greater flexibility, while still 
firmly upholding the principles of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is legislation which guarantees that the future growth in 
the tax point component of the Canada health and social transfer 
will not see the cash portion decline below $12.5 billion over 
the next five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words at least $12.5 billion in federal funds will be 
there each year every year.  It will be there to help provinces 
provide the national health care systems that Canadians cherish. 
It will be there to support the post-secondary education that 
gives young Canadians new opportunities in the future.  It will 
also be there to support social assistance so that Canadians in 
need are not abandoned or betrayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two tax expenditure measures that reflect our 
government's commitment to strengthening Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, C-28 follows through on our 1997 budget pledge to help 
and encourage Canadians to save for the post-secondary education 
of their children.  Under this legislation we are increasing the 
amount that Canadians can invest in a registered educational 
savings plan from $2,000 to $4,000 a year for each student 
beneficiary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important change because this government wants to 
continue the task of improving access to post-secondary education 
for our youth.  Our youth need this access and they deserve this 
access.  This will help young Canadians to compete in a fast 
paced economy as we move into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, C-28 will allow someone who has contributed to an RESP 
but who then sees the intended student not go on to 
post-secondary education to transfer the income from that plan 
into an RRSP.  This will reduce the risk and the disincentive 
that parents may face that in fact the benefits of their RESP 
investment could be completely forfeited if their child chooses 
not to pursue higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using the resources of a strong economy to ensure a secure and 
compassionate society is a key obligation of government. However, 
we must not put aside our work to maintain and expand that 
economic strength.  We need to work harder all the time in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the foundations of a well-functioning economy is an 
effective, fair and transparent tax system, a system that allows 
companies and individuals to focus on the work of building and 
growing their companies or personal endeavours through real value 
added and not through the manipulation of tax rules. That is why 
C-28 includes a range of technical tax measures to reflect that 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did what it had to do and it did this when it had 
to be done.  We have now been able to help achieve the federal 
fiscal success that is beginning to pay real dividends, dividends 
of solid benefit to each province and to all Canadian citizens. 
This seems to be something that the Reform Party either does not 
understand or chooses to ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember that it was a strong majority of Canadians who demanded 
that the deficit problem had to be solved.  They have supported 
our action plan indeed in many, many numbers and it is gratifying 
to see that.  In fact without their support our success would not 
have been possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's solid fiscal and economic progress has been won by the 
hard work and shared commitment of all Canadians.  This progress 
makes possible a renewed investment and commitment in key social 
areas.  It is necessary therefore to support Bill C-28.  It 
deserves the support of all members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will explain today why I am opposed to Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is an insult to the Canadian people.  It consists of 
nothing but rhetoric and serves only as a band-aid solution for 
the mess that the Liberal government has created in this country. 
It is so complex that even Canada's most respected taxation 
experts have difficulty in understanding what it is the 
government is trying to do.  How insulting to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill allocates $1.5 billion extra to the Canada health and 
social transfer.  The CHST goes from $11 billion to $12.5 billion 
when in fact since September 1993 the Liberals have done nothing 
but cut.  There is a lot more needed in order to restore funding 
to post-1993 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Liberals have actually done, if I look at the rural 
riding which I represent, they have created a mess.  The 
unemployment rate is extremely high and there have been no job 
creation targets.  We have hard working farmers who put in long 
hours to make ends meet and fishing communities that once thrived 
off their traditional trade.  We also have a forestry industry in 
this riding. 
Nothing has been created to help these regions. My riding is full 
of tiny communities that are homes to many small businesses.  All 
of the cuts over the past several years have directly affected 
mostly the rural communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals seem to think this is a gift.  They are trying to 
portray themselves as the saviours of all Canadians when in 
actuality they are the bandits who took the money out of the 
hands of the people who needed it the most.  This little increase 
in spending proposed by the Liberals will do little to offset the 
hardship faced each and every day by the people in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the government to increase funding in health care 
and education, to put an end to poverty, to reinvest in social 
programs and to carry through with the recommendations regarding 
pay equity and the seasonal workers exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the gentleman in St-Louis-de-Kent who had to undergo 
a second triple bypass surgery because he could not afford his 
medicine?  What was the cost to keep that person four weeks in 
hospital?  What about the two students who are reported to have 
student debts of $32,000 and $51,000?  How can the Liberals be 
proud of that?  I am ashamed and so should they be. That is not 
what Canada is all about.  How will Bill C-28 help out those 
individuals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has been preoccupied with economic 
development in foreign countries and with bailing out southeast 
Asian markets with billions of Canadian tax dollars.  Yet the 
Liberals continue to neglect their own people, the very same 
people who sent them a very clear message in June 1997 in case 
they have forgotten.  I am living proof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about economic development in Atlantic Canada?  People are 
not looking for handouts from the federal government.  They are 
looking for jobs, real jobs with results in real paycheques so 
the people of Atlantic Canada can live real lives. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a few words about the reality in Atlantic Canada. There 
were the cuts to employment insurance. Now we have people who no longer 
qualify for employment insurance benefits. Only 37% of the unemployed 
are eligible. Was the program really designed to help the unemployed? I 
think not. Job creation is a major challenge and we must start setting 
goals in this area.

left Newfoundland in 1996.  Let us think about it.  I do not 
think we can all move to the western part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to remember what the Reform Party wants in 
terms of taxation.  Reformers talk about how low income families 
will pay less tax.  It is very important for the low income 
family to realize that, God forbid, if we did have a Reform 
government not only would the low income family maybe pay a 
little bit of tax but it would also pay for its children's 
primary education and for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers do not talk about the tax breaks they would be giving 
to their wealthy friends. Under a Reform government you would not 
have a pension unless you were very wealthy.  If you could not 
work enough to save in the form of RRSPs, you would not have a 
pension.  It is very important to remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canadians are very hard workers.  They are not lazy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are not lazy. They are proud people who work very 
hard. However, in recent years, the Liberals have only taken advantage 
of them, and this is not fair.

tackles the crisis in Atlantic Canada, the federal government 
will not get my vote.  I would not be representing my people if I 
supported this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to 
agree with the comments of the previous speaker certainly as they 
apply to the Reform Party. 
We have been listening to a lot of innuendo about tax reform and 
how the Reform members are the defenders of the poor and the 
downtrodden.  However most of their tax policies are to cover up 
the real issue which is trying to give tax breaks to their 
buddies and friends, the wealthy people of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is very complex. It involves many sections of the 
Income Tax Act, charitable donations, along with registered 
education savings plans which I will touch on a little later, 
transfer pricing and so on.  It is a very large bill and affects 
many aspects of the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about one aspect the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot mentioned yesterday.  He talked about how 
this bill changes the Canada Shipping Act.  He then alluded that 
somehow the Minister of Finance would have some kind of conflict 
of interest. I would just like to refer to a number of issues 
showing the history of these sections of the Canada Shipping Act 
through the income tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since at least 1927 Canada has had special tax rules for 
non-resident companies that earn income from international 
shipping.  The rule is that Canada will not tax that income 
provided their home country does the same for Canadian companies. 
Each country taxes its own residents, a fair application of 
international trade and agreements I would think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To apply this rule, it has to be known whether the company is a 
non-resident or not.  That was sometimes a problem because under 
Canadian tax rule, residence is not always easy to decide in 
advance.  Canada was losing business because of this uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 the previous government added a rule to clarify the 
residency rules for foreign shippers.  Basically a foreign 
company that earns its income from international shipping is not 
a resident in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment in today's bill responds to the suggestion from 
the non-profit International Marine Centre in Vancouver. It 
simply improved the 1991 clarification rule. It says that it does 
not matter whether a foreign company carries on its shipping 
business directly or through subsidiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment brings the 1927 exemption up to date, 
including capital gains which were not taxable when the exemption 
was introduced and so may not have been covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again these are technical amendments.  They are not new.  They 
were released in 1995 and were again released with some 
modifications in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the office of the ethics commissioner, the government 
has been informed by Canada Steamship Lines that it does not use 
section 250 of the Income Tax Act for the purposes of offshore 
operations. Consequently, the proposed amendment does not benefit 
Canada Steamship Lines and the company has no intention of 
utilizing this provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to carry on with a very specific aspect of these 
amendments which talk about the registered education savings 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference Board of Canada has stated so many times that 
Canada's education system has somewhat fallen behind in the 
world. Even though we invest many, many dollars in our education 
system, it would seem that some of our proficiencies, certainly 
in science and technology skills, have somewhat fallen behind the 
norm.  That is why this government set up a millennium fund.  It 
is also why we made this amendment to the income tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registered education savings plan is much like a registered 
retirement savings plan.  The difference is that it allows 
parents to put money in a separate fund to get a tax deduction to 
save for their children's future education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registered education savings plan has been around for a good 
number of years but it has never been very effective.  The reason 
it has not been effective is that what happened in these plans is 
that if your child did not attend a post-secondary education 
institution, you forfeited your deposit. In other words, you 
always ran the risk that if Johnny does not go on to university 
or to college, the money is lost.  Of course, most people thought 
this was not a particularly good investment. This government 
realized that it was important for families to save for the 
education of their children and also to get young people access 
to our educational institutions.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk a lot in this House about the importance of access to 
post-secondary education.  This is a place where the government 
is positively trying to accomplish that with partnerships and 
with private families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition it eliminates to a large extent the liability that 
they are going to lose those deposits if Johnny or Mary does not 
go on to post-secondary education.  More important, it raises the 
limits from $2,000 a year to $4,000 a year. It allows a tax 
deduction so we can save for the education of children.  As a 
parent who has three children in post-secondary education, it is 
an expensive proposition.  I wish this program had been in place 
20 or 30 years ago.  I would be utilizing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many families live in the fear that they will not be able to 
provide for their children when it is time to go to school.  This 
is an excellent opportunity for them.  It is a positive way that 
governments can, together with the private sector, ensure there 
is education for our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came back from the National Research Institute.  We talk 
about brain drain.  The member talked about people leaving her 
province.  Memorial University in Newfoundland is one of the 
premier educators in Canada.  These are the roots and the avenues 
to the future for us.  We talk in Canada about having tremendous 
resources.  We usually talk in terms of natural resources.  We 
talk about our petroleum industries.  We talk about our 
metallurgical industries and our forests and aluminium products, 
but in reality the biggest resource we have in Canada is between 
our own two ears.  We have to do more to ensure that young people 
have an adequate education and that they are going to engage in 
those industries that will evolve and be the industries of the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to support this bill and this specific aspect of it. 
A very important aspect of it is what we are doing to make a 
positive contribution for those children who may find it 
difficult to get to school. It gives their parents planning 
horizons to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat through this debate and I have listened to members of 
the Reform Party get up and defend the province of Ontario.  I 
guess they are all part of the same material.  It seems strange 
to me that the province of Ontario came in with a program of 
reducing taxes.  At the same time it was going to cut 
expenditures and do all kinds of wonderful things.  Some of the 
members of the Reform Party keep saying this government did this 
and that government did that.  The reality is most people know 
their is only one taxpayer.  Everybody in Canada has to try to 
get their books to balance, whether it is the federal government 
or the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big things we do is transfer money to the provinces 
in support of health care.  We have created a base level of 
funding there.  Some of it had to be cut and the provinces had to 
adjust to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to me that at the same time that cuts to health 
care and other aspects of our social structure in Ontario were 
going on, the province of Ontario cut indirectly or reduced taxes 
by $5 billion.  When it made the announcement of the $5 billion, 
it was running something like $8 billion deficits per year.  In 
other words, the province continued to run deficits on annual 
rated basis, even though it was also in a program of tax 
reductions.  I heard the minister of finance of the province of 
Ontario saying they cannot make their budget reductions by the 
year 2000. They were to balance the books but now they cannot do 
it.  The difference or shortfall was $5 billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask whether this is in the best interests of Canadians. 
My constituents are telling me to continue with our deficit and 
debt reduction targets, enhance our health care system but they 
do not need tax cuts today because they think there are more 
important things to do.  I think most of the people in Ontario 
have come to realize that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill today.  It is 
nice to be back in the House and fighting Liberals once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listening to the previous Liberal speaker all of a sudden 
we have had some good ammunition given to us.  It was indicative of the 
Liberal short term vision that the member just talked about the 
tax cuts, the economy and the budget shortfall in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics will show that the economy, because of the tax cuts 
put in by the provincial government in Ontario, is undergoing 
tremendous growth. On a long term basis that will be of immense 
benefit to the province of Ontario, as it was for the province of 
Alberta which is now leading all the provinces in economic growth 
and it certainly has some lessons for the federal Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax bill, Bill  C-28, is all about a tax system that is 
patently unfair to the Canadian people.  The Liberals instead of 
wanting to fix it are simply making changes that will make it 
more confusing for Canadians to figure out this Canadian tax 
system and how the Liberal government is able to wrench billions 
of dollars out of their pockets, decreasing dramatically their 
disposable income for their families, increasing dramatically the 
tax levels on Canadian small businesses, the backbone of 
our economy which are providing more jobs in this country than 
any other sector, including the government sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government likes to say it is creating all the 
jobs. That is absolutely false.  It is the private sector and 
primarily the small business sector, but the Liberals do not 
recognize that.  In their tax system they seek only to penalize 
small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 can best be described as a smoke and mirrors bill 
designed to cover up the fiscal mismanagement of the Liberal 
government. Some people have compared the Parliament of Canada to 
a circus at times.  Trickery, smoke and mirrors and sleight of 
hand do belong in a circus.  We are getting a good example of it 
in Bill C-28.  It does nothing but confuse Canadians about how 
the tax system is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the lack of substance in Bill C-28.  The 
government has managed to put together some 500 pages talking 
about changing 20 different acts and regulations in the income 
tax system.  The Liberals certainly do not know how to make 
anything simple.  I think their motto is make it complicated, 
convoluted and confusing and no one will see what they are 
actually doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I 
think we are short of a quorum, so I would appreciate if some of 
the Liberals would come back and listen to this good debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps the bells could be rung.  I do 
not see a quorum.

Prince George—Bulkley Valley may resume his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate seeing so many 
Liberals rush back into the House so they can take part in the 
debate today.  It will be a refreshing experience to hear some 
real facts and substance coming from the official opposition 
party rather than listening to the spin doctors and the backroom 
boys who came up with Bill C-28.  I thank the Liberals for 
returning to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing missing from the bill is any kind of tax relief for 
Canadians.  As we know, Canadians are the most overtaxed people 
in the entire world.  Mr. Speaker, every year when you fill out 
your income tax form I am sure you must shed a few crocodile 
tears over what this Liberal government has done to people just 
like you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the bill—zip, as my son would say—about 
tax relief.  There is no mention of the 73% CPP tax hike, the 
payroll tax which will be applied to Canadian businesses and 
individuals.  There is no mention of the more than $5 billion in 
extra EI premiums Canadians are paying and that is considered a 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every think tank in the country has concluded that high taxes 
kill jobs.  It is as simple as that, but the government just does 
not get it.  It refuses to look at the high tax regime of this 
country and it continues its reckless spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in our party, Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, the hon. 
member for St. Albert.  On a regular basis he puts out the waste 
report.  We have sent $2 million off to Brazil to promote 
electrical energy.  I believe they have had electricity down 
there for quite some time and they realize the benefit of it, but 
we sent them $2 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have sent $450,000 to Lebanon for the Lebanese Parliamentary 
Institute.  I hope that $450,000 is not to teach it how to spend 
money in a Liberal fashion.  I do not think the people of Lebanon 
would appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 does not even consider the $600 billion debt hole that 
this country is in, which this government and the Tories and 
Liberals before it helped to create.  It does not even mention 
the $45 billion in service charges and interest payments every 
year.  Those service charges could pay the entire health care 
bill in Canada for one year, plus educate every student in the 
country for one or two years.  This bill does not even talk about 
that crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the Liberals have a plan for this crushing debt?  Not in this 
housekeeping bill.  They wanted to start off slow and maybe work 
up to something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the Liberals have a plan for tax relief to put more money in 
the pockets of Canadians to give them the option of spending or 
saving it?  Not in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minuscule changes to the bill are designed to make us forget 
for a little while just how high the taxes are in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things could be so much simpler if the Liberals would just 
listen to the Reform Party, the official opposition, which has 
brought to this House a plan called “Securing Your Future”, a 
plan which economists all across the country have said is right 
on the mark.  It is on the right track.  But no, it clouds the 
vision, the philosophy and the legacy of these tax and spend 
Liberals.  They have scales over their eyes.  They cannot see the 
truth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Reformers are calling for less taxes, less debt and 
less interest charges on our $600 billion debt, the Liberals are 
calling for more program spending in areas of little need, 
forgetting the areas of great need that they gutted like health 
care and education payments to the tune of $7 billion since they 
came to power.  They are now throwing back a paltry $1 billion 
and saying they have fixed it.  No, the arithmetic tells me that 
they are $6 billion short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the government for once to consider the average working 
Canadian, to consider the students who are struggling to get 
through university and college and ending up with huge student 
loans, to consider the people who are living below the poverty 
line, and to consider the people who are trying to raise families 
and are having their pockets picked by the Liberal government 
through high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would for once consider all those people 
instead of its own political tax and spend philosophy, maybe some 
day we would get a bill in the House that our party could 
support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-28, an act which will allow our 
government to implement the tax policies and provisions 
introduced in the 1997 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but be continually amazed by the Reform Party's 
flavour of the month.  It was some time ago that it argued that 
what the government should be doing was tackling the deficit. 
When we tackled the deficit and started to win the fight and have 
won the fight against the deficit, it switched to tax reductions. 
Very recently it moved from tax reductions to eliminating the 
federal debt.  We will have to stay tuned to see what the next 
flavour of the month will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, Bill C-28 allows the government to implement the tax 
changes that we brought in, in the 1997 budget.  There are a 
number of important provisions in the bill which facilitate a 
number of detailed changes to the Income Tax Act.  I will not go 
into them today but I would like to address a few key areas.  The 
first area is the Canada health and social transfer, a critical 
part of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government have said that we will limit or put a floor 
on the cash transfers to the provinces at $12.5 billion.  This 
responds directly to the recommendations of the National Forum on 
Health which stated that we should increase the cash floor from 
$11 billion to $12.5 billion.  It would have triggered in, in 
1997-98.  It responds to the concerns expressed by Canadians 
about the delicate nature of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for Canadians to understand the amount of 
funding we are providing through the CHST.  In addition to cash 
payments there are tax points.  In total in 1997-98 it will 
amount to some $25 billion that we will be transferring to the 
provinces to deal with health care, education and welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the old system the funds and the tax points were 
transferred under established programs financing or EPF and 
through CAP which was the Canada assistance plan.  Established 
programs financing was meant to cover health care and education 
and CAP was a cost shared program with the provinces to cover 
welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CAP was not a very efficient program at either the provincial or 
federal level.  For the provinces it was really using 50 cent 
dollars.  For every dollar the provinces spent they recovered 50 
cents from the federal government.  As a federal government we 
did not have the kinds of controls that we desired in a program 
where we were spending Canadian taxpayers' money.  At the 
provincial level CAP was sometimes not managed in a fiscally 
prudent way, so moving away from CAP is a wise decision. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as established programs financing is concerned, it has 
always been a challenge in Canada to ascertain where the funding 
is going directly, whether it is going to health or education. 
Essentially it goes into the consolidated revenues of the 
provinces and it is very difficult to establish that trail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we as a government are doing and will be doing more of is 
ensuring that we set standards and guidelines in terms of the 
delivery of health care, education and welfare.  Some of those 
are already enshrined in the Canada Health Act in terms of 
accessibility of programs, the affordability of programs and 
implicitly the quality of programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do a better job of establishing those criteria 
notwithstanding how difficult the task is.  To measure outputs in 
a health care system, an education system or a welfare system is 
a challenge at the best of times because these systems are 
changing constantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First we have health care, from acute care to community based 
care. How is wellness measured?  How do we measure whether people 
are getting quality care?  How do we measure whether people have 
access to an affordable system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is these areas we need to focus on because the block funding 
is transferring en bloc to the provinces not much differently 
what than we did under EPF.  We need to do a better job as 
provinces begin to grapple with their fiscal positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues and I are concerned that we do not erode 
these very important programs within Canada. That is a very 
important part of the bill.  I am sure that most members will 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on another key area of the bill, that is 
the registered education savings plan where we increased the 
limits from $2,000 to $4,000.  This begins to make education more 
affordable, more approachable for middle income or low income 
Canadians.  Money can be put away for the future education of 
their children and they will be able to afford quality education 
when they get to either school age, university age, or both. 
That is a very progressive part of this undertaking.  I am sure 
it will be supported by members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area I would like to touch on briefly.  I will 
come back to comments made yesterday in the House by the Bloc 
finance critic, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.  He made 
some assertions to which I am sure the finance minister will be 
responding in much more detail as the days and hours ensue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on them briefly because I think the 
member has his facts in error.  Before doing that I would like to 
talk about another provision in the bill that is very important, 
the provision to deal with transfer pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As organizations become multinational and have companies and 
subsidiaries around the world, they start to move products and 
services within their own subsidiaries across national 
boundaries.  Corporations have the ability to transfer the 
profits from high tax jurisdictions to low tax jurisdictions. 
This happens all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a company, for example, is incorporated in the United Kingdom 
and is selling products worldwide, it might set up a wholly owned 
subsidiary and tax haven and move product through that tax haven 
to companies around the world.  It will essentially change and 
adjust its pricing to ensure that most of the profit margin is 
transferred to the low tax jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always had rules.  Canada has had rules about transfer 
pricing and fair market value pricing so that if a Canadian 
company sets up a similar subsidiary in a place like Bermuda it 
has to sell that product to the Bermudian subsidiary at a price 
that approximates fair market value.  We do not want the profit 
margin sitting in a tax free jurisdiction based on some transfer 
pricing decisions that are made at head office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty has been that quite a range determines fair 
market value.  Tax authorities worldwide have been struggling 
with this.  It needs co-ordinated effort so that if companies in 
the United Kingdom, Germany or in South America are selling 
products through intermediaries in low tax jurisdictions they are 
selling them at fair market value. This is a very positive aspect 
of Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn very briefly to comments made yesterday in the House by 
the Bloc member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot about international 
shipping because I think he misrepresented the facts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes reflected in Bill C-28 are not creating any new 
situation.  They are basically reinforcing the fact that if a 
company is shipping 90% internationally and 10% in Canada the 
same rules would apply that have been agreed to countries around 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipping really knows no boundaries. It is not like a mine in 
Chile or an oil and gas pipeline in Russia.  There is really no 
national boundary for airlines and shipping.  The rules have 
always been that if a company is conducting 90% of it business 
outside the country it is not considered to be a resident of the 
country in which the head office might be.  That facilitates the 
fair taxation of shipping companies around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past few years companies have set up individual 
corporations for individual ships not driven necessarily by tax 
but by liability issues.  The holding company would fail to 
qualify for these agreed to international rules if it held 100% 
of these subsidiary corporations.  It would be perceived as an 
investment company and would not qualify under the rules as being 
an international shipping company in the primary business of 
international shipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These rules had to be changed to maintain that level playing 
field.  Otherwise we could create a competitive disadvantage for 
shipping companies that happen to be located in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have been listening with great interest to the debate on the 
tax amendments contained in Bill C-28.  I have listened to 
government members heap praise upon themselves for all their 
great accomplishments.  I will focus my comments on the reality 
and the truth of the matter regarding the government's direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member from the other side earlier mentioned three great 
pillars of Canada:  health, education and social services.  There 
is no disagreement from members on this side, but the truth of 
the matter and the facts are that the government cut funding to 
all three of these areas.  It cut transfers from $18 billion to 
$11.5 billion per year and is now about to raise it and pat 
itself on the back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite keep talking about a stable floor of funding. 
It is obviously doublespeak.  They have cut drastically and now 
they are adding a bit more funding which is significantly lower 
than the amount of funding in existence before they took power. 
The reality and the truth is that the government continues to 
extract more money from hardworking Canadians.  Its guiding 
principle seems to be take a dollar and give a nickel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member from the other side seemed to lack the 
understanding that taxes can be reduced by making government 
smaller and reinvesting money back into the priority areas of 
health, education and social programs.  She thinks the two are 
mutually exclusive.  Liberals cannot envision ever decreasing 
their hold on Canadian tax dollars without taking from some other 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the $47 billion interest payment that 
Canadians pay to service the $600 billion debt.  That is eating 
the heart out of social programs.  The Liberals are directly 
responsible for this situation.  Let us make no mistake about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that we have high debt and high taxes.  Interest 
rates are also on the increase.  Foreign investors are concerned 
about our economic climate.  The Liberals fail to mention the 
number of businesses and young professionals who are being driven 
south by high taxes.  The fact is all is not well with the 
economy.  The Liberals continue to spend more than they take in, 
which is in many ways unbelievable given the amount of taxes paid 
by hardworking Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear about numbers and statistics.  The reality for Canadians 
is that they are working harder and harder to see less and less 
take home pay to care for their own families. There is less money 
for mortgage payments and rent, less money for clothes for their 
kids, less money to put food on the table, less money for them to 
spend wisely in the areas they deem most important for themselves 
and the well-being of their families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on the situation of one family in 
particular, on one individual who decided to go public with her 
struggles.  Kim Hicks' life became a bit of a case study of 
Reform's tax reduction plan.  Her case was first mentioned in a 
speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition in this House in 
the prebudget debate.  I will take a brief moment to summarize 
his story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kim Hicks is a mother from New Brunswick who wrote to the 
leaders of all parties seeking a bright light of encouragement 
regarding her life, her situation.  She and her husband worked 
extremely hard to make ends meet and to provide for their 
children. There was always more month left at the end of the 
money.  This letter struck a chord with the Leader of the 
Opposition.  He undertook a project and hired Mrs. Hicks and her 
family to be a case study to implement Reform's economic plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Hicks was paid the same amount of money she would save in 
taxes under the Reform plan.  She was to report what she would do 
with the money for her family.  Did she squander the money?  No. 
She paid off debts, first priority.  She paid for medical 
procedures her children needed.  She put a portion of the money 
in a savings account.  The remainder was used on a modest outing 
for some family entertainment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are thousands of families across Canada suffering under 
this Liberal government.  This exercise is one of the most 
valuable case studies on Canadian taxation because it was run by 
real Canadians making real life decisions.  StatsCanada and the 
finance department can run all the scenarios they want.  However, 
they cannot recreate the real human story that Kim Hicks 
provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that the finance minister would have taken a 
keen interest in such a study.  Then again, what does the finance 
minister know about paying taxes?  Instead of emphasizing with 
the plight of average Canadians, the finance minister dismissed 
this exercise as a publicity stunt.  I would like to tell the 
Hicks family, whose lives were made that much more bearable, that 
their happiness is not a media stunt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are opposed to, the underlying principles of this bill, 
is that there are more and more complicated, convoluted and 
confusing tax amendments being made which fly in the face of 
commitment to a fair, simple and visible form of taxation, 
something we have long called for on behalf of Canadians across 
this country.  It is high time that the Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Finance and the rest of the Liberal caucus leave 
cloud nine and take a hard look at the financial state of 
Canadian families.  Our we the best country in the world in which 
to live because of this government or in spite of it? It is 
definitely the later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian families want to see a reduction in their taxes.  That 
is what they are calling on from this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill to amend multiple acts. One really has to be a tax 
expert or have a great deal of common sense to speak on such a complex 
piece of legislation. Since I consider myself to have common sense, I 
will make my remarks on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Monday, on the television program <I>Salut, bonjour</I>, Claude 
Picher from <I>La Presse</I> had these wise words: “The Minister of 
Finance should use the projected budget surplus as much as 
possible to reduce” the debt and personal income tax, not to 
fund new or existing programs. That is a statement that makes a 
great deal of sense. It is also good advice for the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like me, he could have raised the issue of the GST and said that 
the GST was originally introduced to dip in the pockets of taxpayers to 
reduce the huge deficit the central government had at the time. The 
deficit having been eliminated, common sense would dictate that the 
government lower if not completely eliminate this tax, thereby making 
good on an election promise made in their famous red book of 1993. Like 
me, he could also have raised the issue of transfer payments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that, in an attempt to achieve zero deficit and even 
surpluses, the government shamelessly cut billions of dollars in 
transfer payments to the provinces. These cuts hurt the provinces, 
which, in turn, had to manage crises in education, health and social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, common sense would dictate that this government restore 
transfer payments to their original level instead of talking about 
implementing new programs that would allow them once again to interfere 
in provincial jurisdictions. What is the logic in this government 
implementing new post-secondary education programs when, as we know, the 
cream of our young achievers trained at public expense in our 
universities leave Canada for the United States or another country 
because the tax system is better than in Canada? What would common sense 
dictate, given that in this exodus of scientists, computer specialists 
and other professionals, we are losing a large part of our capacity to 
innovate and, ultimately, the capacity to create jobs in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a worrisome situation on which no one, not even the 
Minister of National Revenue, the Minister of Finance or the Prime 
Minister of Canada, can put an exact figure. 
In economic terms, the loss of the most dynamic, the most talented 
future members of our society is a disaster, an impoverishment of 
our society.  Where is the sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brain drain is what has led to the need for taxation 
reform.  It is high time our governments seriously addressed an in-depth 
reform of personal and small business income tax.  If we are 
to believe Canada's taxation statistics for the 1950s, individuals 
and corporations accounted for the same percentage of federal 
income tax revenues.  In the decades since, fiscal policy has 
changed increasingly in favour of big business, so much so that in 
recent years individuals' contributions have increased eight fold. 
Where is the sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthwhile pointing out that the corporate share of 
federal tax revenues dropped from about 43% in 1961 to a meagre 10% 
in 1995. 
The main explanation for this is the proliferation of tax 
expenditures available to business, the major corporations in 
particular.  Where is the sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Minister of National Revenue in agreement with the 
Minister of Finance, his colleague, who claims to be able to solve 
the deficit without increasing corporate income tax?  Why do the 
corporations manage to shelter income from tax by influencing 
taxation legislation?  Why are they allowed this legal strategy, 
while the strategy of individuals who decide to do work under the 
table without paying tax is deemed illegal?  This situation 
represents a serious threat to social equilibrium,  Where is the 
sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to understand why the disadvantaged, the people 
with little or no income, try to get out of paying taxes by every 
imaginable means.  The Bloc Quebecois has long been calling for a 
job-oriented Canadian corporate tax reform. 
The Bloc Quebecois is keeping a close eye on the government and 
will continue to do so in the area of taxation, particularly as 
concerns the GST, tax shelters, and so on, to be sure that the tax 
system becomes just and fair for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about family trusts.  There is a flaw in federal 
legislation in this regard.  The report of the auditor general and 
pressure from the Bloc Quebecois have only partly succeeded in 
eliciting a reaction from the Minister of Finance on the subject. 
It is still possible to leave the country without paying taxes 
owing to Revenue Canada, since an acceptable financial guarantee 
need only be left.  Furthermore, no deferral limit nor method of 
interest collection is provided for this guarantee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the October 2 amendment to the Income Tax Act, the 
minister has been unable to report the tax plans this change has 
occasioned.  Where is the sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government should use Bill C-28, an omnibus bill, 
to make the necessary changes to employment insurance 
contributions.  It is vital the government reform the current 
employment insurance system in order to put an end to the 
inequities it gives rise to and to better protect workers, 
including the seasonally employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also wants the Minister of Finance to 
substantially reduce the levels of contribution to the employment 
insurance plan, conditional on the job creation performance of 
business.  The reduction in contributions could be 40 cents per 
$100 of insurable payroll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance must also create an employment 
insurance fund separate from the federal government's consolidated 
fund, as the Auditor General of Canada proposed, to prevent money 
belonging to workers and employers being used as a discretionary 
fund of the federal government.  That makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a good idea for the government to move quickly to 
pass anti-deficit legislation as did the Quebec National Assembly. 
That makes good sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of reaching into people's pockets, the government 
should cut unnecessary expenditures and useless programs within its 
own departments. 
One example is the $30 million to change the Canada Post logo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my time is running out, I will move on a bit faster to 
other examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also cut unnecessary expenditures, the tens of 
millions of dollars spent by the Department of Canadian Heritage to 
brainwash Canadians.  We are entitled to ask whether this 
government is acting wisely, whether the way it manages makes 
sense.  No, it does not make sense, because this government's 
policies are widening the gap between the rich and the poor, and 
adding to the tax burden of the middle class and our small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tax system that drives a nation to poverty definitely makes 
no sense.  For this reason, and in solidarity with members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, I will energetically oppose passage of this bill. 
My common sense tells me that it is urgent that the people of 
Quebec stick together as they move towards sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reason No. 10, they cannot find Port Moody—Coquitlam on the 
map. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reason No. 9, they cannot even find British Columbia on the map. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reason No. 8, they think that the tri-cities are a place where 
Liberals put in a token effort but they just cannot win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reason No. 7, the Liberal Party is $3 million in the hole and 
even to a Liberal a million here, a million there and pretty soon 
you're talking real change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reason No. 6, it is difficult to schedule a byelection that does 
not interfere with the Prime Minister's golf game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reason No. 5, the Liberals pinned their hopes on Anna Terrana 
and then mistakenly appointed her to the immigration board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reason No. 4, anything the fisheries minister is involved with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reason No. 3, current Liberal MPs realize that a byelection 
means they need to talk about B.C. issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reason No. 2, the Liberals are unsure about how to campaign in 
British Columbia because they cannot be bought with their own 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the No. 1 reason the Liberals have delayed calling the Port 
Moody—Coquitlam byelection: the Liberals have not yet figured 
out how to tax byelections.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if only we could light a fire under this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the prime minister tried to ignore the fact of the 
federal debt.  Unfortunately Canadian families cannot ignore the 
debt.  A third of their taxes go to pay the interest on it.  In 
addition to the mortgages on their homes every Canadian family is 
carrying a second $77,000 mortgage which represents their portion 
of this government's debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the prime minister please tell Canadians when and how he 
plans to pay down this Martin mortgage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last year for the first time in a very long time the 
government paid back $1 billion or $2 billion of the debt.  This 
was the first time in a long time in the history of market debt. 
This year when the Minister of Finance communicates his budget to 
the Canadian people, they will realize that this year the 
government will pay more of the market debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said yesterday, the leader of the Reform Party has changed 
his position many times.  Sometimes it is tax reduction, 
sometimes the debt.  We had a clear position in our program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if that statement had been made by the chairman of a 
public company the prime minister would be sued.  This government 
is paying down market debt by borrowing from the federal public 
service superannuation fund and from the Canada pension plan.  It 
is paying off its Visa card charges with its Mastercard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the prime minister believe that paying off your Visa card 
charges with your Mastercard is a responsible federal debt 
reduction strategy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in national accounting there is the national account and 
there is the public account.  We are one of only two nations in 
the world that have all the contingent liabilities included in 
the government's debt system.  We are the only ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On national accounts we had a surplus last year.  Even the 
provincial governments do not include contingent liabilities in 
their debts.  Only the federal government is doing that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the lights may be on in Montreal but they are not yet on 
in the government benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister ignores the need to reduce the debt.  He also 
ignores the need to reduce high taxes.  This government starts 
taxing Canadians when they make $6,500 a year.  The Americans do 
not even start until you make $9,500. Our top tax rate cuts in 
when people make $60,000 a year.  The American top rate does not 
cut in until you make $270,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this Liberal government tax poor and middle income 
Canadians more harshly than even the Americans do? 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is one reality.  In the United States if you are a 
blue collar worker with two children you have to pay $5,000 to an 
insurance company for your health care.  In Canada it is paid for 
by the Government of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
industry department has confirmed what Canadians have long 
suspected.  They are worse off than when the Liberals came to 
power.  We know that incomes are down, taxes are up.  We know 
that productivity is down. 
Debt is up.  We are falling behind in our standard of living 
relative to other countries around the world.

When will it set some real targets for debt and tax relief? 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the study the hon. member refers to is a study that 
found its antecedence in the policies of the previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member wants to take a look at is pretty clear. 
Four years ago the country had its back against the wall.  Now we 
are talking about paying down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago the country was talking about how high the taxes 
were going to go, and now we are talking about how low they are 
going to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago the country was in a state of despair, and now 
there is optimism throughout the land.  That is because of this 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
fact is that Canada's per capita income has fallen from third in 
the world to twelfth in the world in the last decade.  It has 
fallen behind such economic powerhouses as Iceland, which is 
built on the side of a volcano. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not good.  It is time for the government over there to 
wake up.  Canadians are feeling tremendous pain and the 
government is somehow consoling itself with the fact that we have 
a balanced budget on the backs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is again for the finance minister.  When will they 
start to reduce debt and reduce taxes in real terms?  When will 
they start to help Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in previous budgets we already began to reduce taxes. 
Let me say let us not engage ourselves in the kind of shell game 
the Reform would play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party at the federal level says “Let us cut taxes”. 
How would it do that?  It would be by cutting equalization 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the answer?  The member for Selkirk said “Let the 
province of Manitoba increase its taxes to compensate”.  That is

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister understand that the trap he has set up

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are convinced, and have said so repeatedly, that democracy works

suited it to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a democracy, the Constitution is the principal law of the 
land.  But if he wants to quote Mr. Ryan, I would point out to him 
that that gentleman also said that the question would have to be a

<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister should have listened to all of what Mr. Ryan 
said.  Mr. Ryan specifically said that it is not up to the court to 
impose its conditions on the government, that governments must 
assume their responsibilities, and that, in politics and in a 
democracy, it is ultimately up to the people to decide.  It is not 
up to judges appointed by Ottawa to decide for the people of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And federalists working in Quebec, who are responsible people, 
democrats, think that the federal government's approach is 
unacceptable and that it will result in an impasse.

collective decision made in a democracy outside a legal framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are referring to Mr. Ryan, here is what he wrote on May 27 
of last year: “The federal government will feel compelled, as it did in 
1980 and 1995—even though this was not sufficiently pointed out—to 
refuse to promise ahead of time to recognize a result obtained through 
an equivocal question. It would be useless to try to deny the federal 
government this power to reserve comment”. I could not agree more. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my

question is for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bank monster merger was unleashed the finance minister 
actually talked tough.  He even found the courage to challenge 
the banks to guarantee no job loss.  The banks' response was 
“No, Mr. Minister, 9,000 jobs have got to go, maybe more”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do to help the minister find the courage to say no 
to the monster merger? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has set out a process involving a task 
force and ultimately public debate.  We will not allow anybody to 
jump the queue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is why the NDP is playing the banks' game?  Why 
is it trying to hijack the process?  Why will it not let 
Canadians look at the total future of financial institutions? Why 
does it want to focus on this merger and nothing else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP may be prepared to dance to the banks' music, but we are 
going to let Canadians call the tune. 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have 
the minister once again hiding behind the task force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the banks have already defied the minister's 
challenge.  This is no time for the minister to wimp out.  It is 
time for the minister to provide some leadership.  Ten thousand 
jobs are on the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister not show some courage and say no thanks to 
mbanx?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

have task forces within our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that the NDP has been able to do is engage in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the federal transport minister of the day, Doug Young, 
signed on behalf of the Liberal government a $50 million cost 
shared agreement with New Brunswick to provide funding to improve 
the Trans-Canada Highway between Moncton and Riverglade. 
Since then the New Brunswick government has sold this highway to 
the same Doug Young to put in a toll.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the prime minister tell us whether or not this sale is 
consistent with the cost shared agreement his government signed 
in 1995? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the federal government contributed $32 million to 
this highway.  Under the auspices of that agreement it certainly 
did not envisage that tolls would be put on that road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for the Conservative Party from Colchester 
raised some very valid points about the need, now that we are 
going into private sector partnerships in highway building, to 
make sure that this kind of situation is planned for in future 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the government is concerned the agreement has been 
executed faithfully and there is no particular problem in the way 
it has been set up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad the government acknowledges today that something is terribly 
wrong about this deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that a previous minister of transport who signed 
over the money himself is now partly in charge of a highway that 
he is going to toll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the prime minister directly whether he 
agrees with this highway robbery now put on by Doug Young. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. leader of the Conservative Party 
should choose his words rather carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister of transport exercised his duties to the 
best of his ability.  The former minister of transport is now in 
the private sector and has complied with all of the ethical 
guidelines set out by the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement certainly raises questions with respect to the 
general policy as to whether we should ensure if tolls are to be 
put into agreements that other arrangements are made, but there 
is nothing wrong with this agreement.

the people of the country have heard nothing but Liberal 
flim-flam about the helicopter contract ever since the prime 
minister made his cynical 1993 election promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that if we compare the bare bones 
search and rescue helicopter of 1992 with the bare bones Liberal 
chopper, the numbers speak for themselves.  The government spent 
$200 million more than it should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What possible excuse could the prime minister give for buying 
the same choppers for $200 million more? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  I am afraid, Mr. Speaker, the bare bones are over in 
the opposition because its research is not very good at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its members are trying to compare a developmental helicopter 
that was ordered by the Conservative government to be in an 
incomplete form turned over to another company for further 
development. They are taking the price to EH Industries at that 
time which was not for a complete helicopter.  What we are buying 
today is a complete helicopter so there is absolutely no 
comparison between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still saving some 40% in costs from what the Conservative 
government would have put us through. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  The list of 
excuses, Mr. Speaker, grows on and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister and the prime minister have used every excuse in 
the book.  They have played politics with public safety and now 
they are trying to weasel out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government documents, the original EH-101 contract, clearly

to.  We know it.  They know it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about this kind of service to Canadians let us bear 
in mind we are talking about saving lives.  We wanted to make 
sure that we had a helicopter that was going to meet operational 
needs and do it at a price that Canadians could afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could not afford the $5.8 billion boondoggle the Conservative 
government wanted to put us through.  We had a heavy deficit at 
that time.  We could not afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are getting a helicopter that meets our needs and it is

Canada readily agrees and recognizes that it cannot force a people to 
stay in Canada against its will, as this would make Canada into 
something it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem for the Bloc is that Quebeckers want to be Canadians as

the minister of defence just said that in 1992 they were looking 
at an incomplete helicopter and now in 1998 the Liberals have 
bought a complete helicopter.  This may be a case of dumb and 
dumber, but even the Tories when they signed that contract, I am 
sure, were not dealing with billions of dollars on an incomplete 
helicopter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the minister of defence.  For the incredible 
expense that was incurred with buying these new helicopters when 
our Canadian Armed Forces deserve excellent equipment, why the

on good equipment for our armed forces? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

affordable price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member's colleague was trying to do earlier in his 
$200 million calculation or miscalculation was to compare apples 
and oranges, to compare a contract with a company that was for an 
incomplete helicopter versus the contract with that company today 
which is for more of a complete, operational and certified

we are talking about helicopters here, not fruit.  This whole

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon in the House in response to questions on bank 
mergers, the minister played hide-and-seek behind his task force, 
which studied the financial sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he now prepared to ask the task force and a parliamentary 
committee as well to look specifically at the proposed merger 
between the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal right 
away before it becomes a fait accompli? 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, there will be no fait accompli. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked a task force to look at the future of the financial 
institutions and it intends to do so.  Only after the task force 
has made its recommendations and a debate is held here in the 
House, a public debate with Canadians, will the government be 
prepared to consider the merger. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
task force has not had a specific mandate to look at this merger. 
I believe that this merger would be a first step toward the 
sellout of Canadian financial institutions. The one thing that 
keeps the institutions Canadian is that the banks now are 
limited.  There is a proposition where shareholders can only hold 
about 10% of every chartered bank.  I want to know if the 
minister will guarantee to the House today that he will not give 
away the 10% provision that prevents a complete surrender of 
Canadian banks to foreign owners. 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have made it clear on I do not know how many 
occasions that the task force has been asked to look at all these 
questions. When the task force reports, we will debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is why is the NDP joining with the banks in 
attempting to jump the queue?  Why is the NDP attempting to 
hijack the process?  Why does the NDP refuse to let Canadians 
deal with the broad issues?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1995 Doug Young as Minister of Transport signed a 
government cheque for $25 million to pay for the cost of a 
highway from Moncton to River Glade. Now Doug Young has switched 
sides and runs a company that will be charging tolls on the very 
same stretch of highway. The minister has stated in the media 
that he is upset with this and he has instructed his deputy 
minister to make sure it does not happen again.  If it will be 
wrong in the future, it is wrong now. Will the minister act now 
to stop this deal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and the report in the newspaper took 
great licence with what I said.  I congratulate the hon. member 
for bringing forward a genuine concern which is how we should 
adapt our future highway agreements to take into account the 
possibilities of partnerships with the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this agreement was signed there were no such restrictions. 
I have been assured by the Government of New Brunswick that the 
federal contribution of $32 million will not be taken into 
account with the toll pricing mechanism.  All of the conditions 
of the original agreement have faithfully been met. 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the answer and the minister's concern that 
he knows that something is wrong.  By allowing the $32 million to 
stay in the deal just reduces the capital cost to Doug Young's 
company, Maritime Road Development Corporation.  It makes it even 
worse.  We know this is wrong.  He knows it is wrong.  The people 
know it is wrong.  The minister has the power to stop this 
ongoing multimillion dollar highway robbery.  Will he act now and 
cancel this deal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we have entered into an agreement with the province 
of New Brunswick and that agreement will be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a federal-provincial task force of deputy transport 
ministers that is looking into the very question of the 
application of tolls in private-public partnerships in our 
highway rebuilding. I have asked that task force to examine this 
very carefully to ensure that all of the concerns of the hon. 
member and anyone else about tolls and these arrangements are 
addressed.

<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege pertaining to what I 
believe are circumstances or words leading to an act of contempt 
of Parliament. My remarks relate to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contempt of Parliament as you know, Mr. Speaker, is very 
analogous to contempt of court.  If you consult any authority you 
will find that the definitions for contempt of Parliament and 
contempt of court are very similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to give a very quick example, contempt of Parliament is an 
offence against the authority and dignity of the House or an act 
which offends against the authority and dignity of Parliament or 
against its officers or members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A contempt of court is any act calculated to embarrass the court 
or lessens its authority or dignity. Contempt is that which is 
expressly aimed against the dignity and authority of the court 
itself in the person of its judges and its officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take contempt of court and contempt of Parliament very 
seriously and provision is made for severe penalties on those who 
are found in contempt of court or contempt of Parliament. The 
reason is that the courts and Parliament are two institutions 
that must maintain the confidence of the people. The people must 
believe that the judges act with integrity and that 
parliamentarians act with integrity and honesty at all times. 
Contempt provisions exist to make sure that the courts and 
Parliament are not attacked in a malicious or unfounded fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, severe penalties are available to judges when for 
example a newspaper were to accuse a judge of being a hanging 
judge because it did not agree with the findings of that court. 
Indeed, jail terms are possible in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So you may be very surprised to learn in that context, Mr. 
Speaker, that my complaint of contempt of Parliament is aimed at 
a justice, Mr. Justice Louis Marcel Joyal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The context of that contempt of Parliament occurred because on 
December 2 the Minister of Labour rose in this House and 
announced that he was taking legal steps to fire the chairman of 
the Canada Labour Relations Board. This entire House rose in 
unanimous support, including the Prime Minister and the Leader of 
the Opposition, indeed all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman of the Canada Labour Relations Board took his 
situation to federal court. He was trying to get an injunction to 
prevent the legal proceedings that would lead to his firing. His 
case was heard in federal court before Mr. Justice Joyal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> came out with a newspaper 
headline across the front page.  It was at the very top, a banner 
headline.  The headline read “Judge slams Weatherill firing”. 
More interestingly the subheading read “Parliamentarians 
compared to `people around guillotine' in French Revolution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarks that I complain about in my address to you as a 
contempt of Parliament are contained in two paragraphs in this 
story.  I will read them as quickly as I can:  “Yesterday, in 
the Federal Court of Canada, Mr. Justice Louis Marcel Joyal 
compared such behaviour”—that is the applauding of the decision 
to take legal action against the chairman of the Canada Labour 
Relations Board—“to the bloody actions of the French Revolution 
and said it worried him”. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I'm concerned as a citizen,” Judge Joyal said from the bench, 
“that with immunity, a minister of the Crown can get up in the 
House—on the basis of I don't know what—and say, `I'm going to 
fire this guy,' and everybody is up and cheering. I was thinking 
of these people around the guillotine. I don't know if I have a 
right to intervene.  But it left a bad taste in my mouth”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not said in evidence. This was a justice musing from 
the bench. For example, by suggesting that the Minister of Labour 
uses parliamentary immunity to take an unfair action against a 
person, he is implying that if he spoke outside the House of 
Commons the Minister of Labour would be subject to some kind of 
civil suit, so he is imputing motives to the Minister of Labour. 
Not only that, he is comparing all of us, not one side or the 
other side, not backbenchers or frontbenchers, but all of us to 
the rabble of the French revolution, to people who are not in 
control of our ability to make good judgments in this House, 
people who are not in fact representatives of the people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I feel there is a prima facie case of contempt of 
Parliament in the judge's remarks.  There seems to be three 
possible courses of action in a situation like this.  One is that 
the House could decide to move a motion of censure.  Second, the 
House could decide to send the issue to committee where it could 
be debated and appropriate action determined. Finally, the judge 
could be called to the bar to explain the context and the 
intention of his remarks. There is something to be said for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did apply to the federal court to get the transcript of his 
remarks so I could see the context of what he said and so I could 
see what else he said. Unfortunately the transcripts are not 
available.  Apparently it is a case where the judge has control 
over the transcripts and a parliamentarian like myself cannot 
obtain them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to suggest that we should be unfair to the judge 
but I think we should look very seriously at this third option of 
bringing him to the bar to explain himself.  But Mr. Speaker, 
this is subject to whether you feel there is a prima facie case 
of contempt of Parliament in the circumstances I have just 
described. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the concern of the hon. member who has read as we all 
have the very disturbing comments in the paper.  I agree with his 
conclusions that something should be done.  It should be sent to 
committee or somehow investigated by this House, since this House 
has been accused by a high court official while sitting on the 
bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker, that the genesis of 
this and just a bit of the background is that another independent 
officer of this House, a representative of the auditor general 
was the person who originally brought this situation forward. 
That person too was not openly criticized by the judge but I 
suppose by inference is part of the rabble the judge refers to 
since he is also highlighted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker, that members 
of the official opposition asked questions during question period 
which brought this to a head and highlighted this question.  I 
think it was the member for St. Albert who brought this question 
forward. The Minister of Labour responded after a certain number 
of questions with the solution that this man must be dismissed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When motive is impugned, as has already been mentioned, not only 
to the government but by inference to all of us including the 
official opposition, including the auditor general who brought 
forward the case of how ridiculous this situation was and how it 
needed to be remedied and when the remedy was brought to bear on 
it we have all been smeared with the comments that we are acting 
somehow inappropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the actions of the minister were appropriate, as were 
the actions of the official opposition and the auditor general. 
Certainly I concur with the member's conclusion that this must be 
investigated and I believe a censure will be forthcoming 
following that investigation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B> Very briefly 
I would urge you, Mr. Speaker, to take this question of privilege 
very seriously.  I am sure if the reverse obtained and members of 
Parliament were reflecting on the decisions of a judge with a 
similar looseness of lips, many people would have been very quick 
to criticize us for blurring the line between the judiciary and 
the legislative function, and properly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think an equal requirement is laid upon the judiciary not to 
make comments which express contempt for members of Parliament or 
for this House. I would urge you to examine the record in this 
case.  Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, you will be able to obtain what the 
hon. member who raised the point of privilege was not able to 
obtain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, we already know enough of what was said for there 
to be significant concern.  I urge the Chair to reflect on this 
and come back to the House with a ruling that enables Parliament 
to protect itself against this kind of comment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am generally supportive of the remarks of my friend 
from Winnipeg—Transcona.  However, I would not agree that the 
same rules apply to parliamentarians in this place as apply to 
judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a reciprocal rule at all.  I think we in 
this House are very free to comment on matters in front of the 
bench as we see fit.  We in this House have a historic immunity 
that is there for the people of this country.  It is there for a 
reason.  It may be correct that judges are restricted.  I will 
get into that in just a moment, but I do not agree we in the 
House are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the matter at hand, I suggest there are at least two 
perspectives on this event on the remarks of the judge.  The 
first one is that the judge, in making his remarks, appears to 
have embraced the role or mantle of a citizen and felt that it 
was in order for him to pass comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any citizen in this country is free to pass comment in words 
such as those used by the judge outside the courtroom on this 
House.  We are a nation that embraces our freedom.  Comments 
about how we do our business in this place are most appropriate. 
We love to hear it.  Keep those cards and letters coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one perspective.  The judge apparently, in my view, 
respectfully forgot that he was on the bench.  As a judge, he is 
not free to meddle in the politics of this place.  As I 
understand it, he is not free to meddle in any of the politics of 
the nation.  He is there to do a job on the bench interpreting 
the law and fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others in here may stand corrected if the facts turn out to be 
other than those reported. That meddling is worthy of rebuke and 
I regret the apparently profound ignorance that judge has of the 
purpose of this place and the role we fill as members of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That ignorance is reflected only in his remarks made perhaps by 
the seat of the pants while on the bench, I do not know. However, 
those limited back of the envelope comments were a disappointment 
to me and certainly worthy of note on the record in the House 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of how the House should respond, I realize this is a 
matter of privilege.  I realize before anything can go further we 
have an obligation here to put in place a prima facie case that a 
privilege of the House has been breached, in this case an alleged 
contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret this House would have to take the step of finding a 
prima facie contempt on the part of a judge.  If that were to be 
the case, I am sure the judge would perhaps want to have looked 
back and done it differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an alternative to placing on Mr. Speaker the burden of 
finding there was perhaps a contempt, perhaps it would be 
appropriate—I offer this to colleagues in the House in the hope 
that it may be viable—to unanimously agree that the issue is one 
that has been brought to the attention of the House, is of 
concern to members of the House, and we would ask the Clerk to 
refer the matter to the Canadian Judicial Council for comment, if 
any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the matter be responded to by the council, that the Clerk 
make the House aware through Mr. Speaker and, if so advised after 
that, the House deal with the matter, if it is a matter of 
contempt or otherwise as you may give us your advice on.

<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As always, a matter of privilege is 
taken very seriously by me.  I have some facts placed before me 
now.  Surely one of the alternatives that has been placed here 
for my consideration, that this matter be brought before the 
House, has been fulfilled in the sense that members have brought 
it up and we have discussed it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked to judge whether or not there has been a 
contempt of this parliament on which we should take some type of 
action.  This is the first time in my memory, having been here 
some 20-odd years, that such a case has ever arisen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get more information for myself.  I appreciate 
the advice and opinions that have been given to me by members 
from all sides.  Perhaps you would permit me to reflect on the 
whole situation, considering the alternative brought up by the 
hon. member for Scarborough—Rouge River and considering what has 
been asked of us by the hon. member who moved the question of 
privilege a little earlier.  I said the member for 
Hamilton—Wentworth and I stand corrected on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to the House after due deliberation and after I 
have satisfied myself as to the pertinent facts about this issue. 
I will take it under advisement and I will return to the House if 
necessary.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset I would like to add my words of 
appreciation that the member for Wentworth—Burlington raised 
that question.  Since he quite clearly described what constitutes 
a contempt of the House I will not repeat what he has already 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on a question of privilege with regard to the actions of 
the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board and his 
officials which I believe constitute a contempt of the House and 
a contempt of the office and authority of the Speaker.  First I 
will address the issue of contempt of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 21, 1998 the minister met in Regina to discuss the 
rules for the election of directors to the Canadian Wheat Board's 
board of directors as proposed in Bill C-4, an act to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act.  Substantial amendments to Bill C-4 
tabled at report stage by opposition members had yet to be 
debated in the House.  While the House is still debating how many 
directors should be farmer elected versus government appointees, 
the minister was holding meetings as though his bill were already 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sort of thing has been complained about in the House a 
number of times in the past.  Each time it is brought to the 
Speaker's attention, the Speaker has declined to rule in favour 
of a prima facie question of privilege.  However he did leave the 
door open since these actions are clearly insulting and offensive 
to this institution and may constitute a contempt in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 29, 1997 the member for Fraser Valley brought to the 
Chair's attention a similar case regarding the Department of 
Finance.  The Chair ruled on the matter on November 6, 1997 and 
made this statement: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Chair acknowledges that this matter is a matter of 
potential importance since it touches the role of members as 
legislators, a role which should not be trivialized.  It is from 
this perspective that the actions of the Department are of some 
concern.  The dismissive view of the legislative process, 
repeated often enough, makes a mockery of our parliamentary 
conventions and practices. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Speaker that these actions repeated often 
enough make a mockery of our parliamentary conventions and 
practices.  I suggest that making a mockery of parliament 
diminishes the respect due to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 250 of the second edition of Joseph Maingot's 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> the following is stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—there are actions that, while not directly in a physical way 
obstructing the House of Commons or the Member, nevertheless 
obstruct the House in the performance of its functions by 
diminishing the respect due it. 
</UL></UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the actions of the minister and his officials 
distinctly constitute a contempt of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to my argument is the issue of the minister and his 
officials knowingly and deliberately ignoring a warning from the 
Speaker.  In the ruling of November 6, 1997 the Speaker said: “I 
trust that today's decision at this early stage of the 36th 
Parliament will not be forgotten by the minister and his 
officials and that the departments and agencies will be guided by 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that these recent actions have reached a new level of 
indignity, since a minister is no longer just snubbing his nose 
at backbench members of Parliament but now is also snubbing the 
Speaker's direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 21, 1978, at page 3978 of <I>Hansard</I>, the Speaker 
ruled that in the final analysis, in the areas of doubt, the 
Speaker asks simply:  “Does the act complained of appear at 
first sight to be a breach of privilege?—to put it shortly, has 
the member an arguable point?  If the Speaker feels any doubt on 
the question, he should—leave it to the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous complaints against the government in these matters 
were legitimate complaints.  The question as to whether or not 
they constituted a prima facie question of privilege may have 
given the Speaker some doubt in the past.  However, even if doubt 
existed, there are precedents to support the Speaker's putting 
the question to the House.  You should also consider that this 
time it is not just a matter of doubt. There has been an 
additional complaint against a department and the department has 
acted, despite the warning issued by the Speaker.  The Speaker's 
warning was direct, clear and deliberate.  It could not have been 
any clearer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 225 of Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in 
Canada</I> contempt is described as an offence against the 
authority or dignity of the House.  The minister and his 
officials have gone further and brought the authority and dignity 
of the Speaker into question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that you take the advice from the Speaker's ruling of 
March 21, 1978 and leave this matter to the House because, at a 
minimum, there must at least be doubt in your mind regarding this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you rule this matter to be a prima facie question of 
privilege I am prepared to move the appropriate motion.  I think 
it is high time that this House demonstrate to the ministers and 
their departments a little democracy over bureaucracy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to support the arguments put forward by my colleague and 
remind you that while there may not be any precedents for this 
offence there is no reason why you cannot allow the member's 
motion to be put to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May's 21st edition at page 115 states that an offence 
for contempt “may be treated as contempt even though there is no 
precedent for the offence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 221 of Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in 
Canada</I> describes a prima facie case of privilege in the 
parliamentary sense as one where the evidence on its face, as 
outlined by the member, is sufficiently strong for the House to 
be asked to debate the matter and to send it to a committee to 
investigate whether the privileges of the House have been 
breached or a contempt has even occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has demonstrated that the evidence in this case is 
sufficiently strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be of help and interest to this House to understand what 
led to this particular question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker was asked to rule on a similar complaint on March 9, 
1990 regarding a pamphlet put out by the government concerning 
the GST.  Again on March 25, 1991 another complaint was launched 
on a similar matter.  These complaints, while worthy of 
discussion, were not ruled to be prima facie questions of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A stronger case was made on October 28, 1997 by the hon. member 
for Fraser Valley.  In that instance the Department of Finance 
went much further and actually started to take action before the 
bill authorizing the department to act was passed by the House. 
The member argued that these actions undercut the authority of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to the Speaker's ruling which contained what I 
believed to be a strong statement and a strong warning. At that 
point the Speaker made it clear that the tolerance for such 
actions was wearing thin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that the case put forward by the hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River represents another incremental affront to the 
House and a case for a prima facie contempt of Parliament against 
the ministers and their departments has reached the flashpoint.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to question past rulings regarding complaints of 
this nature.  I recognize that Speakers must always be prudent in 
determining a prima facie question of privilege.  The seriousness 
of the complaint brought to your attention by my colleague 
concerns offences that have escalated to the point where inaction 
will only serve to question the legitimacy of the House, its 
members and the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a time to be prudent because this continued disrespect 
has already cast a cloud of doubt over the role of this 
institution.  It is time, Mr. Speaker, that we settle this matter 
once and for all, and I urge you to allow the member to propose 
his motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as you know I have been one of the people driving the 
issue of making the wheat board accountable.  When we were 
interviewing witnesses before the standing committee on Bill C-4 
they tried to rule me in conflict of interest because I was part 
of a group of farmers holding the wheat board accountable before 
the courts in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no court action at that time.  I removed myself and 
asked them to get a ruling whether I would be in conflict because 
my lawyers had said that I was not in conflict.  I was never 
given a ruling on that and I did not mind that too much.  I will 
accept mistakes and things said in the heat of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after I picked up the <I>Western Producer</I> and I was 
astounded that the member for Simcoe—Grey at that time indicated 
outside the House that “if he tries to get involved in a debate 
when this bill is brought back before the full House this week, I 
will demand that the Speaker remove him from that debate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected to uphold the laws of the country.  I had to take 
the action of a civil route in the courts to try to get the wheat 
board accountable.  When as a member of Parliament I am not 
allowed or threatened not to be allowed to participate in the 
debate of something that is important to every resident of my 
constituency, there is something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River raises this 
question of privilege I think he is dead right.  You should be 
looking into this matter, Mr. Speaker.  I would appreciate that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add my voice to those parliamentarians who feel 
their job here has been jeopardized by the minister of 
agriculture presupposing that the legislation would pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 40 some amendments to Bill C-4, all of which have not 
had the opportunity of debate in the House of Commons at report 
stage.  I represent an agricultural riding.  There is significant 
resistance to the whole move to change the Canadian Wheat Board 
under Bill C-4.  Many of the amendments proposed are a direct 
result of farmers in my riding asking that these changes not be 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that I have been unable to do my job as a result of the 
minister publicly stating that he wants the board of directors in 
place before the legislation has been debated properly on the 
floor of the House of Commons and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it makes a mockery of our system.  I believe, Mr. 
Speaker, that you should investigate this matter because I think 
there is still ample opportunity to defeat the legislation or 
have amendments made that would significantly change the 
legislation.  What the minister is doing presupposes what the 
House will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is important that I know if members 
either support or do not support, but it is more important for me 
to have additional information if it is at all possible about the 
particular case.  I would ask hon. members—I presume if you 
stand that you are in support—after we are past that to offer me 
some concrete evidence which will help in my decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, you asked for some concrete evidence.  I will be very 
brief.  The day after this meeting was held in Regina on January 
21, I held a meeting in Yorkton with 300 farmers present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those farmers came up to me afterward and asked me this 
direct question:  “In light of what the minister is doing, he 
has already assumed that the bill is passed.  Why are we even 
discussing these amendments?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a little background information.  The 300 farmers 
who assembled in Yorkton on January 22, the day after that, came 
there with the intent of discussing three major amendments that I 
had proposed.  They asked me what the point was of even 
discussing them if the minister had already assumed that the 
legislation passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That shows the seriousness of this discussion.  They see 
parliament as being a useless exercise because of what the 
minister has done.  The amendments I put forward were viewed with 
disdain, with being a useless exercise because they said that he 
was already talking about putting in place the board of directors 
as if the bill were passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of Parliament I am wasting my time.  That is how 
serious the matter is.  We really have been undermined by the 
actions of the minister because they see us as not having any 
effect in this place.  I think it is very serious and I offer 
that concrete evidence to you, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  I want to make a correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will allow a correction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in my question of 
privilege I referred to the minister as the minister of 
agriculture.  It is not the minister of agriculture but the 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board to whom I 
refer.  He was formerly the minister of agriculture. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>

this question of privilege as fair minded people, all of you.  We 
have heard from five interveners.  I for one would like to get 
more information if we could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for 
the Canadian Wheat Board was named by all five interveners.  I 
would like to hear from him, if it is at all possible, just what 
transpired on the other side.  In fairness, I am sure the House 
would agree that the least we will do is hear from the minister.

the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board reports to 
you. Would the Speaker ask the minister to make that report in 
parliament so that we could hear it as well?  It would be nice to 
hear his side of the story in a public forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It would be my intention to ask the minister 
to speak here.  This is our forum.  I will ask the minister or

one of the rocks out and expect you to say  “Thank you for the

that the idea a nation could tax itself into prosperity was one 
of the cruelest delusions which had ever befuddled the human 
mind.  That is exactly what has happened with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has filled our boots full of rocks.  It is going 
to take out a couple of little pebbles and say “Now don't you 
feel better for this?”  I do not feel any better for this, not a 
bit better.  The idea that all these taxes will make me a 
prosperous person and that the constituents I represent will 
suddenly be rolling in the dough is one of the cruelest delusions 
that has ever befuddled the human mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just think of a few of these facts.  The Liberal tax 
policies mean that a single mother with one child and an income 
of 15,000 lousy dollars will pay $1,364 in income tax.  The bill 
reinforces that by stating it is a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lady is trying to raise a child on $15,000 a year.  Imagine 
trying to live on $15,000.  I cannot even imagine it.  Imagine a 
single mom being forced to live on this amount.  She has 
pressures and stress, and the government comes along and says 
“You know you were going to buy some winter coats for your kids. 
I will take that $1,364 right off the top”.  That is cruel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about those who are almost middle class, not quite but 
almost?  What if they make $30,000 a year?  The bill states that 
it is a good idea to take $11.2 billion from people who make 
$30,000 a year and less.  Indications in Bill C-28 are that this 
is a good idea and people should be grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact they will probably stand in their place over 
there and say that the bill allows people to give more to 
charity.  People making $15,000 a year are charity cases 
themselves.  They do not have any money to give to charity.  Any 
money they might have had has been taken off the top by the 
finance minister who slurped the top off this bit of money the 
woman in my example has and said “If you had ever thought of 
giving to charity I am going to make sure you cannot.  Thank you 
very much, that is mine”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Churchill was right.  It is a cruel delusion Liberals seem to 
hold to that high taxes will bring prosperity for all.  I do not 
know why they do not just get right at it.  Why do they not just 
make the tax 100%?  We would all be so fabulously wealthy we 
would not know what to do with all the extra money.  They could 
just take it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows the old story.  I am surprised it is not in here. 
The new income tax form would a very short form.  On one line it 
would say: “How much money did you make?” On the second line: 
“Just send it all to me”.  It would be signed by the Minister 
of Finance.  It would be much simpler and maybe we would be all 
richer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the gall over there with them saying that the Income Tax 
Act and the tax system in Canada are for the benefit of all 
Canadians.  The Liberals have raised taxes 37 times since they 
took office.  I would be happy to table the list, but what is the 
point?  I do not imagine Liberals would read it.  Every time we 
turn around in income taxes they have failed to index basic 
deductions.  Imagine what that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that the average family in Canada has seen its income 
drop by $3,000 since the Liberals took office.  Real spending 
money has dropped by $3,000.  We now spend more to service the 
debt which the Liberals seem happy with than we spend on food, 
clothing and shelter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they not take it all?  We can all go over to the finance 
minister's house and enjoy the wealth together, except those who 
are rich enough to divert the funds somewhere where they do not 
have to pay the taxes.  The lady who is making $15,000 is not one 
of those people, but there are plenty over there.  That is a 
shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be done? To begin with, there should not be 450 some 
pages of gobbledegook in Bill C-28 that we have to try to wade 
through to find some meat and potatoes for the average family. 
We should be saying to these people, the single mother trying to 
raise a child, a family trying to make $30,000, hardly wealthy, 
we can offer you some help and here is how we are going to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could only get the government to listen I would read it 
something like this.  Why not reduce the GST when it gets a 
chance to help the family that has to pay GST on every little 
thing it buys for its home?  Why not increase the basic personal 
amount? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In question period today the Leader of the Opposition pointed 
out that in Canada we start paying taxes at $6,500 a year. 
Unbelievable.  The government asks people who make $6,500 to 
support the national debt that it has run up.  That is less than 
$600 a month.  I do not say I am going to emulate the United 
States, but imagine if we could have $9,500 before the tax rate 
cut in.  What would you do with the extra $3,000 that is untaxed? 
You might be able to buy shoes for your kids.  That would be the 
basics.  You might be able to start to invest.  You might be able 
save for the future.  You might do all kinds of good things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if you raised the spousal amount equivalent to 
the basic personal amount?  What about the family making $30,000 
who says just let me take home a little more of my money and I 
will look after my kids. If you would just leave me some money, I 
will look after quite a bit.  But if you are going to take it 
away you will have to replace it with massive national government 
programs, where they take all your money, you send it to Ottawa, 
they deduct 50% for handling and they send it back to you in 
services you never asked for.  They deduct a chunk all along the 
way.  Why not just leave the money with the people?  What an 
advantage that would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if you eliminated the surtax the Tories brought in?  What 
if you said to somebody if you do manage to make $50,000 to 
$60,000 a year, although that is not exactly rolling in the 
Cayman Islands, we will not surtax you anymore?  We will let you 
invest in businesses.  We will let you invest in your pension 
plan.  We will let you invest in your children's education and 
their future.  We will let you build prosperity in your home 
town. Instead, if you happen to be a farmer, you happen to have a 
good year, you make $60,000, you pay a surtax because you are 
considered a bad asset for Canada and they take the money the 
money away.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if you reduced capital gains taxes?  Capital gains taxes 
kill initiative.  What if they allowed students, people who we 
saw protesting in the streets the other day, to claim a tax 
deduction for interest payments on student loans?  What if they 
reduced job killing payroll taxes like CPP and EI?  What if they 
passed a taxpayer bill of rights so they could not hog the money 
to finance the future and borrow on our children's future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they did all of that they would have adopted the Reform 
Party's plan “Securing Your Future”.  That is what they would 
have done.  Instead of a hopeless 455 page document that says the 
future is ours because we are the government, it would have been 
the future is yours and we are going to help you secure it.  What 
a difference if securing future were the aim of this document 
instead of lining the bank vaults in Ottawa.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, today we are debating Bill C-28.  As we come back from 
our break newly minted, rested and enthusiastic, what red meat 
does the government throw in front of Parliament to really do 
something on behalf of the Canadian people? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT70"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT70"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It throws in front of us a 464 page bill that was introduced 
just before Parliament broke last time. To help us understand 
this bill there are 578 pages of explanation that say things like 
the individual is not entitled to deduct any amount under 
division c, computation of taxable income over the year except 
under section 111 of the act, lost carryovers. You get the 
picture, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are with the country facing some pretty major problems: 
a falling dollar, unemployment, low incomes for Canadians, 
problems with education, declining health care services.  What do 
we discuss here?  Our first few days back with all the energy and 
enthusiasm that we brought from meeting with our constituents and 
talking to the people of Canada, we talk about changes to the 
Income Tax Act, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the Canada 
pension plan, Children's Special Allowances Act, the Companies' 
Creditors Arrangement Act, the Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act and at least 12 other acts and sets of regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government to get real about what is important 
to Canadians. As many of my colleagues have said, it is not 
housekeeping that we should be dealing with, it is the real meat 
of Canadian life, and that is what this government is trying to 
avoid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians care deeply about taxes because that is what eats in 
to the resources they have available to build a life for 
themselves and their families, to meet their needs and those of 
their children and seniors in their families, and yet those 
resources are being depleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this act really says to Canadians is that the government 
can decide how you should spend your money better than you can. 
It gives a little here, it takes a little here, it adjusts a 
little there, it nudges there, it puts up a carrot here, it puts 
up a stick over there and whacks us and says do this, do that. We 
will support this with your money. That is what this government 
has done for so many years. It knows better. It can tell the rest 
of us peasants who just earn the money how it should be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just astounded with the government speakers, as this bill 
was introduced into second reading, just praising this bill, 
saying things like it is going to encourage charitable donations. 
Out of what?  We have families in this country whose income has 
been steadily decreased because of Liberal taxes and bracket 
creep and hidden tax measures.  What are they going to do to have 
charitable donations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet here is the government saying it is going to encourage 
charitable donations. It is the same government that cut back on 
transfers to the provinces by 40% for social services to help the 
needy and vulnerable in our society.  Now it says it will 
encourage charitable donations. Perhaps it does not know the 
meaning of the word hypocrisy but it sure does demonstrate it in 
its legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the speakers opposite said we are going to increase the 
contribution limit for registered education savings plans. Aren't 
we wonderful? You can save more for your children's education. 
Feel good about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same government has cut funding for post-secondary education 
by billions of dollars and now says but feel good, you can now 
save a little more for your children's education. They are going 
to have to because this government has cut funding for that 
important resource, the training and education of our children in 
the future workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are Canadians going to save with when family incomes are 
declining and being eroded not only by taxes but by increased 
service charges and every aspect of government is costing us more 
and more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then speakers opposite said we are going to get rid of tax 
shelter abuse. Goodness sake, it would be terrible if Canadians 
tried to shelter some of their income from the tax man or the 
finance minister, who of course knows nothing about sheltering 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, here we have a government just intent on getting every 
single nickel out of Canadians possible, taxing everything that 
moves through the grass. Do members know why? So the finance 
minister can get up in three weeks and say aren't I great?  We 
are now living within our means. We don't have to borrow money. I 
guess not, because he has gouged every nickel possible out of 
hardworking Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their taxes have gone up billions and billions of dollars under 
this finance minister's administration, $24 billion over the last 
three years.  That is why he does not have to borrow so much 
money.  He has taken it out of the pockets of Canadians rather 
than getting his own house in order, cutting spending and having 
program after program designed to tweak this, give a little extra 
to this and encourage that and support this politically good 
cause that the Liberals think is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly why he is able to have some bragging rights.  It 
is on the backs of hardworking Canadians.  We need to know that. 
We do not need to let him get away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about promoting film video production in Canada.  We do 
not have health care.  Our young people carry massive debt just 
from trying to get training so that they can have a decent 
living, if they can find a job in this country.  Yet the 
government has nothing better to do than to just continue to 
tinker in industry when study after study has shown these 
tax measures have unintended consequences that very often have 
exactly the opposite effect and the government brags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last one is so amusing. We are going to make it easier 
to facilitate transfers from registered retirement income funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had an Industry Canada study that showed that Canadian 
saving rates have fallen from 12% to 2%.  People are collapsing 
their funds because they simply do not have enough to live on by 
the time the finance minister's tax man gets off their doorstep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have retirement security in this country being cut time after 
time by this government, yet here we have members opposite saying 
they are going to do this little thing that will make it easier 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hypocritical.  It is contemptible to treat Canadian people 
that way.  That is just a sample of the kind of tinkering that 
this bill does instead of really giving some meat and some real 
substance and some real vision to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was struck in question period by the same kind of rhetoric and 
hypocrisy that we had before where a question was asked to the 
defence minister about the shabby treatment of our armed forces 
and the low pay, where people at the lowest levels of our armed 
forces actually are on welfare in many cases to support their 
families.  They live in substandard housing and have second jobs 
delivering pizzas to meet the bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the minister do?  He got up and said we really have to 
support our armed forces who stand on the front lines and protect 
us and who are there to help us in times of emergency.  Rah, rah, 
flying the flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows the actions of his government lead to the poverty and 
to the strained circumstances in family after family in the armed 
forced.  Yet he has the nerve to stand up and say boy, these guys 
deserve our support, and then not give it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a saying that in America politicians can say whatever 
they want as long as they do the right thing.  In Canada they can 
do whatever they want as long as they say the right thing.  That 
is exactly how the Liberals operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They always say the right thing.  Everyone says boy, these guys 
really have our interests at heart.  They feel our pain.  What do 
they do?  They continue to inflict the pain on us while saying 
nice things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we woke up and started doing what was right for 
Canadians instead of just saying nice things, giving reassuring 
words with no substance behind them.  That is just another 
example of what we have to fight here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to help people in our country, if we really 
want to give relief and a good living and bright futures to our 
citizens, then we have to recognize that we cannot spend their 
money better than they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take the minimum out of their pockets to give them 
good services where it is important for them to do so and let 
them decide how to spend the rest, what causes to support, how to 
help others and how to care for their families' futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These made in Ottawa government managed programs are destroying 
our future, our hope and our standard of living.  I appeal to 
this government to start recognizing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is like a running cafeteria.  It has different 
dishes laid out for people to choose from.  Then it finally 
decides that the people who are eating at the cafeteria are 
malnourished.  They are not getting good nourishment. What do 
they do?  They decide well, instead of having so much spaghetti 
we will have more beans. 
Instead of having lasagna maybe we will have bacon and eggs. 
Instead of making a wholesale change in the way nourishment is 
provided they are just changing the dishes around a bit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has a new and vibrant approach to giving real

and by letting them keep their own money to meet their own needs. 
It is time we moved in a new direction for the country and that 
is what we will be working toward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, if I had closed my eyes for a moment I would have sworn 
that was an NDP member of Parliament talking about education, 
health care and workers.  My God, something is happening to the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise in opposition to Bill C-28.  I find it rather amusing 
when my Reform colleagues talk about people making $15,000 a year 
and how difficult that would be.  Yes, I agree.  It is very 
difficult for any worker who is looking after children and making 
$15,000 a year to get by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind the House and all those who are listening that 
under the Reform agenda every worker in the country would 
probably make $15,000 or $20,000 a year.  With its anti-union and 
anti-worker bias everybody would be making that.  The Reform 
Party loves this global competition we are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since free trade, the NAFTA and now that the MAI, which I 
call NAFTA on steroids, have come into effect all that has 
happened is that Canadian working standards have dropped and 
dropped.  They tell us that Mexican and third world standards are 
supposed to rise, which we know is simply false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the taxation problems of a couple in 
my riding, Mr. and Mrs. Fleming, who live in Grand Lake, Nova 
Scotia.  She has a plastic hip, plastic ankles and plastic 
knuckles.  She is severely arthritic and requires oxygen 
cylinders to survive on a daily basis.  She and her husband 
wanted to look after themselves in their own home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has suggested that because of her needs she 
should be in a rehabilitation centre.  That would cost the 
average Nova Scotian or Canadian taxpayer anywhere from $150 to 
$250 a day.  All they are asking for from the government and from 
Revenue Canada is to be able to write off the equipment she 
requires so they can stay at home and look after themselves.  I 
find it disturbing that the government, through our 
correspondence with Revenue Canada, will not even answer our 
letters or respond in kind to that type of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that it will spend thousands and 
thousands of dollars to look after them but these people want to 
stay at home and look after themselves, which would only cost a 
couple of thousand dollars.  I find it absurd that the government 
would try to pass the comprehensive bill before us without 
thinking about the effect it will have on people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not once have I heard the Reform Party today speak about the GST 
or the HST.  It would be a real pleasure if a Reformer stood in 
the House, especially for Atlantic Canadians, to say “If the 
government really wanted to do something about tax relief it 
would reduce the GST on essential home heating oils, electricity, 
children's clothing and reading materials”.  That would mean 
broad tax relief for every Canadian, especially those in Atlantic 
Canada, and not just for the very wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talked about the RESP educational funds.  I should 
remind them that people need a job that pays well before they can 
save any money to put away for their children's future. I should 
remind them of what happened today in Goose Bay, Labrador.  The 
defence minister stood in the House today to talk about how great 
the military is.  I agree with him that we have one of the finest 
military organizations in the world.  Unfortunately a lot of the 
civilian people who work in the military are being asked to make 
major sacrifices in their pay and benefits.  Some of them will go 
from $13 an hour to $6.50 an hour.  They will certainly not have 
enough money left in their pockets to get RESPs to look after 
their children's future education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for Liberals and the Reformers especially. 
They talked about more money for charities and bigger tax 
deductions.  My question is quite simple.  Who is responsible for 
the welfare of those less fortunate in society? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking of the disabled, the infirm, people with no jobs, 
students and so on.  Should it be government that looks after the 
welfare of those people, or should it be the responsibility of 
charities?  I will let the House ponder that question for a 
while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a letter that a constituent in Nova Scotia wrote 
which shows the complexity of the tax system.  If it is this 
complex how can we even trust the government to come up with 
something that is new?  It brings to my attention an article on 
page 2 of Revenue Canada's winter 1997 GST-HST News, No. 27, 
entitled “Tax Status on Salads'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year the tangle of absurdity of Revenue Canada seems to get 
worse and worse, but this surely is a masterpiece even by its 
sorry standards.  Let me offer a portion.  Food containing 
ingredients, whether mixed or not, such as chopped, shredded, 
diced, sliced or pureed vegetables, meat, fish, eggs or other 
food when supplied with a dressing and/or seasonings, whether or 
not the dressing is mixed with other ingredients, is considered 
to be a salad for the purposes of determining its GST-HST status. 
A combination of one ingredient and a dressing of seasonings 
which is sold or represented as a salad is also considered to be 
a salad.  All supplies of salads, except those that are canned or 
vacuum sealed, are taxable at 7%, 15% in the participating 
provinces.  Generally if there is no dressing or seasoning 
applied to the ingredients and no dressing or seasoning is 
packaged separately with the ingredients, the package is not 
considered to be a salad and is zero rated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many hours were spent trying to figure that one out?  If 
this were not happening in my own country I would be mildly 
entertained.  Sadly it is sand in the gears of commerce and 
enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more that the bill the government is 
presenting is so complicated that even highly trained tax experts 
are having difficulty trying to get through it all.  I ask 
members of the Liberal Party to send the bill back, to rethink 
their options and to simplify it so that ordinary Canadians and 
even many politicians here today could understand the 
complexities of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
yesterday morning, Bill C-28 was introduced in this House. This is a 
rather bulky document and it is clear from reading these 461 pages that 
much of it is meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to the financial administration of this 
country. Before the 1970s, at the end of every year, the Canadian 
finance minister would report either a surplus or a small deficit and, 
as a result, there was no Canadian debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, 1968 saw the election of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Thanks to 
his delusions of grandeur and his lack of talent for public 
administration, we started accumulating one deficit after the other. 
During the Trudeau years, from 1968 to 1984, not counting of course the 
nine-month Conservative interlude under Joe Clark, Trudeau and his 
cabinet, in which, we will recall, the current Prime Minister served as 
Minister of Finance for several years, managed to build a monstrous 
$250-billion accumulated debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, we changed our red car for a blue one. The ideas put 
forward then were those of the Conservatives, who reminded me at the 
time of calves stampeding out of the barn for the first time in the 
spring. Stir-crazy. You will no doubt recall that there was one spending 
scandal a month and, in nine years, the accumulated deficit grew from

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, we traded cars again and went back to a red one. Of 
course, the deficits continued to rise, to the point where we now 
collectively owe some $570 billion, with a zero deficit being 
anticipated this year. We even expect a surplus, and the Liberals are 
beginning to wheel and deal on how surpluses should be shared out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind you that, year in year out, we currently pay $44 
billion—and this will please former Social Credit members—in 
interest alone. 
The Minister of Finance, who is very astute, says “We will avoid having 
to pay interest; we will reduce transfers to the provinces by the same 
amount”.  The same minister managed, over a three-year period, to reduce 
by $42 billion the transfers to the provinces for hospitals, post-secondary 
education and social assistance, so that it is not uncommon to 
see a student saddled with a debt of $25,000 to $30,000 by the time he 
or she gets his or her B.A.. Your child, and mine, has incurred that 
kind of debt to get his or her B.A.. Again, the current Minister of 
Finance is largely responsible for this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has some nerve. He is said to be a multimillionaire 
and he owns Canada Steamship Lines. And he is very very familiar with 
Canada's financial rules and also the rules of Revenue Canada. 
Do you know what he does in order to avoid paying taxes, or in 
order to pay as little as possible, in the country whose fiances he 
directs?  He registers his ships in tax havens, Barbados, Bermuda. 
That is our Minister of Finance.  We are sunk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> That sure looks bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> That sure 
look bad, as the hon. member for Longueuil so aptly puts it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the agriculture critic for my party, I would like to call 
to mind a problem we are all facing at the moment with the 
importing of butter oil, mainly from New Zealand and Australia, by 
the big and well-known multinational, Unilever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In late 1993, when we negotiated the GATT, later to become the 
WTO, agreements, it was agreed that agriculture on which there were 
quotas in Canada would be protected: dairy, eggs and poultry 
production. 
In order to protect those quotas, we set a very high duty, which to 
all intents and purposes made it virtually impossible to import 
dairy products, butter, poultry products and eggs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 461 page tome we are presented with here is full of 
loopholes.  When it has been weeded through, when experts like the 
Minister of Finance have weeded through it, it will be found to be 
full of loopholes.  Some companies have discovered the trick of 
importing butter oil at nearly zero duty, a mere 7% or 8%, so the 
amount of butter oil has doubled year after year for the past five 
years here in Canada, and you and I are now being served up second 
class ice cream at the same price as before.  Thus the dairy 
farmers of Canada have had a 3% drop in quotas, which represents 
close to $2,000 per dairy farm in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 47% of industrial milk produced in Canada is produced in 
Quebec, the dairy farmers of Quebec are being penalized nearly 50%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food insisted 
on resolving the impasse.  It involved dealing with the departments 
of finance, revenue, agriculture, foreign trade and, of course, the 
new food inspection agency because butter oil, which arrives by 
ship, must be checked to ensure it does not contain BST.  It also 
must be checked to see that it is of good quality and edible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there is a loophole, an error.  It can be imported under a 
different tariff schedule, a number that was changed so that 49% 
butter mixed with 51% sugar creates a mixture that, once in Canada, 
can be processed to make ice cream. 
Worse yet, the mixture can be put in a separator, the butter and 
sugar switched around and butter made. So what cannot be done 
legally can be done illegally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is passing, and I wanted to speak to you of a loophole. 
One of my constituents called me last week to tell me that she and 
her husband had started a company to operate their farm at Saint-Ludger, 
near Beauce.  They have farmed for 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives and not the Liberals were originally 
responsible, but the Liberals have not corrected the injustice.  I 
was informed that there was an accounting void between November 21, 
1985 and January 1, 1988 for farmers setting up a company within 
that time period. 
Before and after this period, the value of the milk quota can be 
included in the company and when the company is sold, no tax is 
paid on the value of this quota. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituent in Saint-Ludger is therefore penalized, but she 
is not the only one.  It is not encouraging, to be sure, but it is 
estimated that there are 300 producers in Quebec and over 1,200 
altogether in Canada penalized by this administrative oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Minister of Finance to rectify this situation, but 
it is taking a long time to get an answer.  For the ships flying 
the flag of Barbados, there is no problem.  These matters are 
quickly sorted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about employment insurance.  The 
Minister of Finance will soon achieve budget surpluses, but 
unfortunately it will be at the expense of the most disadvantaged. 
As we know, the gap between the rich and the poor is not getting 
any smaller. 
On the contrary, it is growing much wider.  The proof is that the 
government overtaxes workers on their EI premiums and has reduced 
the size of the cheque they receive to 55%, with the result that 
surpluses are accumulating that are expected to exceed $13 billion 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I must say that I am going to vote with my 
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois against Bill C-28, which leaves 
much to be desired.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it has been an interesting afternoon.  One would wonder 
sometimes on which side of the fence one should really sit. When 
I hear some of the hon. colleagues getting up and accusing the 
Reform for all the problems that we have in this country, I 
wonder whether I ran for the wrong party.  Then after I listen to 
that side, and those comments that well it is really the 
Conservatives that were ahead of the Liberals and they are to 
blame for all these bad policies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day somebody said to me “You know, governments have blamed 
everybody for the problems, even God”. Then the gentleman 
pointed out that it was all due to Christopher Columbus.  He said 
that Christopher Columbus was the first Liberal to come to North 
America.  I asked him how he knew that Christopher Columbus was 
the first Liberal and he said that when Christopher Columbus left 
Spain for the new world he did not know where he was going and 
when he arrived in North America he did not know where he was and 
he did it all on borrowed money.  Does that not sound about right 
for our country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe if we keep on looking for excuses we will eventually find 
somebody who will take the blame.  However, it is going to be a 
long time before that man arrives and does so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded today to hear the government side say how good 
things are here in Canada.  It is refunding all these tax 
credits.  I was beginning to wonder where these credits came 
from.  As a farmer, before I go to the hen house to gather eggs I 
have to put some work into getting the chickens to eat the grain 
and produce the eggs.  There had to be a source where the eggs 
came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering where the Liberal government got all these funds 
for refunds, tax credits and benefits as it claims to be doing 
under Bill C-28. It seems to me that it had to come from some 
borrowed money that it had in the past.  When I look at the 
ledger I think there is $600 billion of debt somewhere that 
future generations owe. It also seems to me that there is a 
Canada pension plan that has about a $560 billion unfunded 
liability.  That makes a trillion dollars plus of money that has 
come into source somehow and has been distributed.  We are now 
redistributing and redistributing and things just do not add up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard the prime minister in question period say that his 
government would pay back a billion dollars of debt or liability, 
I quickly figured that out and found that on $600 billion and 
$560 billion it would take about 1,100 years which will be the 
next millennium.  There is not much chance for me or my children 
or my grandchildren to have any of those benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What these people in government do not realize—and it does not 
matter whether it is Liberal, Conservative or NDP as we have had 
all three in provincial and federal governments—is that when 
cuts are made in one place, it affects everybody right down the 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election in the fall of 1993 we heard that Reform was 
the party that would slash, burn and destroy everything while 
every day of that campaign we said that education and health care 
would not be cut.  We now know that the Liberals had a different 
agenda.  They were really the ones who cut, burned and slashed as 
far as education and health care are concerned.  If I am right, 
about 40% of the funding has been cut back.  Now they are slowly 
starting to give a little bit of that back in order to get the 
whole system back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers probably felt it more than anybody else. Not only did we 
pay income tax on the farm, we also had to pay property taxes. 
There were a lot of years where farmers had poor crops or prices 
were poor and there was no taxable income. However, because 
governments cut back on transfer payments for education and 
health, the municipal governments still had to raise those funds 
which came back on the property taxes. In order to make up for 
those cutbacks and taxes, I would have to borrow from the banks 
or the credit unions or privately the funds needed to pay my 
property taxes or I would not be able to stay in production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that our governments do not seem to realize. 
We have to create wealth before we can tax.  We do not tax and 
then create wealth.  It does not work.  It does not work in the 
production of grain.  It does not work in the production of 
livestock. 
It does not work in the production of machinery or manufacturing 
of any sort.  We have to have inputs.  We have to create wealth 
before we can tax that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have been doing is we have been borrowing money to more 
or less give tax credits that should not have been given because 
there was no wealth to counter balance that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long will it take governments to realize that this is the 
way the system works.  Whether we call it an NDP government, 
Liberal or Conservative, the mathematics are there and they 
function only in one direction.  We can say one and one is three 
but it does not matter how often we say it, we will only have 
two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly the way it works in farming. I could say to 
those chickens,  “I pay 25% more tax and now you have to lay 25% 
more eggs”.  It does not work that way. I have to either get 
more chickens or I have to somehow manage them better so they can 
produce more.  That is what governments fail to realize.  I do 
not know when they will finally learn and change the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1988 election when the GST was brought in we heard that 
it was the vehicle that would finally get hold of the debt, that 
the GST would be a fair tax.  They called it the goods and 
services tax so that if one had wealth to buy the goods and 
services one could help to pay down the debt. We have never seen 
a figure or an account where any of that debt has been paid back 
by the GST.  We can say that was the Conservatives and we have it 
in black and white. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in the last election the Liberals all of sudden realized 
that it was a bad tax and it could buy votes if they did away 
with it.  They came out strong and heavy saying “We will kill 
the GST.  We will eliminate it”, or something else.  I forget 
what it all was but we still have it. When I go home I have to 
fill out the GST forms for a three month period.  They are always 
there waiting for me no matter whether I have anything to pay or 
not.  But it is still in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sad part.  Once we have a tax in the system, to get 
rid of that sucker is practically impossible no matter what 
government takes over.  It will have to be a government that does 
not care about buying votes.  That is the only way I can look at 
it.  By buying votes they do not get rid of taxes.  They make 
promises that do not have to be kept. That is the idea of 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in the comment made by my colleague from 
Calgary—Nose Hill about the difference between American politics 
and Canadian politics.  It makes sense that is probably what is 
happening.  When we look at the U.S. tax system it is about 30% 
less than ours.  It is not perfect but at least it is less. Its 
production is more efficient.  When we look at the value of the 
American dollar today and the value of our dollar, we almost need 
two of those little suckers that we call Canadian loonies 
compared to the American buck.  Why is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1976 I took my family on a little trip across the midwest.  I 
got $1.10 for that Canadian loonie.  That is how we were running 
our country at that time.  Our farmers and businessmen were 
producing well, but we have thrown so many taxes on these people 
that we have finally bled them to death and we are all suffering 
for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that changes some day because, Madam Speaker, both you 
and I will be better off.

this opportunity to address Bill C-28 which, as you know, seeks to amend 
numerous acts. Obviously, in order to speak on this complex issue, one 
has to be a tax expert or else have some common sense. Since I feel I do 
have some common sense, I will make my comments along those lines.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, journalist Claude Picher from the daily <I>La Presse</I> made a 
very sensible observation during the television program <I>Salut Bonjour</I>. 
He said “The Minister of Finance should use the expected surpluses to 
try to reduce the debt and individual income tax, and not pour money in 
new or existing programs”. This is a statement that makes a lot of sense 
and it is also sound advice to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like me, Mr. Picher could have pointed out that the GST was set up 
to take money from the taxpayers' pockets and use it to reduce the huge 
deficits of the central government. Since there is no longer a deficit, 
common sense should tell the government to reduce, if not abolish, the 
GST, and thus fulfil one of the promises made in the infamous red book 
of 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like me, he could also have talked about the transfers to the 
provinces. Everyone knows that the government, in an effort to reach a 
zero deficit and even generate surpluses, shamelessly cut billions of 
dollars in transfers to the provinces. These cuts hurt the provinces, 
which have had to deal with crises in the sectors of education, health 
and social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, common sense would dictate that this government restore 
transfer payments to their original level instead of talking about 
implementing new programs that would allow them once again to interfere 
in provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the logic in this government implementing new postsecondary 
education programs when, as we know, the cream of our young achievers 
university-trained at public expense are leaving for the United States 
or other countries because the Canadian tax system is inadequate? What 
would common sense dictate, given that this drain of scientists, 
computer specialists and other professionals leads to the drain of a 
large part of our capacity to innovate and, ultimately, our capacity to 
create jobs in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a worrisome situation on which no one, not even the 
Minister of Revenue, the Minister of Finance or the Prime Minister of 
Canada, can put an exact figure. 
In economic terms, the loss of the most dynamic, the most talented 
future members of our society is a disaster, an impoverishment of our 
society. Where is the sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brain drain makes taxation reform all the more important. It 
is high time our governments seriously addressed an in-depth reform of 
personal and small business income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Canada's taxation statistics, in the 1950s, 
individuals and corporations accounted for the same percentage of 
federal income tax revenues. In the decades since, fiscal policy has 
changed increasingly in favour of big business, so much so that in 
recent years individuals' contributions have increased eightfold. Where 
is the sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthwhile pointing out that the corporate share of 
federal tax revenues dropped from about 43% in 1961 to a meagre 10% 
in 1995. 
The main explanation for this is the proliferation of tax 
expenditures available to business, the major corporations in 
particular.  Where is the sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Minister of Revenue in agreement with the Minister of 
Finance, his colleague, who claims to be able to solve the deficit 
without increasing corporate income tax?  Why do the corporations 
manage to shelter income from tax by influencing taxation 
legislation?  Why are they allowed this legal strategy, while the 
strategy of individuals who decide to do work under the table 
without paying tax is deemed illegal?  This situation represents a 
serious threat to social equilibrium,  Where is the sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to understand why the disadvantaged, the people 
with little or no income, try to get out of paying taxes by every 
imaginable means. 
The Bloc Quebecois has long been calling for a job-oriented 
Canadian corporate tax reform. The Bloc Quebecois has long been after 
the federal government about its taxation policy, and will continue 
to do so, particularly where family trusts, the GST, tax havens 
etc. are concerned, so that this taxation system becomes fair and 
equitable for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us speak of family trusts.  This is a shortcoming in the 
federal legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report and pressure from the Bloc 
Quebecois have only partly succeeded in eliciting a reaction from 
the Minister of Finance on the subject.  It is still possible to 
leave the country without paying taxes owing to Revenue Canada, 
since an acceptable financial guarantee is sufficient. 
Furthermore, no reporting limit nor method of interest collection 
is provided for this guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the October 2 amendment to the Income Tax Act, the 
minister has been unable to report the tax plans this change has 
occasioned.  Where is good old common sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government should use the grab bag that is Bill 
C-28 to make the necessary changes to employment insurance 
contributions. 
It is vital the government reform the current employment insurance 
system in order to put an end to the inequities it gives rise to 
and to better protect workers, including seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also wants the Minister of Finance to 
substantially reduce the levels of contribution to the employment 
insurance plan, conditional on the job creation performance of 
business.  The reduction in contributions could be 40 cents per 
$100 of insurable payroll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance must also create an employment 
insurance fund separate from the federal government's consolidated 
fund, as the Auditor General of Canada proposed, to prevent money 
belonging to workers and employers being used as a discretionary 
fund by the federal government. 
It would make sense for the government to move quickly to pass an 
anti-deficit law like the one passed by the Quebec National 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of digging into the public's pockets, the government 
should cut all unnecessary spending and programs in its own 
departments.  As an example, I could mention the many millions of 
dollars spent to change Canada Post's logo.  That was the 
government's most recent stunt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other examples include the hundreds of millions of dollars 
spent rerouting international flights from Mirabel to Dorval, the 
purchase of helicopters deemed unacceptable by these same Liberals 
when the Conservatives were in office, the many millions spent by 
the Department of Canadian Heritage to brainwash the Canadian 
public, 
along with the millions of dollars spent on Option Canada, a bogus 
corporation, during the last referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop here, because the examples go on and on.  I hope 
that the auditor general's recommendations will finally be 
implemented and a stop put to this scandalous spending.  We are 
entitled to ask whether this government is acting wisely, whether 
the way it manages makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, it does not make sense, because this government's policies 
are widening the gap between the rich and the poor.  A tax system 
that drives a nation to poverty definitely makes no sense.  For 
this reason, and in solidarity with my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois, I will energetically oppose passage of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My common sense tells me that it is urgent that the people of 
Quebec stick together as they move towards sovereignty. 
That is what really makes sense.

have totally mismanaged the way they have run the affairs of this

we are falling back.  We do have to work hard.  One of the 
reasons is our tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our kids are going to be faced with a tax system that is even 
worse than the one we are faced with if the government keeps 
going the way it is.  I also mention, before I get into some 
details, the mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1969 we had a zero debt.  Then all of a sudden we decided 
that we better start spending.  By 1972 we were at $18 billion in 
debt. From there we started that downhill slide.  By 1984 we were 
up to about $180 billion in debt.  At that time most of us said 
that is enough.  A prime minister was elected who said we will 
not let that grow one more dollar, a $180 billion is a disgrace 
for a country like Canada to have as a debt.  The rest is 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 we found that the figure was about $300 billion, from a 
guy who said he would not let it grow another dollar.  By 1993, 
$489 billion and of course today, close to $600. That is total 
mismanagement.  That is government out of control.  That is 
irresponsibility.  That is saddling our children with something 
terrible over their head that they are going to pay for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People out there say they cannot trust government.  Government 
says it is going to get rid of the GST and it does not do it. 
Government says it is not going to let the debt grow and it 
doubles and it triples.  In the meantime government brags about 
what a wonderful job it is doing.  Government says that it was 
fixing the tax system.  What is it doing?  It is tinkering with 
the tax system.  It changes a little bit here, it changes a 
little bit there, but all of it adds up to increased dollars off 
that pay cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are talking about chickens or whether we are talking 
about businesses or whatever we are talking about, there is 
always a little more taken away.  Whether it is one and a half 
cents on a litre of gas that affects all of us, or whether it is 
changing the RRSP from age 71 to age 69, every time we do 
something like that the government squeezes a bit more out of the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the GST was there, the Liberals screamed and shouted they 
will get rid of it.  It is terrible.  In 1991, wow, this is the 
worst thing this government has ever done.  The government did 
pay the price.  We see what the Liberals have done in turn and we 
see what the people have done.  The people have gone underground 
because of that.  There is that much less tax being collected 
simply because that has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently we can talk about the CPP.  That is one that is 
really dear to my heart.  We had a promise from government that 
we would never let CPP premiums go beyond 5.5%.  In 1966 when the 
plan was designed, as early as 1967 bureaucrats were saying it 
was not going to work and we will never be able to maintain this 
with the demographics of this country.  We will never maintain it 
at 5.5%  So why does the government fess up, fix the plan now? 
Of course we waited 30 more years.  We now are tinkering again. 
We have now decided to raise the premiums 73%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are telling a young person who earns $38,000 as the 
maximum instead of contributing $945 a year, you get to 
contribute $1,635 a year and your employer matches it. What a 
great deal that is, $3,300 a year. 
If it is paid for 30, 35 or 40 years, $8,800 will be guaranteed 
at the end of that time.  What a wonderful investment that is. 
How can we build confidence in government with that kind of an 
investment?  If that same amount of money were invested at 6% for 
30 years there would $275,000 in capital and principal alone. 
What kind of annuity could be bought with that?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I believe in young people and in giving a country worth 
having to my kids I conducted a lot of research.  Last Christmas 
I visited two countries that also have pension plans.  Last year 
I visited New Zealand which changed its pension plan and 
Australia which changed its pension plan.  Then I thought it 
would be interesting to take a look at Chile and Argentina to see 
what kind of pension plans they had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifteen years ago Chile realized it had a problem with its 
pension plan.  It had an unfunded liability and it was going to 
reach a point where the plan would be bankrupt and would not be 
able to pay out people when they turned 65 years of age.  Fifteen 
years ago the Chileans decided to fix that problem.  They 
designed a private plan to replace the original plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Argentina followed the same principle four years ago.  I thought 
it would be interesting to talk to businessmen and to government 
and opposition politicians.  Then I tried a really interesting 
thing and went door to door in Santiago, Chile, with an 
interpreter.  I said “I am a Canadian politician, a member of 
Parliament.  I would like to know what you think of your pension 
plan because we have a pension plan that is in trouble”.  What I 
heard was fantastic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said they had a pension plan.  They get a stub every three 
months that listed the companies their pension was invested in. 
They bought their groceries from the company they had a stake in. 
There is pride in that system.  Twenty-three per cent of the 
people had savings accounts big enough to handle their 
retirements, and that is only after 15 years.  There is a 
psychological pride among the people that they are taking care of 
themselves which we do not have here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should ask our young people what they think of the CPP or 
what kind of confidence they have that they will get anything 
when they are 65 years of age.  I know what the answer is.  I 
know what my kids tell me.  They will certainly take care of 
themselves and are not counting on anything from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what government is failing to do.  When people 
are disgusted with government, when people do not trust 
government, it is because of that sort of mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to simplify the tax system.  We have to make it easier 
for people to handle.  We have to flatten it out.  We have to get 
government out of our lives.  All these countries have downsized 
to the point where they can now manage themselves.  If it is good 
enough for Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina and Britain, 
it has to be good enough for Canada.  Certainly the way we are 
going will not be good enough.

Speaker, Shuswap is actually a great place to live other than 
that we are being taxed to death out there, and I can say that 
with confidence.  That is one thing.  No matter where we go 
across Canada one of the main problems we are faced with in any 
meeting is overtaxation to fill the appetite of this government 
and previous governments for taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get a kick out of the concern I hear from the Liberals and the 
Conservatives.  All of a sudden they are concerned about the 
people and taxation. 
We should never forget that there have only basically been two 
parties in power, the Liberal Party and the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  Who is responsible for the mess we are in 
today?  It has to be the Liberals and the Conservatives.  Nobody 
else has been in power.

They have never in the history of Canadian politics learned their

That is what they have learned.  That is what we are paying for 
today.  Unfortunately that is what our children will be paying 
for in the future.  The question today is what are we willing to 
leave our children in future.  With Bill C-28 we will not be 
leaving them very much.  The Liberals could go a long way toward 
helping our people. They could give them a break so the people 
could stand on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity in my riding of Okanagan—Shuswap to send 
out a householder.  I asked the voters questions.  I know that 
the Liberals, the Conservatives and the New Democrats laugh at us 
when we send out householders to get input from the public.  I 
can hear them heckling me.  That is the problem with the old line 
politicians.  They are afraid to put questions to the people who 
pay their wages.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a response which I received.  It comes from 
a woman named Debby Cook.  She has given me permission to read 
her letter today.  Mrs. Cook wrote:

are not disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your questionnaire doesn't really let us voters define exactly 
our opinions.  Therefore I included this letter in hopes you will 
read it, and maybe get a better understanding of how the average 
income family feels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To clarify average income, that's about $30,000 to $40,000 a 
year.  It may sound like a lot, but look at the figures.  Our 
income is already taxed to the max. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband has to work like a dog just to keep our heads above 
water, and that's without children or anything for entertainment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if I was working, the burden would be more.  Sure during 
the year it would work a little better, but without having me as 
a tax write-off— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame when we have to start looking at ourselves as tax 
write-offs.  She continued: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the beginning of the year would look pretty grim. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would wind up paying every year, and still have to have my 
husband's cheques docked, with almost half of it going to a 
government that I'm not sure I believe in any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may have a democracy, but because of high taxes, and lavish 
government spending, the government does indeed dictate the 
outcome of every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time that a person could plan for vacations every 
year, which are so greatly needed, so you don't lose your mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband and I can't afford to go on vacations, so he works 
and works and works, just so the government can live lavishly, 
while we peons, at the bottom, go without any satisfaction or 
restitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, you may ask if we think taxes should be increased for the 
pension? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, absolutely not! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, why not cut MPs large pensions and the gross amount of 
their salaries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our forefathers did not create a working government so they 
could line their pockets, but only so there was some form of 
representation in a united Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next part I asked my constituents if they thought their 
family could afford to pay more taxes.  One of the examples I 
gave was in order to cut emissions from burning fossil fuels. 
Mrs. Cook also had some ideas on that kind of tax.  She wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You ask if there should be a tax added or an increase on our 
gasoline to help cutting emissions.  Okay, there is a problem 
here but not one that can be rectified by raising costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more families are having to buy second hand cars that 
are in the 1970s and 1980s.  These cars are not as well protected 
against these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the taxes on gas are driven even higher there will be no 
help, only hindrance.  We need taxes lowered so that we can 
afford to buy new vehicles.  What doesn't the government get? 
Wake up and smell the coffee. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then asked the voters in my riding how they thought the 
government should spend the so-called fiscal dividend, presuming 
there will be some money left from today's high taxes after the 
books are balanced.  Mrs. Cook wrote on that topic as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You ask if Ottawa should use fiscal dividends.  Why not spread it 
out and treat people with some respect?  Give back to the people 
that which they have given for so long.  Then maybe the question 
on whether our government is out to screw us would be answered. 
Show us how hard work and patience can pay off.  Give us a break. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Cook ended her letter as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for reading this letter.  I am sure you will make good 
use of our taxpayers dollars. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was signed: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just one of your concerned citizens, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debby Cook. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of hundreds of letters that I received as a result 
of the questionnaire.  This lady is not alone.  Her concerns are 
the concerns of average people, hard working people and honest 
people across this land.  They are fed up with governments 
telling them to tighten their belts while governments seem to 
increase three or four sizes every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they work like they do they learn that they have very 
little say in a country that is supposed to be run 
democratically.  We know that is no longer so.  It may sound 
cynical to the people out there when I say this, but I say in all 
honesty that I have not seen the country run democratically for a 
long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Income Tax Act.  When it was introduced it 
was a one time act.  “Come to us.  Believe in us”, said the 
government of the day.  It was only to enact it once but it 
forget to say that it would be once a year.  On and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wonders why the people out there are so cynical 
about politicians today.  That is one of the main reasons.  It is 
time the government wakes up to that fact before it is too late. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to take part in the debate today on Bill C-28. 
Essentially Bill C-28 is an act implementing sections of the 
1997-98 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the bill is before me here.  I see it is 464 pages long. 
It is a very legal document.  Section 1 of the act is probably 
the easiest part of the whole document.  Section 1 might be cited 
as the Income Tax Amendments Act, 1997, but for the average 
laymen trying to work their way through the act it would only add 
to the difficulty that we already have with some 1,500 pages of 
Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when average Canadians could do their own 
taxes. We have a farm in the Peace River country of Alberta and 
for a number of years we did our own income taxes. 
However over the years it became more and more difficult and we 
found that it was important to hire an accountant. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountants I know tell me that it is becoming more and more 
difficult even for them.  They tell me that one accountant in a 
firm can phone for a ruling on a certain section of the act on a 
Monday and get one answer from the department of revenue. 
Another partner might phone on a Friday and get an entirely 
different interpretation.  We have 1,563 pages of income tax 
which is added to every year by things like these amendments.  In 
addition to that, we have thousands of pages of precedents and 
rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the prime minister, who says he can write zero with 
his famous pen, to make an act that is very easy to understand 
and easy for people to do their own tax.  In fact we have talked 
about the idea of introducing a flat tax.  It makes a lot of 
sense to me.  Take the income of an average family, use whatever 
the tax rate is, 20%, and send that in.  The difficulty I guess 
would be what to do with all the unemployed accountants.  That is 
what I tell my accounting friends.  However, even they are having 
difficulty these days fathoming these kinds of amendments that 
are coming forward every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House the prime minister said that he is going to 
start paying down the debt.  At the rate that he has suggested it 
is going to be a very long process.  I think he said a billion 
dollars a year.  With a $583 billion debt it is going to be a 
very long process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that has an insatiable appetite for 
taxpayers' money.  Part of the reason why is that we have this 
massive federal debt that takes debt servicing in the form of 
interest.  The interest on this debt last year was $46 billion. 
Almost one-third of the taxes that the average family sends to 
Ottawa every year goes to debt servicing retirement.  It simply 
is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a number of people on the other side of the House today 
say that one of the things that is going to be changed as a 
result of Bill C-28 is that it is going to allow for transfers to 
the provinces through the CHST to be increased from $11.5 billion 
to $12.5 billion.  I would ask the question:  When will this 
Liberal government be ready to return the amount of money to the 
Canadian health and social transfers that it took away in the 
last Parliament?  The funding was $18.5 billion a year.  This is 
the government that reduced it to $11.5 billion and then tells us 
that by returning $1 billion it is doing a great service to the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My home province of Alberta has gone through sizeable downsizing 
in terms of government operations, including health care.  We 
have all faced it.  The local attitude seems to be to blame the 
provincial governments.  What we have to remember is that a 
sizeable part of the reason that downsizing was necessary was the 
35% in cuts in transfers from the federal government to the 
provinces.  Now the government is telling us that it is going to 
return $1 billion a year.  I do not think it is good enough.  It 
has to share in the blame for some of the things that have 
happened in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen some demonstrations by students in the last few 
weeks in terms of tuition fees and the high cost of education in 
this country.  That was part of the $7 billion in cuts by this 
government.  I think the government has to do the honourable 
thing and return this funding to the levels prior to the cuts 
during the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we need to get government right in this country but it is 
all about priorities.  We have to get our priorities right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have in this country?  We have the highest rate of 
income tax among our industrial trading partners in the whole 
world.  We have Canada pension plan rates rising by 73% over the 
next six years.  We have unemployment figures that still hover in 
the 9% range when our major trading partner just south of the 
border, which we export some 80% of our product to, is almost 
half of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been consistent for 30 years.  We could put it on a 
graph and chart it and that is the way it would go. 
Good times and bad times, there is a 4% to 5% spread between 
Canada and the United States in terms of unemployment rates.  Why 
is that?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest it has quite a bit to do with the poor performance of 
our currency.  We are at a 35 year low for the Canadian dollar. 
We have a third world currency in this country.  People looking 
to invest in Canada have to look at that.  Canadians wanting to 
invest in countries like Chile, how much can they buy with this 
low Canadian dollar?  It simply is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else is happening?  Our debt in this country as I mentioned 
earlier is $583 billion.  It is 73% of our total gross domestic 
product per year.  It simply is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign affairs and international trade committee in the 
last Parliament did a study asking small and medium size 
businesses why they were not in the export market.  What they 
told us was rather startling.  There were a number of factors. 
Too high a cost of doing business in Canada.  Too high a cost in 
payroll taxes and business taxes.  They also told us that the 
amount of regulation was hurting them greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One company from Ontario even suggested that after moving to 
Michigan it had a much better chance of doing business back in 
Canada across provincial borders than it did working in Ontario. 
We have more barriers to trade between our provinces in Canada 
than all of the European Union combined. That is absolutely 
absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I noticed in this bill is that there are 
amendments made to the act which would allow some provision for a 
change of status for family farms in terms of income tax.  I want 
to take the opportunity to mention the amount of duress that 
Canadian farmers are under these days.  I know about it 
personally. My riding is largely agricultural and people are 
hurting greatly. What can we do about it?  First we can get our 
cost of business down and cost of inputs down, but we can do more 
than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has an obligation to go to the next round of the 
World Trade Organization talks on agriculture and make the case 
that domestic subsidies in Europe are hurting us greatly.  They 
are hurting us although we are all on a phase down through the 
last round of the GATT.  The starting point for the phase down 
was 1986, the highest levels of subsidies in the European Union 
and the United States in the history of the world.  When we get a 
15% phase down from up here, we still have substantial subsidies 
that are hurting our Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are hurting.  They are hurting greatly.  This government 
has an obligation to go to those talks and make that case.  Our 
Canadian farmers in grains, oilseeds and beef are subsidy and 
tariff free.  We are leading the way. That is not the case among 
our major trading partners. I suspect that this government will 
not have the courage to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand we have a supply managed farm industry that 
has tariffs of over 300% in many areas.  Three hundred per cent 
on one side with a protectionist policy and an absolutely subsidy 
free, tariff free side on the grains, oilseeds and beef sector 
that I suggest is going to be traded off in the next trade rounds 
by our own government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might do some tinkering with this bill to make it a little 
easier to write off something on the farm.  The big issue 
affecting Canadian farmers is low prices that can be greatly 
enhanced and improved if this government had the courage to go to 
those trade talks and be honest with the public and say “We have 
a sector that is subsidy free.  We need some help in convincing 
other countries to do the same”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there is a lot of tinkering going on with this 
bill.  It is going to add a lot of pages to our Income Tax Act. 
the real issue is getting the government debt down, getting our 
businesses competitive and allowing Canadians to keep more money 
in their pockets.

One of them when speaking the other day referred to the lack of

is what happened.  In my province because of the slashing of the 
federal grants to health care, people like myself—and I figure I 
am lucky—have to go 100 miles before they can get to emergency 
care.  This is the worst we have had since the province was 
settled in 1905.  That is what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has been riding on the backs of the people all 
over North America.  It should not take pride and it should not 
brag about not being in a deficit position.  It has done it on 
the backs of ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to what may be the worst tax grab for the people in 
western Canada.  We go to the gas pumps all across Canada and we 
fill up our tanks.  Let us say that we put in 50 litres of gas. 
Bang, the federal government has got $5.  Just like that, it has 
$5. Page 100 of the October <I>Reader's Digest</I> lists how much 
the federal government has put back into the highways of Canada. 
On average it is a little more than 21 cents.  That is why we 
have toll roads in Nova Scotia.  That is why in Saskatchewan we 
do not have any roads left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Tell that to Young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  I could get Mr. Young.  Maybe he could 
come and give us a hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about highway robbery.  This has been going on for years. 
What is the government's response?  “Oh but we give 
infrastructure grants”.  Infrastructure grants come from other 
sources of taxation and the ministers have to admit that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The straight 10 cents a litre the government takes out of the 
pockets of the people from Saskatchewan in a country that has to 
move grain 100 miles to get to a terminal, and this government 
returns 21 cents on $5 taken.  And the Liberals brag about the 
fact that they do not have a deficit.  They are taking it out of 
the industries all over Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to inform the members of the NDP caucus down there 
about this.  Do they know what the provincial Liberals are doing 
in Saskatchewan?  They are going around Saskatchewan with a 
petition to get the provincial government to spend more money on 
highways.  Maybe that is a good petition.  The provincial 
government in Saskatchewan has not been too kind but at least it 
has spent 40% of what it has taken in.  This government is 
spending less than 4% at times.  I hope the federal Liberals will 
welcome the provincial Liberals from Saskatchewan so they can get 
some help for Saskatchewan roads.  I am sure nobody on this side 
of the House would kick if the Liberals raised it to 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For five years the Canadian Automobile Association and the truck 
drivers association have pleaded with this government to give 20% 
of the money it takes, just 20%.  But no, we are getting 
something like 4%.  This government is riding on the shirttails 
of people who have to make a living in the transportation 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The railway located in my town is slated for closure.  There are 
people south of where I live whom I know extremely well. In two 
years they will have to haul their grain 160 kilometres just to 
get it to a terminal.  And those people over there are wringing 
their hands with delight because they will be able to tax that 
industry even more and put farmers completely out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the one tax that affects all of Canada and this 
government steals every time we put the nozzle in the tank to 
fill it with gas. It is a terrible terrible shame.  It is a 
disgrace.  We are the only country of our size that does not have 
a national highway policy, the only country in the world.  And 
they sit and say “Look what we are doing”. 
We know what they are doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to just one other thing. In Saskatchewan we have 
rural governments.  Rural governments are called rural 
municipalities. These rural municipalities were created at the 
time Saskatchewan became a province. We have a large number of 
Indian bands in Saskatchewan. When the previous Conservative 
government in settling treaties, which took a 10 square section 
out of a rural municipality, promised and acted that it would 
give that rural government 25.5 times the assessment in 
compensation for the tax base that was lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But at the same time that government promised that for any land 
that was purchased by the natives, they would also get the same 
amount. Now this rural government has gone to court with this 
government opposite because all it wants to pay for the amount of 
land purchased is a measly 5.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our rural governments in Saskatchewan have no tax base 
left and they are holding this up in the court and watching them 
completely disappear. I visited two RMs during the Christmas 
break and they are just about finished because they have no money 
left to provide the services because this government has held it 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I said I was happy to talk about this, I really am because 
I come from a province that is just teetering now in many areas 
because of the taxation of this government. Heaven forbid, the 
next tax it will raise will be a carbon tax on more fuel and 
take great glory in spending 21 cents back to the highways for 
every 5 dollar it takes.  Then it can fire Doug Young at the same 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, when 
I hear some of the members of the Reform caucus describe Canada 
and the mess we are in, they never really seem to acknowledge the 
achievements we have made in this great country of ours. I think 
it is very important not to simply be sensationalist opposition 
members. I think sometimes we have to take time to speak 
positively about our country. If the hon. members want to always 
be the nattering nabobs of negativism, that is their own choice, 
but I think that will forever relegate them to being the armchair 
quarterbacks for Canadian politics. That is indeed unfortunate 
because among them there really is some talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Periodically I hear some. The member for Peace River had some 
good comments that I appreciated, especially relative to trade 
policy and the types of activist interventionist government 
policy that are doing more to hurt Canadian trade and exports— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I must interrupt the 
member. I have just been advised that the member has already 
spoken on this subject.  Resuming debate, the hon. member for 
West Kootenay—Okanagan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have heard this bill referred to as a number of 
housekeeping items. Before I became a member of Parliament for 
quite some time I had a construction company. Most of my 
construction was new housing, rather than existing, fixing up, 
remodelling or, if you would, housekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But occasionally, either as a filler or as a favour to a friend, 
we would do a bit of remodelling. But you do not go into a house 
and redo the drywall in that house if the roof is leaking. You do 
not do an expensive renovation inside if the foundation is rotten 
and the house is going to fall down some time after you have 
completed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is tinkering with the Income Tax Act which is so 
rife with problems throughout. It seems absolutely foolish to be 
putting in a bill the size of a mid size town's telephone book to 
tinker with a problem that needs major reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In West Kootenay—Okanagan I hold town hall meetings throughout 
the riding. This year I will be holding 15. Five I held in 
January before we came back to Parliament. I do not know what 
kind of statistics the Liberals claim they are getting, but in my 
riding and in the ridings of a lot of my colleagues I have talked 
to, the priorities for those people are tax reduction and debt 
reduction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is going to put a little money into that 
but a its priority is new spending.  Right now it is patting 
itself on the back rather vigorously for saying that it is 
getting close at least to balancing the books, getting rid of the 
deficit. When the government came in our interest rate was a lot 
higher than it is right now.  Under the previous Liberal 
government in the early 1980s it hit the 20% mark.  A one per 
cent increase in interest rates would cost, based on our $600 
billion worth of debt, $6 billion a year in extra interest 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They like to make magic with figures on the other side but that 
is a pretty simple figure.  If you have $600 billion worth of 
debt and you have to pay 1% a year more on that, that is $6 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time our interest was 12% to 14% higher than it is right 
now.  In our economy right now we see incredible pressure to 
increase the interest rates to look after our falling dollar. 
Some people wonder why the Bank of Canada is holding back so much 
instead of putting the interest rate up.  There is part of the 
reason.  If the interest rate goes up, there goes the 
government's deficit balancing plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the government manages to hold it down there, it most 
assuredly needs to start bringing that debt down.  Sooner or 
later in the evolution of things we are likely to see, at least 
in the short term, an interest increase and that is going to 
knock the government's deficit plan right off the tracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be new spending but this has to be in very targeted 
areas.  Those areas are health care, education and 
technology.  Even there any increase in spending must be smarter 
spending than what we are doing right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time Canada considered itself central Canada, the area of 
primarily Ontario and Quebec.  They were in the areas where 
development was taking place and we in the west were considered 
the hewers of wood and the drawers of water.  That is what the 
west originally was and we accepted that.  Now we are starting to 
come into our own.  The west is the new development.  It is the 
new frontier in terms of technology, in terms of the economy of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet right at the time that we are starting to come into our own, 
we are seeing the entire nation go into decline.  Things like 
capital gains taxes are high in this country.  Yet the government 
has even taken away many of the exemptions for capital gains that 
existed, while in the United States the capital gains taxes are 
much lower and they are dropping. While they are investing in 
vehicles to improve their economy, we are returning to being the 
hewers of wood and the drawers of water on a national scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government has to roll back something, it should not be 
the advancements in our economy that we have made in the last 
hundred plus years.  If it is going to roll something back, it 
should be the taxes and it should be the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country needs tax reform.  The government knows that.  Just 
like the skits on <I>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</I> and the <I>Royal 
Canadian Air Farce</I> where they keep lampooning the leader of 
the Reform Party saying “I just love the word reform”, maybe 
that is what stops the Liberals because they know reform is 
needed.  It just galls them to think that they have to use that 
word.  We do need reform and we need genuine reform, not just 
tinkering which is what this piece of legislation does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do things like end the discrimination between working 
and non-working spouses which basically forces people out of the 
house into a job in order to get a balanced income tax.  Someone 
making $60,000 a year where their spouse chooses to stay home and 
raise the family pays a lot more income tax than two family 
members making $30,000 each. The basic exemption needs to be 
balanced and need to be increased so that we get rid of this 
bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance keeps rising and saying no new taxes. 
The reality is in the last term of the Liberals there were 37 tax 
increases and the government still pats itself on the back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have this incredible system of tax in, tax out, the goods and 
services tax.  Aside from the fact that it is the most hated and 
aside from the fact that the Liberals promised they were going to 
get rid of it, if we have to have it, it should be done in a lot 
more efficient manner.  Right now the government taxes people 
making $8,000 or $9,000 a year.  Those people cannot afford taxes 
and yet they get taxed in any event.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it knows they cannot afford it.  That is why 
it has programs to supplement their income.  With the bit of 
money they have left, they are charged GST on everything they 
purchase.  The government says it knows they cannot afford GST, 
therefore it has a GST rebate program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something inherently wrong with a system that taxes 
away someone's money with one bureaucracy and creates another 
bureaucracy to give some of it back, using up most of it in the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have payroll taxes.  CPP is going up 73%; a 73% increase in a 
pension plan that if they pay in for a generation it will give 
them less than $9,000 a year back.  In the meantime, the MPs 
opposite gave themselves a 18% reduction in their pension plan 
which will see them getting a much more generous pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are going to take away the seniors tax exemption 
and give them the seniors benefit, the old age pension and 
guaranteed income supplement tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heaven help those people who are collecting that if they see fit 
to go out and look after themselves by raising so much as an 
extra dollar because the government is going to take 50 cents of 
it away.  It will take away the non-taxable part.  They will have 
to pay tax on the part that is left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of spending, we do need to spend money on health care. 
When health care was first introduced, there was a 50:50 
partnership.  By 1993 in British Columbia it was down to a 28% 
federal share.  Since that time on the national level, the 
Liberal government has taken another $7 billion away and at the 
same time it ties the hands of the province in how to deal with 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about health care.  We do not have health care.  We have 
sickness care.  When I said we have to start spending our money 
more wisely, we have to start addressing keeping people healthy 
instead of paying their bills after they get sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise with education, if we are going to stick the next 
generation with increased CPP, with ever escalating taxes and 
with a $600 billion debt, we better make sure we provide it some 
way to equip itself for dealing with the mess we have left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few good measures in this bill but basically it is 
like getting a pat on the back while at the same time getting a 
kick in the butt.  If the Liberals want to do something, either 
start doing some serious fixing of this tax act or else stop 
kicking Canadians in the butt.

<A NAME="LINK214">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 6 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-211, an act to amend the Criminal Code (arrest of 
those in breach of condition of parole or statutory or temporary 
release), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of Bill C-211, the private member's bill 
presented by my hon. colleague from Langley—Abbotsford.  His 
amendment to the Criminal Code would permit peace officers to 
arrest parolees who are found to be in breach of their conditions 
of release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the primary responsibilities of parliamentarians is to 
enact laws to ensure the safety and security of our citizens. For 
too long there has been a technicality or in essence a gaping 
hole in our laws which the legislation attempts to address. It is 
most distressful to be in this place and learn that it takes 
years to solve a simple problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, Canada is a large and diverse country.  We have 
many large urban centres and we have many isolated communities. 
In most cases criminal offenders are able to move with relative 
freedom within the country once they have served their time and 
are released from prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the country one of the primary means of security and 
safety of our citizens comes with the presence and the skill of 
our valued police officers.  They are the individuals who protect 
us 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in all parts of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of concerns over public safety and because criminals are 
known to often reoffend, our laws permit a series of steps toward 
full freedom.  Most offenders are released through a process of 
escorted temporary absences, unescorted temporary absences and/or 
statutory release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These steps normally involve the offender being required to 
abide by a number of specific conditions.  Some must refrain from 
attending alcoholic establishments because their past criminality 
was often influenced by their inability to consume alcohol in a 
responsible manner.  Others must refrain from associating with 
specified criminal elements or specified individuals, usually 
because those elements or individuals are rationally seen to be a 
bad influence on the offender.  In other cases those individuals 
may require the security of being isolated from the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the public at large it seems ridiculous that our police 
cannot independently arrest, remove and detain persons found to 
be in breach of release conditions.  Supposedly the release 
conditions have been rationally and extensively considered. 
Supposedly the release conditions have been imposed to protect 
law-abiding citizens.  It makes no sense for us to require our 
police to attempt to contact parole officials in order for a 
warrant to be issued authorizing the arrest of an offender who is 
clearly in breach of his or her conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many in this place are aware, I came here to advocate the 
protection and interests of victims of crime.  I become greatly 
concerned when I can think of many examples whereby the present 
legislation is so limited in scope as to inhibit the ability of 
police to provide that protection.  It complicates procedures to 
the extent where additional crime is a very real possibility and 
it provides an opportunity for further victimization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all are aware of the strain on our resources at this time. 
Police officers and departments have for years been increasingly 
required to do more with less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly can foresee the possible situation where a pedophile 
is released back into society and quite reasonably as a condition 
of release is prohibited from hanging around school yards and 
playgrounds.  He will almost surely also be prohibited from being 
in the presence of children while unsupervised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the police become aware of a breach of one or more of these 
conditions, what can they do?  Up to this point there has been no 
crime committed and there may not be sufficient evidence to 
believe that one is about to be committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under present law police are limited to reporting the incident 
to the National Parole Board.  We know National Parole Board 
personnel are not readily available in all parts of the country. 
These personnel will want to establish the bona fides of the 
infraction because in most cases they will not be familiar with 
the particular police officer.  They may well require an 
extensive report of just what is occurring.  They may not always 
be available at all hours of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it reasonable to expect a police officer to remain on site 
until some unknown bureaucrat or parole official approves the 
arrest? 
It is not as if the police have nothing else to do.  What if the 
officer has other priority calls to handle at the time?  Are we 
to put our children at risk because of technicalities and 
procedure?  Our police need the tools to protect us.  They need 
the power to arrest the individual found in breach of release 
conditions.  The parole officials can always decide later whether 
to revoke the release or impose additional restrictions.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide another common example.  It is most unfortunate 
but many of our citizens run afoul of the law because of their 
problems with alcohol.  When they drink they drink to excess and 
they commit crimes.  In an attempt at rehabilitation we release 
many criminals back into society with the condition to refrain 
from using alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our police come into contact with alcohol in many ways.  They 
are called to break up fights.  They patrol bars and night clubs 
and they patrol our highways and our back alleys.  They may well 
come across individuals who are violating their release 
conditions regarding alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they to await direction from parole authorities which may 
take hours or days, or are they to effect arrests in the 
interests of the safety of all and leave it to be ironed out in 
due course?  Surely it is more desirable to err on the side of 
caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mere act of drinking does not provide the peace officer with 
sufficient grounds to arrest without warrant.  Workload demands 
make it impractical to maintain surveillance for long periods of 
time.  Who will be to blame when the police officer moves on to 
other responsibilities and the offender continues to drink, gets 
behind the wheel and ends up killing innocent people in a car 
accident?  Who will be to blame when he staggers through the 
front door and assaults his wife and children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional example comes from Mr. Ian Russell, the chief of 
police for the town of LaSalle in the Windsor, Ontario, area.  He 
has had an extensive career in law enforcement having retired 
from the metro Toronto police department.  He was quoted as 
stating:  “There is no power of arrest for a police officer who 
finds a person in violation of a condition of their parole”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He cited the example of a convicted wife beater who was released 
from jail with the condition to stay at least 1,000 metres away 
from the home of his victim.  Nevertheless he goes to her home 
and stands on the public sidewalk.  The frantic victim calls the 
police.  Officers arrive but the man is not trespassing.  His 
behaviour cannot be called stalking.  He is obviously violating 
his parole conditions but the police cannot arrest him or remove 
the apparent threat until the National Parole Board issues a 
warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Russell is frustrated.  He is also concerned because the 
criminal has now been put on notice that he may be reincarcerated 
because he was seen to be breaking his parole conditions.  Mr. 
Russell is concerned the offender may decide to commit a serious 
crime to make a return to jail worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is for the very real possibility that the offender 
may retaliate against his victim for notifying the police in the 
first place.  Mr. Russell in his vast experience at one time 
chaired parole board hearings.  He is well aware of the limited 
resources and capability of the parole board to assist the police 
under the present legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One previous argument opposing the legislation cited the lack of 
statistical proof that the present system imposes unreasonable 
time constraints on the police.  Frankly this does not surprise 
me.  This is the old let us wait until somebody dies before we 
decide if there is a problem attitude.  It is so typically 
Liberal it is reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another argument suggests that parole and release conditions are 
intended to assist the reintegration of the offender into 
society.  Therefore it is argued that parole supervisors are 
better situated to determine whether an offender's behaviour 
warrants apprehension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There we go again.  Let us consider the best interests of the 
offender and public safety be damned.  What hogwash.  The very 
fact that a parolee wilfully breaches his conditions is a pretty 
strong indicator that he is not responsible enough to be 
entrusted with his freedom in the community.  Who is in a better 
position to assess the immediate situation?  Is it the parole 
officer wiping the sleep from his eyes at three o'clock in the 
morning as he picks up his bedside phone or the cop confronting 
the offender in an alleyway? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to highlight the fallacy of the laws as they currently 
exist I ask the House to consider the following.  A prostitute 
found to be in breach of a court ordered condition of probation 
by standing on a corner where she is not supposed to be is 
subject to immediate arrest, removal and detention.  A pedophile 
violating his parole by lurking around children is not.  Just who 
are we trying to protect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety of Canadians is at risk because of weaknesses in our 
law.  Canadians continue to be victimized, some again by the same 
individuals, once on the initial charge and again on their 
release from jail.  Our police are available and ready to do the 
job of protecting us.  They need to be provided with the tools to 
do so. 
I urge hon. members of the House to seriously consider fulfilling 
this need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford has put forward a private 
member's bill, Bill C-211, to amend the arrest without warrant 
provisions of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure members of the House that public safety remains the 
government's number one priority in the operation of our 
corrections and conditional release system.  To more fully 
demonstrate the importance we attach to the issue, I would like 
to mention a bit about our present system of conditional release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost all offenders will return, by law, to the community one 
day so the best long term protection for society is through the 
gradual controlled release of offenders that helps them to 
reintegrate into society as law-abiding citizens.  Unfortunately 
there are some, including some Reform Party members, who dwell on 
this procedure to exploit the fears of Canadians about the 
reintegration of offenders into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protection of society is the primary consideration in the 
decision to release any offender.  Only those offenders whose 
risk has been assessed as manageable in the community are 
released on parole.  The transition from confinement to freedom 
can be difficult and offenders have a better chance of success if 
they receive supervision, program opportunities, training and 
support within the community to which they must readjust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offenders who are granted parole are not simply put back on the 
street with no forethought.  Regrettably this is a common 
misconception that again is exploited by some, including Reform 
members, for political gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offenders must have a release plan.  They must leave prison with 
a place to live, a plan for gainful employment or education, and 
a community support system that gives them a chance to change 
their previous behaviour. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before granting parole to an offender, board members review all the 
pertinent information available to make a preliminary risk assessment, 
namely the nature of the offence, the offender's criminal record, as 
well as any social or mental problem. After reviewing all this 
information and, in most cases, interviewing the offender, board members 
decide whether or not to grant parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make this decision, the board relies on a number of 
partners. 
The first one is the Correctional Service of Canada, which provides the 
board with basic information, including the offender's criminal history, 
his behaviour in prison, his participation in programs, and his parole 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community organizations, police forces, victims and other people 
also provide information on the offender's ability to re-enter the 
community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the board decides to release an offender into the community 
a number of standard conditions apply, including reporting 
regularly to a parole officer and to the police as instructed and 
carrying at all times the release certificate or identity card. 
The board can also impose additional conditions such as 
abstaining from alcohol, staying away from known criminals and no 
association with victims or their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Breaking one of these conditions is a serious matter because an 
offender risks returning to prison.  Offenders are still serving 
their sentence and they are closely supervised by parole officers 
employed by Correctional Service Canada working out of local 
parole offices.  These officers play a key role in helping and 
encouraging the offender to successfully complete the transition 
from prison to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parole officer whose powers are considerable can recommend 
directly to the board that a treatment condition be imposed, for 
instance for a drug or alcohol abuse problem, and if the offender 
does not comply he or she can be sent immediately back to prison.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress that there are strict measures in place 
for handling violations and prevention of breaches of parole, 
statutory release and unescorted temporary absence conditions. In 
the case of an offender on parole or statutory release a 
suspension warrant can be issued at any time by Correctional 
Services Canada and the National Parole Board when there has been 
a breach of condition, to prevent a breach of condition or when 
it is believed to be necessary and reasonable in order to protect 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Execution of this warrant provides sufficient authority to 
return the offender to custody until the case can be reviewed by 
the National Parole Board.  A network of officers is on duty 
round the clock to provide for immediate police action by 
telephone and warrants can be transmitted by facsimile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of unescorted temporary absences a suspension 
warrant can be issued for an offender where the grounds for 
granting the absence have changed or no longer exist or when the 
new information becomes available that would have altered the 
original decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Corrections and Conditional Release Act provides ample and 
clear authority for an offender's conditional release to be 
suspended by correction officers. This enables police to arrest 
the offender and bring him or her into custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to realize that police already have full 
authority to arrest an offender without warrant whenever they 
find any conditional release offender committing a criminal 
offence or whenever they have reasonable grounds to believe that 
a conditionally released offender has committed or is about to 
commit an indictable offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also bear in mind that roughly 80% of offenders released 
on parole and statutory release do not commit any type of offence 
while under supervision.  About 11% are returned to prison 
following a breach of conditions established at the time of their 
release. These figures do not include offenders released on 
unescorted temporary absences where the success rate is close to 
99%. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New measures to improve communications between the correctional 
service and police were taken to ensure better community management of 
paroled offenders under federal jurisdiction. This includes notifying 
police in advance every time an offender is released, whether on 
temporary absence without escort, parole or statutory release, as well 
as providing police with relevant information when correctional 
authorities have reason to believe that an offender about to be released 
at the end of his sentence may pose a threat to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, the government passed new legislation to better 
protect the public against high risk violent offenders, by creating a 
long term offender designation for repeat sex offenders for supervision 
and monitoring purposes and introducing indeterminate sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the judicial restraint order requiring anyone to keep 
the peace or face a term of imprisonment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Open discussion and debate on issues affecting public safety 
deserve our foremost attention and utmost scrutiny.  We also have 
a responsibility to ensure that our energies are directed toward 
implementing new measures that are well researched and well 
founded and most of all needed.  However, we must guard ourselves 
against the political exploitation of those issues by members 
such as the Reform Party members who have been interrupting my 
speech here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe our current legislation and practices regarding 
conditional release offenders provide for the right balance and 
responsibility between police and correctional authorities and 
that the system we have in place is a sound one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons I believe that our common goal of public 
safety would not be enhanced by the adoption of the measures 
outlined by Bill C-211. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today in the debate on Bill C-211, presented by 
one of my Reform Party colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this bill contain?  First, as presented, it amends 
the Criminal Code by making a breach of a condition of parole or 
statutory or temporary release a criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 495(1)(a) of the Criminal Code already states that 
a peace officer may arrest without warrant a person who has 
committed a criminal offence or whom he finds committing a criminal 
offence. 
The bill proposes that a peace officer may arrest without warrant 
a person who is in breach of a condition of parole or release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill would amend the Criminal Code by giving a 
parole board the power to release the person or to apply to a judge 
to keep that person under supervision, once that person has been 
arrested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus clause 1 of the bill amends section 497 of the Criminal 
Code.  This section, which is already in the Code, stipulates that 
a person may be detained in order to allow the board which granted 
parole the possibility of requesting that he be detained until a 
warrant is issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same clause 1 would amend section 497 of the Criminal 
Code by adding an exception to the release of a person who has been 
arrested without warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Code as it now stands, a peace officer may 
override the release provision if he has reasonable grounds to 
believe it is in the public interest to do so to prevent “the 
continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of 
another offence”.  The bill proposes to add an exception to the 
release provision at the end of paragraph (<I>g</I>) of section 497. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, clause 2 of the bill proposes to amend subsection 
733.1(1) of the Criminal Code.  It proposes to include failure to 
comply with a condition of parole, statutory release or temporary 
release.  In addition, the sentences imposed for such failure 
remain the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then do we oppose this bill?  For the following reasons. 
First of all, some would say that this bill would prevent the 
release of dangerous offenders and could resolve part of the 
problem of recidivism. 
This could be true, but only partially so.  Why should we permit a 
peace officer to supervise an offender who has failed to comply 
with the conditions of his parole?  Not all offenders fail to 
comply with their parole conditions and constitute a threat to 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next we must look at the interests involved in this bill.  A 
balance must be maintained between the protection of individual 
rights and the protection of the community's interests.  We have to 
raise the issue, which is what I am doing here, of everyone's right 
to protection against arbitrary detention or imprisonment as in 
section 9 of the charter of rights and freedoms and the 
government's need to protect society against repeat offenders. 
This balance is unfortunately disturbed in the Reform Party's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three kinds of parole, that is parole, and statutory and 
temporary release, are not the result of a court order and are not 
granted by the parole board or Correctional Services Canada.  These 
three types of parole are much more concerned with helping 
offenders reintegrate society.  Unfortunately, there is no 
indication in the bill before us of any interest in reintegration 
or eventual rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude very simply by saying that, in this bill 
introduced by a Reform Party member, there is no mention of an 
opportunity for the eventual rehabilitation or reintegration of 
offenders, and the Bloc Quebecois deplores this.  It is essential 
that any amendment to the Criminal Code reflect this principle of 
rehabilitation.  That is how we will build a more just society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois opposes this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to speak on Bill C-211, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code as it relates to the arrest of those in breach of condition 
of parole, statutory or temporary release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford has brought this piece 
of legislation before the House in an attempt to improve public 
protection.  No one can disagree with the importance of this 
objective.  Indeed public protection in a criminal justice sense 
is of primary importance and concern to all of us in this House 
and to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having sat on the Waterloo regional police services board for 
the past 10 years as chairman of the police service, I know 
firsthand the importance of public protection and the need for 
law and order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments will be directed to amendments in this bill which 
propose changes to the way we deal with breaches of a federal 
release condition.  The thrust of the hon. member's proposal is 
to make the failure to comply with the condition of parole, 
statutory release, temporary absence a Criminal Code offence. 
Thus police would have the authority under section 495 of the 
Criminal Code to arrest without warrant offenders in breach of a 
condition because such a violation would constitute a criminal 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous comments by the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford 
lead us to believe that police work in isolation when dealing 
with offenders who breach a condition of release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, he has suggested that the process of bringing an 
offender back into custody is difficult and time consuming.  I 
remind the House that there is a long established system in place 
for handling such occurrences.  Correctional Services Canada and 
the National Parole Board already have the legislative authority 
and processes required to intervene promptly when there is a 
violation of a release condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correctional Services Canada has a network of duty officers who 
can issue a warrant on a 24 hour basis.  The warrant can be 
transmitted electronically anywhere in Canada where the need 
arises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may not be aware that under the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act police have the power to arrest an 
offender without warrant on the knowledge that a warrant has been 
issued against the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such cases the warrant is transmitted for execution within 
48 hours from the time of the arrest.  The hon. member has also 
cited examples where he says a police office cannot take timely 
action when he or she encounters an offender who is violating a 
condition of release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His comments fail to realize a very important reality, that in 
these instances and circumstances police work in partnership with 
correctional authorities to assess and respond quickly to these 
situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal correctional authorities view the police role and the 
enforcement of parole, statutory release or temporary absence 
conditions as a joint process, as a collaborative process.  There 
is good reason for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When police provide information to correctional supervisors on 
breaches of conditions the breaches vary in seriousness.  It may 
be that an offender has returned to a halfway house an hour past 
curfew or failed to report to the police station on a designated 
date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some instances, the correctional supervisor might deem that a 
disciplinary interview is sufficient to deal with the matter.  In 
others, he or she may determine the suspension of a conditional 
release and the arrest of the offender is necessary for the 
protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is worthy of note.  I fully understand the hon. 
member's desire to have an effective law and procedures in place 
especially when it comes to apprehending those who pose a danger 
to others, including children and other vulnerable individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government shares this concern.  That is why, in addition to 
the authority and measures provided in the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, there have been amendments to the 
Criminal Code to enable the police and the courts to better 
intervene in situations where a person's conduct in the community 
may be potentially threatening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Criminal Code was amended in 1993 to permit the 
court to make an order prohibiting an offender who has been 
convicted of a sex offence including a child from being in the 
vicinity of a school ground, a playground or a community centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision also allows a court to make an order prohibiting 
that offender from seeking or continuing employment that involves 
being in a position of trust with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 264 was also added to the Criminal Code in 1993 to deal 
with the offence of criminal harassment to cover conduct such as 
stalking which places another person in fear for his or her 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another provision makes it easier for those who are victims of 
domestic abuse to seek conditions of recognizance to keep the 
offender away and to make it more likely that the abuser, not the 
victim, is removed from the home.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently a new long term offender designation was created 
for high risk sex offenders to provide a period of long term 
supervision for up to 10 years past their warrant expiry date.  A 
new judicial restraint provision was also created to permit 
controls to be applied to any individual who poses a high threat 
and risk of committing a serious personal injury offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House know, the government considers the 
police to be an important partner in realizing our safe homes, 
safe streets agenda.  The last four years have probably seen the 
most intense focus on criminal law issues ever in Canada.  Let me 
take a moment to discuss some of those initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arguably one of the most important changes for police work has 
been the new legislation on DNA.  The first phase of this 
initiative began in 1995 with the DNA warrant legislation which 
allows police to get warrants to obtain DNA samples from 
suspects. That legislation laid the groundwork for phase two, the 
establishment of a national DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA data bank legislation was reintroduced last September. 
This legislation will greatly strengthen our efforts to solve 
crimes more quickly by identifying repeat and violent offenders 
and it will make it easier to link cases around police 
jurisdictions. With the continuing advances in DNA technology, 
the data bank will become ever more important to police work and 
prosecutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government also established a formal national program under 
the Witness Protection Program Act giving police better tools to 
fight organized crime by being able to ensure protection for 
those who risk their lives to assist in investigations. In May of 
last year a regulation under the Controlled Drugs and Substances 
Act gave police new powers to conduct reverse sting operations. 
Amendments to the Criminal Code brought about by Bill C-17 last 
May provided the legislative basis for the police to conduct 
storefront operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has put measures in place to deal with real 
issues of concern today, but having the foresight to prevent 
crimes is equally important.  Again the police community, in 
particular the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, has been 
a pioneer in promoting police crime prevention programs and 
victim services. This government has and will continue to work in 
partnership with the police in a balanced but determined approach 
to reducing and preventing crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the National Crime Prevention Council was established as 
part of the national strategy on community safety and crime 
prevention.  Together with the council, the Department of Justice 
and the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Canada identify what 
works and what is needed in crime prevention in our communities. 
This includes programs focusing on young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General of Canada hope 
to move quickly on the crime prevention front and to follow 
through with the Speech from the Throne commitment to increase 
levels of funding to $30 million each year in this area.  Both 
ministers are looking forward to working on renewing and 
developing new partnerships within communities, the police and 
all levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians rely on the police for protection and security.  This 
government has put the appropriate tools in place for effective 
police work through legislation and policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House have an interest in ensuring that the concerns 
of Canadians are addressed in a most effective and efficient 
manner.  I would ask that all members ensure that we proceed on 
that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reiterate my earlier comments that the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act provides police with 
ample authority to intervene quickly where there is a breach of 
parole, statutory release or temporary absence.  The Correctional 
Service Canada staff are available 24 hours a day to issue 
warrants of suspension and apprehension against an offender who 
has committed a breach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover police already have the power to arrest without warrant 
an offender against whom they believe a warrant of apprehension 
has been issued by the Correctional Service Canada or by the 
National Parole Board.  They may detain him or her for a 48 hour 
period from the time of the arrest until the execution of a 
warrant.  The warrant can be electronically transmitted anywhere 
in the country if need be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a process of careful consideration, I feel that this bill 
would create a power that is duplicative, unnecessary and 
probably inconsistent with the charter of rights and freedoms.  I 
would therefore urge members of the House to vote against it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
indeed a pleasure for me to rise in the House today to speak on a 
bill which would amend the Criminal Code with respect to the 
arrest of those in breach of condition of parole, statutory or 
temporary release.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill introduced by the Reform member for 
Langley—Abbotsford will do two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First it will amend the Criminal Code to make a breach of 
condition of parole, statutory release or temporary absence a 
criminal offence.  As a consequence, this would under section 495 
of the Criminal Code allow police officers to arrest without a 
warrant an offender who is found in breach of his or her parole 
or release conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the proposed bill is to amend section 497 of 
the Criminal Code.  The amendment would grant arresting peace 
officers the authority to detain an individual found in breach of 
his or her conditions in custody until the National Parole Board 
consents to or opposes the offender's release on bail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately I want to say that this would not constitute an 
arbitrary detention.  In fact we are talking about the rights of 
an individual who had the benefit of due process and has been 
convicted of a criminal offence.  His conditional release was a 
second chance and I do not see why we should give the individual 
a third chance when he breaches his conditions.  The individual 
is still paying his debt to society and by breaching his 
conditions he is breaking society's trust in his ability to 
respect the law. Therefore it is my view that this would not be 
an arbitrary detention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further I want to say that, like my colleague 
from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough said in this House in 
November 1997, the Progressive Conservative Party supports this 
bill.  The intent of this bill is positive.  It will provide our 
law enforcement officers with an additional tool in their fight 
against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes that are proposed in this bill are constructive for 
society and are very important.  They give police officers who 
observe individuals who have these conditions placed on them the 
ability to act and to act quickly and decisively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with our Criminal Code and our laws is not that 
police officers do not have the power to arrest but that they 
have to get authorization to do so.  Timing, as they say, is 
everything.  Such events often unfold quickly and officers do not 
always have the time to get the necessary authorization.  Police 
officers do not always have the time to get a justice of the 
peace or to contact the parole officer involved.  That is even 
more true in rural parts of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rural parts of our country police detachments are often 
comprised of only two members and they are responsible for vast 
territories.  With justices of the peace not always being 
available 24 hours a day, it becomes quite obvious that the 
amendments proposed in this bill would be very helpful for our 
police officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-211 is intended to enable police officers to act 
immediately to arrest an individual who is found in breach of 
release conditions without having either to seek a warrant from 
the National Parole Board or justice of the peace or wait until 
another crime is committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a practical example on how this bill could be 
helpful.  An offender subject to release conditions that require 
him or her to stay away from a particular address, either in the 
case of domestic violence or in cases where pedophiles are 
involved, could be arrested immediately upon being found in a 
forbidden area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason why I support this bill is that it will give 
authority to police officers to keep in detention individuals who 
are in breach of their parole conditions.  This means that the 
offender in breach of his or her conditions could not only be 
arrested immediately but also detained until the National Parole 
Board has been notified and given an opportunity to react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offenders who are breaking their terms of parole are, like I 
said earlier, once again breaking society's trust in their 
ability to respect the law.  I do not favour any sort of special 
treatment for such people.  Being released under certain 
conditions does not mean being free.  It means that these 
individuals are still paying their debt to society, a society 
that has already given them the chance to rehabilitate.  This is 
why I believe that their detention would not be an arbitrary 
detention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would ask all members of this House to ask 
themselves the following questions.  Will this bill improve the 
present law?  Will it allow police officers to more effectively 
carry out their duties and to better protect society?  The answer 
to these two questions is yes.  I ask this House to work together 
in a non-partisan way to see that Bill C-211 is carried through.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to address the bill introduced by the hon. 
member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other speakers have pointed out, Bill C-211 seeks to amend the 
Criminal Code so as to make any breach of a condition of parole or 
statutory or temporary release an indictable offence. Therefore, a 
police officer would have the power to arrest, without a warrant, an 
offender under the federal legislation, if he has reasonable grounds to 
believe that the person has breached or is about to breach a condition 
of his parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Bill C-211 would give a parole board the power, following 
the arrest of an offender, to release him or to ask a judge to keep him 
in custody until a warrant for his arrest is issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debated this legislation, on November 6, the hon. member 
for Langley—Abbotsford suggested that the proposed amendments were 
necessary, because police forces in Canada are currently unable to 
obtain a warrant, or to obtain it quickly enough to act effectively when 
offenders who come under federal jurisdiction fail to comply with the 
conditions of their parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reassure the members of this House. These allegations are 
absolutely false. Again, I want to assure members opposite that these 
allegations are absolutely false. 
There are legislative provisions and mechanisms in place to allow our 
police forces to act quickly and effectively in this type of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the breach of conditions of parole, statutory or 
temporary release, as well as the prevention of such breaches, are 
concerned, let me say that the legislative provisions currently in 
effect already give correctional authorities all the powers, and I mean 
all the powers, necessary to suspend an offender's parole. This makes it 
possible for a police officer to arrest the offender and to place him in 
custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for an offender who has received permission for an unescorted 
temporary release, a suspension warrant may be issued if the reasons for 
which the permission was issued have changed or no longer exist, or if 
there is fresh information which would have altered the initial decision 
if available at the time it was made. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  You don't know what you are talking about, 
not on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings:</B>  I always know what I am talking 
about.  My family said so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to offenders on parole or statutory release they 
say I am always right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to offenders on parole or statutory release, the 
Correctional Service of Canada and the National Parole Board may issue 
a suspension warrant any time they deem it necessary and reasonable to 
protect society. Such a mandate would allow police to return the 
offender to custody until his case can be examined by the National 
Parole Board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a network of officers on duty 24 hours a day and the faxing 
of warrants—yes, Canadians are now using modern technological equipment 
like fax machines—police can act promptly without having to wait for 
the actual warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have just demonstrated, there is a quick and efficient 
procedure allowing police to intervene promptly. Nothing in the act as 
it now stands suggests that police should wait for hours for warrants to 
be faxed. The act gives police sufficient powers to act as soon as they 
know a warrant is on the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to stress that, for serious breaches, police have 
the power to arrest without warrant any offender on parole who commits 
or who police have reasonable grounds to believe has committed or is 
about to commit a criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have heard about many hypothetical cases where police 
had their hands tied. We have also heard that, in one case, police had 
to wait for a judge to sign a warrant before arresting a pedophile on 
parole spotted near a playground. If this were true, I would personally 
and unconditionally support the proposed changes, but these examples are 
completely misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A judge's signature is not required to suspend the parole of a 
federal offender. I repeat, a judge's signature is not required to 
suspend the parole of a federal offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the correctional service may, whenever and 
wherever it sees fit, issue a warrant to immediately suspend the parole 
of an offender who constitutes a threat to the community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> At 3 a.m. in an alley? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Jennings:</B> You were not listening.  Officers on 
duty work 24 hours straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you stopped interrupting me, you might learn something.  I 
already said the duty officers work 24 hours straight.  The 
response to your question is therefore “Yes, even at 3 a.m.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, correctional officials can at any time and any place 
deliver a warrant to immediately suspend the parole of an offender 
who poses a public threat even though the person may not have 
broken the law. I say it again, even though the person may not have 
broken the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of a convicted pedophile, the Criminal Code 
already allows a court to issue an order preventing the individual 
for a period that can last to the end of his life from being in a 
place where children might reasonably be expected to be present. 
The Criminal Code enables the police to arrest without a warrant an 
offender on parole who contravenes such an order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an individual fears for his or her safety because an 
offender on parole repeatedly follows or threatens that individual, 
the Criminal Code already authorizes the police to arrest the 
offender without a warrant. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to completely dispel the false impression created 
by Bill C-211 that the police have limited arrest powers under 
the current legislation. 
They have more than sufficient powers under the current 
legislation, as does the National Parole Board, as does 
Correctional Services Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by saying I do not support the proposed amendments to 
the legislation.  I call on all my colleagues on both sides of 
the House to reject these proposed amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today on behalf of our police officers. Across 
the country and for many years they have been calling for the 
reforms offered by Bill C-211.  In fact, the police wrote this 
bill, the government not being able to develop a concept as 
simple and as common sense as this one.  They had to do the work 
for them.  Why did they do it?  To keep Canadians safer.  I am 
proud to do my part to see that police officers are given the 
authority to arrest parolees caught in violation of release 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically Bill C-211 seeks to amend the Criminal Code to 
create a hybrid offence of breach of parole or conditions of 
release.  As a result, existing Criminal Code section 495 would 
allow peace officers to arrest without warrant an offender who is 
found to be in breach of his or her parole or release conditions. 
This bill would also grant arresting peace officers the authority 
to detain an individual charged with such an offence in order to 
allow the National Parole Board time to consent to or to oppose 
the continuation of his parole freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new parliamentarian and a trusting Canadian citizen I was 
shocked to discover that this gap in law existed at all.  Like 
most people I know, I would have presumed that a person on parole 
had such a privilege only as long as he was living within the 
conditions set at the time of his release.  I would have also 
presumed that breaking those rules immediately removed privilege 
of parole.  But that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief of police Ian Russell said last month there is 
no power of arrest for a police officer who finds a person in 
violation of his parole.  Ian Russell is the new police chief 
for the Ontario community of LaSalle.  His comment appeared in the 
Windsor <I>Star</I> of January 17, 1998.  Mr. Russell is a veteran 
of this war to amend the Criminal Code and has illustrated the 
problem clearly with the following story: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A convicted wife beater is released from jail but a condition of 
his parole is he stay at least 1,000 metres from the home of his 
victim.  Nevertheless he goes to her home and stands on the 
public sidewalk.  The frantic victim calls the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officers arrive but the man is not trespassing.  His behaviour 
cannot be called stalking.  But he is violating the parole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the police arrest him and remove the apparent threat. Not 
unless, as Russell explains, the convicted wife beater breaks 
another law on the spot.  Because he is only in violation of a 
condition of his parole the wife beater could remain there until 
a police officer went to the parole officer and submitted a 
report or contacted the parole officer to ascertain whether he 
would issue a warrant to suspend the parole.  Then and only then, 
armed with the warrant, can the police officer return to try and 
fine the parolee, arrest him and return him to custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parole officer has no way of assessing an imminent risk and 
must rely on the peace officer's assessment anyway.  The step of 
contacting a parole officer is pointless and potentially risky. 
This makes no sense.  In the time it takes to contact a parole 
officer and convince him of the need to arrest the violator, he 
can leave the scene and repeat the whole business over and over 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Russell points out, if the violator has decided he will end 
up back in jail anyway he may return to do something “really 
worthwhile”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is achieved in this scenario?  Nothing except for the 
protection of the privileges of the former inmate.  I point out 
that a conditional release is a privilege.  It must be earned on 
the inside, monitored on the outside and be capable of being 
enforced without needless bureaucratic red tape.  That is why I 
stand in support of Bill C-211. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems only natural and only right that the safety of 
law-abiding Canadians should come before the privileges of a 
convicted criminal who has not even completely repaid his debt to 
society.  I prefer to think of this as closing a loophole and not 
the reinterpretation of fundamental rights in this country. Bill 
C-211 is intended to return the balance of rights to law-abiding 
Canadians.  That is those who expect our police officers to 
protect Canadians and their families from known dangers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has a three part upside which should make it 
particularly easy for members from all sides of this House to 
throw their support behind it.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill's only purpose is to help police protect 
society. That makes it non-partisan and nearly controversy free. 
Why would we as elected members of Parliament not help police do 
their jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it requires no money.  How often can we say that about a 
piece of helpful legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it confers no inappropriate powers on police.  In fact, 
it clarifies a power most people would say should already exist. 
I can only restate that it is unacceptable for police themselves 
to be handcuffed by the inefficiencies of a pointless warrant 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fully aware of the mine field we walk through known as the 
charter of rights and freedoms, or should I call it the 
challenges to the charter, which test the patience of regular 
Canadians such as me.  One of the only criticisms of this bill is 
that without proof that present system imposes unreasonable time 
constraints on the police, broader police powers to arrest 
parolees who have committed no new offence would be unlikely to 
withstand a charter challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in agreement that the charter should protect our individual 
rights and freedoms.  As a member of the Reform Party I am 
committed to this philosophy and support our victims bill of 
rights. It is the ridiculousness of criminals using these very 
rights and freedoms they have themselves betrayed to shield 
themselves from punishment or to endanger innocent citizens that 
I disagree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it just me or are not convicted criminals supposed to lose 
some rights as punishment for their crimes?  Would not completely 
fulfilling the conditions of one's parole be required before 
those rights are fully returned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the unlikely event of such a charter challenge I would hope 
common sense would prevail.  I would also hope that the 
consistent and persistent request for such amendments to the 
Criminal Code by our police community, in addition to concerned, 
law-abiding citizens, would be taken seriously as proof that such 
a need exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, if we consider our peace officers to be 
professionals, we owe them a fair hearing of what they say they 
need and we owe them the tools they need to do their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reconsider for a moment the scenario earlier where the 
hypothetical police officer was called by a victim of wife 
beating when her husband violated his parole by coming within 
1,000 metres of her.  Because he could do nothing the officer's 
time was wasted and the woman's danger persisted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember, in order to protect her that police officer would have 
had to track down the parole officer, submit a report and have a 
warrant issued.  Imagine what all this costs in terms of time, in 
terms of money and in lost opportunity to protect the person in 
need.  With the chances of catching the offender at slim to none, 
any cost is too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we offer police officers, at their sincere urging, a no 
cost solution with a potential for quicker, more effective 
response to real life situations such as this.  As for the price 
of peace of mind, simply imagine your own loved one in any kind 
of catch-22 situation like the ones these police officers deal 
with every day and notice how invaluable it really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the requirements of Bill C-211 did cost money, we would 
be remiss in not passing this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of prudence, what could be more reasonable than 
extending to peace officers the powers they need to do their 
jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ian Russell again says this best: “All we are asking is that 
the officer have the authority to apprehend and secure the inmate 
or parolee, take him to a facility, and forthwith contact the 
duty officer to see whether or not the arrest will continue via a 
parole suspension”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is reasonable and necessary. It is no more and no less than 
what is needed.  It is similar to the method with which those who 
violate their probation conditions are treated.  Police across 
the country say it will work and I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with one more example.  In 1988 a psychopathic 
pedophile named Joseph Fredericks raped and murdered 11 year old 
Christopher Stephenson.  Joseph Fredericks was on parole at the 
time and a condition of his parole was that he stay away from 
children.  No peace officer saw them but what would an officer's 
options have been had he seen them?  Arrest Fredericks?  He has 
not committed a crime by being with Christopher.  Take down the 
particulars and report to a parole officer and request a warrant? 
Would that protect him?  Not likely. How about arresting 11 year 
old Christopher under the Child Welfare Act as a child in need of 
protection?  Arrest a child? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case none of the above happened.  Christopher Stephenson 
was murdered by Fredericks who was caught and returned to prison 
where he was slain by a fellow inmate.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to this House to put a high priority on this amendment 
to the Criminal Code and to equip our police departments with all 
the tools they need to deal with breaches of parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired 
and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence 
on the Order Paper.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>AIRPORT SAFETY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise to ask a question of the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Transport.  It relates to airport safety as 
related to the divestiture processes going on across the country 
with cutbacks to NavCan and to other aspects of airport 
facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the minister announced an independent review of 
firefighting issues.  We are very pleased to hear that this 
review will take place, especially in consideration of the events 
that have taken place in Fredericton, Quebec, Sydney and Manitoba 
lately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main concern today is the divestiture of the Halifax 
International Airport and whether it will be equipped with 
adequate firefighting facilities after the divestiture.  I 
believe I have reason to be concerned because other areas of 
Halifax International Airport have been left with substandard 
operational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to compare Halifax with a couple of other airports 
around the country that have exactly the same airport volume of 
traffic, that is about 2.7 million passengers a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halifax has clearly been shortchanged because it has only 44% of 
the hold room space that an equivalent volume airport like Ottawa 
has.  Halifax has 69% less in baggage space and capacity than the 
airport at Winnipeg.  Halifax has 50% less out baggage space than 
the airport at Ottawa.  Halifax has 69% less check in space than 
the airport at Ottawa.  Again, these are all equivalent capacity 
airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall worst statistic that really is kind of discomforting 
is the fact that Halifax handles 750,000 more passengers than its 
rated capacity.  That fact alone raises safety questions that I 
think should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on November 18, the Minister of Transport unequivocally 
guaranteed me in the House that Halifax would be treated the same 
way as all other equivalent airports in these negotiations.  I 
ask today whether the parliamentary secretary, on behalf of the 
minister, will confirm that this commitment would not only 
address the issues I have listed but would also ensure that 
equivalent safety facilities to those of other airports with the 
same capacity such as Ottawa and Winnipeg are available for 
Halifax International Airport. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am in a bit of a quandary 
because the order paper indicated that we would be dealing with 
the question put by the hon. member on December 3 when he asked 
about NavCan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking for a ruling.  The response the government has 
prepared is to the request by the hon. member for a late show 
question arising from a question in the House regarding NavCan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if this situation puts the member out of order 
with his late show question this evening.  I can answer the 
question put by the hon. member at this time or if you find, 
Madam Speaker, that the question is out of order the member could 
try to put the question again by reintroducing at another date 
his late show question of this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave it to you, Madam Speaker, to make the judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I did not submit a 
question to the hon. parliamentary secretary for him to answer. 
This question relates to NavCan.  It relates to the cutbacks. It 
relates to aircraft safety.  I really would ask that the 
parliamentary secretary answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There cannot be any

to come to some kind of arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Madam Speaker, if you would like to start 
the clock with two minutes for a response from the government, I 
can respond right now to the hon. member's question as he has put 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  We will put the clock 
back two minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will try to be as quick as 
I can with the different questions arising from the member's 
question this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I remind the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester that 
safety will always be the first priority of Transport Canada.  As 
most Canadians are aware, Transport Canada has operated the 
country's air traffic control system safely for more than 50 
years.  We are very proud of that record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of NavCan and its management over the past year, 
the air navigation system continues to be safe and secure.  The 
managers there are intent on maintaining the good and positive 
record and on enhancing it whenever possible.  Air traffic 
control staffing levels at airports across Canada have always 
varied in accordance with changing traffic demands and training 
lead times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member understands that at no time is the safety 
of Canadians put at risk, whether it has to do with the 
devolution of responsibilities of air traffic control to NavCan 
or the firefighting and rescue capabilities at a particular 
airport.  I have an airport on the outreaches of Hamilton so I am 
very cognizant of the member's concerns for the airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I assure the hon. member opposite that again he can receive 
the unequivocal guarantee he has received already from the 
Minister of Transport that Halifax will be treated the same way 
as all other cities in the country have been treated in the 
negotiations.  He will know the Minister of Transport has stood 
in his place and has put into process the firefighting 
regulations which are again being looked at by the commission. It 
will report.  In the meantime— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt but I cannot allow the parliamentary secretary any more 
time.

and prepared for her department on first nations social 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report confirms the findings of the auditor general, several 
internal studies and the royal commission on aboriginal people 
that the department is grossly mismanaging social assistance 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report concluded that on reserve welfare dependency is 
increasing, costs are out of control and the department is 
running out of money.  This confirms the Reform Party's audit 
which showed that 75% of DIAND's social affairs budget is 
unaccounted for.  All of this is despite the fact the 1997-98 
estimates allocate $1.03 billion for on reserve social 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Reilly of the Provincial Court of Alberta was so concerned 
that he took the unprecedented step of ordering an investigation 
into alleged political abuse, violence, drug dependency, suicide 
and other social ills.  The results were staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grassroots natives are not receiving the benefits that are 
earmarked for them because of the government's inept approach to 
native issues.  It is causing serious problems on Canada's 
reserves and nowhere is this more apparent than in my 
constituency of Wetaskiwin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hobbema reservation is home to four Cree bands:  Samson, 
Montana, Louis Bull and Ermineskin.  Considered one of Canada's 
wealthiest reserves, Hobbema receives huge payments for oil 
royalties.  The children receive about $100,000 in trust fund 
payments on their 18th birthday, yet this reserve is plagued with 
high unemployment, poverty and substance abuse. 
It has been estimated that 80% of the people on the Hobbema 
reserve live on welfare and in poverty.  How can this be possible 
in light of the royalties and the transfers from the federal 
government?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Samson Band asked the same question. When they 
were not provided with any answers they staged a protest to draw 
attention to what they consider to be mismanagement of funds by 
the band council.  Four concerned members travelled to Ottawa to 
seek a meeting with the minister but they received the proverbial 
brush off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister to clear the air and order a forensic audit 
of the Samson Band's finances.  The hon. member for Skeena, 
Reform's Indian affairs critic, also asked the minister for an 
independent audit.  Our requests fell on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reluctance of the minister and her officials to get involved 
is another example of this government's determination to maintain 
the status quo, to keep people in poverty and to perpetuate 
dependency.  One of Hobbema's respected elders, Norman 
Yellowbird, wrote in the Wetaskiwin <I>Times</I> that “the 
conditions outlined in Judge Reilly's report can be found on 
almost every reserve in Alberta, if not Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is increasingly obvious that there are bands operating 
outside normal bounds of acceptable standards in terms of proper 
fair management of their social assistance programs.  The human 
cost of this accountability crisis is both staggering and 
appalling.  An effective monitoring appeal process is urgently 
required, preferably one run by the Indian people that is 
designed to protect against excess and to ensure equity and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people are clearly unhappy.  Canadian taxpayers do 
not want to see their hard earned dollars misspent.  How many 
more reports are needed?  What kind of proof is required before 
this government abandons its practice of following the course of 
least resistance?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the hon. member for 
Wetaskiwin on behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal inclusion in Canada's economic prosperity is 
important not only for aboriginal people but for all Canadians. 
The aboriginal labour force is young and is growing at twice the 
national average.  The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples 
estimated that 300,000 jobs will be needed by the year 2016.  A 
major increase in the aboriginal economy and activity, both rural 
and urban, is essential to meet the needs and aspirations of 
aboriginal youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to working in partnership with the 
aboriginal leadership and business people, Canadian industry, the 
provinces and the voluntary sector to take action that will 
create the conditions to maximize economic activities and jobs in 
aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 7 this government announced our response to the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.  This response includes a 
commitment to change social assistance on reserves from passive 
income maintenance toward more active measures such as training 
and skills development to increase individual and community self 
reliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of our aboriginal action plan we announced the creation 
of an aboriginal human resources development council which will 
bring together the public and private sectors to identify 
employment opportunities for aboriginal people.  The Regina 
<I>Leader Post</I> welcomed this initiative and said that it is 
encouraging that workable solutions are now being developed to 
help native people help themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution is not to cut almost a billion dollars out of 
programs that support basic services for aboriginal people as the 
Reform Party plans to do, nor is the solution assimilation or 
Ottawa imposed paternalism.  The solution is to work with 
aboriginal communities and businesses to help them acquire the 
tools they need to become full partners in Canada's future.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1).
