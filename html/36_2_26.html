honoured today to table on behalf of my constituents 43 petitions 
calling on the government to keep the reference to God in the

Speaker, I am very pleased and honoured to be able to present a 
petition that has been signed by thousands of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very timely petition.  It gives the government some 
critical advice at an important juncture especially facing the 
initiatives we have heard this past couple of weeks from Ralph 
Klein in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call on the federal government to preserve and 
enforce the Canada Health Act, the foundation of medicare in 
every province and region of Canada, and maintain the five 
principles of medicare:  universality, accessibility, 
portability, comprehensiveness and non-profit administration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that as part of a caring society they believe 
that the Government of Canada can deal more effectively with the 
more than 18,000 Canadians suffering from end stage kidney 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that those on kidney dialysis and those 
successfully transplanted recognize the importance of the 
bioartificial kidney approach to their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that ministers of health have great difficulty 
providing sufficient dialysis facilities and that rates of organ 
donation are not sufficient to meet the need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They therefore call on parliament to work and support the 
development of a bioartificial kidney which will eventually 
eliminate the need for both dialysis or transplantation for those 
suffering from kidney disease.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to take part today in a 
debate in the House which is all about new directions for health 
research in Canada.  The creation of the Canadian institutes of 
health research which is proposed in Bill C-13, now before the 
House, will truly mark a transformation in the way health 
research is organized, funded, co-ordinated and carried out in 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes that we propose are all about excellence, about 
encouraging those who seek it, about rewarding those who achieve 
it.  It is about changing the way that we conduct scientific 
inquiry in Canada.  It is also about putting Canada at the 
leading edge of a dynamic international movement toward 
discovery.  From cancer to the human genome project, from the 
workings of the brain to understanding better the social and 
environmental factors that lead to health or illness, scientists 
are pushing back the frontiers of knowledge toward understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investigators are contributing to our grasp of factors that 
contribute to health and allow us to focus on the prevention of 
illness.  Here in Canada, we understand the importance of that 
work.  We know that health researchers are making an outstanding 
contribution, not only to the breadth of our knowledge but also 
to the depth of our understanding and to the quality of our 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's government is committed to making Canada an 
internationally acknowledged leader in the global advancement of 
health research.  To do that, to achieve that ambitious goal, we 
need to contribute new scientific knowledge based on research 
that meets the highest international standards of excellence.  We 
believe the best way to do that is to break down the barriers 
that have always separated different lines of inquiry in health 
research, separated one discipline from the other and so we 
propose the creation of the Canadian institutes of health 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be a network of investigators linked in virtual 
institutes.  It will bring together experts from four major 
disciplines:  from biomedical enquiry, to clinical research, to 
those working on how to improve health services and the delivery 
of services to Canadians, and those who focus on health 
determinants, what makes us ill and what keeps us healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This national network will address emerging opportunities, 
threats and challenges to accelerate the discovery of cures and 
of treatments.  It will build on the research base already out 
there in our universities, in our health and research centres, in 
our teaching hospitals and in our research institutes and link 
them all in a way that has never been done before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By connecting all of these different areas of research and 
knowledge, we believe we can break down the old stovepipes of the 
past and instead create the intellectual pipelines of the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very excited about this initiative at this time.  To our 
knowledge, no other country in the world is bringing such a 
multidisciplinary approach to health research and we are 
confident that it will transform not only how such research is 
done in Canada, but in other countries as well.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we have such confidence in this project is 
that it came from the health research community itself and 
reflects their priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not imposed by the government.  It was researcher-driven. 
Indeed, the involvement of the research community has been 
crucial to this initiative from the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, a national task force of Canada's health research 
community came together to chart a new course for research in 
this country.  After exhaustive consultations, that task force 
recommended the creation of the Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures build on the strong foundation created over 60 
years by the Medical Research Council of Canada as well as the 
national health research and development program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To facilitate the transition from the Medical Research Council 
to the institutes, an interim governing council was appointed 
made up of 34 eminent Canadians representing the research 
community, health practitioners, the private sector, charities, 
university presidents, granting councils and provinces.  This 
interim governing council has performed an outstanding service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a minister of the government, I want to report to the House 
that we should all be in the debt of these public-spirited 
persons who took so much time from their lives to make the 
remarkable effort to pull together the proposals that have now 
been expressed in the proposed legislation, which is Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for members to know that this effort was led by 
Dr. Henry Friesen, a scientist of conspicuous ability and 
president of the Medical Research Council of Canada.  He presided 
over the task force and over the interim governing council. 
Working with him at the interim council were two vice-chairs, 
Dorothy Lamont, president of the Canadian Cancer Society, and 
Eric Maldoff, who is, among other things, a busy legal 
practitioner from Montreal, but who involves himself in a variety 
of public service functions.  These three people have made a 
lasting contribution to the leadership they have shown on the 
interim governing council.  The government and the House, I 
believe, is very much in their debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes of health represent a further demonstration of 
the strong commitment of the Prime Minister and his government 
toward research and the knowledge economy.  We created a national 
network of centres of excellence.  We started the Canadian 
foundation for innovation and, in the recent Speech from the 
Throne and in the Prime Minister's speech in the House, we 
announced the creation of 1,200 new chairs for research 
excellence in universities around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew that additional funding was needed if we were to keep 
our research community alive and thriving, so we provided it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In last February's budget, we announced $150 million over three 
years for the existing granting councils.  We set aside another 
$65 million for the Canadian institutes in the coming fiscal 
years.  We will increase that amount to $175 million in the 
second year.  This is the single largest investment in health 
research in Canadian history.  It represents a doubling of the 
level of Canadian funding for health research all in the space of 
three years.  It is a clear indication of the government's 
profound commitment to research and to knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confident that these institutes will not only improve our 
understanding of health issues, disease, health services and 
prevention of illness, but they will also bring economic 
benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>New researchers will be hired.  Technologists, graduate students 
and other highly skilled workers will be given opportunities to 
develop their potential. Over the longer term the work will lead 
to new discoveries, new products and new patents. This dynamic 
research environment will also create a very attractive 
investment climate for Canadian and international companies, 
resulting in even greater economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn for a moment to how these institutes will work in 
practice and why they represent an improvement over the current 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health research environment is changing rapidly. New threats 
to health are always emerging, for example, new strains of 
bacteria resistant to old forms of treatment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And in response to these new challenges, modern health research 
is also changing.  There is a revolution in genetic technologies 
and a greater awareness of the effects of the environment and 
other factors on our health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, innovative methodologies in health research 
are allowing us to identify and evaluate how to provide health 
services in the most efficient and cost-effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is bring all of these elements together, in a 
co-ordinated way.  The CIHR will do this.  It will integrate 
basic biomedical research with applied clinical research. 
It will improve our delivery of health care through study of 
health services and systems. And it will deepen our 
understanding of health by studying the factors which affect it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will also provide for a more efficient use of public funds. 
At the moment, research proposals are largely initiated by 
researchers themselves and funding is subject to quality review 
by peers.  While research will continue to be subject to peer 
review, the new system will allow us to identify gaps in 
knowledge and direct our efforts to filling those gaps. Both the 
quality of the research and its relevance to health priorities 
will be the basis for future funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that ethics will be a key component of 
the institutes of health. Standards and policies will be 
developed to ensure that research is conducted in keeping with 
the highest ethical standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes will also encourage the development of 
partnerships.  The institutes are designed to work seamlessly 
with provincial and territorial health departments, with 
universities, with health science centres and with other research 
agencies. There will be a greater opportunity for the voluntary 
sector and community groups to have a say in setting priorities 
for research and for partnerships with institutes where there are 
common goals to be pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One element which illustrates this approach is the Community 
Alliances in Health Research announced in October.  This will 
take the institutes of health research into communities across 
the country to address issues of local concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Say for example the community has a particular health concern. 
Researchers would work with community representatives to examine 
the best ways of addressing those concerns, of finding the cause, 
of facilitating prevention, of furthering treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know for example that rural communities face different health 
challenges than urban areas.  The CIHR will have the ability to 
address the specific preoccupations of rural populations 
employing a multidisciplinary approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR will do something else as well. It will create 
opportunities for young Canadian scientists and for scientists 
around the world to work in a cutting edge research environment. 
Dr. Henry Friesen has said that this initiative “sets Canada up 
to be a world centre”, to use his words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Michael Smith, Nobel Laureate in 1993 who is now carrying on 
his work in British Columbia has stated: “The creation of the 
CIHR is a clear indication of a commitment to strengthen Canada's 
research capacity.  This is a wonderful time to be a part of this 
country's research community as we enter the next millennium”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of impact this legislation can have.  That is 
the kind of atmosphere of excellence we want to create here in 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to make Canada the country of choice for researchers 
from around the world.  And we want to make our own students and 
researchers feel that there is nowhere else they would rather be 
because there is nowhere else that they can achieve so much. The 
CIHR goes a long way to achieving that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is good for health research.  It is good for 
jobs and it is good for Canada.  Because at the end of the day, 
its beneficiaries will not just be the research community, or 
our young scientists, but Canadians, from all walks of life and 
from all parts of the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Canadians who will have more information about preventing 
disease and promoting health.  It is Canadians who will benefit 
from new treatments and products coming to market more quickly. 
It is Canadians who will benefit from a health system that is 
making the most efficient use of their health care dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hardly need to remind the House that when it comes to health 
research, the obstacles to progress are often formidable.  We 
also know that the human impulse for exploration and for 
discovery is unstoppable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much discussion in the House and elsewhere about 
what some call a brain drain.  There are numbers exchanged back 
and forth in the debate about whether Canada is or is not 
suffering a loss of human capital and its best brains.  It is 
difficult to know what the true facts are because the debate 
becomes so clouded by politics.  One thing we do know for certain 
is that if we are to keep the best and brightest in our country, 
if we are to create an environment in which excellence is 
encouraged and its achievement is permitted, if we are to make 
Canada, as the Prime Minister has said the place to be in the 
21st century, then one of the essential steps we must take is to 
invest in research and create a research environment where people 
will want to stay and where people will want to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Canadian institutes of health research is 
about.  A doubling of federal funding for health research, a 
co-ordination of every one of the disciplines involved in health 
inquiry, a new approach to organizing and carrying out scientific 
inquiry for health purposes, all of this has been inspired by 
excellence.  I truly believe that the legislation now before the 
House can make a measurable difference not only in the research 
environment, not only in keeping people in Canada and bringing 
them from abroad to do their best work, but at the end day in 
improving the health of Canadians and the capacity of our health 
system to respond when they are ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years ago, maps of the world had whole sections of the 
globe that were referred to only as terra incognita, because at 
the time, no one knew what was there.  Over the decades and 
centuries, brave men and women ventured forth and discovered what 
was there.  They gave names to those places and pushed back the 
frontiers of human experience and human knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there is still much terra incognita in human knowledge and 
understanding.  Nowhere is the process of exploration more 
exciting or more important than in the field of health research. 
Canada intends to be at the forefront of that field. As Canada's 
Minister of Health, through this legislation I say to the world 
that we intend to be the best.  We intend to do it best. We 
intend to demonstrate to the entire world that Canada is truly 
the place to be.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend this legislation to the House and urge all members of 
all parties to support it.  It is a measure that goes beyond 
politics.  It has nothing to do with partisanship.  It is truly 
in the interests of Canada.  I encourage all my colleagues to 
approach it in that spirit, to pass it through this place to 
committee, to hear the witnesses, to make sure we have it right 
and then to send this legislation on so that the institutes can 
open their doors and commence to function on April 1 next year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of the Minister 
of Health.  Our objectives are very similar. We in the Reform 
Party are happy to see that finally the government has decided 
over the last two years to put money back into research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objectives are the same in trying to strengthen research. We 
recognize that research is the backbone of our economy. It gives 
Canadians a cutting edge to provide not only our citizens but 
also people around the world with a better, safer, healthier 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to compliment Dr. Henry Friesen for the work he has 
done.  He has been innovative in trying to merge or change the 
Medical Research Council from what it was into a new, dynamic 
unit which will ensure that more money is put into the cutting 
edge of research rather than swallowed up in bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party are happy to say, as far as we can see at 
this point, that it will also provide an opportunity to revamp 
research units to make them more effective. It also links up 
existing research units across the country. Those linkages enable 
people in the scientific field to be work more effectively. 
Having previously worked in research, I can say that effort is 
welcomed to be sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the bill up to committee.  If the bill will 
improve the health and welfare of Canadians, research in Canada 
and make sure more money will be put into the hard edge of 
research rather than into the bureaucracy, then we in the Reform 
Party will support it because it is a good thing. If the 
accountability is there then we will support it.  However, we 
want to hear from the specialists and the researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we do have some concerns.  One of those concerns was 
lobbed by a very well respected scientist in the country, Dr. 
John Polanyi, our 1986 Nobel Laureate. Dr. Polanyi made a very 
good point.  He and other researchers around the country fear 
that research will be industrialized, that the only way 
individuals will be able to get their research funds is through a 
small group of people at the top who will dictate to them what 
they can and cannot do.  I am sure the minister fully recognizes 
that this is not a healthy thing in research.  No one wants it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I met with Dr. Friesen, he assured me in the context of the 
structure now that there would be peer review, that the money 
that would be spent would go to the most effective corners of 
research and that there would be outside, independent analysis on 
an ongoing basis as to where the research funds would go.  We 
support that.  At the end of the day we, and I hope the 
government does too, want to make sure that taxpayers' dollars in 
research, as in everything else, will be used in the most 
effective fashion possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the organization of the CIHR it was stated that 95% of the 
moneys would be used for the hard edge of research and at a 
maximum 5% of the money would be used for bureaucracy.  That is a 
good thing.  We will make sure that the government holds up to 
that promise. It is most important that the money gets down to 
the hard edge and is not swallowed up by a bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that when I looked at the organizational structure, 
my fear was that would be exactly what would happen, that the 
organization being put forward was just another effort by the 
government to create a large bureaucratic structure that would 
swallow up a large amount of money at the expense of the hard 
edge of research. 
Our fear was that the extra money that was put into research 
would not go into research but would go into developing this 
rather grand bureaucratic scheme.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in speaking with Dr. Friesen, many of the people on the 
advisory boards will be volunteers selected from their peers. 
They will be the best of the best so that they can select, advise 
and channel our research funds from the federal government to 
make sure we get the best bang for the buck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever happens with the CIHR, it should be an arm's length 
institution so that the scientists who work there and scientists 
across the country will be able to do the basic research that is 
so important in developing groundbreaking findings in which 
Canada has historically been a world leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need that basic research and it needs to be supported.  It is 
not immediately obvious to those who work in research that their 
findings and their work will actually lead to an economic benefit 
in the short term.  That is not what research is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that much of the money that is invested has to have 
an economic benefit.  We have to show effect and responsibility 
for taxpayer dollars, but there is a balance.  On the one hand we 
have to make sure that the money goes to the type of research 
which will accrue a benefit, but on the other hand we cannot 
disallow or prevent the basic scientific research that exists in 
this country which will enable us to make those large 
groundbreaking research efforts in the future.  Our concern is 
whether that will be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our other concern is that we must ensure the independence of 
researchers.  We must ensure that they have the intellectual 
independence and freedom to pursue the study and groundbreaking 
research that is inherent to the university setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another option the government has in the industrial research 
setting is to provide the tax incentives which will enable 
industry to do that research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that Reform has always said is that because of 
the high taxation levels the government imposes upon the 
corporate sector it is not able to do the required research. 
When we speak to the people who want to do this research they say 
“We would love to do the research but we cannot do it because 
our taxes are so high.  Furthermore, we cannot retain the top 
notch scientists that we need”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health explained that he wants to retain those 
people.  Reform believes that we should retain those people. 
They are some of the best and brightest in Canada and in the 
world.  In fact, almost 10% of our population lives south of the 
border, not only because of the money but because of the 
opportunities that are provided within those research institutes. 
These people go south because they have an opportunity to live 
and work in cutting edge environments.  It is not because they 
have more money in their pockets, although for some that is 
certainly a benefit.  More importantly, as researchers, in their 
hearts they truly believe they can do more for humanity by 
working in an environment where they have the tools which enable 
them to be the best they can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not provide that now.  What I hope the Minister of 
Health will do is speak to his colleague the Minister of Finance 
and say “Cut your taxes”.  If we cut our taxes, the corporate 
and industrial worlds will be able to engage in the research that 
will help Canada move forward.  By doing so, we will improve our 
economy, retain our best and brightest, reduce our brain drain 
and strengthen our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the Minister of Health needs to look at, and this 
is related to the research aspect, is the situation in health 
care in Canada today.  We have had a debate recently on this 
issue and I think it is important to put it into context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the basic humanity of health care, and about 
preserving, maintaining and ensuring that Canadians get the 
health care they need.  However, the cold hard reality is that in 
1999 Canadians are not receiving it.  We have a two tiered system 
of health care in Canada today.  There are those who receive 
health care and those who do not.  Every tenet of the Canada 
Health Act is being violated.  It is a myth to say that we will 
support the status quo because the status quo is killing 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the principles of the Canada Health Act is accessibility. 
That principle has been broken.  Having 200,000 people on waiting 
lists for surgical procedures is not humane.  It is not good 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister wants to do something about it he needs to talk 
to the Minister of Finance and say “Return the $21 billion you 
took out of health care so that Canadians can get the health care 
they need when they require it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle is universality, but we are not all 
covered.  In fact, 84 essential procedures were delisted within a 
period of eight months in 1997.  That is continuing to occur in 
the provinces because the provinces do not have the money to pay 
for what is demanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform recognizes the cold, hard reality.  We have a situation 
today that is different than when the Canada Health Act was 
formed in the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act has noble, important principles that we 
would like to support.  In fact, we do support them, but the 
reality is that in 1999 the situation is different.  We have an 
aging population.  The population of those over the age of 65 
will double in the next 30 years.  These people use 70% of our 
health care dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among OECD nations Canada consistently ranks in the lowest third 
for medical technology because governments do not have the money 
to buy new technology, to buy the MRIs that will give Canadians 
the health care they should be getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister likes to talk about publicly administered health 
care.  The cold, hard reality is that in 1999 the federal 
government only supplies 11% of health care.  For every health 
care dollar that is spent the federal government only contributes 
11 cents.  Fifty per cent comes from the provinces and 30% comes 
from the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that people who have the money will get 
physiotherapy.  If they have the money they will get home care. 
If they have the money they will get new drugs.  If they do not 
have the money they will not get those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician I have worked with these people.  It is cruel and 
inhumane to watch a sick, elderly spouse take care of a sicker 
spouse without the help of home care because they do not have the 
money to pay for that home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have cut into the muscle and bone of health care in Canada 
today.  Patients are being discharged earlier and sicker.  Who 
pays the price?  It is the sick patient, the poor and the middle 
class who pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the principles of the Canada Health Act 
strengthened, but we have to look at the reality of today.  We 
have to ensure that the poor and the middle class have 
accessible, affordable, universal health care where we can get 
the best bang for our buck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money does not grow on trees.  That is the reality.  It is easy 
for people to say that anybody who opposes this wants an American 
style two tier health care system.  That is utterly false.  There 
are no members on either side of the House, particularly members 
of the Reform, who want an American style two tier health care 
system.  Everyone in the House abhors that with every bone in 
their body.  That would mean that people could not get health 
care, in particular the poor and the middle class, because health 
care would be determined by the money they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 200,000 Canadians on waiting lists who are suffering. 
It is inhumane to tell a person of 70 years, who may only live 
for five more years, that they have to wait a year before they 
can get their hip replaced because of the waiting list and there 
is no money to pay for it.  That person will spend 20% of their 
remaining life in severe pain.  That is not humane medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what Tommy Douglas wanted.  That is not what the 
Canada Health Act is about.  The Canada Health Act does not 
support that.  We do not support that.  I am sure that every 
member in the House does not support that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the Minister of Health to ask Dr. Friesen and other 
scientists to look at what we in the Reform Party would like to 
do.  We have to see the reality of today:  an aging population, 
more expensive technologies and fewer people working to pay the 
taxes that will provide the base for public health care.  We want 
to strengthen our public system and we want to look at the best 
models to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not throw the baby out with the bath water.  Let us not 
criticize provincial premiers like Mr. Klein who is not satisfied 
with thousands of suffering Albertans on waiting lists. He wants 
to find ways to make sure those people get health care when they 
need it.  If the Minister of Health wants to get on his high 
horse, rip out $21 billion from the provinces and tell Premier 
Klein that he cannot provide health care for people on waiting 
lists, then damn him.  It is the people out there who are 
suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who would try to polarize and poison this issue 
and prevent debate.  When they say that we want an American style 
two tier health care system they are doing it for political 
advantage.  Who pays the price?  The poor and the middle class 
are not getting health care today and they will not get it 
tomorrow.  We want to change that.  We want to make sure that all 
Canadians have equal access to good quality health care and that 
there is enough money in the system to provide that health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister wants to improve health care, I would suggest he 
do it through the CIHR.  He could look at existing studies that 
have been done by Canadians on the head start program.  If there 
is one fundamental thing that can be done to prevent many social 
ills, it is to look at an early intervention program using 
existing resources.  I am talking about prevention, not the 
expensive management of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are models such as the Moncton program, in which the 
Minister of Labour was a leader, the Perry preschool program in 
Ypsilanti, Michigan, and the Hawaii head start program.  What 
have they done?  With a minimal amount of money, and with $6 
saved for every dollar invested, they have reduced child abuse 
rates by 99%, they have reduced youth crime by 60% and they have 
reduced teen pregnancies by 40%.  The benefits accrue all the way 
along.  There is less dependence on social programs, less 
dependence on welfare and fewer kids dropping out of school.  In 
my province of British Columbia 30% of kids drop out of high 
school.  It is a recipe for economic disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1998 the House passed my private member's motion calling 
for a national head start program.  Reform has given to ministers 
and the government a plan of action to save thousands of 
children's lives and to save the taxpayer potentially billions of 
dollars.  I would personally like to see the ministers of 
justice, health, HRD and finance get together to look at adopting 
this plan.  It has a 25 year track record.  It is affordable to 
the taxpayer.  It will save the taxpayer money.  More 
importantly, it will save the lives of Canadians, especially our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government could do in its children's agenda. 
It could have this early intervention head start program for all 
Canadians, using existing resources.  It could use the medical 
community at time zero.  It could use trained volunteers in the 
middle, which is what they did in Hawaii.  It could use schools 
for the first few years of schooling.  That strengthens the 
parent-child bond, improves parenting, makes sure kids have their 
basic needs met and avoids a lot of the trauma that is so 
devastating to children when their brains are developing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current research shows very clearly that in the first eight 
years of life a child's brain is very sensitive.  When a child is 
subjected to abuse, sexual abuse, drugs, the witnessing of abuse 
or even more subtle things such as improper nutrition, improper 
parenting, a lack of boundaries and discipline, then that child 
suffers intellectually and psychologically, which has a profound 
impact upon that child's ability to empathize, sympathize, 
cognate and have appropriate interpersonal relationships with 
other individuals.

brains poisoned so they will have a chance to grow up on a level 
playing field, to grow up to be integrated and productive members 
of society instead of never getting a leg up in society and never 
being the best they can become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that the minister should look at, for which I 
place full blame on him and his colleagues, is the issue of 
smoking.  In 1994, mere months after the government was elected 
to office, the Liberals reversed a trend in smoking that had been 
going on for the previous 15 years.  For 15 years prior to that 
smoking consumption had been progressively going down.  Yet 
because of a smuggling issue the government was faced with a 
problem, how to deal with the smuggling of cigarettes because of 
the different prices in Canada and the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could it do that?  The government had two options.  The 
first one, which was proven to work, was to put an $8 per carton 
export tax on exported cigarettes.  That would have cut the legs 
out of smuggling in cigarettes completely, as was proven in 
1991-92. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also saw from that experience that when an export 
tax was put the tobacco companies, those purveyors of death said 
it could not do that because, if it did, they would leave town 
and be very angry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of doing the right thing, standing up to the tobacco 
companies and saying that it would put on an export tax because 
it is important to decrease smuggling, the government compromised 
the health and welfare of Canadians, particularly children, by 
dropping the tobacco taxes substantially and reducing the price 
by virtually 50% along with the provinces in central Canada.  Now 
we are reaping what was sown in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years in Ontario there has been a dramatic 
increase in consumption.  This is not news.  In 1994 Health 
Canada warned the Minister of Health at the time that more than a 
quarter of a million children would be picking up cigarette 
smoking as a direct result of the government's decrease in 
tobacco taxes and that half those children would ultimately die 
of tobacco related diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members did not do the right thing and put on an 
export tax.  Rather they comprised the health and welfare of 
every Canadian, particularly children.  They put their tail 
between their legs and dropped the tobacco taxes, knowing full 
well that it would commit a quarter of a million children to 
smoking and that half those children would wind up with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, early heart disease, peripheral 
vascular disease, strokes, numerous types of cancer and numerous 
other problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the legacy of what the government did in 1994.  It 
introduced the single greatest devastating health care act to 
affect Canadians in the last 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts today are proving what we said in 1994. If the 
government wants to truly deal with smoking and kids, it will 
deal with education but it will also put tobacco taxes back where 
they were in 1994 and put an export tax of $8 on each carton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would accomplish two things.  First, it would decrease 
consumption among kids and, second, it would cut the legs out 
from any smuggling initiative.  That is what the government needs 
to do and ought to do, yet it has not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I would like to raise is the issue of the manpower 
about which the CIHR need to warn the government very carefully 
and closely.  We have a significant manpower shortage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the nursing population, in the next 11 years there 
will be a lack of 112,000 nurses in the country.  There are 
nurses today that have graduated, and I was asked last night why 
we do not hire more nurses.  Why are they going down to the 
United States?  They are going to the U.S. because governments do 
not have the money to provide jobs for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that there is not a demand for them.  There is a huge 
demand for them.  As testimony to that are the 200,000 people on 
waiting lists, but the reality is that governments do not have 
the money to pay them.  Therefore they are going south where they 
can try to get jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is the area of medical specialties.  We will have 
an enormous lack of medical specialists in the very near future: 
surgeons, internists and specialists in dialysis.  This is what 
the government has to face and deal with now so we can train 
people to care for Canadians as we get older and to care for our 
children.  This is a critical shortage that no one is talking 
about.  The CIHR may want to warn the government of this 
impending disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we will support the CIHR bill up to committee stage. 
We will be very interested in seeing what the government has to 
say about it and, more important, what the researchers have to 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also stress that the government has to look at the 
reality of 1999.  We have an aging population, more expensive 
technologies, and less money to pay for what we want.  There is 
also a greater demand for things that are not covered today such 
as home care, drugs and dental services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that when the Canada Health Act was constructed the 
whole body was taken into consideration except for the mouth, the 
entry into the body.  By ignoring that, a great deal of morbidity 
was caused among the poor and the middle class of the population 
who do not have the money for proper dental care.  It is another 
unseen and silent problem within society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to recognize today that we have a multi-tiered 
system.  People who can afford it get the services.  They queue 
jump or the rich go south of the border.  Whereas the poor who 
would like to have physiotherapy when they are rehabilitating but 
cannot because they do not have the money, are forbidden to get 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health continues to ignore that if people need 
physiotherapy, home care, certain drugs, or care that is 
essential to their health, they are actually prevented from 
getting it in 1999 because they do not have the money and it is 
not covered.  The number of services not covered are expanding as 
time passes, and they will increase.  The gap between what we 
demand of our health care and our ability to supply it will also 
widen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us find a way in 1999 to live up to the ideals of Tommy 
Douglas, to live up to the ideals of the Canada Health Act, and 
to provide an affordable, accessible universal health care where 
no Canadian will be economically disadvantaged by becoming sick. 
We do not want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality today is that not only are Canadians waiting longer 
for surgery.  It has become so appalling that in the province of 
Quebec many patients have to wait two months for radiation 
therapy for cancer treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we imagine the shock of being diagnosed with cancer, with 
breast cancer or prostate cancer, and being told by a doctor that 
we will have to wait two months to get radiation therapy?  Is 
that good care?  That is not good care and no one in the House 
would support it.  That is what is going on today.  That is what 
we have in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec is so desperate, as is my province of 
British Columbia, that it is sending people south of the border 
at a cost that is far greater, five times what it would cost in 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Klein said that he would not accept the fact that 
Canadians were sick, that the poor and the middle class had their 
health care withheld, that they suffered and were sent to the 
United States where they had to pay five times what they should 
pay for service.  Premier Klein is looking for a way to provide 
for the care of these people without destroying the health care 
system and to make sure they get care when they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day the only thing that really matters is sick 
people get health care when they need it.  It should not harm 
them financially in any way.  It should be affordable to the 
taxpayer. That is the common objective of the Reform Party, and I 
would suggest all members on all sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have the courage to move forward.  We must have the 
courage to recognize the reality of today.  We must have the

get health care when they need it.  That is our objective as 
Reformers.  I am sure it is the objective of members across party 
lines.  We would like to see it happen and we would like to see 
it happen now.

<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-13.  I will start 
off by stating that we are, of course, in favour of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can clearly remember the 1993 and 1997 election campaigns.  In 
1993, Bloc Quebecois leader Lucien Bouchard called upon the 
government to make considerable investments in research in 
general, but in health research in particular.  He based this on 
an OECD report to the effect that Canada was lamentably behind 
in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on three major principles in my speech. 
I will try to explain what the Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research are, and why it would have been simpler, even if we are 
in favour of additional research in this area, for all this to 
have gone through the provinces.  We will have the opportunity 
to remind hon. members of the billions cut from transfer 
payments to the provinces, nearly $7 billion of them to health. 
These $7 billion cuts were imposed unilaterally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time comes to make cuts, co-operative federalism no 
longer applies.  The Minister of Health and the Minister of 
Finance do not sit down with their colleagues to find out how 
the wealth can be divided while destabilizing the provinces' 
finances as little as possible.  That is not how it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind the House as well of the requirements of the 
Government of Quebec and the members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
since we will be moving amendments to Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will we have to move amendments?  My colleagues know why— 
the members for Rosemont, Chambly and Jonquière—the role of the 
Bloc Quebecois is to work for an independent Quebec.  It should 
not be too long now before that is achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, work will have to be done to improve the government even 
more.  There is no need my telling members that this work is 
exhausting, such a heavy task it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the principle of Canadian institutes of health 
research.  Obviously, because of the environment, health 
research has changed.  The field is increasingly complex and 
requires increasingly sophisticated technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some claim that, with the sophistication of the technologies, 
between 1950—if I am not mistaken, the year you were born or 
were about to be born, Mr. Speaker—and now, our life expectancy 
has increased by one year every four years.  It is extraordinary 
to think that people lived to an average age of 40 at the turn 
of the century, and by the 1960s were living to an average age 
of 60.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average age of people today, if we take men as our example, 
is 76 years.  We are talking of men who do not smoke 
excessively, eat fairly well and look after their health 
determinants.  I will come back to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of women, the situation is even more interesting, 
and I am sure no one here will be upset by it.  Life expectancy 
for women is closer to 83 years.  People can hope to enjoy the 
company of the women in their lives, on average, for 83 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this reminds us that the major health determinants, 
technologies and environmental and health research are 
increasingly complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have increasing requirements for more resources to buy 
equipment and to carry out health research. While a few years 
ago scanners and equipment for health research and development 
may have cost $2 to $3 million, such equipment can now easily 
cost $10 million, $15 million, $20 million or $25 million, not 
to mention the fact that the life cycles of this equipment are 
getting shorter and shorter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health sector has changed and it is a good thing that Canada 
and the provinces can face new challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the establishment of Canadian institutes of health 
research and we also approve the four major research areas in 
which they will be involved. As the minister pointed out, an 
acting governing council has been established. It would have 
been a good thing to have the provinces take part in the 
appointment process for the acting governing council, and that 
this be spelled out in the bill. 
I will get back to this governing council, which will make 
extremely important decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lawmaker was right in not specifying in which areas health 
research institutes will be established. However, the acting 
governing council will become permanent and will have the power 
to decide in which sector these health research institutes will 
be set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be four major areas and I will talk about them, 
because hon. members are dying to find out about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first area in which Canadian institutes of health research 
can conduct research is a very important one, namely basic 
research in the biomedical field. 
I should point out that at least 60% of all biomedical research 
conducted in Canada is done through companies located in Quebec. 
This is not surprising, since research in brand name 
pharmaceutical products relies on tax incentives that were 
devised by the Quebec government and that apply in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On average, research helps produce about 20 new drugs every 
year. I could talk at length about research cycles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to name any pharmaceutical companies because I 
have too many friends in that field to give preferential 
treatment to one over another, but between the time a molecule 
is isolated in research and a drug is patented for use against a 
disease, 10 or 20 years may well have gone by. This is a highly 
complex process that requires millions and millions of dollars. 
It can easily take close to $300 million to get a drug onto the 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biomedical research is one of Quebec's strengths.  I am sure the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health agrees.  I 
believe there are even some companies located in his riding in 
the east of Montreal, and I am sure he agrees with me that it is 
very important for funding to be available to ensure the 
continuation of research in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean, concretely?  I would hate to be like 
Professor Calculus in Tintin, talking around in circles, without 
giving our viewers any concrete examples. What exactly does it 
mean to get a drug onto the market?

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the example of AIDS.  As hon. members know, AIDS 
came on the scene in the early 1980s.  At that time it was 
dubbed the gay plague, a figure of speech but a very evocative 
one, because it was so closely associated with a specific group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A whole generation of people lived with the AIDS virus, for 
which there were then no drugs. Now, the battle has been won. 
AIDS has gone from a fatal disease to a chronic illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, people are no longer dying of AIDS. 
Triple therapy, which is a combination of drugs, came along.  It 
is, of course, still an ordeal to be a person living with AIDS. 
It is an ordeal for these people personally and for their 
natural helpers, but nonetheless it is possible now to live with 
AIDS. This is in large part due to biomedical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see all parliamentarians join with me in 
offering our most sincere congratulations to BioChem Pharma, a 
Quebec company responsible for a number of drugs that have 
contributed to our winning out over AIDS and no longer dying of 
it.  AIDS has gone from a fatal disease to a chronic illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That initiative required an investment cycle of 
several millions of dollars. This makes it all the more 
important for governments to provide tax incentives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we should not discuss the balance to be achieved 
between the role of the patent drug industry and that of the 
generic drug industry. On the contrary, such a debate should 
take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Rosemont will certainly address this issue 
in his speech. We in Quebec feel we have achieved that balance; 
we do not hesitate to encourage, through real and significant 
tax incentives, the development of the patent drug industry, 
which is one of Quebec's finest industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public authorities, and particularly the health department 
masterfully steered by Pauline Marois, one of the best health 
ministers we have ever had at the National Assembly, do not 
hesitate to put on the list of available medication generic 
drugs that are equivalent to brand name drugs, when these may 
save taxpayers some money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, one of the research areas to be considered for Canadian 
Health Research Institutes is that of biomedical research in 
which, as I pointed out, Quebec is a leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clinical research is the second area. Applied clinical research 
is a very important area, since it plays a fundamental role in 
the discovery of new drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, I would like to digress for a moment. I am not very proud 
of the government in that area. I have a natural tendency toward 
fair-play. 
I tend generally to remember the good things the government 
does, when they happen, but I must also recognize the bad ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assess the entire drug licensing system. I have been 
interested in this since 1993, when I elected to represent the 
people of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve in the House of Commons with a 
very solid majority.  Not as solid as that of the member for 
Chambly, but I was still proud of my majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that the system of licensing drugs is not up to 
par in Canada.  Changes are necessary, since it is not uncommon 
for companies to choose to submit their clinical monograph in 
the United States in order to get their drugs approved, even 
though the research was done in labs here, in Quebec or in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all parliamentarians to take note and to help me put 
pressure on the government so that we may soon review the drug 
licensing system, which has two great shortfalls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what happens in the States, relatively speaking— 
we all know that the population of the States is ten times that 
of Canada and that the money invested in health research is not 
the same. 
In relative terms, ten times the number of people are working on 
drug licensing in the States as in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system of organizing work at the health protection branch is 
not the most effective to ensure a reasonable time between the 
submission of a clinical monograph and the arrival of the drug 
on the market, to ensure the wellbeing of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is as well an important third area of research, health 
systems services.  Health systems raise questions for all levels 
of governments. 
I understand one of the roles of the Canadian health research 
institutes—there will be between ten and fifteen—in addition to 
biomedical research and applied clinical research, will also be 
the business of analysing health systems and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics aside, all governments, be it the government of Ralph 
Klein in Alberta, Lucien Bouchard in Quebec, or Mr. Tobin in 
Newfoundland, are wondering whether we have organized our health 
system for maximum efficiency and effectiveness, so that it can 
deliver the best possible services to the public.  They are 
asking themselves some questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, all governments have envisaged some sort of 
ambulatory care formula—virage ambulatoire in Quebec—for ensuring 
that the public has health services when needed, but that stays 
in institutions are kept to the shortest time possible.  This is 
what the shift toward ambulatory care is all about: getting 
people back to their normal surroundings as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health systems are also facing a number of problems which, if 
managed effectively, could suggest promising solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out, for instance, people are living longer, with 
the result that there will obviously be tremendous demands on 
the system at some point, because it is inevitable that, between 
the ages of 60 and 90, we will in all likelihood require varying 
degrees of health care. 
Of course some are in better shape than others but the demand on 
health services does not generally come from people in their 
20s, 30s, 40s or even 50s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to ask all hon. members here to raise their hands if 
they needed to call upon the health services between the ages of 
30 and 50, I do not think there would be many hands to be seen, 
for this need generally arises in one's 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or 
even 90s.  In fact, the elderly no longer belong to a single 
group known as the third age. A new term has been coined, the 
fourth age, because people are living longer and longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois caucus is always pleased to salute our 
seniors. 
We invest a great deal of time in our fellow citizens of mature 
years, whether they are in social housing, in specialized 
resources or in their natural surroundings.  We are always 
pleased to salute them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides biomedical research, clinical research and research into 
health systems, the fourth area that will be supported by the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research is that of cultural 
society and population health.  This is something that needs 
considering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be admitted from the outset that people do not all start 
off life on an equal footing.  It is an error to think that a 
person born in Anjou and a person born in Saint-Henri start off 
life the same, will age in the same way, will cope with life in 
the same way.  It is wrong to think so, and this leads us to the 
whole matter of health determinators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now aware that all is determined before the age of five. 
That is what is called early childhood, and the more stimulation 
a child has, the better his or her early interpersonal 
relationships, the stimuli in life, the better his or her 
personal growth will be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no hesitation in paying tribute to the government, which 
has invested considerable sums in help in early childhood.  It 
is of course a provincial responsibility, but I must recognize 
that the government has done an excellent thing, and I think all 
my colleagues have benefited.  I refer, naturally, to the 
community action program for children, the CAPC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize it.  I said so earlier.  I can be critical, but I 
can also be motivated by honest fair play.  The CAPC is a good 
program.  I am sure that my colleagues will offer the government 
a good round of applause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> The determinants of health are found in well 
designed programs to meet the needs of a specific clientele, 
infants in this case.  I repeat, it is between the ages of 0 and 
five that everything comes into play.  This is when the brain 
develops.  This is when we learn to take in information and to 
create meaningful relationships with people, which will last a 
lifetime.  This is what determines our intellectual directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need for me to tell members that I had the good 
fortune of belonging to the category of children receiving a lot 
of intellectual stimulation.  I thank all those who have made 
the process possible, especially my mother and my twin brother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my early childhood, while we were not rich, we were not 
lacking for affection.  We lived in fairly close proximity. 
My identical twin, René, and I have fairly different characters. 
He is active in sports.  My only sport is jumping to 
conclusions, but I do train a bit at the gym.  I must say I was 
very happy then.  I remember those moments with great joy.  He 
went to École Victor-Doré, because he had cerebral palsy, and I 
went to a regular school, but at the end of the day, we kept 
each other abreast of the day's events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that contributed a lot to my intellectual development. 
It is in fact my intention before June to invite my twin brother 
René and to introduce him to my colleagues, even though some 
have thought that people are not quite ready for two Ménards in 
the same political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue by saying that the health research institutes 
will reposition research. 
It is extremely important to make sure that the areas to be 
covered by health research information will indeed be covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strategic repositioning will take place in health research to 
solve major medical issues. While we are pleased about the 
progress made in science, we are aware that some answers have 
yet to be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my two colleagues are here, I am taking this opportunity 
to stress that one area of research in which we will have to 
invest in the coming years is that of heredity, genetics, the 
human genome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing is good, because later on I will explain how Quebec 
has a number strengths in research. I mentioned biomedical 
research. There is, of course, cancer research. 
Quebec has very definite strengths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also AIDS research. Quebec was one of the first 
provinces, one of the first nations to conduct research on AIDS. 
I am thinking about Dr. Weinberg's expertise. Dr. Weinberg is a 
member of the international institute for research on AIDS. He 
is the chair of that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. member for Jonquière will make an eloquent 
presentation on genetic engineering, which is a strong sector in 
Quebec. This is why my colleague—who is incidentally an excellent 
member of parliament and a hard worker who keeps on top of her 
files—is very involved in making sure that the riding of 
Jonquière, which she represents here in the House of Commons, 
will get a health research institute specializing in genetic 
engineering. 
I do not want to anticipate on this topic, because the hon. 
member will be addressing it. She has a much better grasp of 
what is going on in this area than I do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that the government will be won over by the 
arguments in favour of selecting her region as the hub of all 
genetic engineering research, because the institutes in question 
are not physical structures.  We are not talking about mortar 
and brick, but about virtual structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us here know something about the meaning of virtual 
because very often, during oral question period, we have the 
impression that the answers the government is giving us are 
virtual too.  So we can speak with authority about matters 
virtual.  The future CIHRs will be virtual; they will not have a 
new physical location, but will bring people together in a 
network. We are speaking of establishing networks. 
I will give an example of the region my colleague, the member 
for Jonquière, comes from.  If it is decided to establish a 
genetic engineering research institute, research will be 
concentrated in this region, but there may be information from 
Saskatoon or Halifax, because all researchers will be able to 
access the network, and the most up-to-date information will be 
available to all members of the research community with similar 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that this is the great thing about the institutes 
being proposed in Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research will thus finally be broadened—I use this word 
deliberately—and decompartmentalized.  Wherever researchers are 
concentrated, they will be able to stay abreast of what is being 
done by their counterparts elsewhere.  This will, we hope, 
create a vigorous environment that will benefit the public and 
contribute to the development of researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand what the government intends to do, funding for 
these institutes will follow the normal curve. 
I think we used to learn in statistics—perhaps not so much in 
law—that the normal curve of distribution is bell shaped. I 
understand that investments in the Canadian institutes of health 
research will peak at $500 million. One has to admit that it is 
not a mere pittance. Indeed, it is a considerable amount. It 
will allow an increase in our capacity by investing in the 
development of researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I would like to draw attention to a fact which the 
minister glossed over, but which I believe is worth mentioning, 
and that is the fact that the Medical Research Council will be 
abolished. 
This bill contains transitional clauses. There are basically 
four main granting agencies in Canada: the Medical Research 
Council, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, 
the Natural Sciences Research Council, and the National Research 
Council, the latter being involved in supporting industrial 
research in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill is passed—and I understand that it is reasonably 
well received, although I will comment further on this later on, 
because the Bloc Quebecois is motivated by its search for 
excellence as it has always been—we will have the opportunity to 
move amendments which I dare hope will be supported by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian institutes of health research will promote 
interdisciplinary and integrated health research. This is 
important, because very few research fields are self-supporting. 
When research in genetics is carried out, it obviously can have 
some impact on research on populations. For instance, research 
on diabetes can change our understanding of health determinants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all hangs together. One of the merits of the Canadian 
institutes of health research would be to promote greater 
interdisciplinarity. 
As I said on many occasions because I feel it is quite crucial, 
this will encourage exchange of information between researchers. 
It will also encourage innovations in the field of research and, 
to conclude on this particular issue, it will further advance 
health research application in Canada and in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I referred to the interim governing council made up of 
34 eminent Canadians. If need be, I could easily list them; 
there are quite a few celebrities among them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of Dr. Friesen of the Medical Research Council of 
Canada, which will be abolished. There was also Mr. Bryden, from 
Ontario. One of the most eminent members to whom I want to pay 
tribute today is Michel Bureau, of the Fonds de la recherche en 
santé du Québec, the FRSQ, the main granting council in the 
province of Quebec. He played a key role in drafting this bill. 
I believe I am correct in assuming that the FRSQ will appear 
before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also talk about Ms. Nadeau, associate professor in the 
department of psychology. Psychology is certainly one field 
where more knowledge is needed and it is certainly something 
politicians should know how to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also mention a distinguished professor from the faculty 
of law whom I had the pleasure of meeting myself in my Montreal 
office. She is an ethics specialist. Members know how important 
ethics are in politics. It is even more so when one has to 
develop research protocols to ensure that, if humans are asked 
to take part in research, it will be done with all due respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank Bartha Maria Knoppers—I know she will recognize her 
name even though I am not pronouncing it correctly—for making 
herself available and for talking to me about what we should 
expect from the Canadian institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also Dr. Robert Perrault, medical consultant and heart 
disease specialist. He is the director of public health in 
Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an impressive group of people. They worked very hard. I 
thank them for what they did, as did the Minister of Health. I 
want members to know that they organized their work. The 
minister announced the establishment of the Canadian institutes 
of health research last February. They formed a number of 
committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They formed these committees to be more effective, and I would 
like to list them.  They organized their work using as their 
starting point a legislation committee. One of their mandates 
was to advise the minister on enabling legislation.  I will 
return to that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also had a subcommittee on planning the institute, a third 
one on programs and a fourth very important one on peer review. 
Hon. members must realize that all committees that are to award 
fellowships must be governed by the principle of excellence. 
Fellows must be selected on academic merit, the intrinsic merit 
of the research is what determines a recipient, not political 
affiliation.  That has nothing to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peer committees are therefore important.  Peers must be the ones 
to make decisions. 
They must examine the documents.  Care must be taken to ensure 
that, in each sector in which a research institute is created, 
the most knowledgeable people at the leading edge of research in 
that sector are the ones to assess applications.  That is what 
peer review is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a fifth committee as well, focused on knowledge.  Then 
there is partnership and marketing.  I will take it upon myself 
to point out to hon. members, although I cannot imagine them not 
knowing this, that there are two major categories of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is basic research, which deals with theory and has no 
connection with marketing.  This is research for the sake of 
research, like art for art's sake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is applied research, which of course has a very 
specific goal.  It is very often sponsored by the private 
sector.  It is aimed at a very precise application.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last committee, and I already touched on this, is the ethics 
and policy committee. It is concerned with people who will be 
taking part in the research as guinea pigs, let us not mince 
words. Its area of expertise concerns the need to respect their 
status, on the need for a policy of informed consent always and 
on the need to ensure that people taking part in research 
projects know the effects of the products tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Chair please tell me how much time I have left? I 
think I have used up half of my time, but I want to make sure 
that I do not forget some critical elements. 
Anyway, if I have something to add, at the end of my 40 minutes, 
to fully cover the subject, I will ask for unanimous consent to 
have more time. But it would make things easier for me if you 
could tell me how much time I have left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes will be headed by a governing council and there 
will be a president and advisory committees. I believe that it 
is important to see a few things. I do not know if the cameras 
can close-up on this acetate, but that would be very instructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are indicating that I have only six minutes left. I still 
have many things to say. However, I am confident that there will 
be unanimous consent to allow me to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of the research institutes will operate as follows: there 
will always be a secretariat, and divisions on basic activities, 
on clinical activities, on health systems and on culture and 
health, which are to some extent the determinants.  The same 
model will apply for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to speak—I did not realize it would go by so 
quickly—of a number of things, and, in particular, of one thing 
that must be considered. The government cut $21 billion in 
transfers to the provinces.  That is a cut of nearly $7 billion 
to health care and social services. This was money the provinces 
were counting on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we are pleased about the Canadian institutes of 
health research, even though for all the reasons I have given we 
will support the project, would it not have been simpler for the 
government to allow the provinces to assume this responsibility? 
Before establishing the Canadian institutes of health research, 
should the government not first have returned transfer payments 
to their 1993 level? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want all parliamentarians in this House to realize that the 
Government of Quebec was deprived of $1 billion in transfers. 
That is $1 billion annually to manage a department of health, as 
Pauline Marois is doing with vigour.  I will show correlations 
and demonstrate in specific terms what the cuts mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take all the cuts made since 1993 in Quebec's budget, we 
are talking about 20% of the cuts in all the hospitals of 
Quebec, about the closing of half of Greater Montreal's 
hospitals, about hospitalization costs for 370,000 persons, 
about the salaries of half the nurses, about all the operating 
budgets of all Quebec's CLSCs and, lastly, about the cost of all 
the youth services offered by the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot ask us to discuss such a bill if we are 
not able to remind the government that it acted like a 
highwayman, like a common thief. It had no respect for the 
provinces; it deprived them of resources. This is a government, 
in health care, that did what the worst offenders hesitate to 
do, it misappropriated funds. I repeat, and there is a consensus 
among opposition parties, this is a government that has 
literally stolen from the provinces. It should know that anyone 
who does that is called a thief.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to mention this, but I felt it was my duty to do so. 
This will not, however, prevent us from supporting the bill in 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be introducing amendments because, when I read the bill, 
I nearly had heart failure, and I am in good shape.  In law, the 
preamble to a bill has an interpretative function.  It is not 
insignificant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Parliament recognizes the role of the provinces in 
health care and that the Government of Canada collaborates— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not take some nerve to mention “the role of the 
provinces” in a bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say that the first thing we will do in committee is 
introduce an amendment emphasizing the central role of the 
provinces under the Constitution.  Is there anything more well 
established, since the days of the Tremblay commission ordered 
by Maurice Le Noblet Duplessis, is there anything clearer in the 
minds of Quebecers than the prerogatives of the National 
Assembly and the nine other legislatures when it comes to the 
health sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very least we are entitled to expect of a bill such as 
this is that it would state clearly that the provinces have a 
preponderant role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that my time is running out.  Mr. Speaker, I seek 
unanimous consent to speak for approximately five more minutes. 
If my colleagues agree to grant me an additional five minutes, I 
will be most grateful, because there are things I feel bound to 
share with the House and I think that, as a general rule, when I 
rise to speak, it is value added. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to support the bill.  We are going to work hard in 
committee.  We have submitted a list of witnesses, but I would 
need another five to ten minutes to fully address the issue. 
So, if you would be so kind as to ensure, in a spirit of open 
co-operation, that I am not deprived of my time, I would be very 
grateful, Mr. Speaker.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in 
the debate at second reading stage of Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, I will indicate that my colleagues and I in the 
New Democratic Party support the spirit and the intent of the 
bill.  We appreciate the fact that this legislation represents a 
strategic repositioning of health research in Canada.  In our 
view, it does seek to broaden the idea of health research and it 
appears to advocate and promote a new way of dealing with health 
research in the country today.  It promotes a multidisciplinary, 
multisectoral and cross-regional approach to health care.  It 
provides us with a way to look at the social, cultural and 
environmental determinants of ill health.  These are all very 
important objectives and we support the intent of the bill in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do, however, have some concerns with respect to the specific 
wording of a number of clauses in the bill.  We look forward to a 
thorough analysis and debate at the committee stage of the bill. 
We also look forward to hearing the views of folks across the 
country concerning the bill.  In that process, we hope that we 
can actually improve the bill and come back with a piece of 
legislation that has solid support right across the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, when one looks at a bill like this and addresses the 
whole matter of health research in Canada today, one has to ask 
the question whether or not it meets certain fundamental 
objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our task today is to take this legislation and square it with 
the government's agenda as a whole because the bill on its own, 
in isolation of a broader approach that looks at the absolute 
necessity of looking at health care in its most broadest sense, 
is doomed to fail unless we have a complete agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I proceed to raise criticisms or make some constructive 
suggestions around this whole approach, I will also join with 
members in the House in acknowledging the work of those who 
helped create this evolution in the country around health 
research, and those who worked so hard in helping to draft the 
bill we have before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly want to add my thanks and congratulations to Dr. 
Henry Friesen, who has provided leadership to the country as head 
of the Medical Research Council for a long period of time, and 
who has worked very hard to move that model toward the one we 
have today, and who in fact talked himself out of a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to acknowledge the work of the interim governing 
council that spent hours and hours on deliberations that led to 
the bill before us today.  I understand that the work is just 
beginning.  If one looks at the purpose of the bill, which is to 
create virtual institutes of health research, the interim 
governing council has already received somewhere in the 
neighbourhood of 150 proposals for such institutes.  It will be 
the task of the new permanent governing council to weed that 
number down to, as I understand it, 10 to 15 institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are enormous challenges ahead for those experts who have 
been involved in the process, and very significant challenges for 
those who will have to take this legislation and implement it in 
a meaningful way that addresses the concerns of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the best research in the world will come to naught unless we 
have the political will, the federal government leadership to 
actually implement the findings of research and to act on 
research that is pursued in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are in an interesting position.  We are on the eve of 
the 10th anniversary of the Ed Broadbent resolution in the House 
of Commons, supported by all members from all sides of the House, 
calling for the elimination of child poverty by the year 2000. We 
know, by all accounts, that rather than looking forward to an 
improved situation as we enter the new millennium, the situation 
has become much worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my leader has said many times in the House, we have not only 
failed to stop poverty among children in the country, the 
government has also been responsible for seeing a huge number of 
children added to the rolls of poverty.  We know that since 1989, 
one in seven children lives in poverty.  Since 1989, 500,000 
children have been added to the rolls of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add something from a Winnipeg perspective. I come from a 
constituency that has a very hard-pressed community.  In the 
inner city of my constituency, in the heart of Winnipeg, in a 
neighbourhood called Point Douglas, new statistics released this 
past week show that 60% of children live in poverty.  Six out of 
ten kids in my community go to school with empty stomachs, are 
not able to learn and are likely to suffer health consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point here is that if we do not make the links between health 
research and action, we will not address the root causes of ill 
health and the spread of disease.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had study after study showing the direct 
links between poverty and ill health.  The minister himself 
released a study this past summer at the health ministers 
conference in Charlottetown showing that in many respects we have 
a much more serious situation than we have ever had when it comes 
to children, young people and aboriginal people.  The facts are 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from other centres, for example the centre of excellence 
in Winnipeg, the Centre for Health Policy Research and 
Evaluation, that there is a direct link between ill health and 
levels of income.  The more money people make, the more income 
they have, the better their health. Knowing that, why has this 
government stood still? Why has it not initiated serious policies 
to address this matter and reduce poverty especially among 
children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has told Canadians of the tremendous 
surplus of close to $100 billion over five years.  Considering 
the benefits of the current economic situation, why has the 
government not moved to use some of that money to address 
poverty, to put meaningful policies in place, to look at a 
national child care program and meaningful early childhood 
development programs? On that score there has been virtually 
nothing.  There has been no translation of a very significant 
research finding into action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example that comes to mind shows the absolute imperative 
of translating research findings into action.  As members know, 
today the Minister of Health is meeting with the tobacco 
industry's most celebrated whistleblower, Jeffrey Wigand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Minister of Health released thousands and 
thousands of pages of documents that had been under lock and key 
in Great Britain. The documents show that the tobacco industry 
over the last number of years has deliberately targeted young 
people and has ensured the products they create will get nicotine 
into the system faster to ensure young people are addicted more 
quickly and that there is a lucrative market for the sale of 
cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hot off the wire I understand the Minister of Health has 
announced that he is hiring Jeffrey Wigand as an adviser to him 
and his department on matters pertaining to tobacco.  Bravo. Good 
for him.  I hope that is true. I hope that means the government 
is finally serious about acting on programs that will curb 
tobacco addiction and smoking among young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has known for a long time about those statistics 
and it has done nothing.  In July 1997 I wrote to the Minister of 
Health and suggested to him that considering the gravity of the 
situation it would make sense to translate the results of the 
research findings into action by introducing higher taxes on 
cigarettes.  This is something the government repeatedly refuses 
to do.  I suggested to the minister that he had an obligation to 
launch a lawsuit against the tobacco industry as was done in the 
United States as a result of the work of Jeffrey Wigand and 
others in exposing the malicious intent of the tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested subsequently that he not simply point to B.C. as an 
example of something being done in this country in that regard, 
but that he should actually take up the charge, show leadership, 
work with provinces like B.C.  I am sure all provinces are 
interested in pursuing this.  I said that he should put together 
a national suit against the tobacco industry to recoup costs to 
our health care system caused by that kind of irresponsible 
profit seeking agenda of the tobacco industry. To date, there has 
been nothing. This is a perfect example of where research and 
good findings do not translate into action. 
What we need today to go along with the bill is a clear 
commitment to act on those findings, to show political will and 
provide leadership.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have have heard, and it is inevitable that we are going 
to get into this discussion, that this is tied inextricably to 
federal funding and national standards for health care.  Clearly 
if we are serious about pursuing a holistic approach to health 
research and translating those results into improvements for our 
system as a whole and for the betterment of the health of all 
Canadians, then it is inevitable that we focus on the state of 
federal financing for health care. It is inevitable that we 
demand once again that the government look at its abdication of 
responsibility and its failure to ensure the full restoration of 
cuts in transfer payments for health care that it initiated when 
it came into power in 1993. It advanced this very specifically in 
1995 with the implementation of the CHST.  This elimination from 
our health care system was the single biggest cut in funds in the 
history of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we address that point of view.  I am 
tempted to call the Reform members on their attempts to disguise 
their true agenda.  I think many of us in the House feel a sense 
of indignation when we know that the health critic for the Reform 
Party will stand up today and talk about the need for universal 
health care and ensuring that the most vulnerable citizens in our 
society have access to health care, all the while advancing a two 
tier American style health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing a clever disguise from the Reform Party.  I do not 
think there is any question about that.  All we have to do is 
look at some of the quotes from the member himself going back a 
couple of years.  The member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca said in 
1996, “In fact a two tiered health system will strengthen the 
public system, not erode it.  In a two tiered system those who 
choose to go to a private clinic will receive faster and better 
care than their counterparts in the system. Is this an unequal 
system that provides for different levels of care?  Yes”.  His 
leader, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, did the same when 
he said, “If they are willing to pay, they could get themselves 
a higher standard of care and quicker access”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the true agenda of the Reform Party members. That is 
really what they are talking about.  For them now to try to 
disguise it and to suggest that their support for Ralph Klein's 
privatization initiative will not do anything to contravene the 
principles of the health act and will not deny access to 
Canadians is absolutely fallacious and dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House must work together to convince the government 
that it has to increase transfer payments for health. It has to 
show leadership.  It has to ensure that we have an increased 
budget and a significant and stable funding base for health 
research, if we are truly going to improve the status of 
Canadians and be true to the principles of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very specific concerns in Bill C-13 which I would 
like to quickly enunciate in the time I have left. One of our 
biggest concerns, and I am sure we will hear more about this in 
committee, is whether or not this legislation advances our agenda 
for independent scientific investigation into the root causes of 
ill health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we have been faced with cutbacks in funding 
and an approach on the part of the federal government to 
deregulate and offload wherever it can.  Academics, researchers, 
universities and think tanks are put in a very difficult 
position of having to increase their reliance on corporate 
donations, meaning pharmaceutical manufacturers and private 
insurers.  All of this undermines the very independence that is 
so necessary for the integrity of the system.  It creates very 
serious possibilities for conflict of interest.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a litmus test to be applied to the bill. Does it ensure 
that we advance down the path of truly independent research? Does 
it involve a significant level of funding to ensure that we do 
not broaden the whole agenda to a series of private-public 
partnerships which will undermine the very objectives we have in 
mind as we pursue this bill?  In that regard, we have three very 
specific concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clause in the bill refers specifically to “facilitating the 
commercialization of health research”.  In our view that is 
vague and potentially dangerous phrasing.  It would be our hope 
to hear from witnesses in committee to determine whether or not 
it would be worthwhile to reword that clause to ensure that the 
public interest is clearly paramount and that any kind of 
commercialization agenda is secondary to the public good.  That 
is one concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second concern has to do with the governing council as 
outlined in the bill.  Our concern is that it is very loosely 
worded and not clearly prescribed in the legislation.  Again this 
allows the possibility for control by the industry, particularly 
pharmaceutical manufacturers for setting the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not be unique or new to suggest that specifics on the 
governing council should be entrenched right in the piece of 
legislation.  That can be done expeditiously at committee.  We 
should be ensuring that the appointment criteria for members of 
the governing council are specifically defined and that the 
public voice be absolutely dominant in that configuration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we have a concern about the whole issue the minister 
raised today pertaining to ethics.  He suggested that the vague 
wording in the bill which says “will take into consideration 
ethical issues” is sufficient.  It is certainly our view that it 
is too vague. It leaves too many possibilities again for 
corporations, pharmaceutical companies and other research 
institutions to pursue research that might be less than ethical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we will hear suggestions in committee about the 
need for an independent arm's length body that is directly 
accountable to government. Given the changes happening in our 
society today around reproductive technologies, xeno 
transplantation, human cloning, we will hear that we absolutely 
need an ethical framework for determining research of the future. 
We need an independent body to help us sort through what is the 
appropriate way one uses human research subjects, how one 
notifies individuals involved in this process and what protective 
measures can be put in place to deal with those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To wrap up, I would suggest that this bill is worth looking at 
in detail at committee.  I hope the concerns I have mentioned 
will be addressed.  All of us are interested in strengthening 
this bill so that there is a central focus on the causes and 
prevention of ill health, in particular the social, economic, 
cultural and environmental determinants that have a very direct 
impact on health and well-being in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know the hon. member was in the House listening 
intently this morning to the minister and the other members who 
spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health critic for the Reform Party concentrated a great deal 
on comments he and his party made last week in regard to a two 
tier health system.  If I am not mistaken, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre is very much opposed to that, as am I.  I 
find it really strange that a member of parliament from an 
opposition party would stand in the House defending himself more 
than actually speaking on the bill that we are debating.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, I would like the member's comments on the Reform 
Party's position with regard to a two tiered health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the member who 
posed the question, I too feel offended by the way in which the 
Reform Party critic has portrayed his position to the public 
across Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, as I said before, that this is a clever disguise or a 
clever ruse for fooling the public, because the record speaks for 
itself.  The Reform Party has time and time again been on the 
record saying that what this country needs is a parallel, 
private, for profit system, that what this country needs is a two 
tier approach to health care, that what this country needs is an 
avenue by which those who have the money can pay for the services 
that they need.  It says this without addressing what happens to 
the universality of our system and without addressing the long 
term effects on comprehensiveness and accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is appropriate that on the very day that we are 
discussing this issue and hearing that kind of doublespeak from 
the Reform Party that we look back to the architects of the 
Canada Health Act, Monique Bégin, Tom Kent and the daughter of 
Tommy Douglas, Shirley Douglas, all of whom are speaking out on 
this issue.  In fact, as we speak a press conference is being 
held with some of those architects who are very, very concerned 
about Ralph Klein's proposal, very concerned about Reform's 
position and in fact have said that medicare, based on equal 
access to comprehensive care, will barely survive the beginning 
of the new millennium without dramatic corrective action on the 
part of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the federal government must intervene immediately and 
stop the Klein government from contracting with for profit 
hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the money cut from the federal transfer payments must be 
restored for investment in the public health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the federal government must exclude health and social 
services from all trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The architects of the Canada Health Act believe that the kind of 
proposal we are hearing from the Reform Party would be absolutely 
contrary to the principles of the act, would be a fundamental 
shift away from medicare as we know it today and would end up 
costing Canadians much more down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see that the Conservative critic for health care is 
with us on this one and we look forward to pursuing a 
consolidated, united position, holding the federal government to 
account and demanding that federal transfers increase and that we 
preserve the principles of medicare. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a great deal of respect for my colleague from the New 
Democratic Party.  We have co-operated on a number of issues over 
these past couple of years as we have sat together on the health 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course on this whole debate on health care many proposals 
will be made.  Many proposals are already being made.  However, 
the fact of the matter is, and I think my hon. colleague will 
agree with me, that we have seen an abysmal lack of leadership on 
behalf of the federal government, which is supposed to be the 
custodian of health care in this country, to take any kind of 
initiative and to actually renew health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If proposals which have come from the Reform Party, or any other 
party, the member's own party for that matter, are not debated in 
a sensible way, where emotion will not run riot, we will not get 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of those kinds of comments, I ask my hon. colleague if 
she is prepared to lay at the feet of the government the 
responsibility for the demise of the health care system.  Is she 
prepared, along with Canadians right across this country, to 
offer concrete solutions that are not embedded in 1960s 
philosophy, but really take into account what is happening in 
Canada today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all I am 
quite prepared, as the Reform member suggested, to hold the 
federal government to account for the crisis we are facing in 
health care today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows that we have constantly spoken out about the cuts made 
to transfer payments by the government and how that has put 
enormous pressure on the federal system and opened the door to 
private sector health care.  He knows that we have called the 
government to task for signing an agreement with Alberta in 1996 
which allowed for the growth of private clinics in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I agree that we are seeing an appalling and abysmal lack of 
leadership from the federal government.  However, I would also 
say that we are seeing an appalling lack of leadership from the 
leader of the member's own party.  In fact, just two days ago the 
leader of the Reform Party in response to a question said “I 
think there is room from the federal angle to open up the Canada 
Health Act so that if the provinces want to pursue other options, 
including greater involvement of private resources, they have the 
freedom to do so”.  What the Reform Party, Ralph Klein and Mike 
Harris are talking about is retreating, going back to the old way 
of doing things before we had medicare when if we had the money 
we could get the care we needed and, if not, tough luck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is saying that we are in a crisis today and we agree 
with that.  The question for all of us is, how do we solve the 
problem?  I would suggest that the only way to solve the problem 
is to work to innovate and strengthen our public system and 
ensure that the medicare model is preserved, not destroyed as the 
Reform Party would have us do.  He asked for alternatives and 
solutions.  I suggest to him that there are many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Forum on Health has made some very important 
observations about how to reform the system within the public 
model.  It has talked about the need to look at a continuum of 
care and to move toward a community based model of holistic 
health care.  It has talked about including home care, continuing 
care and drug care under our plan.  That would address some of 
the costs and the pressures coming from the private sector.  The 
New Democratic Party has put together a long set of 
recommendations and a very thoughtful analysis of this situation. 
I would be happy to share them with the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask him to join with us in holding the government to 
account and preserving our publicly administered, universally 
accessible system, and not take one more step down the path of 
destroying and dismantling medicare. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in this debate today.  I 
remind the House that this is the first major health bill to come 
before this parliament.  I think many of us were anticipating 
this and looking forward to the debate.  I want to remind the 
viewing public that we are debating an act to establish the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research, what I will refer to as 
the CIHR, and to repeal the Medical Research Council Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this is the first major debate on a health bill 
before the House is significant.  We have had many debates on 
health care in the last couple of years, but no bills of any 
significance have come before the House.  I want to remind the 
House of some of the issues we have spoken about in regard to 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them, of course, was the hepatitis C issue, which the 
government completely mishandled.  We went on for days and days 
seeking a fair, just and compassionate solution for all hepatitis 
C victims, and a generous solution on the part of government in 
terms of assistance to those victims.  We fought and raged for 
days, but the government held its position.  Today not one 
hepatitis C victim has received any support from the federal 
government.  In fact, a huge number of them were left out of the 
package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also debated at length in the House the draconian cuts to 
health care, which goes back to the previous speech given by the 
NDP member. 
We are talking about a government which took $17 billion out of 
health care.  I see you shaking your head, Mr. Speaker, but it is 
true.  This year during the budget debate the government 
proclaimed that its budget was a health care budget, that it 
would return $11.5 billion of the $17 billion it took out.  That 
will bring us back to the levels which existed 10 years ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not have a lot to brag about.  However, this 
bill is worthy of debate and it is worthy of support.  I want to 
state very clearly from the beginning that I support it and the 
Progressive Conservative Party supports it.  I think it is a very 
worthy initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it is the House of Commons I guess we have to be a 
little political, but I want to mention some of the issues on 
which the government has swallowed itself whole from time to 
time.  I will talk about the hypocrisy of government.  One item I 
will talk about is the Drug Patent Act, which was brought into 
the House about 10 years ago when I was a member of parliament on 
the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, do you remember that?  You stood in the House and 
raged for hour after hour, condemning the government for bringing 
in the Drug Patent Act.  I want to remind the public of that for 
one very good reason.  The Drug Patent Act had a purpose behind 
it.  It relates to the very bill we are talking about today.  The 
bill that we are speaking about, of course, will bring research 
scientists together so that we will have a network of the 
scientific community sort of singing from the same song book, 
exchanging and sharing information, with some funding from the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister today mentioned the term brain drain.  He said, and 
I agree with him, that this act will do something about the brain 
drain.  That is what we had in mind when we brought in the Drug 
Patent Act in the early 1990s because what Canada was missing was 
a great deal of expertise in terms of scientific and medical 
research.  Those people were leaving the country in big numbers 
and drug companies had no patent protection in this country in 
comparison to other industrialized countries in the world.  We 
brought in legislation which provided them with that protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument of the day was, why would companies invest millions 
and possibly billions of dollars in research if someone else 
could steal their patent within a handful of years?  It was a 
very deliberate attempt by our government of the day to bring in 
protection for the research community in this country and it has 
worked.  This bill should go some distance in reinforcing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be remembered that the government promised to rescind or 
take away the Drug Patent Act, to change it dramatically. 
Obviously it has not done that because it would not be in its 
best interests.  However, in opposition I suppose it was 
politically a pretty popular thing to say at the time and, of 
course, I have reminded you of some of the speeches you made, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking office is something like a lynching in the morning.  It 
sort of focuses the mind.  That is exactly what happened when the 
Liberals took office in 1993.  The government then decided that 
maybe this was not such a bad idea after all, and we still have 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has tagged on to some of the initiatives we took 
in the past.  Being totally honest, some of them were not very 
popular and some of them are still debatable.  However, some of 
them were worth embracing and certainly the present government 
has done that, and I commend it for doing so. 
The government has gone one step beyond adopting what previous 
governments have done in actually grabbing and taking ideas right 
out of an election platform.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about Jean Charest's plan for Canada's 
next century.  That is the platform on which I ran in the 1997 
election.  I will step through some of what we were talking 
about.  I want you to listen carefully, Mr. Speaker, to see 
whether or not you agree with what I am saying.  There is a 
direct link between the present bill and what we had in our 
platform in 1997.  I am accusing the government of lifting the 
idea right out of our platform in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Charest spoke about health care for the future on page 27 of 
his plan.  He talked about our health care system needing 
flexibility.  He said we should continue to adopt new medical 
treatments.  He said specifically that new pilot and experimental 
programs would provide Canadians with state of the art, cutting 
edge services and treatments and new technologies to improve the 
access to care in rural and remote areas of the country.  The 
minister spoke specifically of rural areas today.  He said there 
would be programs to test new integrated delivery systems aimed 
at providing health care based on the highest quality and best 
practices.  Again, the minister mentioned that this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Charest also spoke of the development and maintenance of a 
Health Canada worldwide website on the Internet to provide a 
state of the art health care information system, including advice 
on the prevention and treatment of illnesses to help hospitals 
and researchers link their knowledge bases.  He spoke very 
specifically about linking the knowledge bases in the country. In 
fact that is what the new agency will be doing.  He spoke about 
working closely with the provinces and territories to reduce 
unnecessary health care expenditures that result from duplication 
and reinvest the savings back into the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is almost word for word what we were saying in the 1997 
election campaign.  The Progressive Conservative Party said that 
it would create a national institute for health with memberships 
drawn from the health care field.  The board would be co-chaired 
by the federal minister and provincial territorial ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, we said we would co-ordinate the gathering and 
distribution of information on research and new medical 
technologies with an emphasis on disease control, ensuring that 
Canadians benefit from the best and the latest medical advances; 
assist in the development and publication of national health care 
targets and goals; and measure, evaluate and publish progress 
toward achieving these targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the message is pretty clear.  The government obviously 
thought it was a good idea and it is adopting it.  We are pleased 
to support it because the idea really came from our platform in 
1997.  I guess that is one of the advantages of being in power. 
They can just take whatever part of whatever works and call it 
their own.  Maybe there is nothing new in that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has had a history of advances in medical science.  I want 
to go through some of the names.  The minister mentioned this 
morning Best and Banting.  I would like to mention a couple more. 
One is Sir William Osler, who wrote the medical textbook 
<I>Principles and Practices of Medicine</I>.  He introduced the 
idea of clinical care.  Another is Dr. Wilder Penfield who 
established the Montreal Neurological Institute and made many 
discoveries in the area of brain functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have that same excellence taking place in the country. 
One thing I ran across in <I>The Economist</I>, of all places, was 
a procedure.  Maybe that is not the best word to describe it, but 
it was out of the Ontario Cancer Institute. 
It devised a way of using high frequency ultrasound to check 
within a few hours after the first dose of chemotherapy being 
administered to find out whether or not the anti-cancer treatment 
is working.  The article went on to explain that most cancer 
treatment, despite the billions of dollars that are poured into 
it, is by guess and by hazard in terms of whether or not the 
treatment is actually working. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Gregory Ozamota and his colleagues devised a new method of 
detecting whether or not a cancer treatment is working within 
hours of administering it so that patients in the future 
hopefully will not have to go through some of the tough 
medicines, the harsh chemicals in terms of treating cancer, only 
to find out that the treatment is not working.  That is an 
advancement that is taking place today in Canada.  This new 
institute will foster that type of advancement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, as I have mentioned, are not strangers to huge 
advances in medical science.  Despite our small population base 
of 30 million people, we have had some very notable achievements 
within the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the new institute will do is sort of bridge 
the gap between what a scientist wants to do, or is driven to do, 
and the need within Canadian society for that service.  There 
will be a linkage between the two so that we will not have a 
scientist going out on his own pet project, to simplify it, 
without any payoff to the greater society at the end of the day. 
Funds will be channelled in such a way that there will be a real 
identified need within society for the research to be ongoing. 
That is an important distinction to make, an important point to 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theoretical side of science and the absent minded professor 
are always talked about.  I read an article not long ago about 
Einstein.  It mentioned that sometimes scientists are so focused 
that they are focusing on their research without focusing on the 
greater need of society or where the research will actually take 
them.  The new institute will give some of our scientists a 
little more direction to reach the goal at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story goes about Einstein that he was so indifferent to his 
surroundings that on more than one occasion he arrived in his 
laboratory in his pyjamas.  I am not sure if that is happening 
today in Canada, but focusing our funding in the directions as 
outlined in the bill is a very important part of the new 
institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we would like to see happen to which the minister 
has alluded in the past is the drug approval process.  I think it 
can happen.  The other day it was brought to my attention that 
there is a new drug out called Rituxan.  It is a cancer treating 
drug that has been tied up by red tape in the drug approval 
process.  I want to point out what has happened in other 
countries.  This drug has had great success in the treatment of 
some cancers. 
In just about every industrialized country in the world this drug 
has already been approved and is on the shelf.  I will give an 
example of some of those countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Australia, Rituxan was submitted for approval in May 1997. It 
was approved in October 1998 and the launch date of the drug in 
that country was October 1998.  Germany applied on March 21, 
1997.  The drug was approved on June 2, 1998, and went on the 
market on November 26, 1998.  The United States moved a little 
faster.  The drug was submitted for approval in February 1997 and 
approved on November 6, 1997.  The launch date was December 15, 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no way of knowing whether or not the information I have 
is correct.  It was provided to me by the department.  Rituxan 
will not be approved for use in this country until late in 
December, if in fact it does happen.  That is two years after the 
United States.  Many of our patients are going to the United 
States to get this drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping, and the minister has alluded to it, that the 
process in Canada can be improved upon.  It is not that we want 
to do it in a hasty fashion because no one wants to see that 
happen.  However, I get the feeling we get tied up in red tape 
and are not sharing information with other Canadian jurisdictions 
which might possibly lead to a speed up in the approval process. 
This is something I think we can look forward to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things we cannot mention, obviously.  A Reform 
member went to great lengths today to distance himself from some 
remarks he made with regard to a two tier health care system in 
Canada.  I might possibly face some questions on that point, but 
I was a bit dumbfounded by some of the comments made by the 
member last week, and this week in attempting to distance himself 
from those remarks.  I mention this only in the context that we 
are debating a very important initiative by the government.  I do 
not think we should be sidetracked by other issues despite 
the difficulties some members from time to time get themselves 
into when they pronounce policies and positions that are not 
sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I will sit down and entertain questions and comments 
from other members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to our colleague's speech from inside and I gather 
that, before all parties can agree on a bill that would finally 
grant additional funding to health research, many concerns need 
to be raised, particularly with respect to the will to ensure 
that no research institute designation will be made with no 
regard to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask our colleague, through you Mr. Speaker, 
whether his party would support an amendment that would 
explicitly give, within the bill, a more active role to the 
provinces when it comes to the establishment of Canadian 
institutes of health research. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think most of us will 
bring forward amendments on the basis of what we see in the bill. 
I think the point the member is making is a commendable one.  It 
is one that we certainly have concerns about. 
I am glad that he did get on his feet because the structure of 
the Canadian institutes of health research lends some questions 
to the integrity of the system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tells us and the bill spells out that the CIHR will 
be led by a president and a governing council, who together will 
be responsible for the overall direction of the institutes. 
Members of the governing council will reflect the highest 
standards of scientific excellence and so on.  It goes on to 
explain what they will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns we have is that every one of these 
appointments will be by governor in council.  In other words, 
cabinet will decide who these people are.  I think that process 
has to be re-examined as to how these appointments are made.  Are 
they there at the pleasure of the government?  The act tells us 
that indeed they are at the pleasure of the government, up for 
review every five years.  That is a major issue we should examine 
in committee and have more explanation on.  As to the institutes 
themselves, nobody knows.  It is not spelled out in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about Dr. Chopra from Health Canada who sued Health 
Canada under the Human Rights Act. He was one of the scientists 
who testified on the shredding of documents that had to do with 
the BST beef hormone issue.  The word is the independence of this 
body and the independence of the governing council and the 
president.  That is a very important issue that the bill has to 
address and that we need more clarification on by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the treatment that some people have received from the 
government and the Department of Health is any indication of what 
might come, this whole process will have to be examined a little 
more closely and a little more transparently. We have gone 
through the difficulty of where one person basically is making 
the decisions.  It is the Prime Minister of Canada who decides 
who the president will be and who the members will be. There is a 
real danger in doing that. I hope we can move beyond that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member again for allowing me to get back up based on 
his question.  The other consideration is the review process, who 
is accountable and the measuring stick.  Are we going to wait 
five years to determine whether or not the new body is 
functioning efficiently without any reporting to parliament other 
than tabling the document? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of coming into parliament and reporting to 
the committee on the structure and whether or not it is working. 
It is simply blindly giving the government a blank cheque to set 
up a process which I think should be reviewed very thoroughly 
every year for the next five years to determine whether they have 
done it right or not.  Those are some very important points that 
have to be made and that will come out in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party, along with the Bloc and his members, will be bringing 
forth some amendments that we think will strengthen the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, we support the initiative.  We think it 
is very credible.  With some of these little deficiencies, if the 
government is willing to look and listen, I think we can 
strengthen the bill dramatically.  We will then have a bill that 
will indeed work for all Canadians.

very pleased to speak on Bill C-13, the Canadian Institutes of 
Health Research Act. I am particularly pleased because, along 
with many other hon. members, I have been working on this issue 
for more than a year. 
We were very happy to hear about the establishment of these 
institutes in the 1999 federal budget and we are also very 
pleased to have this bill before the House today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the establishment of the Canadian institutes of health 
research is a truly visionary and forward-looking initiative that 
will directly address one of the major concerns of Canadians: to 
increase our knowledge of health issues in order to try to get 
rid of illnesses and health problems affecting so many 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 is a huge step in the right direction, since it will 
ensure Canada's competitiveness in the knowledge-based global 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this bill, along with the 21st century chairs for 
research excellence in universities across Canada that were 
announced in the Speech from the Throne, will give Canada a 
competitive edge as we move towards the next century. Canadians 
will be world leaders in the generation of new knowledge. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to speak about the bill because of its 
importance to the city of Montreal and to the people in my riding 
of Pierrefonds—Dollard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Montreal is a world-class health research centre.  Health 
research and development is playing a major role in revitalizing 
our economy, creating jobs for our citizens and securing a future 
for Montreal in Canada in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Montreal is home to some of Canada's leading centres of academic 
research.  McGill University and the University of Montreal are 
at the leading edge of Canadian health research.  Research at 
those universities is at the highest standards of excellence. 
McGill and the University of Montreal are the second and third 
largest recipients respectively of the Medical Research Council's 
MRC funding in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers in those universities are extremely competitive in 
funding competition.  Their research is at the highest standard. 
Concordia and the University of Quebec in Montreal should also 
not be forgotten.  Their research in the social aspect of health 
is opening up new fields of knowledge about our health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the excellence of science in Montreal and the quality of 
our research, Montreal is the most successful of any city in 
Canada in MRC funding competitions.  The MRC invested $59.6 
million in 1998-1999 in Montreal alone. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the Medical Research Council, or MRC, is allocating 
$76.5 million for health research. That amount is proportionally 
a greater part of the MRC's budget than Quebec's population is 
in relation to Canada's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that the federal government and the 
provinces are co-operating in the area of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the MRC is actively funding research, while the 
provincial organization responsible for health studies, namely 
Quebec's Fonds de la recherche en santé, is developing programs 
that complement those of the MRC. These two bodies have 
established close relations which have obviously benefited 
health research in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that the chair of the Fonds, Dr. Michel 
Bureau, has been actively involved in the development of the 
concept of health research institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the MRC will be integrated into the research institutes, 
and since these will further promote health research in Canada, 
Bill C-13 is of paramount importance for Montreal and for all of 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers in Montreal are working on new discoveries and 
treatments that will benefit people across the country.  The 
Montreal Neurological Institute, the Institut de recherche 
clinique de Montreal and the Royal Victoria Hospital are all 
world-class centres of research addressing the key health 
concerns of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private sector companies such as Merck Frosst and Astra have 
secured worldwide research mandates at their research centres in 
Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one example of research in Montreal.  Many people 
might not know that one of the leading experts in the area of 
genomic research is actually working in Montreal.  It is widely 
accepted that genomics, the decoding of human genetic structure, 
potentially unlocking the keys to the treatment of disease, is 
the leading edge of health science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Tom Hudson is a major participant in the work of sequencing 
the human genome. 
He is an associate physician at the Montreal General Hospital and 
a director of Montreal's Genome Centre.  He is also the associate 
director of the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, one of the leading genomics research 
centres in the world.  He is also under 40 years old. In fact, 
last year he was named one of Canada's top 40 people under 40.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of leaving for multiple opportunities in the United

working tirelessly to advance science in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 will support people like Dr. Hudson and continue to 
provide opportunities for him in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This investment in research has an extraordinary impact on 
Montreal and on all other Canadian cities. All researchers hire 
laboratory technicians, graduate students and other staff, thus 
creating more jobs in this innovative sector of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research spinoffs may be the most critical factor for Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is generally agreed that health industries will be one of the 
key sectors of a knowledge-based economy. The pace of innovation 
is very fast, and new research methods, such as genomics, are 
opening the doors to new areas of knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, basic research is the foundation of health 
industries, because it helps produce innovative goods and 
services. This research activity is the engine of our economy 
while also ensuring our competitiveness. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only needs to look at the example of BioChem Pharma in 
Montreal.  BioChem Pharma has its roots in a research grant years 
ago at McGill University.  This research led to the discovery of 
3TC which is one of the drugs which has turned HIV into a more 
manageable disease.  In fact, 3TC is now the leading HIV-AIDS 
treatment in the world.  BioChem Pharma now employs over 1,000 
people in Montreal providing an innovative force to our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of small Canadian start-up companies that are 
seeking to move the knowledge gained from research into products 
and services that meet unmet health needs. I think of Neurochem, 
which is looking at treatments for Alzheimer disease.  There is 
Methylgene, which is developing leading edge anti-cancer 
compounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting aspect is that these are companies located not 
in Boston, not in San Diego and not in Seattle.  They are based 
in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Globe and Mail</I> recently had an article about how young 
people are now coming to Montreal to participate in the 
innovative economy.  It mentioned the aerospace, the animation 
and the biotechnology sectors.  Montreal is well placed to be at 
the leading edge of the knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 is an important piece of legislation to achieve this 
goal. The Canadian institutes of health research represent a 
major investment in the knowledge and innovation needed to drive 
our innovative economy forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that it will fund research, first 
and foremost, that will seek to improve the health of Canadians. 
The objectives in the legislation make that clear.  It will fund 
research that will promote the highest standards of ethics in 
research. It will work in partnership with all sectors of the 
research community to advance Canadian science.  It will also 
work to promote economic development and the translation of 
research into benefits for Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a system of virtual research institutes is an 
important innovation for Canada's scientific community.  It will 
bring together researchers and networks, ensuring that the 
results of research can be used and further developed more 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of institutes in sectors essential to Canadians 
will focus research, bringing together studies from different 
disciplines and making it possible to attack today's complex 
health problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly, cancer research is predicated on genetic studies 
and cellular studies, but it also requires analysis of the 
environment's impact on cancer, as well as studies on the most 
effective treatment of cancer patients in the health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 will make it possible to channel research 
strategically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month, with other MPs, I attended a breakfast meeting at 
which Dr. Patrick Lee of the University of Calgary spoke about 
some very encouraging observations he had made in his cancer 
research.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He has discovered mechanisms in reoviruses that can destroy 
cancerous cells.  The new cancer treatment he has come up with 
has made headlines worldwide.  Breakfast with Dr. Lee was a 
fascinating affair; I was delighted to hear about the work he is 
now doing in Canada.  He turned out to be an excellent 
ambassador for Calgary, Alberta and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 will support people like Dr. Lee, who are truly on the 
cutting edge of health issues that concern Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, it is important to mention that the Canadian 
institutes of health research is first a question of health and 
its funding will be through peer review.  This is the only 
determinant for excellent science. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no hesitation in supporting this bill, which will 
represent a major investment in the health of Canadians and in a 
more effective and innovative health care sector.  I urge 
members of the House to support it as well, so that Canadian 
institutes of health research can begin their important work for 
the well-being of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am certainly pleased today to join the debate on Bill C-13, the 
Canadian institutes of health research bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time of an overall failing health care system in Canada, 
I am pleased to see some encouraging news contained in this bill. 
I also wish to offer a critique of Bill C-13 and to offer some 
points on what I believe are the bill's shortcomings. I raise the 
points of concern only in an effort to improve the bill.  Overall 
I believe that the bill is worthy of further support and my 
colleagues in the Reform Party would want to give that support at 
least up to committee level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand the bill, it is intended to take the place of 
the Medical Research Council and provide a more direct and 
systematic approach to research in Canada.  Furthermore, the 
primary objective of the Canadian institutes of health research 
is to excel and build upon internationally accepted standards of 
scientific excellence and research through the creation of new 
knowledge and its translation into improved health for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the primary methods that will be used is that of virtual 
institutes through the Internet and other high tech 
communications.  The institutes will be made up of experts in 
their selected fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promise of addressing a portion of the Canadian brain drain 
is a worthwhile discussion.  I would agree that one of the 
reasons we are losing our best and brightest from Canada to the 
United States is the research dollars that are available.  To 
lose our best means that while they may have been educated in 
Canada, we are losing them to a foreign country.  The 
consequences of this failing is like a row of dominoes.  As the 
first person leaves, the process becomes easier for the next 
person, and so on and so on.  Before we know it there is a flood 
of people leaving Canada which is virtually impossible to stem, 
unless there is a major change in the reasons that people are 
leaving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are people leaving?  May I suggest that it is the lack of 
incentive to contribute to our own medical and health research, a 
lack of financial support for the employees and institutes that 
they work at, and higher taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take corrective action.  With some constructive 
fixing I believe that the bill could be one small piece of the 
solution to the brain drain, particularly in the medical 
professions in Canada today. I believe there are a number of 
concerns and ways that the bill can and should be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that by the end of the second year the CIHR will have a 
proposed budget of $500 million.  This is up from the current 
budget of $300 million.  The addition of $200 million is a 
substantial amount of money.  However, I believe it to be prudent 
to put some reasonable restrictions on the use of this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to believe that without legislative regulations the 
intent of today's debate will carry over to reality tomorrow. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT37"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT37"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that we set out a framework for the governor in 
council to work under.  Therefore, I believe the administration 
costs arising out of the CIHR need to have a cap. Currently the 
Medical Research Council administration portion of its $300 
million budget is 4.5%.  May I suggest that this level could be 
maintained and perhaps even capped at 5%.  To allow otherwise 
often leaves open the door for future abuse of taxpayers' 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-13, clause 26(2), the CIHR “may borrow money, 
issue debt obligations or grant or receive a security interest 
only with the approval of the Treasury Board”.  I fail to see 
why the CIHR needs to have this capability.  With an annual 
budget approved by parliament, it is imperative that all 
ministries, departments and crown corporations live within their 
allocated budget needs.  The future for any organization is built 
upon the available resources.  I can see no benefit in allowing 
the CIHR the ability to borrow money even with the approval of 
Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remaining on the issue of finances, I would draw attention to 
clause 26(1)(f), whereby the CIHR may for the purpose of 
achieving its objective, license, assign, sell or otherwise make 
available any patent, copyright, industrial design, trademark, 
trade secret or other like property right held, controlled or 
administered by the CIHR.  While I do not disagree with the 
premise of this clause, I would like to see the financial 
benefits accrue back to the Canadian taxpayer.  In other words, 
when the above types of licensing agreements are granted, the 
revenues revert to the CIHR and this lowers the financial burden 
on the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that individual Canadians do not need to take a back 
seat to anyone or any other country when it comes to research and 
development.  They simply need the chance and the environment to 
continue and complete their work.  While I believe that Canadians 
are willing to fairly contribute and ensure that innovative 
medical research is undertaken in Canada, it is fair to say that 
those same Canadian taxpayers want to see a return on their tax 
dollar investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also interested in the individual projects themselves.  It 
appears there are two distinct and different ways of selecting 
the projects.  One approach is for the governing council to ask 
for proposals on a given area of research.  The governing council 
would then review the submitted proposals and select them 
according to peer review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage of this approach is that the issues of the day 
will be sure to receive a given amount of research resources. 
The disadvantage however, is that without strict guidelines, the 
governing council runs the risk of being swayed by the political 
agenda of the day.  We must remain vigilant on this and ensure 
that politics do not interfere and compromise our medical 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In consultation with health officials, it was confirmed that 
there is an alternate route for those who wish to submit 
proposals.  Anyone may draft a proposal and submit it to the 
governing council for peer review and selection.  The advantage 
of this process is that new cutting edge medical research will 
find a forum for peer presentation.  Individuals without 
connections to major universities and other research centres need 
to have an opportunity to present projects for research funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While meeting with the minister's staff regarding the selection 
of the individual projects themselves, it was indicated that 
there would be a balance between these two alternatives.  I am 
pleased to support this aspect of the bill, but believe that the 
advantages and disadvantages need to be accounted for in the 
regulations.  This could easily be included within the operating 
guidelines and subject to review by the Standing Committee on 
Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently, the present government has been in the debacle of 
definitions concerning pay equity.  The issue of scientific merit 
enters into this debate.  It is important that the preamble also 
include a statement that indicates “Whereas parliament believes 
that health research should provide support for research on the 
basis of scientific merit”.  This should be interpreted as 
research funding based upon the validity of the project, not on 
the basis of employment equity groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect of this bill that requires strengthening is the 
matter of ethics.  We all recognize today that technology has 
made great leaps forward. 
The minister has stated that this is an important part of the 
bill.  I believe it can be further strengthened.

Let us have a process whereby when new issues arise which have 
not yet been contemplated that researchers do not find themselves 
lost in a morass of bureaucracy.  Let us ensure that the future 
is safe from deviation and questionable ethical decisions.  Let 
us ensure that these decisions are not left in the hands of any 
one person or indeed in the hands of the bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other aspect of the bill which I feel is important to draw 
further attention to is clause 21.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governing Council shall review the mandate and performance of 
each Health Research Institute at least every five years after it 
is established and determine whether its mandate or the policies 
respecting its role and functioning should be amended or whether 
it should be merged with another Health Research Institute or 
terminated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of this particular clause lies in the history of 
other government programs.  All too often a valid government 
program has been initiated with no end in sight.  It just goes on 
and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that when this bill is enacted that clause 21 
remain or even be strengthened.  When a program has outlived its 
usefulness, then it is time to eliminate it.  The program may act 
as a catalyst, however the program should not be an industry in 
and of itself.  Where a government program is not worthy of 
further funding, then we simply must end the program and move on 
to something else that is bigger and better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR information states that there will be 12 to 15 
institutes.  I would ask that the future governing council and 
Minister of Health bring this matter before the Standing 
Committee on Health for input and development.  If the CIHR is to 
work effectively, it must not only have the support of the 
government, but the support of the taxpayers as well.  In order 
to accomplish this the research must be seen to be without 
political interference, without the view by the public regarding 
validity and necessity and with the broad based support of 
Canadian medical researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I favour the concept of private-public relationships, 
stringent regulations must be built into this legislation.  We 
must be certain that such a partnership does not become an 
opportunity for the government of the day to have the private 
sector do its bidding.  For any such program to work, there must 
be a transparent, accountable process.  Clause 4 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the CIHR is to excel, according to 
internationally accepted standards of scientific excellence, in 
the creation of new knowledge and its translation into improved 
health for Canadians, more effective health services and products 
and a strengthened Canadian health care system, by— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One manner in which the bill sets this out is in subclause 4(l): 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(l) ensuring transparency and accountability to Canadians for the 
investment of the Government of Canada in health research. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that the Government of Canada represents the 
taxpayers of the country.  As such, the taxpayers will not accept 
any more Shawinigan shenanigans.  I want to stress to the 
government that it should get it right this time.  When the bill 
states “transparency and accountability”, let us have clear 
regulations set out for the research institutes involved.  Let 
the bill and regulation adhere to standard acceptable accounting 
procedures.  Let the recommendations of the auditor general be 
attended to immediately and not on a never-never plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I believe that the intent of the bill heads us in the 
right direction, I want to stress that since its introduction and 
the subsequent briefing, there has not been sufficient time to 
draw together an independent body of medical researchers to vet 
the promises and premise of the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that the Medical Research Council has played a large 
role in this development.  However, I feel it is imperative that 
those outside the system also be given an opportunity to review 
the bill and to give their input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the CIHR is intended to promote health and medical research 
across the country then let us take sufficient time now to ask 
researchers if it is in their best interest.  If the researchers 
who will be involved find that the proposed system will not work 
or will work better in some other way, let us find out now and 
change the system at its inception, not partway through the 
process.  Hopefully we can do this at the committee stage when 
the bill comes to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One aspect of the bill I have not yet addressed is the high 
level of taxation that exists in Canada today.  While the bill 
addresses one part of the brain drain, even though the Prime 
Minister refuses to take his head out of the sand and acknowledge 
the serious problem, it is clear that high taxation is a problem 
for medical research in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go through this debate I would call upon the finance 
minister to take direct action on the high rate of taxation 
rampant in Canada today.  Enough of the smoke and mirror shows 
with promises one day, only to be reneged on the next.  We need 
lower taxes so more Canadians will stay in Canada to begin with 
and those in the medical profession can do the research we so 
urgently need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No less of a body than the International Monetary Fund has 
stated that Canada needs to devote the majority of the surplus to 
lower our debt and taxes.  I ask that the finance minister heed 
these words and assist in the elimination of Canada's brain 
drain, particularly in the medical professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 20 years our health system in Canada has been 
failing Canadians.  It is common knowledge that the government 
has torn $21 billion out of the Canadian health care system in 
the last six years.  It is only prepared to put back a small 
portion of that $21 billion into it.  Canadians are paying a very 
real price for this failing.  The failing rests squarely on the 
shoulders of the health minister, the finance minister and 
members of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time to fix it.  Now is not the time to lay blame 
where blame does not deserve to be laid.  Premier Klein is not 
the problem.  He is attempting to solve a problem in his province 
that has its root cause in Ottawa.  By finding innovative 
solutions the failing of the Canadian health care system can be 
reversed and better health for Canadians will come about. The 
status quo is not acceptable.  We must move forward and seek out 
real, new and innovative solutions.  This bill may be a part of 
that but we know that we can all do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I reiterate that at this time the Reform Party 
will support the bill up to committee level.  I believe that I 
have enumerated ways in which the bill could be improved and 
strengthened.  Let us work together collectively to build a 
better health care system, seeking ways to improve it and 
certainly seeking ways to improve medical research that is so 
important to the health of Canadians.

Canadian Institutes of Health Research Act, to quote its short 
title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to speak about the institutes of health 
research, because this is an issue very dear to me, that I have 
been following now for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, as early as December 1997, I wrote to the federal 
health minister to inform him of a genetics research project 
being proposed by a research team from the area I represent. 
I asked him to assess the merits of this research project to 
determine if a grant was warranted.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In June, I once again wrote to the health minister to invite him 
to take the opportunity, while he was visiting my region, to 
meet a research team interested in working at a proposed 
research institute that could meet its needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in October, in a letter sent to the health minister, I 
asked if the federal government could provide some clarification 
about the proposed establishment of a health research centre in 
my riding of Jonquière. 
I stressed in that letter that I was very open to any investment 
in a specialized research centre.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my Progressive 
Conservative colleague for calling to order this government, 
which tables bills and goes on to show its “keen interest”. As we 
have seen, it had to be called to order. Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now start where I left off. Last October, I sent a letter 
to the health minister asking that the federal government give 
some clarification on an investment project to establish a 
health research centre in my riding of Jonquière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this letter, I indicated that I would be very receptive to 
the idea of investing in a specialized research centre. 
In a release in relation to this letter, I made the following 
statement “If the government wants to announce major investments 
for health research in Jonquière, I will be very happy. My party 
and myself have long been asking that Quebec get its fair share 
of investments in research and development. Good for us if our 
region benefits from those investments.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude this recapitulation by saying that, last week, I 
sent the health minister another letter, in which I deplored 
health care cuts imposed by the Liberal government since 1993 
and the longstanding lack of equity in the distribution of 
federal R and D investments in Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I added that, naturally, consistent with the provinces' 
jurisdiction over health, we supported the idea of receiving a 
fair share of these new investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am taking this time to give a history of my remarks 
and positions on this issue is that I want to make it very clear 
that the Bloc Quebecois and myself have long been supportive of 
the idea of reinvesting in research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want this debate to be exempt from any partisan comments. 
Following the dubious attempts of Liberal and Progressive 
Conservative members to make political hay with this issue—I 
could give a history of that, but I would probably run out of 
time—I stated that this initiative should be judged on its merits 
from a scientific point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I said, back in July, that it was clear to me that 
researchers in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region were the players, 
not Liberal or Progressive Conservative members. I added that 
without researchers there would be no such initiative and that 
it would be thanks to the excellence of the projects and the 
quality of the team of researchers, and nothing else, that the 
region could emerge as a winner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the legislation before us today, the House probably knows 
by now that the Bloc Quebecois agrees with its principle. 
I believe every member recognizes that health is the most 
precious gift we have and that research in this area will result 
in improving the quality of life of our fellow citizens either 
by preventing diseases or by curing those who are suffering from 
diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the intent of the bill is laudable, it is nonetheless 
ironical to see the federal government suddenly so concerned 
about health issues, when we know how drastically it has cut 
transfer payments for health to the provinces since 1993 and 
reduced funding to the granting councils that allocate money to 
scientists in the health field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that in 1993 the federal government 
unilaterally and irresponsibly withdrew from health care 
networks when it introduced the Canada health and social 
transfer. 
In fiscal 1999-2000, Quebec's shortfall in social transfers is 
estimated to be close to $1.7 billion, $850 million of which is 
lost every year in the health field. Since 1993, the cumulative 
shortfall in the health field alone amounts to nearly $3.4 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government claims times were tough and it was 
fighting the deficit. To this I say that people did not stop 
being sick, and it is health workers and the sick who have been 
hurt by federal cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diseases did not suddenly disappear when the Liberals came to 
power, and yet they slashed research grants. 
By so doing they delayed new discoveries and medical 
technologies that would help us take better care of our fellow 
citizens at a time when ageing will require more resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering where all these Liberal members who come parading 
around in my riding were, when their government was making these 
drastic cuts to health care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did they fight to make sure that the health of the population be 
considered a priority and be spared from these cuts? I have not 
seen them very often, in hospitals or emergency wards in Quebec, 
praising the health budget cuts made by their colleague, the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate it if 
the hon. member opposite would let me make my speech. When she 
makes her own, I will listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we agree with the intent of the bill, we do not accept 
everything in it. The Bloc will put forward amendments to make 
the bill more acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, just to give members a general idea, in its 
preamble, the bill does not recognize the provincial 
governments' exclusive jurisdiction in the area of health but 
presents them as mere collaborators with the federal government. 
Here they go again with their mania in the area of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should have been stated in the preamble that it is the 
provinces' responsibility to manage health services within their 
territory and that their agreement is needed in order to 
encroach upon areas under their jurisdiction. We will ask that 
this be specified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 14 of the bill provides that the governing council is 
responsible for the management of the Canadian institutes of 
halth research as a whole, unless it decides to delegate some of 
its powers, duties and functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill as it currently stands, provincial governments do 
not have the authority to choose the research institutes and 
they do not have their say in the strategic direction, 
objectives and policies of the institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, even though clause 5(c) says that the institutes of 
health research are to consult other stakeholders, including the 
provinces, to collaborate and form partnerships with them, the 
wording of the clause is very vague et clearly dilutes the 
importance of the provinces by putting them on the same footing 
as other stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, effectively, nothing will allow the Quebec government to 
ensure that the institutes of health research will respect its 
health priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, it is important to point out that, throughout the 
bill, reference is not made simply to health research, but the 
more general phrase “issues pertaining to health” is used, 
opening the door to an involvement that goes beyond the simple 
research realm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say once again that it is not the establishment of 
institutes as such that is a problem for the Bloc Quebecois, but 
the fact that there is a possibility of direct encroachment on 
provincial jurisdictions in the field of health services to the 
public, without serious consultation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that the federal government wants to put in place 
parallel structures instead of supporting approaches taken by 
the provinces. If this is not its intention, the federal 
government should take advantage of the hearings on this bill 
and co-operate with the Bloc Quebecois to make it clearer, to the 
satisfaction of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Canadian institutes of health research, the federal 
government must not try to get involved in areas that come under 
provincial jurisdiction while forgetting that it is in large 
part responsible for the indecent cuts and the dire straits 
faced by the provinces in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the legislative framework be properly 
developed, because it must not infringe on provincial 
jurisdictions, but rather complement these.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, in Quebec, there is a science and technology 
ministry that is currently finalizing a new scientific policy 
and which identified its strategic areas in health research, 
namely mental health, cancer, genome and biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee hearings, we are determined to ask the 
federal government to respect the particularities and the 
strengths specific to researchers in Quebec regions, in order to 
build upon their success and their skills in areas where they 
excel. The federal government should not designate any institute 
of health research in Quebec without the consent of the 
Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving the network for researchers in order to facilitate 
information transfer is desirable. However, this should not lead 
to federal criteria being applied or provincial areas of 
jurisdiction being infringed upon. This is why it is crucial 
that the Quebec government, which has jurisdiction over health 
issues, take part in selection and management, in these 
institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will attend the hearings of the Standing Committee on Health 
concerning this bill and ensure that representatives of the 
provincial governments and the researchers in outlying areas 
like the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean are heard, so that this bill can 
serve the interests of science and reflect Quebec's priorities 
before serving the federal government's political goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area where I live, we already have 
prominent scientists who, these last few years, have been 
carrying out research in genetics and the human genome. We also 
have researchers like Michel Perron, who is part of Groupe 
ÉCOBES. Mr. Perron studies populations. As the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve said this morning, I think that the 
expertise of the researchers from the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean 
region has reached quite a high level. Their expertise should be 
recognized through a health research institute. I will do what 
is humanly possible to see that they get recognition for their 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is offering its support to the federal 
government so this bill will really promote health research 
while respecting federal and provincial jurisdictions and 
improve the health of all Quebecers and Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in the House today to discuss this very 
important legislation dealing with the Canadian institutes of 
health research as introduced by the Minister of Health earlier 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada enters a new century, the Government of Canada, along 
with the research community, recognizes that there is a 
tremendous opportunity to transform the funding of health 
research in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, a national task force on health research drew on the 
views of leaders and stakeholders in the granting councils, the 
teaching hospitals, the universities, the health charities, the 
provincial health research agencies, the health institutes and 
the business community. The task force proposed a major 
transformation in our approach to health research and recommended 
the creation of the CIHR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating the CIHR, the Government of Canada has taken the 
first step toward creating a national health research strategy 
aimed at engaging all health research partners.  This will 
position Canada very well as we move into the 21st century and, 
as such, is a very exciting proposition.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's health research community has been given the chance not 
only to create Canada's premier health research enterprise, but 
also to do something very important for our country.  In the next 
few months, the vision of a cutting edge, integrative and 
collaborative health research community in Canada will take shape 
and thus become a reality.  That too is very much in keeping with 
what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR represents a revolutionary approach to health research 
in the country.  It will reposition health research in a 
strategic way, funding and co-ordinating all federally supported 
research around an integrated health research agenda.  This 
integrated approach will help to identify gaps in current 
research and lead to new strategies to address research 
shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A priority of the CIHR will be to make a good link between 
health policy and good health research, in step with national 
health objectives, which is very important.  It will incorporate 
the best of current approaches and practices to capitalize on 
existing strength while avoiding disruption of the excellent 
research work already under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing appreciation among stakeholder groups that an 
environment is needed where all sectors of health research are 
simultaneously welcomed, where areas lacking in capacity can be 
bolstered, and where all health researchers are encouraged to 
work together to solve complex and multifaceted health problems. 
The opportunity to exchange ideas and findings with fellow 
investigators is rare in the research world.  Through this 
collaborative approach, research results will be shared to 
greater advantage and ultimately the creation and application of 
new knowledge will in fact be accelerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's diverse health research community has rallied around 
the CIHR because they know that by transforming Canada's health 
research sector, everyone wins.  They continue to play a key role 
in building this new organization as participants in a national 
dialogue in the CIHR development, leading up to the establishment 
of this key organization. In fact, this whole exercise to create 
and design the CIHR has been done in a very transparent and open 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR will bring together Canada's best investigators from a 
full spectrum of health research under a single umbrella to form 
a national brain trust of health researchers.  This 
multidisciplinary approach will be organized through a framework 
of virtual institutes, each dedicated to a specific area of 
focus, linking and supporting researchers pursuing common goals. 
New synergies and networks will be forged across disciplines, 
including basic biomedical research, applied clinical science, 
health services and health systems and society, culture and the 
health of populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIHR is an example of Canadian innovation and will mean a brain 
gain for Canada.  New investments and better training will keep 
Canadian researchers in the country and maintain Canada's ability 
to develop world-class researchers in health in this area. The 
CIHR will bring the best and the brightest minds together to 
unlock then the mysteries of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we see in the legislation, Bill C-13 will establish in law 
the federal government's commitment to the full range of health 
research inquiry.  This will include an area of explosive growth, 
research into the social, cultural and environmental factors that 
affect the health of all Canadians. How, for example, does the 
health of Canadians who live in my part of the country differ 
from those who live in other parts of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its support of both medical and social research, the 
CIHR will ensure that we as Canadians have a better 
understanding, not only of disease but also of health status. 
This latter field is a growing field of interest and has profound 
consequences in terms of health prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be 10 to 15 virtual institutes that will support and 
link researchers as part of a national team based in numerous 
institutions where excellent work is being conducted across 
Canada.  For example, an institute may be established to focus on 
aging, another on women's health or dedicated to mental health or 
the treatment and prevention of diseases such as cancer or heart 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To offer a sense of how a virtual institute might work, let me 
provide members with an example.  Consider an institute on 
respiratory ailments in which a focus is on the growing incidents 
of asthma among Canadian children. 
It could bring together a multidisciplinary research agenda to 
address the following:  basic genetic research on asthma at a 
hospital in a city centre; clinical trials and evaluations of 
asthma therapies in various provinces; research by social 
scientists and public health officials on factors leading to 
asthma in children in rural areas; or evaluate local pilot 
projects to improve how our health system responds to childhood 
asthma.  Any of those or all of those would be in play.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This integrative approach will build on the research base in our 
universities, our health and research centres, our teaching 
hospitals, federal and provincial governments, voluntary and 
private sectors, and all of these working in conjunction and with 
each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR will effectively transform Canada's research sector in 
this way.  Research that has traditionally been performed in 
disciplinary separation will now be integrated across scientific 
disciplines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research that was once conducted in a context that was separate 
from delivery will now be performed with a view to the integrated 
health system.  Research performed under a multitude of agendas 
will now be integrated into a national health agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating a robust health research environment in Canada, the 
CIHR will build the capacity of the Canadian health research 
community and promote the discussion of ethical issues, the 
dissemination of knowledge and the application of health 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, thousands of highly skilled Canadians 
are employed in the health sector.  The CIHR will provide 
expanded training and career opportunities for our scientists and 
clinicians in all areas of research, inspiring a whole new 
generation of Canadians to view health research as a viable 
career choice.  The CIHR will ensure that funding levels are 
competitive with other countries and that our best and brightest 
minds remain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping our researchers here in Canada is definitely a top 
priority, but this is not the only benefit of the CIHR. Canadians 
will benefit from the development of technologies, products and 
services and practices that will lead to new treatments and 
preventative measures.  The CIHR will be a solid return on their 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health research plays an important role in providing new 
information and analysis upon which the effectiveness of the 
health care system can be judged.  It will contribute to the 
advancement of national standards and provide valuable support of 
the decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collaboration and partnership will lead to the sharing of 
information among researchers wherever they reside and among 
stakeholders, thus improving dialogue across different frontiers 
and creating a transparent and inclusive process for the setting 
of the health research agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A climate of innovation and discovery will stimulate research 
investment in the health and biotech sectors. The number of made 
in Canada breakthroughs will multiply and will multiply fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to emphasize again, because it is 
important, that the CIHR will be focused on results, on knowledge 
creation, on discoveries and enhanced base of knowledge to 
improve the health system.  It will create more highly skilled 
jobs in key sectors of the economy and, above all, it will create 
healthier Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As exciting as this venture may be for researchers, in the end 
all Canadians will benefit and the Canadian institutes of health 
research will be very good for Canada.  As a result, I urge all 
members of parliament to support this very important piece of 
legislation in the interests of all of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-13 concerning the 
Canadian institutes of health research.  I am pleased for many 
reasons, but I would like to take members back a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1998, when this concept was first being looked at 
through a task force, I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. 
Howard Dickson who was the scholar in residence for the Medical 
Research Council of Canada.  We discussed this concept in quite 
some detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also received correspondence later from Dr. Paul R. Murphy of 
the faculty of medicine at Dalhousie University in my home 
province of Nova Scotia and from Dr. Timothy H. Ogilvie, the 
acting dean of the Atlantic Veterinarian College at the 
University of Prince Edward Island.  They were also interested in 
supporting this particular concept of the Canadian institutes of 
health research.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1998, I wrote to the Minister of Health saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research is a 
nation-building initiative, bringing together the best of 
Canada's researchers to work in harmony for a better health care 
system.  It certainly seems to merit consideration for 
appropriate funding in the upcoming federal budget.  In fact 
most, if not all Canadians, would support health care as the 
number one budgetary priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am respectfully requesting that you give appropriate 
consideration to the need for investment in health research in 
Canada, and seek proper funding in the upcoming federal budget, 
in response to the concept presented by the Canadian Institutes 
of Health Research Task Force. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to see that the concept has moved beyond the 
point of just studying it and that legislation has now been 
brought forward in the form of Bill C-13.  I am sure that most, 
if not all Canadians, will agree with the principle that I 
mentioned in the letter to the minister that health care is one 
of the number one concerns of many Canadians.  It is in fact the 
top concern for many people living in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House of a personal experience.  Just a few weeks 
ago, my 83 year old mother-in-law had a fall.  She ended up going 
into the hospital because she broke her pelvis in two places. The 
sad part is that she ended up on a small cot in the the hospital 
hallway and for a couple of days or more was unable to be 
admitted into a proper room where she could be cared for. Imagine 
the indignity for a person her age lying out in a hallway on a 
small bed that she could hardly move in.  These are some of the 
conditions that exist in our hospitals across the country because 
the health care system is still in a state of much needed repair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put the bill in context.  I want to talk a bit about some 
of the background and indicate where we stand with respect to the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, you still have plenty of time 
in your talk today.  I thought I would break in here because it 
seems like a logical place.  We will go to Statements by Members.

our sovereignty was not put a risk by big bad American companies 
buying up Canadian companies.

Meanwhile, those that are not sold to foreigners join the 
thousands of other economic refugees who flee Canada's repressive

corporate and personal tax rates, and a high level of regulatory 
burden are reducing productivity, restricting growth and reducing 
the value of Canadian equities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal policies are making Canadian businesses particularly 
vulnerable to foreign takeovers.  Referred to by some as Canada's 
corporate fire sale, the list of Canadian companies being taken

American Tobacco bought Imasco for a whopping $17.3 billion. 
Other takeover targets include MacMillan Bloedel, JDS Fitel, 
Newcourt, Poco Petroleum, MetroNet, Celanese, Discreet Logic and 
Groupe Forex.

a leading constitutional expert from McGill University who 
testified this morning at the standing committee, the Nisga'a 
treaty amounts to nothing less than legislated segregation in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Prime Minister is a very simple one.  Is the 
Prime Minister satisfied that he will go down in history as the 
Prime Minister who embraced legislated segregation in Canada and 
gave it the force of law?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have had treaties in Canada since confederation. 
It is an obligation that was taken when the British settlers came 
to all parts of Canada.  It is an obligation that we have to 
respect.  I do not want to rewrite history.  It is a system 
that was done in good faith by the government of the day.  It 
made commitments to these people and we have to respect those 
commitments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  I guess we

is he not prepared to give the people of British Columbia a vote,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The obligation that has been vested in this situation of the

of the national government as well as the provincial Government

my question is for the minister of defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we had a series of weaknesses in the Sea King helicopters 
that embarrassed the Canadian air force.  We then had the 
Hercules aircraft that took four attempts to get from A to B. Now 
a private contractor has discovered that our Aurora aircraft are 
so corroded they can only fly at one-third of their design 
altitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if there is any point where the government gets so 
embarrassed that it takes action or not but surely it must at 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the minister of defence.  What are the exact 
steps the department of defence will take to address these 
shortcomings in our aircraft in the Canadian Air Force? 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on November 18, as a 
safety measure, a flight restriction was imposed on the Aurora 
fleet restricting the aircraft to non-pressurized flights under 
10,000 feet.  This precautionary measure was taken as a result of 
the discovery, during a regular overhaul, of corrosion on the 
external skin of one of the aircraft which could potentially lead 
to an in-flight depressurization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the Aurora's surveillance role requires the aircraft 
to patrol at low altitudes, below 10,000 feet, the impact of the 
Aurora's operation is minimal and the aircraft will continue to 
fly on its regular missions.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RESEARCH ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK204">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-13, an 
act to establish the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, to 
repeal the Medical Research Council Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When debate was interrupted before 
question period the hon. member for Halifax West had the floor. 
He has 16 minutes remaining in his allotted time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I 
was saying earlier in my speech, I am very pleased to touch upon 
the topic of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.  I was 
about to give a bit of background with respect to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research bill 
is to establish institutes to excel according to internationally 
accepted standards of scientific excellence in the creation of 
new knowledge and its translation into improved health for 
Canadians, more effective health services and products, and a 
strengthened Canadian health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that health care and health research go hand in hand. 
Without proper health research it is very difficult to have good 
health care.  The health care that one receives has to be related 
to research and properly applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was indicated earlier by the hon. member for Winnipeg North 
Centre, we support the bill up to committee stage, at which time 
we will probably make some suggestions aimed at improving it.  We 
will try to improve it with the best interest of Canadian 
citizens in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add my voice to the record in giving thanks to Dr. 
Henry Friesen and many others who contributed to bringing the 
bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what happened between 1994 and 1997.  We know 
that the government continuously cut its investments in health 
research.  Between those years the per capita funding of health 
research fell from $9.14 to $7.92.  Canada became less 
competitive in its funding levels compared to other 
industrialized countries including the U.S., the U.K. and France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cuts had several effects.  They drove researchers, 
including established professors, recent graduates and 
post-graduate students, across the border in search of 
sustainable funding.  We have heard much about the brain drain, 
and this is an area in which many of our skilled and talented 
people have moved from Canada because of the cuts that were made 
in research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coupled with the large scale withdrawal of federal funding and 
poor social programs, cuts in health research diminished the 
capacity of our health care system to care for patients and 
stifled the application of new research findings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coupled with the withdrawal of federal funding in post-secondary 
education, cuts in health research drove university 
administrations to foster commercial research partnerships with 
industry.  These partnerships in many cases decreased academic 
freedom due to an emphasis on applied research, a trend on 
self-censorship among university researchers and a privatization 
of research findings for the purpose of profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the difficulties that research can get into if it is so 
closely tied in with corporate and commercial sponsorship that it 
loses its academic freedom and independence to come forth with 
accurate findings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is being brought forward to establish the Canadian 
Institutes of Health Research. 
This has been done in an attempt to correct some of the past 
mistakes.  The government has now endorsed a new model of health 
research funding, the CIHR.  By and large, as I said, we welcome 
it as a replacement for the Medical Research Council. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT62"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT62"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1510

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand there will be new money and we support those 
efforts.  By doubling the 1997-98 levels of research funding to 
$500 million in the year 2001-02 Canada will regain some ground 
it lost to the cuts over the past six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the legislation in its support for researchers and 
academic programs will help alleviate the problem of a brain 
drain in Canada, but the legislation needs to go further.  Our 
reservation is that the funding levels under the CIHR will still 
remain disproportionate to the funding in the United States and 
other industrialized countries.  We would recommend increased 
spending of $750 million annually, or 1% of the total annual 
health care expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research in a social context is another very important area. The 
multidisciplinary, multisectoral and cross-regional approach of 
Bill C-13 will ideally contextualize hard research, acknowledging 
the social, cultural and environmental influences on health.  Our 
reservation is that this emphasis needs strengthening so that 
there is a central focus on the causation and prevention of ill 
health, in particular on social and environmental determinants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are many problems in society that have to be 
addressed.  I think, for example, of the high incidence of teen 
suicide.  I would mention that in my riding of Halifax West and 
in the province of Nova Scotia a very strong effort is taking 
place right now to create a chair on mental health for 
adolescents.  This is an area that is very important because we 
know that if young people who are suffering from problems do not 
get help then things just go downhill from there.  We know the 
kind of research that has been set up has to support those 
efforts and move forward in a way that will help our young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of the legislation to apply research and to connect 
health researchers to health providers is a significant 
development.  Again we have a bit of a reservation because we 
know that to make this initiative more than an empty gesture on 
the part of the government the social transfers to the provinces 
need to be restored.  How will new research results be applied 
without adequate health care funding, equipment and the staff to 
do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier in my remarks at the end the unfortunate 
circumstance that my mother-in-law met and the kind of service 
she received when she was admitted to hospital.  This was because 
of the cuts in health care funding where there is inadequate 
staff and inadequate facilities to accommodate the kinds of 
situations we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague spoke earlier about commercialization.  I will 
not repeat the remarks she made in that regard, but she also 
talked about the governing council that will be set up under the 
legislation.  A governing council will be appointed to set the 
priorities and the goals of Canadian health research in all 
institutes.  Each institute will have an appointed institute 
advisory board to set institute specific goals.  The appointment 
criteria of these boards, however, are not specific and are 
insufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appointees, I might note, at the discretion of the Prime 
Minister need only reflect scientific excellence and relevant 
background.  What guarantees do Canadians have that industry or 
pharmaceutical interests will not override the public interest? 
We recommend that the appointment criteria be specifically 
defined and that a public voice be dominant.  This is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I received a letter in June of this year from Dr. 
Stan Kutcher who is with the Association of Chairs of Psychiatry 
in Canada.  He pointed out with respect to these health 
institutes that they would like to see an institute of mental 
health and mental illness established as well.  There is another 
whole area that has to be considered with respect to these 
institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, with respect in particular to the governing council, I 
received a letter from the Palliative Care Association of Nova 
Scotia in which it indicated that it would like to have someone 
on the board of that governing council.  Again, there is a lot of 
interest in this particular concept and a lot of support from the 
various associations and the various communities. 
They want to have a say in how these institutes will work so that 
their concerns will not be overlooked. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about ethics a bit earlier and the importance of 
ethics in this whole concept.  To us and many in the bioethical 
community, including the National Council on Bioethics in Human 
Research, the consideration of ethics is inadequate.  It has to 
be a dominant part of this legislation.  Ethics, particularly in 
dealing with human research subjects, should override all 
research projects.  We think this is a very important point that 
has to be taken into consideration.  This protection should be 
entrusted to an independent, arm's length body which will be 
directly accountable to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look at this whole issue of health research institutes, we 
realize that health care is not something that is looked at in a 
vacuum.  There are many things that tie into proper health care. 
It brings to mind many other concerns in our society that we must 
deal with in a meaningful way if the creation of these health 
institutes is to be meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, something we have heard a lot about recently is 
child poverty.  We know that tomorrow we will celebrate the 10th 
anniversary of the all-party motion passed in 1989 to eradicate 
child poverty by the year 2000.  We know that poor children have 
health problems.  Again, there is a tie-in.  If children are 
living in poverty, they are due to have health problems.  When we 
think about the creation of the health institutes we have to take 
into consideration child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness is another very serious issue that is confronting 
our society.  Many of the people who are experiencing 
homelessness are people who were institutionalized.  They were 
released from institutions without the proper supports being in 
place.  The cuts that have taken place do not allow the proper 
follow-up facilities for a lot of these people and they end up on 
the street.  This is another area that ties in very closely with 
the whole concept of health care and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the problems of health in our aboriginal 
communities we see high incidents of diabetes and various other 
diseases.  We see a shorter life expectancy among our aboriginal 
people.  All of these issues are very serious health concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the high incidence of teen suicide in aboriginal 
communities and a lot of other communities throughout the nation. 
These are all things that have to be looked at very closely if we 
are to make a very meaningful inroad with respect to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the environmental issues.  We see spraying taking 
place.  People who are sensitive to chemicals are quite often 
prisoners in their own homes.  There is one lady in my riding who 
is not able to go out during certain times of the year because 
the people next door spray their lawn with pesticides and 
chemicals to which she is very susceptible.  It is almost life 
threatening for her and for many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very important issues, all of which can be dealt with 
through proper scientific research and proper health research. 
That is why these institutes are very important, but we must see 
the connections and we must be able to bring the whole thing 
together in a meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think of the example of gulf war syndrome.  We hear about 
a lot of soldiers coming back from tours overseas and the 
sicknesses they are experiencing because of exposure to various 
toxins and substances.  In many cases they are trying to get 
help, but they are not able to get the kind of help they need. 
These are very serious health concerns which come to mind as we 
discuss this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think about the anthrax vaccinations.  We are putting 
substances into the bodies of our soldiers who go overseas.  They 
do not have the right to say no, they do not want to be 
vaccinated, because they will be court martialled for disobeying 
an order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all issues that tie in very closely with the whole 
concept of health and these are all things which we have to give 
very serious consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to speak to this 
bill.  As I indicated earlier, having followed it from its 
inception, I see it as a very important tool to enable our 
society to move forward in a progressive way to address some of 
the health concerns of Canadians.  However, we must do it with a 
sense of fairness so that the people who will be affected will 
have an adequate say in how these things move forward.  We want 
to keep in mind fairness in representation on the boards, 
fairness in process, transparency and all of those very important 
things that go along with making our country truly a democratic 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member mentioned not knowing how many institutes 
there will be.  I think that is worth more explanation by the 
member because we are all concerned about it.  We are working in 
a vacuum, with not a whole lot of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support in principle the bill, as I have mentioned before. 
However, I think that is something that has to be brought out in 
committee.  We deserve more explanation than what we have been 
given in the bill and by the minister today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member touched on the fact that the appointments will be 
made by the Prime Minister.  When we are talking about the 
governor in council appointing the president of the CIHR, we are 
talking about the Prime Minister appointing the president. 
Governor in council means a political appointment by the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a better way to do that.  Not only will the 
Prime Minister be appointing the president, he will be appointing 
the council as well.  We are moving into the next millennium and 
we are still doing it the old way.  Can something new not be 
considered in the appointment of these senior positions?  Surely 
to goodness we can move beyond just simply appointing through 
patronage.  I hate to say the word patronage, but is there not 
some way that we can move beyond the old way of appointing 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
comment upon the issue of fairness when it comes to appointments 
and the issue of ethics.  As members may know, I introduced in 
the House a private member's bill on a code of ethics for 
parliamentarians.  A key part of that bill involved the whole 
concept of an ethics counsellor who would be independent and who 
would be accountable to parliament, not to the Prime Minister or 
to any minister of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That to me is an essential part of the democratic system, that 
we have accountability, as well as openness, transparency and 
fairness.  That is something which has to be built into this 
legislation as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member was quite right in pointing out a concern about 
how the appointments will be made.  I would certainly support the 
idea that these appointments should be made in a manner that will 
be fair, open and transparent and will be accountable to the 
people who will be the end users of this new service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for making that point.  In my remarks 
I mentioned some of the groups that had written to me expressing 
their wish to be involved in the governing council.  I mentioned 
the palliative care community wanting to have representation on 
the governing council.  There are many other groups which are 
concerned about this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the details we will be bringing forward at committee 
stage to try to bring forward amendments to ensure that kind of 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we are on the 
right track in examining the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out clause 17 of the bill to the hon. member, which is 
found at page 9.  The Prime Minister will be appointing the 
governing council.  Clause 17 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governing council may 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) appoint, layoff or terminate the employment of the employees 
of the CIHR; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) establish standards— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point we are making.  I hope that the Canadian 
public is listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this will lead to, and I think the member might agree with 
me, is the difficulty that Health Canada has had in the past.  I 
bring to the member's attention the case of Dr. Chopra, who was 
one of the scientists who testified on the shredding of documents 
which had to do with the BST hormone issue. 
Basically he was silenced by the government.  He was told to shut 
his mouth and go away quietly.  But he did not.  He appealed 
through the human rights tribunal, which sided with him.  That 
was a huge victory for him and other public servants.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want some safeguards built into the system so that we will 
not be confronted with the same type of situation where there is 
some independence being exercised which is arm's length from 
government.  I cannot see that in the bill as presently written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member might agree with me.  Obviously it is one of the 
changes that we would like to see in the bill and possibly 
entertain in the next few days as we go into committee.  Maybe 
the member could comment on that specific section of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed I will comment on 
that particular section.  I think the hon. member has drawn out a 
very valid point about which we ourselves have concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he mentioned, there is a governing council, and if we look at 
clause 7 of the bill, the governing council shall consist of not 
more than 20 members, one of whom shall be the president.  When 
we go to the next subsection we see that each of those members 
will be appointed by the governor in council, which means 
cabinet, which means the Prime Minister, and that is where the 
concern comes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at clause 17, which the hon. member cited, it does 
not really matter what powers that governing council has if it is 
not independent from those who appointed it.  That is the point. 
There has to be a clear method of appointment which allows for 
independence.  That is why I mentioned earlier in my speech that 
we recommend that the appointment criteria be specifically 
defined and that a public voice be dominant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel it is very important, and I am sure the hon. member who 
asked the question will agree that the public should have a say 
in how these things function.  Therefore, I am hopeful that we 
can change the appointment aspect at committee stage so that we 
will have a proper method of appointment which will enable a true 
public voice to have a say over these councils.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Oak Ridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems like a long time ago, our first caucus in Collingwood, 
where indeed all members of the Liberals caucus were very, very 
worried about the state of medical research in this country.  It 
was January 1998, and since that time we have come to a day where 
members of parliament like myself are almost on a daily basis 
receiving extraordinarily wonderful letters from members of the 
research community in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote Dr. Challis, from the department of 
physiology, in the faculty of medicine at the University of 
Toronto: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mood of the research community at the University of Toronto 
has never been so positive.  The announcement, in the February 
budget of more funding for health research and the creation of 
CIHR, the reference to health research in the Speech from the 
Throne and the Prime Minister's announcement of the 21st Century 
Chairs for Research Excellence have contributed immensely to our 
confidence in performing vital research in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, the legislation is well balanced and enables the 
Governing Council to make all decisions necessary in terms of 
funding programs, creation of institutes, appointment of 
scientific directors and advisory board members. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continues with his thanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was shortly after that Collingwood caucus that I had the 
opportunity to go to Winnipeg to meet with Jon Gerrard, who had 
previously been the minister for science and technology and who, 
on a napkin in the local deli, described to me his vision, with 
that of Dr. Henry Friesen, of what the Canadian Institutes of 
Health Research could look like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we look at all of the concerns that were expressed and 
what was not happening in the previous model.  There are concerns 
about a pure medical model in health research.  We did not have 
an evidence based practice.  The social determinants of health, 
poverty, violence and the environment were not being adequately 
dealt with in our present system.  There was just not enough 
money for even the pure biomedical research that would actually 
get us a cure.  These were huge concerns back in the spring of 
1998.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that day until February 1999 when we signed the health 
accord and the social union contract there have been commitments 
to move toward accountability, transparency and best practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that we get to finally move to the whole issue of what 
we do to keep the country healthy and how we move to be truly 
accountable in the outcomes of health care delivery.  The 
solution is clear. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Canadian institutes of health research, Bill C-13 
speaks of health research as the way to the future. A national 
coalition made up of the industry, the volunteer sector, the 
scientific community, universities and colleges, governments, 
hospitals, health care centres, venture capital, the research 
council and consumers, supports the CIHRs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to take this opportunity to transform 
research, to fragment it into a truly integrated system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of the CIHRs is very clear. Their mission is excellence 
in accordance with recognized international standards of 
scientific excellence in the development of new knowledge and in 
using it to improve the health of Canadians, provide better 
health products and services, and strengthen the health care 
system in this country. The challenge is huge. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly important that we move in a system that is 
integrated in terms of research.  There will clearly be 
cross-cutting research themes, the basic biomedical science that 
must be peer reviewed and must be appropriately funded, and the 
applied clinical research that we must have to know whether what 
we are actually doing enables better outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research in health services and health systems delivery is 
imperative in the fact that we no longer spend money in a way 
that does not work.  We have to move to true accountability and 
stop the unnecessary surgery, unnecessary prescribing and 
unnecessary testing that are costing the government a huge amount 
of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the whole idea of society, culture and health of the 
population which can be a part of any integrated system of 
research.  As well, there is the cross-country processes of peer 
reviews, knowledge management, ethics and partnerships which are 
so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to all researchers in the country, to all voluntary 
health sectors, and particularly to consumers that this is indeed 
a benefit for Canadians.  CIHR will indeed help improve the 
health of Canadians and their families with new health 
discoveries, treatments and practices, and a much better 
understanding of the broad determinants of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The improvements to our health system and services will mean the 
ultimate sustainability of our health care system.  It is a made 
in Canada solution for made in Canada research and products and 
an amazing opportunity for Canadian research excellence to be put 
forward on a global frontier.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member who just spoke has all kinds of credentials 
in the medical profession.  We understand and appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure she would want to refer to page 9, subclause 17(1) 
which deals with the governing council.  I remind her that the 
governing council will be appointed by one person, the Prime 
Minister of Canada.  In part the subclause reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>17(1) The Governing Council may 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) appoint, layoff or terminate the employment of the employees

staffing, including the appointment, layoff, or termination of 
employment— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on.  If we turn to page 10, subclause 20(1) 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governing Council shall 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) establish, maintain and terminate divisions of the CIHR, to 
be called Health Research Institutes;

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question again goes back to the arm's length relationship 
with the government and the independence we would like to see in 
these institutes.  I cannot see where there will be any 
independence.  The strong arm of the Prime Minister will be on 
the very body that is being created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there not a new, a better way, a more creative and more 
intelligent way to set up a body that will move us into the 21st 
century in terms of medical research? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I reassure the hon. 
member that the research community has been extraordinarily 
consulted in the setting up of these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interim governing council of the institutes has had 
subcommittees working on all matters from programs to peer review 
ethics, to knowledge management, to institute design, 
partnerships and commercialization.  The subcommittees will be 
reporting and there will be a process by which there will be 
public feedback on those matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To repeat the letter I received from a researcher at U of T, the 
legislation is well balanced and enables the governing council to 
make the necessary decisions.  It is important we understand that 
there will be a scientific advisory capability and a filter by 
which true scientists will be made heads of the institutes, true 
scientists will be put in positions of authority.  It will be a 
process that scientists, and particularly the interim governing 
council, will be extraordinarily comfortable with.  It really is 
important that it work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians thought or at least assumed that medical or health 
research was already being done by the Medical Research Council, 
or at least that is what the Medical Research Council was 
supposed to do.  Now the Liberals are creating the new research 
institute called the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to do 
probably the same job and same work as the Medical Research 
Council was supposed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we reinventing this wheel?  Can the member shed some 
light on this and answer this question?  Why was the previous 
organization not doing its job properly and why is the new 
organization expected to do the same job in a better way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member needs 
to understand the difference between health research and medical 
research.  What is very clear is that medical research in the old 
biomedical model was not satisfying all our needs in 
understanding all the determinants of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Social Science Research Council was doing the work on 
poverty, violence and the environment.  The Medical Research 
Council was merely looking at biomedical kinds of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative as we move forward that we have an integrated 
way of looking at all these issues because we know that poor 
people do not live as long.  What are we to do to sort that out 
and figure out what we can do about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Forum on Health was very clear about the social 
determinants of health and how we have to move in these trends 
from hospital to community care, from doctor to multidisciplinary 
and to patient as a full partner in care, and from traditional to 
complementary medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no place in the old Medical Research Council for these 
kinds of questions to be answered and they are the questions that 
Canadians want answered.  We now have a solution as to how to do 
that without compromising the extraordinarily important 
biomedical research that needs to be done.  In so many issues we 
just really want a cure. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of Bill C-13, an act to establish the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House have had the opportunity to hear about the 
important transformation CIHR will bring to health research in 
Canada.  Increased funding will make more resources available to 
find Canada's best researchers in making the discoveries that 
will make a difference to the lives of people around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The structure of the institutes will provide a mechanism for 
developing a strategic vision for research in thematic areas that 
will meet the needs and priorities of Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be the focal point around which all partners in the 
health research process will gather, including those who fund 
research, those who perform it and those who use its results. 
CIHR will provide the support that is needed to make Canada the 
place to be for the best and the brightest health researchers in 
the world.  The result will be better health for Canadians, a 
better and a more efficient health care system, and economic 
growth and job creation in the burgeoning life science sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my hon. colleagues will excuse what is sometimes a trite 
phrase, let me say that the whole of CIHR will be much greater 
than the sum of its parts.  The reason for this is the way that 
CIHR will mobilize resources in every region of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIHR will make its impact felt in the regions through mobilizing 
increased funding for health research in research centres across 
Canada.  It will make its impact felt through its direct effects 
on the efficient and cost effective operation of Canada's health 
care system.  It will make its impact felt by building the 
research capacity platform in centres across Canada and it will 
make its impact felt through a new focus on community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its focus on partnerships CIHR will take the increased 
federal investment in health research and make it grow even more. 
Partnerships will bring more research funders to the table to 
embark on jointly funded collaborative projects.  These projects 
will result in an even greater level of research activity in many 
centres across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Medical Research Council of Canada has had tremendous 
success with its partnership programs, so much so that for every 
federal tax dollar invested in health research $1.36 was spent on 
health research.  I have no doubt that the integrated and 
co-operative structure of the CIHR will continue this successful 
leveraging of our tax dollars to create an even better dividend 
for Canadians.  The CIHR is designed to work in partnership with 
provincial and territorial health departments, with our 
universities, with our health science centres and with our 
research agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As every member of the House is aware, responsibility for 
delivering health services is the responsibility of the 
provinces, but CIHR will have the potential to have a strong 
positive impact on provincial health care systems.  Creating new 
knowledge is important, but CIHR is designed to facilitate the 
process of translating research results into application and 
innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIHR will establish links with provincial and territorial health 
service agencies and with those responsible for delivery of 
health information and health care in each province.  Through 
these links CIHR will help provinces acquire the evidence they 
need to make important decisions about how best to deliver health 
services to their residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 is an extremely important piece of legislation for the 
people of my riding of Oak Ridges and for the residents of the 
city of Toronto.  It is about our health.  It is about innovation 
in our community and it is about our position in the knowledge 
based economy.  Toronto has had a long and proud history in 
health research.  Torontonians have a tremendous record of 
contributing to the health of Canadians and to people around the 
world through their research discoveries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most obviously about Frederick Banting and Charles Best, 
researchers at the University of Toronto who through their 
investigative spirit and genius discovered insulin, a discovery 
which has saved millions and millions of lives in Canada and 
around the world.  There is little doubt that it is among the 
greatest Canadian achievements of the past century.  To this day 
it evokes tremendous pride among people in my riding and among 
people across the country.  The University of Toronto has named 
one of its research centres the Banting and Best Institute in 
honour of this historic achievement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently I think of Lap-Chee Tsui, a world renowned 
researcher at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children, who 
discovered the gene for cystic fibrosis. 
His research in genetics and genomics is truly opening up a new 
world of knowledge about our health which promises new and 
effective tools to promote health and treat disease.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toronto's research community is dynamic and vibrant.  It has 
researchers across the full spectrum of research, from basic 
molecular biologists to social scientists looking at the broad 
determinants of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The University of Toronto is Canada's largest research 
university.  Given the quality of its science and the excellence 
of its research, it is the most successful university in the 
MRC's peer review funding competitions.  This past year the 
University of Toronto and its affiliated institutions received 
$55 million in research funding from the MRC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research infrastructure in Toronto contains some of Canada's 
most prized research institutions:  the Hospital for Sick 
Children, the Mount Sinai Hospital, the Toronto General Hospital, 
the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, the Institute of 
Clinical Evaluative Studies, just to name a few. The health 
research conducted in Toronto is of the highest standards of 
scientific excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the CIHR as set out in Bill C-13 is to excel 
according to internationally accepted standards of scientific 
excellence in the creation of new knowledge and its translation 
into improved health for Canadians, more effective health 
services and products and a strengthened health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While its standards of excellence may be international, its 
impacts will be felt in every region of the country, whether it 
is in Toronto or in the maritimes.  For example, in Halifax at 
Dalhousie University a doctor is studying stimulant use among 
adolescents.  In Montreal Dr. Thomas Hudson of the Montreal 
General Hospital is examining the genetic causes of common human 
diseases. It is also going to flourish in Vancouver where at the 
University of British Columbia Dr. Janice Eng is studying balance 
and other problems experienced by patients with Parkinson's 
disease.  It will flourish in centres right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the bill to the House.  I hope all parties will 
support this very important initiative of the federal government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like some clarification and observations from 
the member on this issue. I know he has looked at this bill 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I have been attempting to make and which I will 
continue to make is that there is a lack of an arm's length 
relationship between the CIHR and the Prime Minister.  The Prime 
Minister will be appointing the president of the CIHR and the 
governing council of the CIHR.  The governing council, after it 
is appointed by the Prime Minister, will appoint the advisory 
boards.  There is linkage between every level of this 
organization and the Prime Minister's office. I am concerned that 
these people should be able to exercise their independence and 
they probably will not because of the Prime Minister's hand on 
the very institution we are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the other points I have made, I remind the member 
and I want to tell the public especially that the governing 
council will appoint, lay off and terminate employees and 
establish all the standards.  It will terminate employment at 
will.  It will determine the organization and classification of 
positions within the CIHR.  It will set the terms and conditions 
of employment. 
The list goes on.  The governing council will establish, maintain 
and determine divisions in the CIHR to be called health research 
institutes, create the advisory board and appoint the scientific

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking for some sense of autonomy between this 
organization and the Prime Minister's office.  In this piece of 
legislation I do not see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are serious concerns that have to be addressed in the 
committee.  As I said, we are prepared to support the bill, but 
the major concerns in terms of how this is set up, the structural 
component of this institution, have to be closely examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I sit down, the other point I will make for the hon. 
member to reflect on is on the reporting mechanism.  There is no 
provision in the bill, other than for the minister to table a 
report in the House, for the House to debate the performance of 
this institution.  We will not have an opportunity to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In five years time, the government will review its operation, 
but in the meantime, the control has gone beyond parliament 
completely.  Members of parliament will no longer have the 
opportunity to determine whether it is meeting its mark, whether 
it has missed it by a mile, or whether there has to be a 
rejigging of the configuration of the organization. So many 
different things are missing from this bill that should be 
addressed and can be addressed.  I would like to have the member 
comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my 
colleague's observations.  I certainly appreciate his indication 
that in general his party supports the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is quite correct that if there are specific 
concerns he or others may have, when the bill goes to committee 
they will certainly be able to discuss them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would indicate that the CIHR was enthusiastically supported 
after much consultation by a wide coalition of Canadian health 
research partners across the country in terms of the structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member pointed out some very specific concerns with 
regard to the Prime Minister, and if I understood the member 
correctly, the independence of this body.  This is what has been 
suggested after much consultation.  It would seem that many of 
the proposals and the structure itself originated in those 
consultations with the research community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt there will be witnesses before the committee.  If there 
are those in the health community who have those particular 
concerns, as has been suggested by my hon. colleague, they will 
have the opportunity to present them to the committee.  I presume 
that if the will of the committee is such, it will make 
amendments in its recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the interim governing council to 
the minister worked extremely closely with the health research 
community.  I want to stress that in terms of what we have before 
us today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am especially 
pleased to work on an issue my colleague from New Brunswick 
Southwest is involved with. When he talks about health care, he 
really knows what he is doing. He has lived through things that 
gave him the opportunity to have a closer look at the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government talks about research and development, it is 
obvious that people of good faith will find it difficult to 
oppose, in principle, a bill that deals with medical research 
and will promote the development of several regions of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time I was sitting with my colleague from New Brunswick 
Southwest. We were talking about medical research, especially in 
the pharmaceutical field. We know what impact the bill passed at 
the time has had on the country as a whole, and particularly in 
the Montreal area. This is a example we like to give. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to space research, I am pleased to see the 
government is also continuing its efforts in that direction, 
with all the impact research has had in areas where, a few years 
ago, we had absolutely no expertise. I am sure these examples 
will convince everyone that research is the basis for 
everything. This is true throughout the world. Without research, 
be it medical or any other type, there is no development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give you other examples, one of which immediately comes 
to mind, namely aluminium. I will get back to the issue of health 
in a moment. I am pleased to see that the Secretary of State for 
the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of 
Quebec is here. There has been no job creation in the aluminium 
sector in Quebec. In fact, nearly 10,000 jobs were lost. The 
reason for that—and I am glad to see the secretary of state and 
the industry minister are aware of that reality—is that the lack 
of research in a primary sector always results in job losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I am happy to say this bill will ensure that 
several cities in Canada will have the opportunity to take their 
place in the area of medical research, and we all hope this will 
create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a city in the world that did not need research or 
labs for its development. I am thinking of Montreal, for example, 
and cities like Toulouse, where the aeronautical and chemical 
industries played a key role in the city's development, or 
Boston, with its technological institute. Research created tens 
of thousands of jobs in these regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investors are attracted to places where they know they will be 
able to find a pool of qualified researchers. This applies to 
the health sector as well as any other sector. Take cities like 
Grenoble or Tours, in France, whose development was boosted by 
research in the transportation sector, particularly with regard 
to the high speed train. And let us not forget Bombardier, which 
helped us develop an expertise that makes us one of the best in 
the world today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, there are still too many sectors where Canada 
does not put enough emphasis on basic research. 
I am thinking about the forest product industry, the aluminium 
industry and the health area, except for pharmaceutical 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports the underlying principles of this bill and 
the funding of research projects that will be selected because 
of their excellence and in accordance with international 
criteria. The Progressive Conservative Party will support such 
initiatives. We are in favour of medical research that will help 
Canada maintain and increase its competitiveness in research 
activities, which are currently creating more jobs than any 
other area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, we must stop relying only on jobs in resource-based 
industries. There is only one way to break out of that cycle, 
and it is through research. In improving the health of the 
population, medical research will play a key role in increasing 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, when dealing with an issue like this one, what we in 
our party hope for is that, once the bill is passed and the 
institutes are selected, the regions will not be forgotten, and 
I want to commend the minister responsible for amateur sport for 
his work in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several regions in this country are in deep trouble, because 
their natural resources have all been used up and no 
consideration was ever given to research that would have 
supported processing of these resources in major industries. 
What is happening now is that research is being carried out in 
Europe and the United States. For some fifty years, research was 
completely overlooked in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are faced with the need to do some considerable catching 
up.  That is why it is our fervent hope that the government, 
with the assistance of the opposition parties and members, will 
be able to ensure a fair distribution of the Canadian institutes 
of health research, and that the regions will not be left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a position to do good things in the regions.  We are 
not there just to be exploited.  We are there to create 
worthwhile and well-paying jobs for local people.  Introduction 
of this bill has created a great deal of hope in the regions of 
Canada and of Quebec, and more specifically in my region of 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill was introduced, many people in my region were 
quick to show leadership, one of the best in the country, in 
trying to show their elected representatives, both those in 
opposition and those in government, the importance of moving 
forward with basic research in the health field, and 
particularly of not neglecting the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to list a few of the people in my region who have 
worked very hard to ensure that the regions may one day benefit 
from this project, particularly the region of 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These include Jean-Guy Boily, who has worked very, very hard to 
raise the awareness of all stakeholders about basic research, 
health research in particular, in our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is Robert Jacques, Jean-Eudes Girard, Réjean Lafrance, Yvon 
Perron, Dr. Houde, the researchers at the Hôpital de la Sagamie, 
Michel Perron, Dr. Daniel Gaudet, Dr. Bégin and Gérard Bouchard of 
the IREP, the Institut de recherches interuniversitaires sur les 
populations.  The people at the CORAMH, the Corporation de 
recherches et d'action sur les maladies héréditaires, also do a 
lot of work on hereditary disease.  What is interesting is that 
very often in my region so little is shared that everyone runs 
into the same problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that, in our region, there is very close co-operation 
between the private sector, the medical sector and all the 
researchers, among the entire scientific community.  This also 
applies to a large part of Quebec. These stakeholders work hand 
in hand to introduce projects that will be structural and that 
will lead to worthwhile discoveries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare to hope, obviously, that the government will note the 
efforts of our regions so they may be taken into account in the 
establishment of these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting, and I am pleased to point this event out, 
is that the government has confirmed that, next June, in the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region, and more particularly in Jonquière, 
an international conference will be held on genetic determinants 
of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our region is particular on the issue of genetic research.  I am 
pleased that it can put forward publicly all the expertise it 
has developed laboriously in recent decades, very often with 
little support from national or provincial organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am obviously pleased to point out that we will take this event 
very seriously.  We are not asking anything of Bill C-13. 
We are asking to be recognized as people who have succeeded in 
developing a very high level of expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to mention that the expertise developed by our 
region is beginning to make quite an impression both in 
political circles and among those who perform basic research 
throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the work done by CORAMH researchers on hereditary 
diseases in particular will be known to all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ÉCOBES group at the CEGEP of Jonquière is working very hard 
in co-operation with the people of CORAMH and IREP, who are 
internationally renowned. That is why an international 
conference will be held in our region in June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rest assured that we will submit extremely productive projects 
not only for Quebec, but for the whole country, and—why not—for 
the whole world. To many researchers, our region is an 
interesting laboratory for research on hereditary diseases, on 
genetics. We look forward to the creation of an institute for 
research in these areas so that we can have access to more 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetic research is no longer limited to hereditary diseases. 
Today, researchers are looking at genetic predisposition to 
cancer. God knows cancer affects all families. Every family is 
faced with this terrible challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is to say nothing of asthma and cardiovascular diseases. I 
am convinced that, if the members of the House, particularly 
government members, show that they are conscious of the 
importance of the research that has already been undertaken in 
our regions, particularly in the region I represent—I was not 
elected to represent the whole world but to represent the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region, particularly the beautiful riding 
of Chicoutimi, the fjord—rest assured that we will follow this 
issue very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confident that the research fostered by the establishment 
of these institutes will benefit all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlights comments made by Pavel Hamet, the 
director of research at the Centre hospitalier de l'Université 
de Montréal. He was with us in Jonquière when the minister 
announced the international conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stated that research is indeed being carried out in Saguenay 
and that it is of a very high level, because it has led to the 
discovery of several genetic diseases. “Moreover, he said, the 
Saguenay area is unique, because of its gene pool.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may come as a surprise to some of the hon. members, but he 
also said that the Saguenay is the only region recognized by the 
World Health Organization for its work on regional genetics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Hamet noted that the region is home to the Institut 
interuniversitaire de recherche sur les populations, or IREP, as 
well as several researchers, and that a number of large families 
have yet to be studied, which the WHO considers highly valuable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went as far as to say that it was in our national interest to 
retain in the Saguenay region a group like ÉCOBES and 
researchers coming from the medical community like Dr. Paul Bégin 
and Dr. Daniel Gaudet, whom I and some ministers have had the 
pleasure to meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues are too crucial to be debated loudly in the House 
of Commons; one is even tempted to whisper when addressing them. 
People like animals normally cry in pain when they are suffering 
or have something to hide. As far as we are concerned, we have 
every intent to see this through and to ensure that this 
initiative benefits every region in the country, especially one 
of the greatest regions of Quebec, that of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers like Dr. Bégin et Dr. Gaudet are also members of the 
research centre of the CHUL. They are major partners in many 
projects, including research on high blood pressure and 
neurological disorders. According to Dr. Hamet, other 
collaborative projects will be carried out in the areas of 
breast cancer, cystic fibrosis and neurodegenerative diseases. 
God knows how important it is to look into these diseases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director of research explains that, in the genetic sector, 
the raw material comes from our region and that structural 
benefits are to be foreseen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, I think it is essential that the government put some 
emphasis on core research. It is important in all sectors, 
including in the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could obviously elaborate on that, particularly on the 
positive results achieved, which gave prominence to Canadian 
researchers who are now internationally renowned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I cannot help but ask the government to pay more and 
more attention to a problem that has strong links with the 
medical and health sectors, that is poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lately, we have heard a lot about poverty and about how it is 
destroying Canadian families. It is important to see how the 
phenomenal increase in poverty is linked to health problems. 
Undernourished children cannot be in good health and cannot 
succeed in school. Fathers and mothers who do not earn decent 
salaries cannot feed their children properly and provide them 
with a minimum level of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this is so important for this government, which has 
benefited from the structural measures put in place by the 
previous, Progressive Conservative government. Fairness is 
important in politic. We should recognize that each successive 
government normally makes a positive contribution that deserves 
recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the structural measures it put into place over several 
years, the former Progressive Conservative government made it 
possible for the present government to do away with the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade was the most progressive of measures at the time.  It 
allowed us to raise our exports from $90 billion to $230 billion 
over five or six years.  Imagine what that represents in net 
revenues for the government.  We need only think of the GST, 
which will bring in $24 billion this year.  I can understand them 
not abolishing it.  I would at least ask them to make some 
choices for turning things around that are important to the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that the government will be responsive to these crying 
needs, that it will make investment choices in areas such as 
poverty that will be extremely important for researchers in the 
health field, and this must start at the grassroots level. 
That means ensuring that mothers and fathers have enough money 
to feed their children.  People are in worse health if they do 
not have the bare necessities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I say yes to basic research, yes to health research, 
yes also to a healthier population that is in better shape 
because it can afford the bare necessities of life.  That is why 
I spoke yesterday about the importance of looking very seriously 
at inaugurating a guaranteed minimum wage.  It is time we looked 
at that possibility, like the European Economic Community and 
Portugal will soon be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are dozens and dozens of programs to feed the poor.  There 
has been a 50% increase in child poverty over the past five 
years.  The problem is a serious one, and it is all interrelated 
with health research. 
War has been declared against poverty with a tool that strikes 
me as likely to be the only one that could be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are matters on which we could concentrate for hours.  We 
are going to focus a great deal of attention on Bill C-13 as it 
relates to research.  As a party, we have always believed in the 
importance of research.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like my colleague to comment on the structure of 
the CIHR.  I think it is problematic, but I would like his 
opinion on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is the Prime Minister appointing the president of 
the CIHR and the governor in council, which in turn will 
determine what becomes an institute.  In other words, we do not 
know yet what these institutes are.  There is no transparency as 
to how many there will be or what they will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem in terms of this arm's length relationship 
that we would like to see between the CIHR and the Prime 
Minister's office.  This arm's length relationship I guess could 
be called independence.  The member could possibly speak on this 
lack of independence, as I see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, regarding a reporting mechanism, none of us know whether 
or not the goals and objectives of the CIHR will be achieved, but 
there is no measuring stick and no reporting back to parliament. 
Once the bill leaves the House of Commons it is out there in 
bureaucratic land somewhere.  In five years time, when this 
agency is reviewed, there will be no input and no ability of 
parliament to have any input on the structure of this new 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying all this, believe it or not, in the context of 
supporting the bill.  We do support the bill, but I think some of 
these questions of independence, arm's length from government and 
the reporting mechanism have to be addressed in the bill.  I am 
hoping the member can comment on that from a Quebec perspective. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. As I pointed out a moment ago, a bill is never perfect 
when first tabled. Obviously, our caucus, through our health 
critic, the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest, will 
certainly make extremely efficient efforts to put forward 
amendments concerning the administrative structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of my work on this issue, I met with many specialists in 
medical research, and it is true that these are people able to 
assume a lot of responsibilities. They do not want handouts. 
They are able to make interesting proposals, in relation to both 
the areas where research should be encouraged and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will certainly have an opportunity to share their views 
with the committee, and my colleague will be able to propose 
amendments. This will allow us to come to an agreement on the 
main thrust of Bill C-13, which is to encourage health research 
by establishing research institutes. It will also enable us to 
create thousands of research application related jobs for young 
people looking for structural jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with a scientific community which is used to 
taking charge and which did not always get the support it needed. 
I am convinced that my colleague's wish will be fulfilled by the 
government, because the government's goal should be to encourage 
people who can carry out good research and create jobs. 
Ultimately, I am sure all Canadians will appreciate and benefit 
from that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be interesting to give researchers more scientific 
responsibilities, and also administrative ones, so that 
politicians can step back from the appointment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entering an era where political appointments will become 
less and less acceptable. I have been reviewing the Canada 
Elections Act. Just yesterday, we talked about returning 
officers. For the last hundred years, they have been appointed 
by each successive governing party, but we are now wondering 
whether it would be better to have a process whereby the best 
candidates would be appointed to these positions.

over two years.

rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central and on behalf of 
all my colleagues to respond to the government's proposal to 
replace the Medical Research Council and create the Canadian 
institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective, as I understand it, is to create new knowledge 
and then translate it into improved health for Canadians.  Before 
I go into the details, I would like to extend my appreciation for 
the work of Dr. Henry Friesen, who is the president of the 
interim governing council, and other members of the council who 
have cared about the importance of cutting edge research and who 
have worked hard to put this idea together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want, of course, to provide Canadians with more effective 
health services and products from a strengthened health care 
system, not a weak system as the government has made it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Liberals can do this with Bill C-13, which is one of 
the major pieces of legislation they have proposed before the 
House.  I have some problems with what they say they can do, what 
they will actually do, and what they will cause to be done. These 
are the three different things I am concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into the details, I have many questions in my mind 
that I would like to have answered by the government members. Why 
are we not extending the mandate of the previous organization, 
the Medical Research Centre? 
Why are we not putting it on the right track?  Why do the 
Liberals not give the current institution the vision and the 
tools to get the job done?  Why are the Liberals reinventing the 
wheel?  Perhaps it is cash-strapped because of the $23 billion 
the government cut from our health care spending.  Maybe it is 
because of the lower morale and the confidence of the health care 
providers in the system. Maybe.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Medical Research Council failing because of the brain 
drain that the government has caused?  Are doctors, nurses, 
scientists and researchers leaving our health care system and 
research facilities in such large numbers that we are falling 
behind in research?  Maybe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it that the researchers and scientists cannot afford the 
technology necessary and the tools required in order to conduct 
their research? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these questions have remained unanswered so far in this 
debate.  I have been listening very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government allow that to happen to our research? 
Did it destroy our research capabilities in order to balance the 
budget?  Maybe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much democracy is going to be created with this new 
institute? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government members should be answering these questions 
during the debate today.  Canadians want to know the answers to 
these questions.  Canadians want accountability in our research 
system.  The Medical Research Council has 85 employees and it 
costs about $14 million per year.  However, instead of creating a 
new entity, why do the Liberals not work with the 85 scientists 
we already have in the system and give them the tools and the 
technology they need to get their work done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will have 20 directors to appoint if this bill 
passes, 20 patronage-ridden appointments which shows from their 
record.  Will they be awarding these positions based on merit? 
Will these positions be advertised?  I doubt it, that is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much work to be done on the bill and many 
considerations to be made.  There has been very little time to 
consult with the various scientific communities.  Who will 
co-ordinate, integrate and focus the research?  How will this be 
handled?  Will the applicants themselves, the people allowed to 
do the research, direct the bulk of the research, or will the 
nature of the research be directed by the advisory board forcing 
applicants to apply for funding in areas dictated by a central 
body? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, there are many areas that the health committee of the 
House will want to investigate.  Witnesses will need to be called 
in to clarify certain aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently received a letter from  the Heart and Stroke 
Foundation of Canada asking to appear before the health committee 
of the House.  They are looking forward to appearing before the 
committee because they want to express their support for the 
bill.  They also have concerns that they want to put on the 
table.  They want to bring the foundation's unique perspective to 
the work of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The represent Canadians in the cardiovascular community: 
doctors, nurses and patients.  The Canadian Heart and Stroke 
Foundation of Canada speaks for many Canadians, including those 
who have died from cardiovascular diseases.  We hope they will be 
allowed to give testimony before the committee, unlike the 
Nisga'a hearings in B.C.  As we see, the government stacked the 
witnesses on the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal dominated committee makes it very difficult for us 
to work with it.  We on this side of the House want to help the 
Liberals.  We know they cannot see they do not have vision. We 
know they do not listen to Canadians.  We will hold the 
flashlight for them and give them direction in their darkness. We 
will try to help them do the government's committee work. 
However, it is very difficult to work with the partisan-ridden 
committee system that we have in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to support this bill.  We would like to support 
whatever we can that will improve, develop and facilitate medical 
and health research in Canada because we know that is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill could address the concerns of the brain drain.  It 
could be used to attract and retain Canada's brightest young 
researchers.  It is going to be hard enough to keep them in 
Canada because they are overtaxed.  It is shameful that many 
successful young medical science graduates would go immediately 
to the U.S.A. to make some serious money and pay very little tax 
on the six-digit salaries they make there.  It is going to be 
difficult for the Liberals to convince our finest young minds to 
stay in this overtaxing country.  Maybe Bill C-13 could be used 
to expand what we have to accommodate our scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is that Bill C-13 promises a clear and concise 
statement in a yearly plan that promotes the development of 
research in health and science.  We know that the auditor general 
is continually calling on the government to be more transparent 
in its reports to parliament.  There are many examples of the 
government not being overly forward in terms of providing the 
House and Canadians with the facts and figures concerning many 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The performance reports that the Liberals offer as supplementary 
budget estimates on a semi-annual basis are not all they are 
cracked up to be.  They are a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the example of CIDA.  Parliament is quite far 
removed from its operations.  CIDA is left running wild, out of 
control, while the government provides parliament with as little 
information as possible about the mismanagement and lack of—

I apologize to the member, but since what he said is so 
interesting, I find it most unfortunate that there is no quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could you call for quorum so that the Liberal members can come 
and listen to what we, on this side of the House, have to say? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is such an important 
bill that I was surprised only two Liberals members were 
listening.  It is an important bill.  In the last few minutes 
quorum had to be called twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, I was talking about the government reporting to 
parliament.  We hope that the annual report of the Canadian 
Institutes of Health Research will really provide information to 
the elected representatives of the country so that we may decide 
whether our constituents' tax dollars are being spent wisely.  We 
will be anxiously awaiting the auditor general's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that time is limited and there are many things I want to 
say about the bill.  I cannot even pretend to deal with the 
process of research grants that will be administered by the new 
institutes.  The selection process could attract foreign 
participants who would provide us with a wealth of new 
perspectives, experience and products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know about agencies created by Tories and Liberals that 
are at arm's length from the House of Commons.  We see the 
terrible waste of tax dollars squandered on million dollar 
dinosaur statues, pornographic movies, free flags and hundreds of 
thousands of dollars for constructing dead trees and many other 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that these new institutes, created to operate at arm's 
length from the government, will not turn into pork barrels that 
the Liberals will use to pay off political favours and other 
things.  Hopefully high ranking scientists will be allowed to 
make decisions without interference from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of the BST hormone fiasco.  The government 
pressed hard for scientists to approve and declare that the 
bovine growth hormone was safe, but the scientists refused.  They 
ended up leaving their jobs over the issue.  Liberal senators on 
the Senate committee dealing with this were appalled at the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effort in Bill C-13 represents our federal government's 
single largest investment in research and knowledge.  We want to 
develop affordable and accessible health care.  We need to work 
on the prevention of disease, detection of disease, health care 
services and treatment, new discoveries, new products and new 
patents.  We need to meet the health challenges of the future, 
including new treatments for new strains of bacteria.  We need to 
fight those new strains with new antibiotics.  We need to be 
innovative and evaluate and improve our health care resources. We 
need to deepen our understanding of health care issues and 
services.  We need to identify and fill in the gaps between what 
we have and what we should have.  We need to confront questions 
of ethical standards.  We need to research all of those things. 
We have to work closely with the provinces, territories, our 
universities, health institutions and numerous NGOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about a cutting edge research centre.  We 
hope he can deliver it.  Canadians want to see accountability, 
not more bureaucracy.  The minister said today that 95% of the 
funding will go to research and 5% toward administration costs. 
We will hold him to those figures.  We will see if that happens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When President Reagan met President Gorbachev at the first 
nuclear disarmament meetings, he said trust, but verify.  We have 
to verify whether the government sticks to its promise before we 
start trusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the record.  We have seen the Liberals drop the 
ball on an organ donor transplant system.  They did not deliver. 
They continue to study it while Canadians die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the government ignore the head start program which 
was supported by all sides of the House.  That motion was 
introduced by my colleague, the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan 
de Fuca, who has worked hard on the issue.  The Liberals have 
done nothing about extending the head start program from 
aboriginal children to all Canadian children, even though it has 
been a successful initiative elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know about the Moncton and Hawaiian head start programs. 
It is said that for every dollar invested there will be a saving 
of $6, there will be fewer youth dropping out of school, a 
reduction in teenage pregnancies and a reduction in youth crime. 
It increases the bond between children and their parents. These 
are all the things we know the head start program will deliver, 
so why do the Liberals not go ahead with it?  We will have to 
wait to see what they will do on research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is smoking.  We saw the government raise taxes 
on tobacco and then lower them because it could not do anything 
to stop tobacco smuggling.  The Liberals caved in.  They did not 
have the political will to tackle the problem of smoking, 
particularly as it concerns our children.  Why not tackle the 
cause of smoking related diseases by working to prevent people 
from starting to smoke?  Why do the Liberals limit work on 
smoking problems and merely treat the diseases that flow from 
chronic, long term tobacco use? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is fetal alcohol syndrome.  Why not stop the 
syndrome instead of merely dealing with the results?  That is 
what the government has done on so many other issues.  It 
addresses the symptoms but not the cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important issue is the drug problem. Governments at the 
municipal level, the provincial level and the federal level are 
not dealing with this issue.  The federal government could 
contribute a lot to this issue.  I have not seen any strong 
initiative from the federal government to deal with the drug 
problem.  Drugs are being imported into this country and nothing 
is being done.  Nor has anything been done to effectively treat 
drug users.  The government is turning a blind eye to this 
serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other problems stem from it, for example AIDS and HIV, but 
nothing is being done by this government.  It believes in looking 
at symptoms but not treating the causes.  We hope this will not 
continue to be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that we need to work with, consult and include our 
scientific community in the work that our federal government does 
in the field of health.  We need the input of our scientific 
community to direct the research.  On this side of the House we 
hope that this bill will result in the creation of successful 
research institutes.  We want to help the Liberals achieve this 
if we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the Surrey and White Rock Home Support 
Association, which is in my riding.  In Surrey Central we are 
trying to establish a wellness centre for seniors.  The energy 
behind this effort is Mr. Ron Watson and the Surrey and White 
Rock Home Support Association.  Ron is a wizard when it comes to 
matters of health care.  He is one person who many people in our 
community, myself included, look up to.  The Surrey wellness 
centre will benefit the elderly in our area.  There is a need for 
this type of accommodation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the Liberals have refused to allow Surrey to use 
millennium project funds to get this going.  The Liberals have 
financed dinosaur statues, tree statues, all kinds of parties and 
other things, but they will not allow the spending of millennium 
project funding on such an important project that will help our 
seniors.  The Surrey wellness and health centre will have 1,000 
beds.  It will serve Alzheimer patients, geriatrics, the general 
population and the terminally ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, there is a need for that facility, but this 
cold-hearted Liberal government has no vision and will not help 
us. Instead, it insists on trying to get us to build a dinosaur 
statue for $1 million or have a big party.  We cannot use the 
millennium project funds to get the home care unit going. It is 
absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another issue, Alberta is creating a health care system to 
try to keep Canadians from having to go to the U.S. to get 
medical treatment because the health care in this country is not 
working.  This country has a sickness care system, not a wellness 
or health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is already a three tier health care system.  One tier is 
regular treatment which is status quo and only in a medical 
emergency.  The second tier is a waiting system and 200,000 
people are waiting for various treatments.  The third tier is 
when people do not get the desired health care and they have to 
go to the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is very difficult to trust the government 
knowing its misguided priorities and propensity to mismanage 
whatever it does. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pleasure that I take part today in the debate on Bill C-13, the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I am all the more delighted to do so following 
my colleague from Jonquière and my colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who spoke this morning and made a very 
good case for these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle, we cannot be against the establishment of these 
health research institutes in various areas of public health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, my speech will focus on Bill C-13, as presented by 
the government, but I will also clarify the more problematic 
aspects of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other matter I will address is the whole issue of research 
and development. There is much to say on this subject, but I 
will confine myself to a few points because, for a long time, 
Quebec, and Montreal in particular, did not get its fair share 
of federal grants for research and development. I will come back 
to that later because Montreal has been a poor cousin when it 
comes to investment in research and development by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have a strong metropolis, attract brains and stimulate 
productive investments, what is required is investment in that 
metropolis, so as to develop the various areas on which Montreal 
based its economic recovery. Biotechnology is one major area in 
Montreal in terms of recovery. Yet, we are still waiting for 
federal productive spending in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that only 16% of R and D expenditures are made in 
Quebec certainly raises questions. No wonder Montreal lost its 
title of Canada's metropolis to Toronto. It is because the 
federal government did not spend and did not want to invest in 
areas that were crucial to Montreal's development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without basic, crucial, productive and job creating investments, 
Montreal will never meet its economic recovery objectives. I 
will come back to R and D later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to the priorities of Quebec and the Quebec 
government. These need to be addressed because it is not true 
that the federal government is the only one to promote and give 
priority to scientific and technological research. It would be a 
mistake to think that, with its bill, the federal government is 
the only one to give priority to an area that is crucial to 
Quebec's economic and technological development. 
So does the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Quebec government created a ministry 
of research, science and technology. This ministry is working on 
a draft science policy which will be made public in a few 
months. It focuses on such critical issues as aging, and other 
important areas Quebec has been working on and for which it 
never received a cent from the people across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to Quebec's priorities later on. At the end of 
my presentation, I will give a rather telling example of what 
public investments in research could accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced a private member's motion to legalize the use of 
marijuana for medical purposes. 
We are still waiting for money from Ottawa to start clinical 
trials in phase III, which would allow us to go ahead with it, 
thereby allowing patients to take their drugs legally. I will 
also come back to this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-13 is to establish institutes of health 
research. In his last budget, the finance minister gave some 
indication to this effect. Today, the basis on which these 
institutes will be built are set out in very concrete terms. To 
establish these institutes the government acted on the 
recommendations made by 34 university scientific experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They included Quebec and Canadian academics and scientists. Bill 
C-13, which establishes these institutes, is based on the 
recommendations made by these 34 experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say the issues that might be raised are important. 
They are crucial to the people in Quebec and Canada. Among other 
issues, there is the whole issue of population aging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a demographic situation where the population in Quebec 
and Canada is getting older. The aging curve is going up. To a 
certain extent it is harmful. In the context of renewal and of 
our ability to secure the future of the Quebec and Canadian 
society, technological alternatives will have to be developed to 
ensure that the life expectancy of Canadians will increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of aging is fundamental and it encompasses various 
areas. Obviously, it covers every disease. 
I am thinking of diseases like Alzheimer and various mental 
diseases as well as various surgical procedures. Technology in 
that area in essential to increase the life expectancy of 
Canadians and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of research could be arthritis. I think a lot of 
Canadians suffer from this disease. I know what I am talking 
about. One third of the people in my riding are over 55. This 
disease affects an increasing number of people everywhere in 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of clinical evaluation and evaluation of technologies 
also seems essential to us. Technologies cannot be developed 
scientifically without verifying their accuracy at some point 
and finding ways to apply them. In terms of technological 
development in Canada, useful applications must be sought for 
new technologies because, in the end, our goal is to improve the 
quality of life of the people we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue of clinical evaluation and evaluation of technologies 
is another area in which the institutes could be called upon to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In budget terms, we got a surprise.  It was a surprise for me, 
at least.  But I discussed it with my colleague from Drummond, 
who has been the Bloc Quebecois' critic on the subject for many 
years. I would say that she spearheaded the entire Bloc 
Quebecois strategy in the request for transfer to the provinces, 
in the desire of Quebecers to have their loot, as one of our 
former premiers put it.  The member for Drummond said to me “We 
could summarize the government's initiative in two words.  I was 
in attendance at the standing committee and aware of all that 
was happening.  It is a praiseworthy but virtual initiative”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the principle is praiseworthy, we will support it, but at the 
same time this is a technocratic or bureaucratic blur, something 
the government opposite always arranges for the various health 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is a surprise no longer, we know it now.  The 
minister was clear.  In February 1999, it was made clear that 
there will be a $65 million investment for the 2000-01 fiscal 
year.  We also learned that there would be $175 million more for 
the following year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a lot of money, and we must agree.  But the members on 
this side of the House must see to it that this money really 
serves the needs of the people of Quebec.  I have said this, 
there is a policy currently being developed at the Quebec 
department of research, science and technology and we must make 
sure that these investments really meet the needs of the people 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate is clear.  It is written in black and white and in 
the preamble to the bill.  It appears a little further on in the 
bill: it is to organize, co-ordinate and fund health research in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, there is a willingness to organize, but there is 
more. Earlier, I was reading part of the preamble and I was 
somewhat surprised to see what it said. The preamble reads in 
part as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Parliament believes that health research institutes 
should be created to coordinate, focus and integrate health 
research based on— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is essential at this point to tell you that there is a 
problem within the problem, with this notion of focus. 
These are the issues I want to raise, because while I said we 
agree with the principle, there are some problems. The first one 
is that the bill does not recognize the exclusive jurisdiction 
of Quebec and the other provinces in health and social services. 
This should be pointed out. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read another part of the preamble, which sheds light on 
the role of the provinces under this legislation. The second 
“whereas” reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Parliament recognizes the role of the provinces in 
health care and that the Government of Canada collaborates with 
provincial governments to support the health care system and 
health research; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the role of the provinces is recognized, but the federal 
government continues to collaborate strongly and to focus, as 
they say in the preamble of the bill. 
I think care must be taken to recognize that provincial 
governments, including the Government of Quebec, have exclusive 
jurisdiction in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect of this bill, and one that I have a 
problem with, is that, despite any statements of policy the 
provinces might issue, including those from the Government of 
Quebec, they do not have the authority to choose CIHRs.  The 
bill makes it clear that the future governing council will have 
final authority.  This is important, and I will read paragraph 
5(c), among others, which says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) consult, collaborate and form partnerships with the 
provinces and with persons and organizations in or outside 
Canada that have an interest in issues pertaining to health or 
health research; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the CIHR will collaborate with the provincial 
governments, but never when it comes to administration.  The 
Government of Quebec will never be able to define the general 
direction it would like its institutes to take.  I find this 
very worrisome from certain points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect is that the provinces are not on an 
equal footing with the other partners.  Just now, I read 
paragraph 5, which made this abundantly clear.  Basically, 
certain agencies will be placed on the same footing as a 
province, which has a duly elected government and which provides 
services. 
In the worst case scenario, agency <I>X</I> could be considered on an 
equal footing with a province of six to seven million people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I think the federal government has not really 
taken into account the role of the provinces in the provision of 
health care services.  This is nothing new, because the 
provinces have never really been considered in the overall 
picture of services provided.  Since 1993, the federal 
government has cut $3.4 billion in provincial transfer payments 
for health.  In the 1999-2000 budget, the shortfall in social 
transfer payments will be $1.7 billion for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that Quebec and the provinces are partners, but it 
needs to be understood that we are not all equal partners. 
Some of those partners, like the provinces, have duly elected 
governments and certainly deserve to be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased however to see that the secretary of state 
responsible for the economic development of the regions in 
Quebec has stayed to listen to my speech. He is the member for 
Outremont, a member from Montreal. He should be aware that 
various development axes and sectors have contributed to the 
economic recovery of Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was, for instance, the very dynamic sector of 
biotechnology that has created a lot of jobs without any federal 
support. 
Given the huge amount of money announced by the finance minister 
for the creation of the institutes of health research, I am 
concerned about the money that will be spent in Montreal in 
these sectors. It is rather surprising.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec currently gets only 16% of all the 
structuring spending in R and D. The industry minister brags about 
all the huge achievements made in Montreal and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the industry minister across the way and, naturally, the 
hon. member for Outremont is agreeing with the minister. It is 
incredible that the man who should be protecting the interests 
of Montreal and Quebec would accept that only 16% of the 
structuring spending in R and D is handed over to Quebec, which has 
25% of the overall Canadian population. 
This is unacceptable, and I look forward to seeing how the hon. 
member for Outremont will defend this position at the next 
election. I can understand the Minister of Industry; he is not a 
Quebec MP, but I have great difficulty understanding the hon. 
member for Outremont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are indicating that I have only two minutes left, Mr. 
Speaker. I is a pity, because I could go on for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with something that, while not personal, is very 
close to my heart, the whole issue of the use of marijuana for 
medical purposes.  I have been saying for a long time that we 
needed to invest in research. 
Canada has lagged far behind other countries for a long time, 
compared to what has been done in the way of research in 
California and in England.  Canada has never been able to catch 
up, to resume its role as an initiator, able to provide its sick 
people with medication that meets a whole set of medical 
criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close on that point, for I see you are about to interrupt 
me, but I must assure you that we are in agreement in principle. 
And as my colleague from Drummond has said, it is a 
praiseworthy bill, but one that is still a virtual one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary

explain, not in great detail but in general, what the Government 
of Canada is doing to contribute to the development of the 
province of Quebec, particularly of the Montreal region, with 
regard to research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that my colleague the Minister of Industry 
and myself were somewhat taken aback by the comments made by the 
opposition, particularly by the Bloc Quebecois, but I think this 
is part of a normal pattern whereby these members try to suggest 
to the people of Quebec that the federal government is not doing 
anything positive. Of course, they do not want people to see 
what we are really doing because it certainly does not serve 
their cause. What they want is to break up the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> I hear them shouting on the other side, 
which obviously means it hurts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague the Minister of Industry rightfully reminded me 
a few moments ago that one of the best research and development 
tools we have in Canada is the tax credit, which is administered 
by my department, Revenue Canada. This tax credit represents 
about $1.4 billion for the Canadian economy as a whole, and a 
good part of that money is invested in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> If the members opposite will let me 
continue, I would like to talk about biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Biotechnology, in Montreal essentially, was established with the 
assistance, the indefeasible support of the Canadian government 
and of my colleague in industry, especially through the creation 
of the biotechnology research institute, which gave a lift to 
biotechnology in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest number of researchers in the field of biotechnology

is, first and foremost, the hon. member for Outremont. He should 
remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state can list all the things the federal

about billions of dollars and millions of dollars—I admit that—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me come back to the point 
I was making just before all the Bloc members left the House, 
because when we speak about the truth, about what the Canadian 
government is doing in Quebec, they do not like to listen and 
they certainly do not want the people to hear about such things. 
But I was about to deal with the aeronautical industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned Technology Partnerships Canada, which spends about 
50% of its budget in the province of Quebec. The Minister of 
Industry approached a number of corporations, including 
Bombardier, CAE Électronique and Pratt & Whitney. So, it was a 
very significant program that created a critical mass in the 
greater Montreal area and helped to develop an industry that has 
made quite an impact not only in Quebec and in Canada, but 
internationally as well, and the Canadian government is very 
proud of its contribution to this success story in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Foundation for Innovation also got involved in the 
work of several research centres, in order to build a 
forward-looking, knowledge-based industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently had the opportunity to be the guest speaker at a 
breakfast meeting held by the Inno-Centre of Montreal. At this 
networking breakfast, I announced that the federal government, 
in collaboration with the Inno-Centre, will be spending 
$4.5 million in seed money especially to help launch 
technological businesses. Again— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
would like to know if the minister is taking part in this debate 
on research institutes or if he is still on questions and 
comments. I rose to speak when he finished his first question, 
but the member— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Could I please have the floor, Mr. Speaker? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I will take the 
floor.  This is what happened.  I am sorry, I will have to do 
this in English because my French just is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a member representing a party other than the party 
that gave the speech, the other member on his or her feet will be 
recognized even if it is a second or third question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular instance the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands 
rose to ask a question.  He decided not the ask the question. The 
member for Outremont rose and was recognized.  Even though it was 
his second question he was from a different party.  That is the 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is always the way it has been done.  If other chair 
occupants choose to do it differently that is up to them, but I 
would never have recognized a member from the same party to ask a 
question if there is another member from a different party on his 
or her feet.  That is the reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Outremont has 30 seconds to ask a question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Rosemont will then have two minutes to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find interesting that the 
Bloc Quebecois is making statements that are not accurate. It is 
interesting to see that when we give an answer, they do not 
really want an answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold: </B>Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. minister in

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe there is a rule here in this House, to the effect that 
a minister or member of parliament may ask a question to the 
hon. member who just made a speech, but that person should be 
given sufficient time to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has a lot to say, I see. He simply should have his 
name put on the list of those who want to speak for 20 minutes, 
like everyone else in this House, and not take up the time of 
the member who is making a speech in reply to the outrageous 
claims made the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All right, that is 
enough.  We are finished.  There are no more points of order. 
The hon. member for Rosemount has two minutes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems that facts are 
upsetting to that side of the House. The fact is that 16% of 
federal research and development money goes to Quebec, while the 
province accounts for more than 25% of the country's population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> This is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could have gone further. I 
could have provided some statistics that show precisely that 
Montreal, which is represented by the secretary of state and 
member for Outremont, among others, does not get its fair share 
of goods and services from the federal government. We are 
talking here about productive spending, about federal spending 
that creates jobs. Quebec comes up short, on this score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister does not agree with these figures, let us hear 
him say so. These are the facts. 
The secretary of state responsible for the Canada economic 
development for Quebec regions agency, who is a member of 
parliament from Montreal, should be in a position to challenge 
what I am saying. I tell him not to start listing various small 
projects, but to look at the overall actual results and to 
assess them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ) </B>moved that 
Bill C-213, an act to promote shipbuilding, 1999, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of emotion that I 
rise today in the House to give the most important speech I have 
ever given since I was elected in 1993 as the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. 
I will be dealing with the private member's bill that I have 
brought forward to promote shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, shipbuilding is the most important issue falling 
under federal jurisdiction, since the Lévis shipyard once had 
over 3,000 employees and provided jobs to close to 1,200 workers 
during the last two years to rebuild the oil platform <I>Spirit of 
Columbus</I>. At some point, the overall wages reached $150 million a 
year and the economic benefits often exceeded $300 million in the 
regions of Quebec and Chaudières-Appalaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is the result of a process I started more than two 
years ago with Richard Gauvin, the president of the Davie workers 
union, in order to bring together all the stakeholders in the 
Canadian shipbuilding industry. 
Why? Because we both realized that we would never get the 
attention of the federal government that the Davie shipyards 
needed if we did not get the other Canadian shipyards on board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes together, sometimes individually, we approached all of 
the stakeholders that could be of some help to us. I want to 
thank Richard Gauvin for his valuable contribution and I want to 
say hello. I know he is sitting in the gallery, along with two 
members of its union executive, Bernard Demers and Nelson Roy. I 
can assure the House that the Davie workers and their families 
were always at the centre of my main concerns when I was 
drafting this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank the management of all the shipyards I 
visited in Canada during the last two years for their co-operation. 
They helped me see that they were not competitors of Davie but 
partners fighting the same battle—to get the federal government 
to put together a real shipbuilding policy, a policy that would 
allow them to compete effectively with other shipbuilding yards 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to thank all MPs in the ridings concerned who paved 
the way for me to meet with the directors of these shipyards, as 
well as the 100 MPs who have supported my bill this far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have talked about a merchant marine policy for Canada for 
more than 50 years, and nothing has really been done to promote 
shipbuilding per se.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government did not address this in the last throne 
speech, today I will present three of the seven measures being 
called for jointly by the Shipbuilders' Association of Canada, 
which represents the owners of all the major shipyards in 
Canada; the Fédération de la métallurgie CSN; the Marine Workers 
Federation (CAW Canada), representing maritime workers 
primarily; and the Shipyard General Workers' Federation of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These demands are being supported by 160,000 people who have 
sent postcards to the Prime Minister of Canada, and to all 
provincial premiers who met in Quebec City on August 9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-213 is to promote shipbuilding in Canada 
and make Canadian shipyards more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First measure:  A loan and guarantee program: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) through the establishment of a program whereby a maximum of 
87.5% of the money borrowed by a company from financial 
institutions to purchase a commercial ship that will be built in 
a shipyard located in Canada 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) is guaranteed by the federal government in the event of 
default in the repayment of the loan, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) bears a rate of interest comparable to that available for 
loans from financial institutions to large and financially 
strong corporations, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) is repayable on terms comparable to those usually granted 
by financial institutions to large and financially strong 
corporations for the repayment of their loans; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure already exists in the United States, and is part of 
a specific program to promote shipbuilding, known as Title XI. 
Since 1993, the American government has approved financial 
guarantees totalling $2.9 billion U.S. under this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goal in this bill is to improve the loan guarantee program of 
the Export Development Corporation. Right now, this program is 
restricted to exportats only, and the maximum is 80%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But a loan guarantee program is needed because of the very high 
cost of ships and oil rigs and the long period of time required 
to build them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, the title XI program makes it possible for 
American shipyards to price their ships competitively on the 
international markets. It provides federal government guarantees 
for financing or refinancing requirements in the private sector 
for long term construction or reconstruction projects of ships 
under the American flag in American shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian program should extend to Canadian and foreign owned 
ships built in Canada, and it should include a Canadian 
government guarantee for private loans and set interest rates 
similar to those granted to big healthy corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ships eligible under the program could include commercial ships 
like passenger ships, bulk carriers, self unloaders, cargos, 
tankers, tugs, push tugs, barges, dredges, research ships, 
pollution abatement ships, oil and gas drilling rigs, and 
floating drydocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar loan guarantee program was recently launched in Nova 
Scotia, but it is limited to $85 million and is obviously 
restricted to the Halifax shipyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second measure provides for changes to tax rules relating to 
lease financing. Another provision in clause 3 provides: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) by amending the provisions of the Income Tax Act and the 
Income Tax regulations to improve the tax treatment of lease 
financing for the purchase of a ship built in a Canadian 
shipyard. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, this is aimed at exempting new ships built in a 
Canadian shipyard from the application of Revenue Canada 
regulations with regard to lease financing. Lease financing has 
become the preferred financing option for the purchase of 
capital equipment. In their current form, these regulations make 
ownership and lease financing not very attractive, even 
unprofitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual depreciation that Revenue Canada would normally allow 
as a deduction from taxable income in other circumstances is 
substantially reduced in the case of lease financing. Not only 
does this transfer the depreciation from the first to the last 
years of the useful life of the ship, but it also results in a 
decrease of real savings from the ownership and operation of a 
ship, which means an increase in the operating costs of Canadian 
ships.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By exempting ships built in Canadian shipyards from the 
application of regulations relating to lease financing, the 
existing depreciation rates for ships would apply without any 
restrictions, and the tax disadvantage which prevents ownership 
or lease financing of ships would be eliminated. This exemption 
would not eliminate any of the taxes applicable to ships and 
their owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an unprecedented initiative, because many assets are 
already exempt from regulations governing lease financing, such 
as furniture, office equipment, computers, electric appliances, 
televisions, radios, furnaces, air conditioners, railway cars, 
cars, vans, trucks and trailers. But not ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third measure concerns refundable tax credits: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>)—by amending the provisions of the Income tax Act and the 
Income Tax Regulations to allow a refundable tax credit for a 
portion of the costs relating to the construction or refit of a 
commercial ship in a shipyard located in Canada or the 
conversion of a ship in such a shipyard 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) to the shipowner for the construction of a Canadian ship, or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) to the shipyard owner for the construction of a foreign 
ship. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax credit is drawn from a Quebec government initiative 
implemented in the context of 1996-97 budget measures to support 
Quebec's shipbuilding and marine industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program could apply, without being limited thereto, to 
commercial ships, such as passenger ships, bulk containers, self 
unloaders and all those I named earlier.  It would not apply to 
fishing boats eligible for financial assistance under other 
federal or provincial ocean fishing development programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs that could be taken into consideration in calculating 
the tax credit would include the cost of plans and 
specifications and the salaries of employees involved in the 
construction of a ship. 
Total construction costs ought to be in keeping with market 
standards in relation to the planned ship.  A tax credit could 
be given that would be the equivalent of a maximum of 20% of 
construction costs of the first of a series, 15% of the second 
and third, and 10% for the fourth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This credit might be considered an extension of the R and D credits 
in effect in Canada, so as to reflect the unique nature of 
shipbuilding, where the very first units in a new construction 
or retrofit program involve very steep development costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contributing to these initial expenditures, the reimbursable 
credit could facilitate subsequent production, thus generating 
the economies of scale so essential to the prosperity of the 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax credit would be kept within the economic entity of the 
shipyard.  It could not be transferred to other divisions of the 
business owned by the shipyard owner, and would be paid only 
once construction of the ship or oil platform was finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make it clear that it is not just by chance that 
the other four initiatives called for by the key stakeholders in 
Canadian shipbuilding are not part of my bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, “elimination of the unilateral aspects of NAFTA 
which, while allowing the United States to sell new or used 
ships to Canada free of the 25% duty imposed on all other 
countries, totally blocks Canada's access to the American 
market” cannot be part of a bill.  It must be part of some 
bilateral negotiation opened up again with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my personal opinion that the federal government ought 
never to have accepted the 1989 exclusion of shipbuilding and 
shipping from NAFTA.  If these two areas were included from 
NAFTA, with the present exchange rate of our Canadian dollar, 
our shipyards would be overloaded with work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipyard owners and the shipyard unions are also calling for 
“an international social clause governing working conditions for 
shipbuilding”.  This ought to be included among the concerns of 
the Minister of International Trade at the World Trade 
Organization negotiations.  Hon. members must understand that I 
could not include this in my bill, because it involves the WTO 
and must be the object of multilateral negotiations first.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint publication by shipyard owners and unions also asked 
for the “promotion of Canadian resources” and “for investments 
in coastal infrastructures”. These views are simply meant to 
remind the Liberal government that Canada has the world's 
longest coastline and the largest inland waterway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, it would be important to preserve the 
existing Canadian shipyard infrastructure. Let me digress for a 
moment to point out Davie's useful role following the grounding 
of the Norwegian cruiser <I>Norwegian Sky</I>. That shipyard may also 
be called upon soon to repair the Maltese freighter <I>Alcor</I>, which 
is grounded not far from Île d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, shipyard managers and unions asked the federal 
government to hold a summit for industry stakeholders, to 
further discuss the issues affecting the Canadian shipbuilding 
industry and to develop a strategy covering all aspects of 
shipbuilding, so as to make that industry prosper again. I fully 
support that request for a summit which, incidentally, was a 
promise made by the Liberals in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also biases and myths that should be dispelled 
regarding the shipbuilding industry. The first myth is the high 
cost of manpower. Salaries paid by Canadian shipyards are lower 
than those paid anywhere in Europe. The hourly rate for manpower 
in the Canadian shipbuilding industry is 20% lower than in the 
United States, 50% lower than in Germany, and 40% lower than in 
Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only Korea and communist China pay salaries that are lower than 
those in Canada, but our manpower is far more qualified. The 
effectiveness of our manpower has increased by 25% since 1986. 
Not many countries can boast such an improvement. Collective 
agreements are more flexible than ever. This is not necessarily 
the way to look for improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that workers in the shipbuilding industry are well 
paid, but they also pay a lot of taxes. 
With the loss of 7,000 jobs in this sector, the federal and 
provincial governments in Canada have lost $70 million annually. 
If nothing is done, these losses could soon reach $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since each shipbuilding job lost eliminates at least two other 
jobs elsewhere, tax losses can be estimated at close to $200 
million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much have these job losses cost the EI and social assistance 
programs?  I have not been able to obtain official figures, but 
I can say that costs were at least $200 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another myth is that demand is low.  Many of the shipbuilding 
industry's detractors claim that the industry is in decline and 
that demand has dried up.  In fact, the opposite is true.  In 
the spring of 1999, there were 2,542 ships on order throughout 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the ships in circulation in the world are over 
20 years old.  Some of them are in very poor condition.  We saw 
this recently off the Île d'Orléans.  Others must be refurbished 
very soon.  As ecological concerns increase worldwide, more and 
more countries are requiring double hulls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent increase in oil prices will further favour shipping 
as a means of transportation and again point up the need for new 
oil drilling rigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With globalization of markets leading to increased exports, 
shipping can only benefit, because trains and trucks cannot 
cross oceans, and transportation of weight cargo by air is too 
expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear that a traditional industry is in decline. 
Another concept that must be challenged is the view of 
shipbuilding as traditional.  All eyes are on the new 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent visit to several American and other shipyards, 
including the largest shipyard in Taiwan, which is the fourth 
largest in the world, showed me that the largest Canadian 
shipyards have nothing to fear from any of them.  Our technology 
is equal to, if not better than, that of our competitors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our shipyards, such as Davie, are known worldwide for 
the quality of their engineering services; they produce 
three-dimensional plans. Computer-aided manufacturing is present 
nearly everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frigates manufactured in Canada are the best in the world. They 
are loaded with more computers than any airplane. So where is 
the problem? The problem is financial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are indicating to me that I have only two minutes left, Mr. 
Speaker, so I will have to go faster and improvise my 
conclusion. I could easily speak for two hours, but I have only 
20 minutes. The problem is financial, there is a lack of 
financial guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is also that many countries are still subsidizing 
shipyards to the tune of 9% in Europe, and 30% in Asia. In the 
meantime, the United States are hanging on to their 
protectionist measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is the good Liberal government doing meanwhile? It is 
watching the ships go by and is doing nothing. It is counting on 
the nature of things, on external pressures to make things 
happen in the area of shipbuilding. However, it is not with such 
a laissez-faire attitude that the situation will improve. While 
it has been ignoring the problem, the number of jobs has dropped 
from 12,000 when it came to power to 7,000, and it is still 
dropping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In St. John's, Lévis, Vancouver, everywhere, the situation is 
increasingly precarious. 
I urge the Liberal government, which, I know, will not dare 
support a bill introduced by a mere opposition member, to vote 
the way its party faithful asked it to do at the last national 
convention through a resolution asking for substantial action: a 
review of the situation and concrete measures. I urge the 
government to wake up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to be able to address private member's Bill C-213, 
an act to promote shipbuilding, brought forward by the hon. 
member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, and to hopefully shed 
some light on some of the innuendoes and the doom and gloom we 
have been hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The desire to see shipbuilding in Canada contribute to the 
national well-being is one that the government wholeheartedly 
shares.  This is why the government has designed a federal 
shipbuilding policy tailored to the industry as it exists in 
Canada today and is consistent with our approach to other 
industry sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind why the member has put forth his 
bill.  He is hoping to assist an industry located in his riding. 
I refer to MIL Davie.  As all members of the House, the hon. 
member has come to this place to defend the interest of his 
constituents and I commend him for that.  As elected 
representatives we all share this sense of obligation and must 
meet it with vigour by telling the full story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the member may wish to ask his constituents if they 
are aware of the federal government's contribution to MIL Davie. 
I suspect the member's party line dictates that he cannot discuss 
positive contributions offered by the Canadian government.  This 
would be a truth that his party would rather leave to others to 
raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me do so with pride.  Has the member informed his 
constituents that the Government of Canada already invested 
almost $1.6 billion in Davie industries between 1983 and 1996 in 
the form of contracts, contributions and loan guarantees? 
Probably not.  Has the member asked his constituents if they 
prefer more money thrown at the problem as he is proposing in his 
bill?  Probably not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even venture to say that the hon. member's own 
constituents would take a common sense approach and affirm that 
his bill is not the magic bullet for this specific industry. 
Rather, his constituents would likely prefer a tax cut or 
increased spending on various social programs.  In the wonderful 
world of the Bloc Quebecois everything is possible.  After all, 
it chooses not to govern, only to oppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now take a moment to reiterate the Government of Canada's 
policy.  My colleague, after asking the industry committee to 
meet on the subject of productivity and shipbuilding, essentially 
ignored the evidence presented by the witnesses and concluded 
that there is no government support for the shipbuilding and 
repair industry. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1900"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT102"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT102"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1900

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take it that this must have been nothing more than a partisan 
slip from my colleague who I am sure will eventually admit to his 
constituents that there is a federal shipbuilding policy made in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are essentially four elements to our government's 
shipbuilding policy carried out by the various government 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, thanks to Public Works and Government Services Canada, 
the acquisition of ships in Canada by the federal government is 
done on a competitive basis but is restricted to Canadian 
sources.  Let me point out that at present shipyards in Atlantic 
Canada employ almost 2,000 Canadians and, thanks to the federal 
government's made in Canada shipbuilding policy, these workers 
are now benefiting from over $8 billion to $9 billion in federal 
shipbuilding and repair national contracts tendered through the 
competitive bidding process in the past 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the finance policy allows for an accelerated capital 
cost allowance on new ships built in Canada.  It also allows 
purchasers to write off 100% of the entire cost of a ship over a 
mere four years.  If we bear in mind the fact that the average 
life of a ship is approximately 40 years, this is a very 
accelerated rate of depreciation.  It gives rise to a deferred 
tax item on the balance sheets of companies that exceeds the 15% 
declining balance rate afforded to foreign built vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, thanks to DFAIT, we have put in place a 25% tariff on all 
non-NAFTA foreign built ships of more than 100 tonnes that enter 
Canadian waters, with the exception of course of fishing vessels 
over 100 feet in length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, in response to the shipbuilding and repair industry's 
conditions, the government has spent $198 million on an 
industry-led rationalization process between 1986 and 1993.  This 
money was given directly to the industry for upgrading facilities 
and displaced workers adjustment programs because the industry 
itself, I point out, decided it was necessary to reduce its 
capacity so that the remaining shipyards could survive and 
continue to be competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is also supporting the shipbuilding and 
repair sector through a number of other key initiatives as well. 
For example, we have an attractive R and D environment driven in 
part by the scientific research and experimental development tax 
credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have financial assistance through risk sharing repayable 
funds through the enabling technologies element found in 
Technology Partnerships Canada.  This could likely be of help in 
fostering the development, application and diffusion of critical 
technologies with major impacts and benefits within and across 
industry sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government helps the shipbuilding and repair 
industry to compete internationally through the Canadian 
Commercial Corporation assistance and the Export Development 
Corporation export financing, which can support up to 80% of a 
purchase over a 12-year term at commercial market, and let me 
highlight its support, which has grown from $3.5 million in 1996 
to more than $130 million in 1999.  This is a perfect example of 
how the government is modernizing its policy to reflect changing 
needs.  Financing terms were expanded from eight to twelve years, 
and interest rates now match commercial rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peter Cairns, president of the Shipbuilding Association of 
Canada, called this “a very good initiative, beneficial to the 
whole industry nationwide”.  He called it a “significant step 
in the right direction in an area where Canada has a lot of 
expertise”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the hon. member opposite would ask the government to pile on 
top of these measures special treatment for the shipbuilding and 
repair industry in the form of more favourable loan guarantees 
and exemption from lease financing, measures that do not exist 
for any other industry in Canada and that are contrary to 
Canadian tax policy and our international trade obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the kind of tax credits the hon. member is asking 
for amount to what is in essence a subsidy.  Canada will not get 
into a subsidy war with its international competitors which, let 
me point out, it cannot possibly win. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to take a step back and provide the member with a 
worldwide view of this entire issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, when measured internationally, shipbuilding in 
Canada amounts to about four-tenths of one percent of global 
production.  This market is dominated by Japan and Korea which 
account for about 35% to 33%, respectively, of the world 
commercial shipbuilding.  When we add China to the mix, three top 
countries now control more than 75% of the world's production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Asian and Europeans are not standing still waiting 
for the rest of the world to catch up.  Consolidation, mergers 
and specialization continue with giants like HHI and Daewoo in 
Korea, and a Chinese industry that is rationalizing from 26 
companies down to two.  In the face of such extreme and 
unremitting pressure, brought about by predatory pricing, 
substantial global overcapacity and subsidies, many traditional 
firms, such as Norway's Kvaener, have elected to get out of the 
business of new construction altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of such evidence, one may be inclined to walk away 
from the table and ignore the difficulties being encountered by 
the men and women of the shipbuilding and repair industry. 
However, that would be too easy and, simply put, not the right 
thing to do.  The Bloc, the NDP and the Tories may disagree that 
the answer does not lie in topping up the subsidies that other 
countries are providing or in simply throwing in the towel, as 
the Reformers would like us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will do the right thing and continue our efforts 
in multilateral discussions to negotiate subsidies down.  As the 
Minister for International Trade has stated, we are committed to 
doing so and we are putting shipbuilding subsidies on the 
priority list of the upcoming negotiations in Seattle, 
Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we should be doing all we can, in an intelligent way, to 
foster shipbuilding and repair in Canada.  But, surely, this is a 
shared responsibility not to be undertaken solely by the federal 
government.  The provinces as well as the owners have a duty to 
respond to their workers.  Most of the provinces with 
shipbuilding and repair interests have provided support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to respond to Bill C-213, an act to promote 
shipbuilding in Canada.  The purpose of the bill is to make 
Canadian shipyards more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière in Quebec wants 
to establish a federal loan granting program that will cover up 
to 87.5% of money borrowed to purchase a commercial ship built in 
Canadian shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also provide a favourable and generous tax 
treatment of lease financing for the purchase of Canadian built 
ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill proposes a refundable tax credit for refitting 
commercial ships in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Canadian, I can commend the hon. member for the intent of 
the bill and what he is trying to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surrounded on three sides by water, one would think that Canada 
could have a viable, thriving and prosperous shipbuilding 
industry.  However, that is not the case.  There are so many who 
remember the great ships built on our east coast in particular, 
and the shipbuilding industry in Canada takes on a romantic 
notion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories make a great deal of noise lamenting the sad state of 
our shipbuilding industry.  In fact, they are to blame as much as 
the Liberal Party of Canada for the loss of this industry in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all Canadians know, the current Liberal government is 
maintaining a high and artificial level of taxation.  They are 
hurting our economy, our productivity and our growth with their 
high taxes.  They are hurting our consumers, and they are 
discouraging foreign investors from coming to Canada.  They have 
caused a brain drain that threatens the future of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this past weekend, the International Monetary Fund 
recommended that the Liberals abandon their policy of delegating 
50% of the budgetary surplus to new spending because something 
has to be done about the high level of taxes that are killing 
jobs, our economy and our industry in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our employment levels are too low.  With our vast resources and 
our ability to create wealth with other nations in the global 
economy, we should be doing a lot better.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House, we appreciate the initiative shown by 
the member in bringing forward Bill C-213.  He is trying to find 
solutions to the government's mismanagement and its effect on our 
shipbuilding industry.  Regrettably, he is using the wrong 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Loans, grants and incentives will not accomplish what low taxes 
across the board would accomplish.  Would the member go sector by 
sector, industry by industry, company by company offering tax 
breaks, granting loans and other things? That is what the 
Liberals do.  They give away government contracts and 
opportunities to those who contribute to the Liberal Party.  A 
hotel can be saved from bankruptcy if enough money has been 
given, and CIDA contracts will be awarded.  We know this is a 
long story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower taxes would help all sectors of our economy.  If the 
government lowered taxes, that would help our industries. Lower 
taxes would help all companies across the country. High taxes 
caused the problems.  Lower taxes would solve much of the damage 
that has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition policy calls for private sector 
self-reliance without the federal government providing tax 
dollars to support any specific sector. Why would the hon. member 
single out shipbuilding?  There are so many other sectors to be 
propped up with tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the shipbuilding industry in Canada.  With only .04%, 
that is 1/25th of a percentage point, of the world's 
shipbuilding production, it is time to admit that Canada does not 
currently have the right environment to sustain a shipbuilding 
industry.  Rather than try to match the subsidies and other 
incentives offered by other countries, we should concentrate our 
efforts on negotiating down unfair export subsidies.  Far from 
guaranteeing loans to Canadians who purchase Canadian built 
ships, we should drop the 25% tariff we have on non-NAFTA ship 
imports so that all Canadian shipowners are not penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada can tell us about the problems in the 
shipbuilding industry.  It is a declining industry, a dead in the 
water industry.  There is an overcapacity in the world of over 
40%. Canada is not even in the ballpark.  We have 25% duties 
against imports of ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Liberals and Tories have done to the shipbuilding 
industry in Canada is a study on what not to do in terms of 
productivity.  Yet the industry department continues to have a 
shipbuilding policy which has technology partnership grants, 
research and development grants, and the Export Development 
Corporation supporting it.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology partnerships Canada program is available to a 
number of firms to do research and development if they so wish. 
It is repayable based on success.  It is a risk sharing, reward 
sharing program.  No one should use this program for 
shipbuilding.  There would be no way to pay back the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the world shipbuilding industry. The industry has 
moved away from North American markets and European markets to 
southeast Asian markets.  Japan and South Korea continue to 
control over two-thirds of the total international market for 
shipbuilding and ship repair.  China is emerging as a rival. 
Combined, these three countries control over 75% of the world 
market.  Due to extreme pressure from Asian shipbuilders, many 
traditional shipbuilders, including the Norwegian company 
Kvaerner, have chosen to get out of the industry altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada cannot build major ships, only minor and smaller vessels. 
Both of these markets are already operating at over 40% of their 
capacity.  Demand and prices are already weak and are forecast to 
continue to decline.  Prices for 1999 are down by 6% to 24% from 
last year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international market is experiencing a significant 
downsizing.  Since 1976 the number of shipyards in the world has 
dropped by half and direct employment has significantly declined 
to about one-third of what it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do those things that we can do well.  We can reduce 
duties in a multilateral forae, and we will be going into the WTO 
round in Seattle.  If we will be dealing with duties, then I hope 
we will deal with this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All tariffs will probably be on the table for discussion and I 
would expect, depending on what we can get in return, that we may 
be able to drop the 25% duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Market conditions for shipbuilders are not about to change. 
Maybe we would be better off in Canada helping our ship buyers by 
reducing the 25% duty.  Maybe the ship purchasers in Canada could 
help generate employment, creating jobs and developing the 
business.  Protecting shipbuilders did not help in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total employment in Canada's shipbuilding and ship repair 
industry as of May 1999 was about 4,950.  The rationalization of 
this sector of our economy took place between 1986 and 1994 and 
resulted in a loss of over 7,000 jobs.  The loss of those jobs 
cost the federal government $198 million.  That is a lot of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has already assisted in helping the 
industry phase down through $200 million in adjustment payments. 
That experiment, as usual, has proven to be a dismal failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not turn to taxpayers and make them pay for a 
shipbuilding industry in Canada that will never be viable.  Let 
us not hinder the choices of the firms in Canada that want to buy 
ships or force a duty on them if they do not buy a Canadian ship 
because we wish to have a shipbuilding industry.  It is the 
government's fault that this industry and others are not thriving 
in Canada.  In fact, it is hindering us with high taxes, 
preventing prosperity.  We support de-politicizing economic 
decision making by eliminating grants, guarantees and subsidies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak today to Bill C-213, a bill which I support 
because of my party's longstanding support for the creation of a 
national shipbuilding policy for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank members of the Marine Workers Federation who came here 
en masse last spring, from coast to coast to coast, to present 
100,000 cards demanding that the government implement a national 
shipbuilding policy.  I am glad to see many of them here tonight 
for this important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need a shipbuilding policy?  It seems so obvious to 
many of us, but it cannot be reiterated enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to this place from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, a community 
which sits on the shores of one of the finest working harbours in 
the world.  Shipping is part of the economic lifeblood of my 
community.  It is part of our history, culture and who we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my home I can see crews working on ships on the shores of 
Dartmouth Cove.  They are blasting the hulls or repairing and 
refitting the superstructures.  Across the harbour I can see the 
naval dry docks where our navy is being fit with the latest 
technology, and as I cross the bridges I see the huge Halifax 
shipyards, major employers in my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are jobs in a vibrant and necessary industry.  I see this 
from my home, I hear it from constituents, and I know it from the 
things I am told by the workers in the industry.  However, I am 
troubled by the fact that the government has a different view of 
the industry.  It sees the industry as one which is on the way 
out, a sunset industry.  That is why it is letting the industry 
die.  It sees this industry and the workers involved, and the 
communities which rely on shipbuilding, as being expendable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That approach is reflected in the government's indifference to a 
shipbuilding policy.  It is astounding to me that the 
indifference exists, given the fact that such voices as Buzz 
Hargrove, J.D. Irving and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce are 
now all singing from the same song book about the need for a 
shipbuilding policy.  But indifference is what we have seen from 
the government, or at best mixed messages.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party has a long but not very proud tradition of 
saying one thing in opposition and doing another when in 
government.  The Prime Minister was firmly in favour of a 
national shipbuilding policy when in opposition.  At that time it 
was the Conservatives in government who were dragging their 
heels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election of 1997 the Liberals trotted out kind words 
about shipbuilding, but when my colleague for Halifax West raised 
issues surrounding shipbuilding with the Minister of Industry 
after the election, his position was against the shipbuilding 
policy.  He admitted that his biggest worry was spending any 
money to support the industry.  Why?  Because this could see 
Canada participating in a subsidy war.  Once again we saw our 
government abandoning our industry to avoid potential trade 
irritants with our powerful neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We clearly heard that the government's policy was to allow our 
shipbuilders to disappear, while other countries like the United 
States were prepared to protect theirs.  The difference seems to 
be that other countries understand the importance of having a 
cutting edge shipbuilding industry.  Contrary to our government's 
view that shipbuilding is a sunset industry, other countries 
understand that shipbuilding is using the most up to date 
technologies in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other jurisdictions are not content to rely on the third world 
for their transport needs as a matter of policy either. 
Unfortunately, that is the case in Canada.  Halifax harbour 
rarely sees a Canadian built ship with a Canadian crew.  We 
instead see ships like the Maersk Dubai.  These are common 
vessels in our waters, ships with no labour standards and 
questionable safety and environmental practices.  It is shameful 
that this is the policy of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very recently we have seen new developments in the Liberal 
government's waffling on its shipbuilding policy.  We have heard 
the government leader in the Senate, a newcomer in cabinet but a 
Liberal hack of the oldest order, say that he wants a 
shipbuilding policy that not only supports the current shipyards, 
but which can compete for foreign and domestic business. However, 
across the cabinet table the Minister of Transport is delivering 
yet another slap to the face of Canadian shipbuilders.  He has 
chosen to abandon any pretence of having a Canadian first 
procurement policy.  An example is that the Minister of Transport 
has gone offshore to buy the much needed ferry for Newfoundland 
to Labrador, while the St. John's shipyard is currently idle. 
Why is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the solution to the problem is obvious. 
Build the ships here.  Create the jobs here.  Keep the skills 
here.  Support the communities here.  Develop the economy here. 
Instead, we see the Minister of Transport going offshore to get 
the ferry.  How can we trust anything the government is saying 
when it behaves like this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this bill, not because it is perfect, but because it 
moves in the right direction.  It recognizes that we need public 
investment, using all public policy tools, such as government 
loan guarantees and tax credits to support a national 
shipbuilding policy.  That is why I support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as a country we need to go further than this bill.  We 
need to look at shipbuilding as part of a larger shipping policy. 
Our policy toward shipbuilding should not just create employment, 
it should set some terms on that employment.  We have to 
establish some environmental terms for that employment. 
Shipbuilding and refitting can be a dirty job.  It involves a lot 
of heavy industrial activity.  Many of my constituents have 
expressed concerns about the environmental problems related to 
activities such as blasting hulls and the use of chemical 
solvents in refitting ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of our workers and the sake of residents who live 
near shipyards, we need to have more comprehensive environmental 
controls and protections for these worksites.  They should be 
regulated and the regulations should be enforced.  We need to 
have fair labour standards in the shipbuilding sector which 
encourage the democratization of the workplace and better 
treatment for labour organizations.  We need basic social rights 
to be protected by shipbuilders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be looking beyond this bill to having a national 
policy that requires international shipbuilders to live with 
acceptable social, environmental and labour standards if they 
want to use their products in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to change our overall shipping policies to allow 
the enforcement of health, safety and environmental standards on 
all ships which ply Canadian waters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to use a national shipbuilding policy to encourage other 
industries to add value to our raw resources and not just ship 
out the raw goods.  I believe we must re-approach our dealings 
with out trading partners and reject subservient relations with 
other countries, such as we get from NAFTA and the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support the bill, I will remind the House that the root 
of our problems in many sectors, such as shipbuilding, comes from 
our decreased ability to use subsidies and tax incentives to 
promote domestic economic development.  These restrictions are a 
result of trade agreements put in place by both Tory and Liberal 
governments which restrict our ability to have a national policy 
in areas like shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a national shipbuilding policy:  Dartmouth and Halifax, 
Nova Scotia; Marystown, Newfoundland; Saint John, New Brunswick; 
and Lévis, Quebec need it.  Canada needs the thousands of 
family-supporting jobs that a vital shipbuilding industry will 
create.  I hope the government will finally commit to action on a 
national shipbuilding policy for the sake of all of those 
communities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague from Lévis for his bill.  I am so pleased to be 
able to get up and support his bill and his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard some comments about how the Conservative Party, when it 
was in power, did not do things for the shipbuilding industry. 
Let me tell the members that the Conservative Party gave the 
single largest contract in the history of Canada to Quebec and, 
yes, indeed, to Saint John, New Brunswick, my shipyard.  It 
injected billions and billions of dollars into the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sit in the House of Commons week after week.  I got up in the 
last session 27 times to ask the Minister of Industry to bring in 
a national shipbuilding policy to make us equals and competitive. 
All we ever heard was “We have a national shipbuilding policy 
right now”.  Well, we cannot compete with the national 
shipbuilding policy that the the Minister of Industry says we 
have.  He should take a look around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour of the International Monetary Fund helping those 
countries that are poor and having a difficult time.  However, 
right now money from the International Monetary Fund is going 
into Korea and Japan to help subsidize shipbuilding.  Here we are 
and we cannot subsidize our shipyards.  “No, no, we cannot do 
that”, says the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back on October 29, 1990, Mr. Holloway, the secretary treasurer 
of the Marine Workers' Federation, wrote to the now Prime 
Minister of Canada, when he was seated on the other side in the 
opposition, asking about the state of shipbuilding in Canada. 
The the present Prime Minister replied by saying that while the 
Conservative government may indeed have recognized that there was 
a problem, because things were winding down in the shipbuilding 
industry, that it had done absolutely nothing to foster the 
development of a Canadian merchant marine.  He said that it was 
safe to say that most people recognized that something needed to 
be done to create a much more competitive shipbuilding industry, 
and that the government should have, as it should have done long 
ago and as it had promised to do, taken steps to alleviate this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was what the Prime Minister said when he was in opposition. 
Well, he is in government now and he says that there is no 
problem whatsoever to bring it in.  The government has the power 
to bring it in, but where is it?  It has not done anything.  The 
silence from Ottawa is deafening as other jurisdictions continue 
to announce further support for shipbuilding in their countries. 
Why are we not seeing the same level of competence and 
responsiveness from our government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry talks about high technology. 
Shipbuilding is high technology, very high technology.  We used 
to have thousands and thousands of people working in the 
shipbuilding industry.  For every job that was created in the 
shipbuilding industry, there were two or three other jobs in the 
community that were created as well. 
When I am talking about shipbuilding I am talking about a 
national policy that goes right from Newfoundland to British 
Columbia.  It is not just two shipyards.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what happened recently.  The United States came 
in and wanted to buy MIL Davie because it wanted to take over. 
There is no question United States has invested.  We know that 
and we are worried about it because the United States has the 
Jones Act and the Jones Act protects the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States can do all kinds of things, but we cannot go 
into the United States and bid on its tenders.  We cannot go in 
and do what Americans can do in Canada.  They can come here and 
bid on our shipyards.  They can bid on our contracts.  They can 
do everything because they have protection.  We cannot because we 
do not have that protection in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we not seeing the same level of confidence and 
responsiveness from our own government?  We want to know why we 
are not.  Highlights of the shipbuilding industry supported by 
other jurisdictions in the last two to three weeks include the 
week of November 10 when the United Kingdom announced new support 
for ship repair whereby two and a quarter of the value of the 
repair is given as a subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Norway has increased its subsidy from 7% to 9%.  Norway has also 
stated its intention to provide a special new subsidy to support 
the building of fishing vessels. Germany has reintroduced 
subsidies to the level of 9%.  Of the 68 shipbuilding nations on 
the planet today, 67 of them have national shipbuilding policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Except us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Yes, except us.  The old OECD agreement 
was entered into by this country.  All countries that built ships 
entered into it many years ago.  The only country adhering to it 
is which one?  Canada.  We are the only country adhering to it. 
That is why we cannot compete.  None of the others are adhering 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we hear that the Liberals will be going to the WTO meetings 
down in Seattle and that this will be a priority.  We have heard 
all that rhetoric before.  They do not have to go to the WTO. 
They can come in here this week and bring in a national 
shipbuilding policy.  There is absolutely no reason in the world 
for our men and our women who built frigates, which are the best 
ships to be found anywhere in the world, to have to wait until 
they go to the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>European countries are so concerned right now with what has been 
happening with the dollars from the IMF supporting Asian 
shipyards that they have initiated a court action against the 
Daewoo shipyard.  This Korean shipyard is over $350 million in 
the red, continues to take orders and build ships below cost and, 
we have been told, allegedly uses some IMF money which includes 
Canadian tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a shipbuilding policy with provisions for an improved 
export financing and loan guarantee program similar to the title 
11 program in the United States. Yes, it took over our sugar 
refinery.  It is taking over our shipbuilding.  It is taking over 
everything, and we are sitting back and letting it happen here in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be an exclusion of the newly constructed ships 
built in Canadian shipyards from the present Revenue Canada 
leasing regulations, provisions for a refundable tax credit to 
Canadian shipowners or shipbuilders that contract to build a ship 
or contract for conversions with change of mission, mid-life 
refit or major refit in Canadian shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to say that there should be an elimination of the one 
sided aspect of NAFTA which allows the U.S. to sell new or used 
ships duty free in Canada yet absolutely prohibits Canadian 
access to the U.S. market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our newly appointed industry minister in 1993 was given a gloomy 
report from Ernst & Young on the future of shipbuilding in 
Canada.  The report entitled “International Competitiveness of 
the Canadian Shipbuilding Industry” was commissioned by the 
previous Tory government and concluded that the industry was in 
very serious trouble.  That was 1993, and this minister and this 
Liberal government have done nothing to make Canadian 
shipbuilding competitive with the international shipbuilding 
sector in countries that subsidize their shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That 119 page report stated that if the government did nothing 
to help the industry become more competitive, an estimated 15,000 
jobs would be lost by the turn of the century.  We only have a 
month to go. 
I beg my colleagues over there to take a serious look at what is 
happening.  There are about 25,000 people, some of whom are on 
welfare and some of whom had to go to the United States to find 
work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>People have come up from Louisiana to Saint John, New Brunswick, 
to interview our shipyard workers and said they were the best 
trained people they have ever interviewed.  They offered them 
jobs down in the United States.  We have the most modern 
shipyards in Quebec, back home in Saint John, New Brunswick, in 
Newfoundland and right through to Vancouver, and what happens? We 
have a government that does not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead tonight like never before for the government to put our 
people back to work.  Let them have their dignity.  Let them feed 
their families.  They do not want to be on welfare.  They do not 
want to be on unemployment.  We can do that by working together 
and getting a national shipbuilding policy which makes us 
competitive.
