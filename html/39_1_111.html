      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce an act to amend the Holidays Act. This private member's bill seeks to declare February 15, Flag Day, a national statutory holiday.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should be celebrating the birthday of Canada's first very own flag that was first flown over Parliament Hill on February 15, 1965. What better way to celebrate than to declare Flag Day a national statutory holiday. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February is one of the few months of the year that does not have a national statutory holiday, something I hope to change with my Flag Day bill. Canada does not have a single day off between New Year's Day and Easter. Many comparable industrialized nations enjoy more holidays year than we do. Hard-working Canadians need a mid-winter break. I think it is time we celebrated this special day with a national holiday.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill is a very short bill. It simply would provide an exemption from the GST for natural health products, as defined in the regulations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just note that a survey from March 2005 indicated that 71% of Canadians have used NHPs, 77% of Canadians believe NHPs can be used to promote health and 58% believe they can even be used to treat illness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would simply help people who are promoting their own health by taking vitamins and using nutritional products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the new food guide includes a recommendation of vitamin D to help with bone metabolism and calcium absorption. Vitamin D will even help in the mitigation of multiple sclerosis. Folic acid is well-known for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. A simple supplement like chromium can help with blood sugar metabolism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would help Canadians, who are investing in their own health, to accomplish that objective and would probably help the government accomplish its objective of reducing wait times because people who are healthy will not be in the wait lines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all members will find this an interesting bill and support this project to help all Canadians live a healthier life.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Speaker, the Privy Council Office has contacted all departments and agencies to ascertain whether they have the electronic capacity to search for and sort financial information such as funds, grants, loans and loan guarantees by federal electoral riding.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then he cut the court challenges program, the very program that funded a number of important cases that sought to advance equality rights. Abolishing this program is a serious step that directly reduces Canadians' ability to defend their charter rights.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything we have heard from that side of the House has been one long excuse about why the Conservatives cannot do anything. They have been in office for a year.

That is the charitable way to put it, because I was in this place when specific promises were made to Canadians that the government would create actual child care spaces. Unless I have missed something, my fellow members, I see no child care spaces at all delivered by the government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a matter affecting all Canadians, the government’s plan is to ensure that our judiciary becomes ideological, that is, that the judiciary share this government’s ideology. I am not alone in saying this; all the members of the Liberal caucus and all the country’s legal experts, the Quebec Bar and the Canadian Bar Association say so, too.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He clearly stated the reason why he changed the composition of the selection committees created for the first time in 1988, under the leadership of the Right Hon.

What was the composition prior? There were seven members. One member came from the judiciary, three members came from the legal profession, and three members from the community at large appointed by the government. Each of the seven members had a right to vote. The government has now removed the right to vote from the judge who chairs the committee, added on a fourth so-called member from the community, and in so doing ensured that its appointees have the majority vote on the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was not sufficient. Under the previous system for the selection of judges, the JACs, as I have heard the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> refer to them, the judicial advisory committees, were required to evaluate potential candidates and to actually label them as highly recommended, recommended, or not recommended. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, I guess, is so afraid that it does not have enough individuals who share its ideological bent who would meet the designation of highly recommended that it has now wiped out those designations and now it is a pass or fail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is clearly unconscionable. This is what we call lowering the bar. Our judiciary is heralded throughout the world for its excellence, independence and impartiality. By removing the designations, highly recommended, recommended and not recommended, the Conservative government is ensuring that Canadians will no longer have the guarantee that those appointed to our judiciary are highly recommended. They will not know if a person received one point above the passing grade. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are parents today who are arguing with their provincial governments in an attempt to change the evaluation and the school marks system of pass or fail because they have no way of judging exactly how well their children are doing. This is happening in Quebec now. Now we are seeing this neo-conservative government lowering the bar. But that is not all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Etobicoke--Lakeshore made the point that the Conservative government is not willing and not interested in governing for all Canadians. It is only interested in governing for those who share its own ideological bent. What better way than to look at what the government has done with programs, plans and agreements that the previous Liberal government had negotiated and signed following widespread consultation, whether it be the Kelowna accord or the early learning and child care agreements with 10 provinces and two of the territorial governments. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just on that last issue, the government said by scrapping those agreements and by instituting in place of those agreements $100 a month per child under the age of six, which would amount to $1,200 a year, this would provide choice to families who choose to have one of the parents stay at home, and choice to those families who decide to have only one of the parents work full time and the other one possibly work part time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as is the case, and the Conservative government has shown it over and over again, it did not tell all of the truth. It did not tell all of the facts to Canadians. That $100 a month, or a total of $1,200 a year, is taxable. The Conservatives neglected to put that in big bold print in those ads they took out in major national newspapers. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked about $100 a month per child, and we had to go down to the bottom of the page and in minuscule letters we had to use a magnifying glass in order to determine that it was taxable. Guess who is going to have to give back the most? It is the poorest families, not the richest families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask members, how more ideologically bent can a government get than to design a program that is in fact not to help families have real choice? If we want families to have real choice, then we ensure that families have access to early learning, for instance in play groups. For those individuals who are private providers who wish to upgrade their skills, we ensure that when they are taking care of children in their homes or in the children's homes, they have the proper training and skills. Whether it is just to babysit a couple of hours or not, the spaces must be there. They must be created and that has not been the case.</div>

    </p><a name="Para429890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is just on the judicial process. As far as Kyoto, the Liberals did not follow any of it and we are 35% below the levels that we should be. It is this government that created child care spaces. They created none. As far as aboriginals, it is this government that has provided a $3.7 billion increase over two years, more than four Liberal budgets altogether, and as far as an assault on the farmers being undemocratic, it is the former government that put farmers in jail related to the Wheat Board.</div>

It allows me to straighten out the facts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that it was a Conservative government that abolished and scrapped all of the early learning and child care agreements signed with the provinces. Is that not interesting?</div>
    </p><a name="Para429895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would assume that members from Saskatchewan in the Conservative Party who are sitting in the House would have been protesting their own government because that meant cancelling the full universal pre-school program for all four-year-olds in the province of Saskatchewan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program was there. The money was there. The spaces were going to open in September 2006. It was because the Conservative government scrapped the agreement with Saskatchewan that those spaces did not materialize.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about Alberta. We want to talk about choices for families. Yes, there are families that choose, if there are two parents, one parent chooses to stay at home. Many of those families and parents also wish their children, notwithstanding that one of the primary caregivers is at home, have access to early learning. Early learning is given at community centres, for instance. If the mom wishes and if she is the parent at home, she can get instruction, and share with other parents her experiences and benefits from it. The children are provided with early learning development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alberta was focusing primarily on training. Why? It was because almost 80% of early learning and child care is done in the private sector. Guess what? The operators who provide that early learning and child care in the private sector were welcomed. The Liberal government's agreement with the Government of Alberta would have meant that the operators of schools would have access to funds in order to be able to go back to school and receive training. Then they could qualify themselves as regulated child care space operators. There would be the understanding, yes, that parents have much more confidence in a place that knows public health requirements and such things like exercise, nutrition and the training of those workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there was no typo and is no typo in the official opposition's motion. It is that Conservative government that destroyed Kelowna, that destroyed the early learning and child care agreements, and that is destroying the independence and impartiality of our judicial system. The next thing is the Conservatives will have elected judges. Would that not be a nice sight?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new approach has been based upon four elements, but only one goal, and that is real tangible improvement in the lives of aboriginal Canadians provide motivation and structure to what we are doing.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para429908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have discussed this approach several times before the House. First of all, we are in the process of investing immediately in the urgent problems that are undermining the quality of life, such as unsafe water and inadequate housing. Next, we will also be introducing legal frameworks to promote programs for responsible, transparent governance. Furthermore, we are entering into agreements with aboriginal groups in order to resolve grievances and promote good governance.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para429909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that this approach has been resourced by Parliament in last year's budget, and I will detail the disposition of this funding for the benefit of the House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget, which presented to Parliament last year, allocated $3.7 billion for aboriginal and northern programs, including $3.2 billion alone for aboriginal investments. It includes funds for initiatives and priorities that are essential for healthy and sustainable aboriginal communities. I refer to areas such as housing, water and education. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, a $400 million fund was set aside for northern and off reserve housing. Today houses are being constructed in Nunavut, for example, as a result of this. We see real improvements for the quality of life for aboriginal peoples. Much work is left to be done, but we have made progress.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move to specifics, the budget committed a full $450 million to investments that will have an immediate and positive impact on the lives of Canadian aboriginal peoples. The money will be allocated to investments to improve water, housing on reserve, education and supports for aboriginal women, children and families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement for safe drinking water and adequate affordable housing I think is self-evident to all Canadians. However, the government also recognizes that it is through education and training that aboriginal people, youth in particular, can live prosperous lives either on or off reserve. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, it is through an educated and employed population that healthy, stable communities are developed and sustained, and women play an integral part in the strength of the cohesiveness of the family and the health of the community. I think all fair commentators would observe that the government's agenda with respect to aboriginal women has been one that is noteworthy and very positive.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para429915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, as much as $300 million has been allocated to housing improvements for aboriginals living in off-reserve communities.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para429916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to another $300 million will go toward affordable housing in the three territories, $200 million of which will go to Nunavut where the need is greatest and $50 million each to the Yukon and to the Northwest Territories. Earlier I had referenced $400 million. It is $300 million in northern housing and off reserve housing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say this funding will address the needs of and will be of benefit to both aboriginal and non-aboriginal northerners. There is more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional $500 million will be devoted to community development, including that of aboriginal communities for the north, with which my colleague across the way is well familiar. These are the first nations that are affected by the Mackenzie gas project, the Inuvialuit, the Deh Cho, the Sahtu and the Gwich’in. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this funding is to support regional projects that will help alleviate socio-economic impacts on communities affected by the planning, the construction and the operation of this pipeline, which is so essential to our country's future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These budgetary commitments speak to the determination of the government to address the needs of first nations, Inuit and Métis in Canada and to support them in the building of a healthy and prosperous future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we also recognize, in terms of the way forward, that we also have to acknowledge the past. To that end, one of the first things we were able to achieve as a government was to negotiate a residential schools settlement agreement and to devote $2.2 billion to provide financial recognition of the often negative impact of the residential school experience. This will be buttressed by support programs to help former students, their families and their communities and to build a better future for themselves. The Aboriginal Healing Foundation is an important part of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to add, with reference to aboriginal languages, that Canada's new government is committed to delivering real results for the preservation of aboriginal languages. We believe that language is a vital component of first nation, Inuit and Métis identity and an important part of Canada's heritage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize that although the previous government had designated $160 million over 10 years ostensibly to support aboriginal languages, implementation of that fiscal framework was never completed and none of those funds were ever accessed by aboriginal communities, not one cent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, this government recognizes that aboriginal languages need stable funding so they can be protected and preserved. Therefore, we are providing long term funding of $5 million per year for the aboriginal languages initiative, to which the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78766,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78766&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Status of Women</A> has spoken. This supports the preservation, the revitalization and the promotion of aboriginal languages. We are committed to develop a long term plan for the support and the maintenance of aboriginal languages. The Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Status of Women and her colleagues in the aboriginal community will develop a new and better approach that meets the needs of our aboriginal people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government has not cut spending aimed at aboriginal peoples.

    </p><a name="Para429929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be clear about this. The issue of the $3.7 billion includes the residential schools agreement, which was negotiated by the previous government and ratified by the Conservative government.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister speaks with great enthusiasm about his efforts to remedy the wrongs for aboriginal women.

    </p><a name="Para429934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very interesting to see the attempt on the part of the former government to claim credit for the residential school agreement. That agreement was finalized, following extensive negotiations among myself, the National Chief of the AFN and respected members of the former judiciary. I recall being there. It was an agreement that this government resolved. To the extent that the former government wishes to take credit for it, that should provoke incredulity, about which my friend has spoken.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us come to really what the government has faced and the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No budget cuts have been directed by the Conservative government toward aboriginal Canadians. None whatsoever. There was a very substantial budgetary increase of $3.7 billion. My friend says that $2.2 billion relates to the residential school agreement. Fair enough, but it is part of the budgetary allocation of the Government of Canada and it is more than the previous government did in the four budgets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the previous government specialized in, with respect to the dire circumstances of aboriginal people, were empty promises, rhetoric, no delivery. That is the case whether we look at housing, or water, or the circumstances of women on reserve or the rights of women. Year after year of defalcation, the Liberals failed to deliver to aboriginal people. That is why we have the circumstance in our country, which I, as minister, and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Prime Minister</A> are trying to address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to women's rights, I implore my friend to get on board, to help in terms of the building of the Native Women's Association of Canada, ensuring they have proper funding, in terms of repealing section 67. She says that there has been no consultation. This has been under discussion in Canada for 31 years. Now, that might not be enough consultation for the Liberals, but it is quite enough for this Conservative government to move forward. There will be further consultation at committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matrimonial property is another case. This has gone on for over 20 years. The previous government allowed it to continue. We are dealing with the issue.</div>

    </p><a name="Para429941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Canadians have seen our Conservative Party ads that are on across Canada. They talk about the fact the new choice for Liberal leader is in fact not a leader at all, and I think the chaotic nature of this motion will probably demonstrate that to Canadians. The motion is all over the place. It includes about half a dozen different things and I think demonstrates again how hard it is for the leader to set priorities. He does not seem to be able to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even on the issue I am going to talk about today, I think he has demonstrated that he cannot focus on what he said he would do. He promised before the new year that the Liberals were going to be asking a question on the Canadian Wheat Board every day. I think we have had about two of them since we have come back. Obviously someone decided they were going to tack the Canadian Wheat Board onto the end of this motion, but we in the Conservative Party have a far greater commitment to agriculture than that. I want to talk about that this morning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about grain marketing. On this side of the House, we believe that western Canadian grain farmers should have the freedom to choose how they market their grain, with the Canadian Wheat Board as one of the options in the marketing of that grain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79002,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79002&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</A> last fall announced that we would hold a plebiscite on the marketing of barley. That plebiscite is now under way and, let me ask members, how much more democratic could the process be than what we have put in place? Not only are we consulting those who are most affected by not having marketing choice, but we are giving them clear options to choose from.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to talk about the options that western Canadian farmers are being presented with in the plebiscite that we are setting forth now. The minister made a commitment that the plebiscite would be based on a very clear question. He listened to people's suggestions on what that question should be. Many producer organizations, members of Parliament from both sides of the House, provincial and local leaders and individual farmers were able to offer their views on what should be the content of the plebiscite questions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After consideration, the government decided that producers would be asked to select one of the following three options. The first option on the ballot will be: “The Canadian Wheat Board should retain the single desk for the marketing of barley into domestic human consumption and export markets”. It is fairly straightforward. The second will be: “I would like the option to market my barley to the Canadian Wheat Board or any other domestic or foreign buyer”. That is straightforward as well. The third will be: “The Canadian Wheat Board should not have a role in the marketing of barley”. They are three very clear questions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who say that western Canadian farmers are not capable of understanding those three questions. Of course, we are not the people who say that. We believe that our farmers are intelligent people and good business people. They can look at those three questions and know clearly what they are saying and what they are about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three options are clear. They are simple and to the point. Farmers are more than capable of expressing their preference for the option of their choice. For the farmers who want to maintain the monopoly, the question is there. For those who want to see the Canadian Wheat Board out of the picture, the question is there. For those who want the option to use the board when they want to market directly nationally or internationally, that option is there as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about voter eligibility, because it is something people need to understand. The minister has said repeatedly that the plebiscite would be based on a broad base of voters. Each farm operation, whether a single producer, partnership or corporation, will be eligible for one vote as long as it has produced grain during the last year and has produced barley in at least one of the last five years between 2002 and 2006 inclusive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This attempt was to make sure that we are dealing with actual farmers, with people who are currently farming and who have grown barley in the last five years. If producers sold barley to a feedlot, produced it for use on their own farm, or sold it to the Wheat Board, they are eligible to vote. Active farmers who intended to produce in 2006 but were unable to do so, for some reason beyond their control, will still have the opportunity to obtain a ballot by contacting the election coordinator at the website: 2007barleyvote@kpmg.ca. They have until March 2 to arrange to get that package.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those packages were mailed out February 7. The voting will continue until March 14. We are actively and positively encouraging barley producers to participate in the plebiscite to make sure their voices are heard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear about the government's intentions with the Canadian Wheat Board, because there have been some misconceptions about it. We believe it should be there as a marketing option for producers. We believe it should remain in place and continue to market on behalf of those who want to sell their grain through the board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commitment to the barley and wheat producers of western Canada has been to give them the opportunity to seek out the best possible return for their product, and to give growers the chance to succeed and the freedom to make their own choices on how to produce and market their crops, whether that is through the Wheat Board or some other mechanism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get there, we need to meet the producers' needs, maximize their returns, maximize their choices and give them the options they deserve. That is what the barley plebiscite is all about.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite a contrast to what we have seen in the past in the way that the Liberals dealt with western Canadian farmers when they wanted some changes to the system. I would like to take a few minutes this morning to tell members what happened when farmers in western Canada attempted to get some choice.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78924,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78924&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wascana</A> has been involved in this issue for a long time. He was actually a minister at the time when five departments and agencies coordinated in an attempt to squelch and just basically squash the position of western Canadian farmers. Farmers were being faced with the possibility of having to deal with multiple government agencies at once. There were RCMP raids in the middle of the night on farmers' homes. I know of one story of a couple who had come home from the hospital when the RCMP raided their home in the middle of the night trying to confiscate their equipment. It was a terrible time for western Canadian farmers. Agencies such as the RCMP, customs, justice, Revenue Canada, and the Canadian Wheat Board all ganged up on individual farmers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was interesting was that farmers had enough guts to push back, particularly on the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78924,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78924&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wascana</A>. They actually went to court and the courts ruled in their favour. That same day, the member for Wascana, as the minister, changed the regulations so that farmers were again in violation of the law. Most Canadians know that this action culminated in dozens of farmers being locked up in jail because they were trying to sell their grain and take it into the U.S. market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a terrible time in western Canada. The Liberal government punished these farmers almost to the point of destroying them. I had the opportunity to be in Lethbridge on the day the farmers went to jail. It was a horrible sight, something I never want to see again. Women and children were crying as their husbands and fathers were being taken away. It was clear that even the law enforcement officers who were being forced to uphold the law that day thought it was basically a sham. It was an embarrassment, and it comes back onto the shoulders of the previous Liberal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All farmers really want is choice. They want to be able to do their own business and to be free to make their own business choices as they grow their grain and bring it to market. They want to have the opportunity to make a good living on the farm. They believe they are capable of making the decisions that will help them do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great time for a plebiscite. We think this is the time for farmers to step forward and say they want choice. This is the time for farmers to say that they want the ability to run their own businesses as they choose. We have made democracy the centrepiece of our approach to marketing choice for western Canadian wheat and barley growers. We think that is very important for them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been clear from the beginning that we believe in giving producers a choice. That is what a democracy is all about: having a voice in the decision making process.</div>

    </p><a name="Para429963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished his comments by talking about the respect the government shows for democracy. That may be a debatable topic, but I will not get into that now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would ask the hon. member how he interprets the results of the Canadian Wheat Board producer-director elections in his own constituency, where the producer-director elected in that area of southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta has been elected and re-elected several times. In fact, he holds the position in complete opposition to the position taken by that member of Parliament. It would appear that farmers in that area have expressed their view specifically on Canadian Wheat Board issues by repeatedly electing and re-electing the director in that area who supports the single desk. I wonder if the hon. gentleman could explain that contradiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is this. On the barley plebiscite and the middle option, option (b), that he described earlier in his remarks and that purports to put forward the dual marketing proposition, can he assure producers that when that option (b) refers to the Canadian Wheat Board it is the Canadian Wheat Board that farmers know today with a single desk? Or is it some other concoction that is not properly named the Canadian Wheat Board in that middle option? I think that point of clarity is extremely important, because what that middle option purports to say is that we can have the open market and we can have the single desk together at the same time. I would be grateful if the hon. gentleman could clarify the point of whether or not under option (b) there will be any single desk.</div>

    </p><a name="Para429969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out first of all that he should be apologizing to western Canadian farmers for the fact that he was the minister in charge of the government file when farmers were locked up and put in jail. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have a lot of time here, but I would like to direct him to a blog and “The Truth About Marketing Choice” at marketingchoice.blogspot.com. There, the member would be able to see answers to many of his questions, including the fact that if we bring in a voluntary wheat board, the Wheat Board will be one of those options; clearly, if we have a voluntary marketing system, we do not have a single desk. By definition, we do not have that. The member knows that, he understands that, and so do western Canadian farmers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the three questions that we brought in, it is interesting that those questions are similar to the questions the Canadian Wheat Board asks on its annual survey. Last year's annual survey showed that 54% of farmers, even on wheat, wanted choice. They either wanted the board out of marketing wheat all together or they wanted a dual market. The majority of producers of wheat and the vast majority of producers of barley have indicated over the past few years in Canadian Wheat Board surveys that they want choice. We would like them to have that opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the best I can say about it, but I again would direct the member to “The Truth About Marketing Choice” at marketingchoice.blogspot.com. He will be able to get a lot of information about this issue so that he can understand it a little better.</div>

The issue has to do with whether or not all Canadians, particularly those who are most vulnerable and most in need in our society, are being properly cared for and included in the priorities of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government cancelled or cut $18 million from national literacy programs, $55 million from student summer programs, $45 million from affordable housing programs, and $10 million from the Canadian volunteer program. There are ample examples of these kinds of things, but I think these four speak for themselves. Can the member explain to Canadians why we are cutting funding for programs and services for the most vulnerable in our society?</div>

What we have done is move them from advocacy to direct programming so that the people who are most impacted by these situations are able to benefit from the programs, rather than have them go to people who just want to talk about them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously that is something that drives Liberals crazy, because if there is one thing they love, it is to talk about things and never do anything.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with great sadness that I rise in the House today because, in many regards, the motion before us forces us towards a sad conclusion. My speech here this morning will focus mainly on the part of the motion that deals with the cuts made to Status of Women Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para429986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past several weeks, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women has been hearing from representatives of women's groups directly affected by these cuts. These women's groups have made remarkable progress in achieving gender equality within our society for the women of Quebec and Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These women have travelled from across the country to try to convince the government to reverse its decision. What is most shocking about these cuts is that they have been made deliberately. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for the Status of Women even stated—she had the audacity to say—that 12 of the 16 Status of Women Canada offices were being closed because the employees in those offices provided too much support to groups that lobby for women's rights rather than focussing on providing direct services to women. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I would remind the minister that direct services fall under the jurisdiction of the provinces and territories. Second, it is extremely pernicious to do this sort of thing. It shows very little respect for women who are fighting to obtain their rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fail to understand. Every day, it seems, this government tells us that Canadians are important to it and that it wants what is best for them. But every day, it seems, as a result of ideological decisions, the government makes them more vulnerable. I can not understand it. Women represent 52% of the population. Women all across Canada are protesting these cuts. To date, there is perhaps one group that I have heard of that was in favour of these cuts. That group is REAL Women of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remind members that REAL Women of Canada represents 50,000 people while we represent 52% of the population, that is almost 18 million women. Consequently, 50,000 people out of 18 million is a very small number on which to base the policies that affect all women. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Gwen O'Reilly of the Northwestern Ontario Women's Center tells us that the cuts affect all the groups in communities that benefited from the services that were previously offered: francophones, aboriginal people, rural residents, and women’s groups working on issues of poverty, violence, access to justice and employment. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, in December 2005, the Prime Minister made an election promise to respect and promote the human rights of women. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429994"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, this government is very hostile toward women who form groups to defend and promote the principle of equality for women. The closing of 12 offices is an extreme measure to ensure that women’s organizations can no longer participate and make their voices heard in the development of public policies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is shameful to treat women this way, to try to muzzle them and to try to ensure that women will no longer have the chance to be heard in defence of their rights. It is shameful. I would even say that by changing this program into a program of services to individuals, the government wants to make women even more dependent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women of Quebec and of Canada do not need charity. That is what the government is now doing by changing these programs; it is offering charity. For too long, women were under the thumb of the Church. Everything they received was given as charity; they had no rights; they had to bend to the will of people who decided what rights we were entitled to. </div>
    </p><a name="Para429998"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, women have come into their own. We have developed tools and programs to ensure that all women have the same rights, that all women will have access to equality and that all women will have access to equity.</div>

She laid out some of the difficulties women face in Canada, especially in dealing with some of the harsh cuts that have been made by the so-called new government. My question deals with remote and rural parts of Canada where services are somewhat limited in any extent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An office in Thunder Bay was closed as part of the cuts to the Status of Women organization. While that office was quite removed from my riding, it provided service to many communities, such as, Sioux Lookout, Red Lake and Kenora. People in those areas needed the services of this office. It was actually an anchor for them to know that in some way the government was reaching out to them and was going to be involved in some of the difficult issues the member mentioned. I wanted to bring that to the attention of the House and the member. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the challenges are great for women in many parts of the country and the urban areas have difficulties, imagine the difficulty for people in small remote sites all across northern Ontario. Women needed and relied on the resources that were provided through these offices. Those services need to come back. Those who live in some of the remote sites feel a sense of desperation and face a challenge. They relied on these services.</div>

    </p><a name="Para430012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the young people who went through these programs are now working for companies.

    </p><a name="Para430015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that supporting families is essential. In Quebec, three family support initiatives are the pillars of our program to help families. These three initiatives are financial support for families, increased number of child care spaces and the implementation of the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This support is intended to promote equality between men and women, so that equality will no longer be a right, as it is today, but a fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All governments must truly commit to supporting families. Need I remind this house that 74% of women who have children under the age of six are in the work force? Need I remind this House that women are the heads of single parent families, the poorest families in our society? They need this support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This support is necessary and part of it is the balance between work and family life. This work and family balance can only be achieved if the child care network is effective, financially accessible and available—in other words, it needs to be a top-notch child care network. When all these conditions are met, parents can satisfy their desire to have children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-Quebec agreement on child care services and early learning was signed on October 28, 2005. This is a good agreement. The Bloc Québécois asked for it for years. We finally got it after a tough fight. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, one of the first things the Conservative government did when it came into power was to end this agreement and dig in its heels to oppose this way of doing things that was so appreciated by the majority of parents in Quebec. No one was complaining about this agreement. It truly gave the Government of Quebec the latitude to focus on its own jurisdiction and provide top-notch child care services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government responded with its new policy. Its right-wing vision—which we are seeing more frequently—does not meet the expectations of most Quebeckers; it only satisfies a small minority of people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Canada-Quebec child care agreement ends, there will be a shortfall of $269 million a year for Quebec. This will further accentuate the fiscal imbalance. Our needs still exist in Quebec and the money still remains here in Ottawa.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being elected, the Conservative government announced an annual allowance of $1,200. This allowance does not equal child care, and it is taxable. When the time comes to fill out their next tax return, Canadians will let us know that this amount is taxable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430024"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For parents who are less well off, this diminishes the chances of receiving help from other levels of government. This amount is therefore further reduced. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois proposed that this $1,200 be given in the form of a refundable tax credit. This would have cost the government no more money and would have helped families that are less well off. The government ignored this proposal, which upset many taxpayers. More right-wing bills!</div>
    </p><a name="Para430026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Conservative government must acknowledge that it made a big mistake in cancelling this agreement. Quebec's family support program—although not perfect and constantly evolving—is valued by Quebeckers. It has even been recognized by the OECD. As I already mentioned, Quebec families are supported through comprehensive, harmonized measures, policies and programs.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para430027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the members that it is up to Quebec to set its own standards. We must respect the its jurisdiction and allow Quebec to retain complete control over education and child care issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that Quebec is satisfying expectations. Thanks to these measures and according to the latest statistics, the number of births rose gradually between 2003 and 2005 from just under 74,000 to just over 76,000. The rate of increase accelerated in 2006; the most recent estimates indicate that there were 82,500 births in 2006, the most recorded in Quebec since 1997.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that when we support women and families and provide a fair and accessible child care system, we can increase the number of children, who are certainly our greatest treasure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, Quebec's goal was to create 200,000 more child care spaces. The province met that goal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will support today's motion because the Conservative government is imposing an ideological agenda that is too socially conservative, pigheaded, and not in line with what the people want. Child care services are a right, not a privilege. The women of Quebec and Canada are clamouring for it, and they expect their governments to support them. To ensure our children's future, we must provide quality child care services as part of an education system that is worthy of a developed country like Canada.</div>

    </p><a name="Para430037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government eliminated every reference to Kyoto from its websites. It has constantly indicated that it does not support the protocol and that it is not interested at all in trying to meet the targets under that protocol.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec has shown some leadership in terms of climate change initiatives. I wonder if the member would care to comment on why it is important for Canada to make commitments as outlined in the Kyoto protocol in the best interests of the future generations of Canada.</div>

We have a blame game going on. I think the experience of life for many Canadians is one of a deterioration of their standard of living and a nervousness about their future and their children's future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not want anyone to get me wrong. There is certainly lots of blame to go around and much of that has been put on the table this morning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have real concerns about their day to day lives that they want to see their government address. I want to touch on a few of the issues that have been brought to me by my constituents in Parkdale—High Park in Toronto.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concern is on the issue of child care. I have been campaigning for a national child care program since before my children were born. My youngest son is 21 years old and we still do not have a national child care program. However, during that time we have seen a generational change where in the 1970s only about one-third of mothers with children under the age of five were in the paid workforce and now we see almost three-quarters of mothers with children under five in the paid workforce. We have seen a massive social change during this period.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successive federal governments have failed to address this change. Canada is one of the few developed, industrialized democracies that does not have a national early learning and development program for its children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have campaigned for many years in my community on the need for a national, not for profit, good quality child care program that puts the needs of our kids front and centre. It would not replace the role of parents. It would embrace the role that parents play and try to help them in every way possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, governments after governments have squandered the opportunity. Even when we had successive balanced budgets and successive majority governments, especially by the previous Liberal government, there was too little too late. There was a kind of deathbed conversion to the issue of child care that, unfortunately, squandered the opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To now see the current government roll back the baby steps taken by the previous government in terms of provincial agreements on early childhood development is, quite frankly, shocking. For the government to replace that with a kind of taxable baby bonus and to tie that up in a bow and pretend it is child care, people do not buy it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I neglected to say that I will be splitting my time with my colleague here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the government to pretend that what is being offered to parents is a baby bonus, is quite a dissimilation. We need to recognize that the majority of parents are facing a difficult reality today. I know that in my riding the child care fees go anywhere from $800 up to $1,400 for a child and yet the waiting lists are long. In some child care centres hundreds of kids are on the waiting lists. Parents are at their wits end trying to deal with the situation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child care is an urgent crisis and I do not think Canadians care which party deals with it, they just want it dealt with. They want the blame game to stop and they want parties to get on with representing them here in the House of Commons and make progress on the things that affect their daily lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my community there has been a real deterioration and a growing poverty. Studies have called it the growing gap. We see people who increasingly are working for very low wages. Housing costs are skyrocketing. The average cost of renting an apartment in my riding is about $1,000. People simply cannot afford this. Transit costs a lot. People need to travel great distances to get to work.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140">(1140)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para430053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in the 1990s there were massive cuts to social spending and most of that money was never restored. Welfare rates were cut, the national housing strategy was cut and people with disabilities and mental illness were left to fend for themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many university students in my riding have massive student loans and incredible debt that weighs on their shoulders when they finish university. Many graduates start out really terrified because many of them cannot get a job. Even after they graduate, it could take a number of years to find a job with a sufficient income to pay down their incredible debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cities, where 80% of the Canadian population lives, are stretched to the limit. The cost of services are being downloaded onto our cities. They have a $60 billion infrastructure deficit. They lack a national urban transit strategy, which is something for which I have been calling for some time. They are struggling to pay for things through property taxes, things that ought to be paid for through our income taxes. This has had the inevitable impact of a deterioration in our quality of life, especially our environment with the growing smog in our urban centres, and the deterioration of our water systems. My riding borders on Lake Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what Canadians need to judge all representatives by, especially governments now and past, is not what they say, especially when they are in opposition, but what they do when they are in power. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for the current government is to use this opportunity today to make, what I think has been a deteriorating situation in our country, it better, certainly not to make it worse.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the very bad decisions being made by the government is around politicizing judicial appointments. This is very dangerous. We have seen south of the border what happens when judicial appointments are politicized and how very dangerous that situation can be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, I joined a number of members from this House to celebrate the successful outcome of the Maher Arar and Monia Mazigh situations, who, unfortunately, were the victims of a climate of fear created after the September 11 attacks and the casting of a net so wide that it began to undermine our democratic rights and freedoms. It was, in part, because of a courageous judge who spoke the truth and cleared Mr. Arar's name, that ultimately led to his exoneration and finally to a public apology by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Prime Minister</A>. Hopefully, the family will now be able to get their lives back on track. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that case hit home once again the importance of an independent judiciary and the importance of having our fundamental human rights and our democratic rights protected at all costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have great concern with the government cancelling the court challenges program. It is a very small amount of money in a multi-billion dollar government. It is only $5 million to ensure that those whose rights are supposed to be protected under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms actually have access to the necessary legal processes to have those rights defended. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a francophone, a woman, a lesbian, a gay, a bisexual or a transgendered person, a person with a disability, a first nations person, whoever a person is, does not have access to the halls of power, to have the court challenges program as a safety measure to ensure their rights are protected is fundamental. I see no justification for the complete elimination of this program. I find that very troubling. Because so many disadvantaged people have had to seek their rights through the courts, I believe this is a provision that must be enshrined.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145">(1145)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para430063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken out many times against the cuts to women's programs and literacy programs. It is important that these programs be restored and that opposition voices be guaranteed in our country. It is a sign of maturity and security on the part of a government when it not only allows opposition voices but in fact encourages and fosters opposition voices. That is a sign of a healthy democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians listen to these debates, they expect us all, whatever party we are in, to do better and to act on behalf of the good of all Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para430072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to her principal point on child care, the fact is that $3.5 billion of funding was cancelled by the Conservative government. It was an agreement negotiated with the provinces that came up with $100 a month per child under six, which is taxable, but that just puts money into the hands of persons who may not even need it. It is not even based on the ability to pay or the need. It creates no new spaces, therefore it creates no choices, and the whole issue was about creating choices. If there are no new spaces, there are no choices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also promised to give tax credits to businesses to create child care spaces in business and industry. We have heard nothing from the Conservative government about whether it has done anything or whether there is any interest and yet it was going to provide spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that issue alone, the Conservative government deserves to be blamed for breaking promises. It said that things were going to happen and that spaces would be created.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I talk to people in the constituency of Surrey North, which I have the privilege of representing, they talk to me about the things that matter in their weekly lives which is really what matters to most of us. People talk to me about being concerned about affordability, about being able to afford things for their children for school. Many of them despair of ever being able to afford to send their sons and daughters to anything past high school, the trades, apprenticeship, college, university. They know there is a growing gap between what they have and what other people have. They see that growing gap and it frustrates them and they do not understand it. They expect their elected representatives to do the job we were elected to do which is to represent them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look at today's motion put forward by the Liberals, there are some comments I would like to make. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very concerned about child care and child care choice. I have spent most of my paid and unpaid adult working life, which is longer than I might even want to say, looking for child care opportunities for families, not just child care during regular workday hours, but child care that is within the reach of everyone, regardless of what they do for a living. I still do not see that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very disappointed. I worked with the Liberal government in the early 1990s, from 1991 to 1996, looking at universal child care and a national child care initiative. If that had worked and had been in place, we would not be standing here now saying that the lack of child care is the crisis that it is, because it would have happened. It would have had roots and would have been in place. It would not have been something that could have been so easily cancelled by the current Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservative government cancelled the national child care strategy, it also sent a message to provinces about the lack of importance of child care. What the Conservatives did was not child care choice. One hundred dollars a month before taxes is not child care choice. No one would deny that parents could use an extra $100 a month, or whatever it is after taxes, to provide support for their sons and daughters, although they must be under six years old. After a child reaches six years of age, what does the child care choice become? It does nothing for child care. It creates no spaces. It trains no child care providers. It speaks not at all to the needs of a child over the age of five. I would hope that the Conservative government is not suggesting that children who are six, seven and eight would provide their own care. This really has created a crisis across this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very interested in the cancelling of the Status of Women offices. One of the best pieces of research I have ever seen done by that office was about how to get more women into government. From looking at the Conservative caucus, I would have thought that the Conservatives would want that research to continue. Surely the Conservative Party more than any other party in this House could use that research about how to have more women elected as part of that party. That was very puzzling. I hope it does not mean that the Conservatives do not want more women as part of their caucus. That was the research that was going on and they certainly could use that assistance, I would suggest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in Surrey North are very concerned about the affordability of housing. The amount of CMHC money going into Surrey North this year is $48,000 for the entire constituency. That will do some rent subsidy I am sure, but it is not going to get housing for the homeless and it is not going to help with affordable housing for people in any significant way. If people do not have a safe home, they cannot raise their children in safety.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1200"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1200"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1200">(1200)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para430089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of safety and the cutting of child care, the Conservatives talk a lot about crime but they do not talk very much about the prevention of crime. Anybody knows that child care and good early childhood initiatives and interventions would make an enormous difference in preventing children from getting into crime and making those very bad choices that lead them down that road. The Conservatives are at the other end around punishment, but they have cut off the avenues of preventing the crime in the first place by cancelling the child care initiatives. In many ways that is a travesty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed the Conservative government reaching out into the ethnic community. Every time I turn around there are Conservative members at events in my riding. I know the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has been there. But on truly embracing cultural diversity, where are the centres on credentialing? Where are the centres where physicians, nurses, teachers, engineers and accountants can have their credentials from other countries assessed? We welcomed those people to Canada to address skills shortages because they had those degrees. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a motion on the notice paper, but I do not know how quickly it will come forward. The motion talks about seniors from other countries, in particular, India, who cannot collect the seniors pension even if they are citizens in this country. They live in poverty. They cannot collect a pension because we do not have a signed treaty with that one country. Many people from India have contributed to our country, but they cannot have a seniors pension for 10 years, even though they are working, contributing and volunteering in their communities, because India is not one of the, I do not know, 112 countries that have signed a treaty. That has been raised with the government on a number of occasions and there has been no action on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleague who just spoke, that people who elect us to come here judge us by what we say and what we stand for. People will judge governments in power by their actions, not by what they say they are going to do, not by what they say they care about, but by what they do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see the kind of action that will make a difference for the people I have the privilege to know and to work with in Surrey North. A post-secondary education is no closer for the children of those people who cannot afford the still very large tuition fees. Many people want their sons and daughters--many daughters, I hope--to go into apprenticeships and work in the trades because they can make a good living. We have a huge skills shortage in British Columbia because of the building boom. Their sons and daughters cannot take advantage of that opportunity because it is too expensive and there has not been enough money put into the post-secondary education envelope and student loans for those people to afford it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People just want their lives to be a bit better. They want to have a bit of hope for the future, just like all of us do. They want to know they are doing the best they can for their children. They do not expect miracles. They do not expect to be rich. They do not expect special privileges. They just expect to live safely in their communities with access to the kind of resources that their families might need. That is not what they are seeing. That is how the government will be judged.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some missed opportunities, as I said, with child care. The child care initiative could have had deep roots if the Liberal government had moved on it when it was first discussed. I do not know when it was first discussed, but when I first started discussing it with the federal government was in 1991. It would have had deep, deep roots in the community by now and would have created more spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue around protecting and promoting linguistic and cultural diversity that is in the Liberal opposition motion is an important one. We cannot just go into communities that have contributed to this country at the last minute, whether they are Asian, South Asian or whatever the country of origin is, and try to make friends without addressing the things that those people have said are important: the seniors pension for people in the South Asian community; credentialling for people from every community. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People ask what we do for foreign trained physicians in Vancouver, British Columbia. Mostly we just let them drive taxi cabs because we do not have a way that they can be credentialled, even though the federal government encouraged them to come. It said we needed physicians. It said we needed accountants. It said we needed engineers. But there they are, driving taxi cabs. There is nothing wrong with driving a taxi cab, but they want to use the skills in the profession for which they were trained.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many missed opportunities by the previous government and there have certainly been choices made by the Conservative government that will not give more hope, a better life, and a little bit of hope for the future to the constituents of Surrey North. It will simply reinforce for them that there is indeed a growing gap, that they are at the bottom of that growing gap, and that they are not going to be able to provide the kind of future that they want to see.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents do not care who we are here. They do not care what colour hats we wear. They just want us to do our jobs, make their families safer, and let them provide good lives for themselves and their families.</div>

Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I have listened with great interest to my hon. colleague and I know that she has a sincere interest in all of the topics that she covered. However, I listened to her speak about the investment that our party, the Liberal government, had made in child care, and her question was why we did not do it sooner.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out to her that we had a $42 billion debt that we had to deal with when we became government. Then we had a deficit that we needed to pay down, and that happened with the help and on the backs of Canadians right across this great country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make no mistake. There was pain and there were worthwhile social programs that could not be invested in until we got our fiscal house in order. Once we did, our government brought in agreements with every province and territory. We had a pan-Canadian child care system that was going to go ahead, that offered real choices to Canadians, not just working families, because we were investing in programs in the community that at-home parents were also able to access. It was a far more comprehensive program than what the government has offered, which is a taxable amount of $100 a month per child up until the age of six.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague also talked about the need for social housing. I know that in Kitchener Centre and the Waterloo region, we have invested at the local level in ensuring that social housing is being built. The supporting community programs initiative that was brought in under our Liberal government was investing in partnership with agencies at the community level to ensure that we were addressing those needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to my hon. colleague is this. Why, when all of these important things were in place, when we had the Kelowna agreement signed, and I would underscore her comments that we are judged by our actions not just our words, did the NDP decide to pull the plug on all these progressive social investments, these programs--</div>

Having been the health minister and held several other portfolios in the province of British Columbia, I know that there was a debt. I know that there was a great deal of pain paying off that debt because we felt that pain in British Columbia as we watched our health care transfer dollars go down as we picked up the deficit that was created, and we were not able to spend money in other areas as a result of that. I do appreciate that the debt needed to be paid off. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have 10 babies a day born at Surrey Memorial Hospital. That is almost 4,000 babies a year and they do not understand about debt. All those babies who, during that time, missed out on having early support, early intervention, and support for their moms at home or child care choice do not understand that. It should always be a choice and we should support parents regardless of what that choice is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a whole generation of children who missed out on that kind of support, for which we will probably be paying $125,000 a year in the prison system while that debt was being paid down. I would suggest that while the debt needed to be paid down, it did not need to be completely done on the backs of the health care system and all of those children who missed out on opportunities during that time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched our health care system for two years as health minister and two years as the minister for children and families, and watched those tremendous missed opportunities for a whole generation really of children for whom we will pay that price.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430110"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the debt had to be paid down, and the member can blame whomever for that debt, but during that time, we had a whole generation of children who missed out on opportunities. People missed out on having good opportunities for health care, and health care under medicare, a publicly funded, maintained, accessible, and universal system which the Liberal government found itself seemingly unable to address at the time.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the opportunity to speak today on the motion presented by our distinguished colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78667,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78667&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</A>, the deputy leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are debating a motion that goes to the heart of what I think troubles Canadians very much. We are discovering what I think people knew or at least had an inclination, but are now finding confirmed, that the party that forms government in Canada across the aisle is a narrow-minded, meanspirited, ideological-driven government whose primary objective is to emasculate the role of the federal government, and in doing so cause Canadians to be disconnected from their national government and I would say from each other. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It occurs to me that the government loves power but hates government, especially good government. There was a time in Canada when we had two major parties in the House of Commons, the Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, with varying philosophies but in general recognized and continued the social infrastructure of Canada of which Canadians are proud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time we could count on reasonable and fair government, whether it was our party or the Progressive Conservative Party. Ours was better, but at least we knew that Canada would not be dismantled while the PCs were in power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians knew they could count on a moderate government, one that acted in the national interest and that despite our differences would attempt to do what was right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78900,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78900&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Central Nova</A> killed the Progressive Conservative Party shortly after saying that he would not. The current Conservative Party is obviously not progressive. I suspect most of my colleagues on the other side would be offended to be called progressive. In fact, they are regressive in every sense of the word.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak to this motion today specifically on the issue of skills development and education and to a part of Canada that I think the government forgets and that is the people of Canada and in particular, the most vulnerable people in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430119"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked a question this week of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A> on why he and his government slashed $55 million from the summer career placement program or as many of us know as the summer grants program. Since its inception in the mid-1990s it has employed hundreds of thousands of students across Canada. It was also a program that helped many worthwhile community organizations, not for profits, to obtain a little extra help from students who brought their energy and talent to organizations that in most cases actually related to their field of study. To many students these summer jobs represented the only chance they had to earn some money and to help pay their way through university or community college.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response we got was no response. Instead, we got non-answers while students and community groups are left to wonder what will happen. There is still no information available on the HRSD website, directing students or community groups as to what will happen with what is left of that funding. It is a disgrace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no legitimate reason why this important program would be slashed except in the case that the government does not believe in helping students or that the government does not believe in continuing Liberal programs, even Liberal programs that most of its members would concede work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that students were not the only Canadians who were victims of the government. Last year in my community of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78797,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78797&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Dartmouth—Cole Harbour</A> the recipients of grants from the student summer career placement programs were the East Dartmouth Boys and Girls Club, the Cole Harbour Boys and Girls Club, Dartmouth Public Housing, the MS Society of Canada, Regal Road United Baptist Church, Big Brothers and Big Sisters and Dartmouth Day Care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every single grant in my riding went to a not for profit organization. There are no Exxons here, there is no GE, and there are no large companies benefiting from this program. That was one of the reasons that was used when the program was virtually dismantled in the fall.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study after study has suggested that one of the great challenges facing Canada is the shortage of skilled labour to meet the demand of the labour market. Yet sadly, at least nine million Canadians suffer from lack of literacy, unable to obtain the necessary training and skills needed to compete for those jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is shameful that those who are illiterate, the vast majority of whom happen to be poor, have been singled out, targeted by the government with millions and millions of dollars taken away from literacy funding. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money allocated by the previous government did not go to pay big salaries. It did not go to pay for huge administrative costs. The money for literacy went to help ordinary Canadians who could not read or write. The funding was beginning to make a difference where individuals were obtaining the reading and writing skills necessary to get a decent job and in doing so, providing for their families and making a contribution to their communities.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Movement for Canadian Literacy could be days away from closing down permanently. Ann Marie Downie, who runs Literacy Nova Scotia, has told me that her organization and the other 30 community organizations that work with her to provide training to learners will probably have to close their doors maybe within months, but certainly within the next year. Why then would the government cut funding to literacy?</div>
    </p><a name="Para430128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next up on the chopping block is the $5 million cut to the Status of Women. For some reason the $1,000 a day limo minister of heritage decided that cutting support for women's organizations was in the best interest of government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the women's movement in Canada is one of hard work and dedication to equal rights, the inclusion of women and their equality in the charter. This work continues to seek greater equity in Canadian society for women and yet the funding was cut. It makes no sense. Again, I would suggest the Conservative government loves power but hates government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Conservatives have slashed social programs that are valued by Canadians, they have undertaken what can only be called a massive orgy of pork-barrelling. Since they have come into power they have hired friends, party hacks, and major contributors to their right wing party. In Atlantic Canada, it seems every new senior official appointed to the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency has been a Conservative, and yet they have the temerity to lecture others about accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their blatant stacking of the judicial committees threatens not only the independence of the justice system, but it is an attempt to go after the charter, a document that has always made elements of that party uncomfortable, including its leader, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. The Conservatives have stacked the judicial committees for no other reason than to appoint right wing judges that will render the charter hollow. That is their goal. There can be no doubt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in James Travers' column in the Toronto Star, and he is certainly far from being a card carrying Liberal, he suggests that:</div>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Woven through its declared willingness to ride roughshod over Parliament is the same single-minded determination that is driving its attempts to add partisanship and ideology to the appointment of judges. Both are risky steps in the wrong direction...Reversing the trend away from a politicized appointment process by loading the screening committee is as damaging as what it's doing to Parliament. Along with raising the U.S. spectre of mixing personal beliefs with legal competence, it erodes public confidence in an independent judiciary.</small></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para430134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of comparisons between the Conservative government and the government in the United States right now under President George Bush. Canadians are beginning to realize that the current government in many ways is in lockstep with the right wing values of its republican friends to the south. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is cuts to students, women's groups, literacy, court challenges program, or the assault on the charter, we now know that in May 2005 the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was replaced by a narrow, right wing party that seeks to eradicate the role of the Canadian government and unravel what Canadians feel brings them together. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that generations of Canadian governments, Progressive Conservative and Liberal, have focused on building a stronger, united Canada. Today's government is focused on creating a reduced and divided Canada, a Canada where the federal government abdicates and off-loads its responsibilities to the most vulnerable, and those members do not want to talk about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians do want to talk about it. They want a generous nation, a big nation, a strong nation, a nation that knows that we are stronger when we take care of the most vulnerable, and make them part of the success and the future prosperity of Canada. That is what the Liberal Party believes as well.</div>

I would like my colleague to clarify something.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get criticized for the rise in greenhouse gas emissions under our watch by 27%. That is true. We could have done a better job. What is not known is that our economy grew by 47% over the same period of time as a result of wise management. This drove our unemployment levels to the lowest levels in more than 30 years. Yes, our greenhouse gas emissions did go up, but not nearly as much as the increase in our economy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if my hon. colleague would elaborate on the fact that we implemented a number of programs under the previous prime minister, including a very large sum of money for alternative energies, and also the EnerGuide program, which was an outstanding program that enabled homes to be built better thereby dramatically reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if he could shed some light on the fact that those programs were implemented by us, but the Conservative government has taken those programs, watered them down, renamed them, and suddenly claimed to be green.</div>

    </p><a name="Para430143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiatives that the Liberals took while in government, in particular the Montreal conference for which our now leader was responsible, showed that Canada was a leader in the world's environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take one program about which I have some knowledge from a previous life. It is the EnerGuide for houses program and specifically the part of the program that went to the lowest income families. It was gutted by the government last year. The Conservatives have reintroduced some of these programs and they re-gifted them as new Conservative initiatives. However, the EnerGuide for low income houses was a program in which I was involved when I worked at Nova Scotia Power. In fact, we were the delivery agent for that program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nova Scotia Power provided that program free of charge to Nova Scotians. Those who spent a lot of money on fuel and polluted the environment would have the corporation go in, do an assessment and make recommendations to them. These people were the lowest income Canadians, the people who could least afford $2,000 or $3,000 to renovate their homes in order to save money and help the environment. The program helped those people the most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it gutted the program, that was an example of the kind of narrow social exclusionary practices of the government. It was not helpful to individual Canadians. Nor was it helpful to the collective of Canada or to the entire world, as we went about the job of trying to ensure we had an environment that was sustainable for generations to come.</div>

    </p><a name="Para430148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large social engineering project is occurring, masterminded by the Conservative government, and it is below the radar screen of many Canadians. The implications of this are quite enormous. Although much of the package sounds good, it goes against common good public policy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only retail politics trumping fact based public policy, it is much more than that. It is seeding a rigorous social Conservative view in politics, education and the bureaucracy. It is a marriage between social Conservative religious groups and one political party, the Conservative Party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people have an absolute right to believe in whatever they want. Indeed, any religious group can lobby any political party or government as hard as it wants. However, we draw the line at responsibility. A government is responsible to ensure that religion and politics are separate. This is an unsaid but widely accepted viewpoint of most Canadians. Out of respect for people's religious views, we do not marry or mix religion and politics. However, that is not what has occurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak about the implications of this in a moment. The fact is it will affect and has affected everything from Parliament to the courts, to the media, to education and to the bureaucracy. Parliament has largely become, at least within the government, a dictatorship where power has been centralized within the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s office, ignoring good advice from bureaucracies, his own MPs and cabinet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be an unsatisfying and soul destroying experience to be members of the government now and to be seen as little more than potted plants, not listened to or respected by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. This is a very dangerous situation for all who voted for individuals and expected their members of Parliament to advocate for them in a constructive way in the House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts have also been changed, as we saw recently. The current grouping, in terms of deciding who will be judges, has changed quite significantly and has been stacked with individuals who reflect the social conservative values of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media is in the hands of a small number of people. I know this is not a very satisfying situation for many journalists. That does not have anything to do with the government, but having media centralization in a small number of hands stultifies different viewpoints and does not allow the Canadian public to see the breadth of views out there. It is not a healthy situation for strong public discourse. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implications are quite serious, and I will go through some of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the loss of democracy. We have a situation where the power is controlled by and large within the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s office and the hands of a very few. We know that party would have supported Canada joining the U.S. in the war in Iraq. Imagine if the U.S. invades Iran. If the U.S. were to ask the government to join in that fight, what would it do? Would it support it? If it did, It would be a devastating.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On cuts to the poor, the government does not even pretend to advocate for the poor. It raised the income tax rate on the poor and dropped the basic personal exemption. As a result that, the poorest in our society have been hammered and have less money in their pockets now than ever before. The discrepancy between the haves and the have nots are widening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On child care, as colleagues have mentioned before, $3.5 billion have been cut. In my province of British Columbia as well as in all other provinces it has had a profound impact on child care workers, spaces, parents and families. They do not have the choice that the party across the way professes to give Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the $1,200 child care benefit is taxed. Because of that what ends up in people's pockets is a fraction of that $1,200. In fact, it amounts to about $2 a day. That is not child care, those are not spaces and that is not a choice. The 25,000 spaces that were promised by the government so far amount to zero.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of human reproductive technologies, another board has been stacked by the government, filled with people who are anti-choice. The implications of this in terms of embryonic stem cell research are devastating for our researchers. As a result, Canadian research into embryonic stem cell activities will be crushed and the ability of our researchers to engage in the lifesaving research required to deal with diseases, such as cancers, will be snuffed.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On health care, we fought hard to keep the needle exchange program in Vancouver. Did the government extend it for three years as had been requested? No. It extended for one year in a sudden death decision. This is a research program that saves lives and money and reduces crime. However, because of an ideological approach, the government has not extended the program past the one year, a program that has proven to save lives. In fact, the government has ignored the facts in <i>The Lancet</i> and other world renowned medical magazines.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the government on the Sudan? It is missing in action. Where is the government on the Middle East? Quite rightly, it supports Israel and its peace and security, as we all do. However, where is the government on the crisis in Gaza? It rightly removed funding from Hamas, but it is nowhere in being able to alleviate the catastrophic situation taking place on the ground in the Gaza Strip. People dying of preventable causes right now.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan is one of the most egregious situations that has taken place while the government has been in power. The public, and unfortunately members of our beloved military, believe the government is doing things in their favour. What they do not know is the government has used our troops as a political pawn for its own political benefit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government gave the House 48 hours to make a decision, which was the most important decision that any of us had to make, on whether to put the lives of our troops on the line for our country. Yet, the public does not know that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government got it wrong. It did not have the development package correct. It did not have the political package correct. As a result and as we see from Senlis Council briefings and other people on the ground, we are losing the war in Afghanistan. Why? The government does not have a plan for dealing with the poppy crop. It does not have a plan for training the Afghan national police. It does not have a plan for dealing with the insurgency coming from outside. As a result, our troops, which are bleeding for our interests and those of Afghanistan, do not have the backup they require to do the job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political solutions are required to deal with Afghanistan and the government is missing in action. It did not get it right when it rammed this through Parliament and it does not have it right now. It is leaving our troops bereft and on the side to do the hard work without giving them the backup on the ground. That is reprehensible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to listen to the solutions that are being offered. They would make that mission a success and would allow our troops to be safe and get out by 2009, with respect to the combat aspects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that the poppy crop eradication process taking place right now is going to dramatically increase insecurity for our troops. Therefore, I demand that the government speak to the United States and the United Kingdom and stop this plan. The farmers have said that if we take away their poppy crops, we will destroy their ability to provide for our families and because of that they will join the Taliban.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The omnibus motion before the House today is reminiscent of the Liberal Party of the past. It is an indication of what would come should the Liberals ever have the opportunity to form government again. It should remind us that all that party is is a party in disarray, a party that cannot pick priorities and a party that is obviously facing division within its own ranks. The motion touches on Kyoto, day care, agriculture, justice, linguistic duality, the Wheat Board and the Status of Women Canada. It is the latter that I will discuss this afternoon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For months now, the opposition has been attempting to mislead Canadian women about what has been happening since we formed government. There has been a great deal of discussion around the renewed terms and conditions of the women's program and the new criteria for funding. We believe advocacy has a role to play. Canada's new government believes that now is the time to act and we want to focus taxpayers' dollars towards action. We have the studies; we know there are problems. Instead of wasting time discussing the issues, our government is looking at tangible ways in which we can make a difference now. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs is dealing with matrimonial property rights for aboriginal women. Our government increased funding to on reserve family violence shelters by $6 million. As well, the minister announced $450 million for improving water supply and housing on reserve, education outcomes and socio-economic conditions for aboriginal women, children and families, real money in the hands of organizations that are on the ground working to make a difference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of human trafficking, the former minister of citizenship and immigration developed a program to offer victims temporary visas. Human trafficking is on the rise and the majority of those trafficked are women. They are brought to this country and are forced into a life of prostitution. Instead of being treated as criminals, our government will issue temporary resident permits for up to 120 days and will provide the necessary health care required free of charge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women's issues are issues that all Conservative MPs and cabinet ministers are concerned about, not just one minister, all cabinet ministers. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A> announced $4.48 million to help retrain women on social assistance in New Brunswick. This three year pilot project called Partners Building Futures will help women on social assistance get the training necessary to find jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the minister has introduced legislation, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>, that will make it easier for Canadians to access the guaranteed income supplement. The guaranteed income supplement pays out $6.2 billion a year and goes to 1.5 million low income seniors who are mostly women. This is real change that will affect people right where they live in our communities across our nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430181"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one short year we have introduced the universal child care benefit to help women and their families in their homes. We have implemented patient wait time guarantees for prenatal aboriginal women. We have expanded eligibility for compassionate caregivers, most of whom are women. We have introduced pension splitting for senior citizens. We have targeted tax cuts like the GST, the textbook credit and the credit for families with children involved in physical activity to ensure that families are supported. This is real change, ideas and policies that are making a difference in real Canadian women's lives.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is committed to action in terms of women and justice issues. There are stories in the paper every day about repeat offenders, men who have abused their wives, children or girlfriends, who are back on the streets putting lives in danger because law enforcement does not have the necessary tools. Domestic violence is an issue that this government takes seriously.</div>

We need effective sentencing where dealing with sexual predators and repeat offenders is addressed. We need to end conditional sentencing and raise the age of protection. This is critical.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government believes in supporting programs that have a direct impact on women. We believe in putting money into the hands of groups that will help women in their communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2005 Canada was cited by the United Nations committee on human rights as failing to adequately address the high rate of violence against aboriginal women. These women and their children deserve safe communities. This is why Canada's new government has committed to the multi-year funding of $1 million a year until the year 2011 to the Native Women's Association of Canada. The Sisters in Spirit initiative addresses the high rates of racialized, sexualized violence against aboriginal women. This project will have a direct benefit on the lives of aboriginal women in their communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no simple answer. The economic security of women can be traced back as a root cause of the problems women face on a daily basis. We need to ask how we can work together to alleviate these problems, and how we can work with the provinces to better provide services for women. That is one issue which the status of women committee is addressing as we speak. The committee is taking a look at the economic security of women all across our nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a woman faces domestic violence, what can we do to help her get herself out of that cycle of abuse? How can we help women to get out of these situations, to find jobs, build homes, be self-sustaining? We need to let women know that there are other options enabling them the opportunity to change their lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that this government is trying to silence women or their advocacy groups is completely ludicrous. I would like to put our partisan political differences aside and work with all members of this House to ensure that we are making a difference in the lives of women all across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that action replace words. It is imperative that problems are solved so women in their daily lives, in their homes and communities all across this nation can get the assurance and support that they need.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pleasure to be here today working with our government in terms of putting words into action.</div>

It gives Canadians who are following this debate a chance to see whether the new member brings a new and fresh perspective to the tired old policy that Canadians rejected a year ago last month.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals first promised in their 1993 red book to deliver a child care plan. Canadians waited. And they waited. I do not know where the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78667,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78667&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</A> was for the past 13 years, but Canadians like us waited 13 years for Liberals like him to tell us what their plan was. When the Liberals finally got around to telling us the plan, they got it wrong in the eyes of Canadian parents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the last election, Canadian parents said they were looking for choice in child care. What did the Liberals offer? A cookie-cutter approach to child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian families are diverse. The Liberals ignored our diversity. Some families are looking for spaces like the Liberals promised, and we will begin delivering in the upcoming fiscal year. Many others only need access to part time child care. Others are looking for flexibility of care to meet their rotating shifts. Still others want to stay at home or have a trusted family member or neighbour care for their children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Liberal government's child care plan offered these families nothing. Under the Liberals, only a select group would benefit. Anyone looking for something other than a regulated, nine to five, child care space got nothing. Regular Canadian families got nothing from the Liberals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the old Liberals' plan. Since then, we have had an election where that plan was up against our plan for choice in child care, and it lost. Since then, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78667,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78667&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke—Lakeshore</A> came back to Canada. Since then, the member had a chance to listen to families in his riding, families who do shift work and families from China and India who have more than one generation under the same roof and prefer having grandparents help raise the kids. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member has had time to listen to Canadians who looked at the child care options they were presented last election, Canadians such as Kate Tennier of Advocates for Child Care Choice, who was quoted in the December 5, 2005 <i>National Post</i> as saying, “You might have a perfectly good grandmother or neighbour to look after your children, but you are forced into regulated day care” under the Liberals' plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What new plan does this new member bring us? The same old tired Liberal child care plan that Canadians said they did not want. Rather than rejuvenating the Liberals with fresh ideas, it looks like the old Liberals were able to get to him and make him sound just like them. Too bad it does not sound anything like what Canadians sound like.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the most recent statement of what Canadians want in child care comes from <i>Today's Parent</i> magazine. <i>Today's Parent</i> polled Canadian parents. Results were published in this month's edition and they show a mere 16% of parents looking for child care spaces and the Liberal plan. They show that 38% prefer to have a parent stay at home and 17% use relatives. These families want support too.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservatives are listening to Canadians. Only the Conservatives offered Canadians support for their choice in child care. The good news for Canadian families is that we did not take 13 years to do it, like the Liberals did.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new government's choice in child care plan will see an investment of over $12 billion over five years. The Liberals promised less than half that. The new government delivers support directly to families for their choice in child care. The Liberals transferred less funding to provincial bureaucracies, with no accountability measures for what the money should deliver.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the shortcomings of the Liberal plan were so stark that they led no less than former Liberal deputy leader Sheila Copps to comment, “The last agreement actually saw some provinces rake in millions in cash without creating a single new day-care space”. That is from the <i>Calgary Sun</i> during the election campaign, in its issue of December 7, 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new government's plan has two parts: the universal child care benefit, which delivers $100 a month to every child under the age of six for the child care of choice, and the child care spaces initiative that is set to begin delivering spaces in the upcoming fiscal year, as promised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have delivered on the UCCB. Over $1.4 billion has gone out to 1.4 million families on behalf of 1.9 million children. That is more benefits to Canadian families in half a year than the Liberals would spend for an entire year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we have met our commitment on the universal child care benefit, we will deliver on our child care space initiative, but Conservatives recognize that a plan for child care spaces has to be better at meeting the needs of Canadian parents than what the Liberals had planned. The Liberals wanted to fund day care providers. We want to fund children.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250">(1250)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para430220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservatives recognize that Canadian parents with young children are involved in all kinds of work environments and situations, not just nine to five, five days a week, with evenings and weekends off. Our plan looks for options for Canadian parents who are working shifts and on weekends. We want spaces that are flexible for the needs of farm families and parents who work in fisheries. The standard nine to five child care that the Liberals had planned is not suitable for them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's budget set aside $250 million a year beginning in fiscal year 2007-08 to support the creation of new child care spaces in communities across Canada. We want these spaces to answer the real needs of Canadians. We have taken the time to hear their concerns and get their ideas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we have provided the provinces and territories with $650 million to help in the transition to our new child care policy. We have consulted with the provinces and territories on our plans for child care spaces. Together we will find a child care solution so that Canadian families can balance work and family life as they see fit, no matter where they live.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the initiatives we promised Canadians in the last election. They are initiatives we promised in the Speech from the Throne last year. They were included in last year's budget. We are delivering on these promises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge hon. members to join me in voting down this motion.</div>

It is clear that he is planning to criticize the Liberals and play up what his party has done.

    </p><a name="Para430226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, he referred to 37% or 38% of Canadians. Those figures certainly do not include Quebec. He could never say that in Quebec, because we have a very good child care system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, the $1,200 parents receive annually is not a complete gift. Much of it comes back to the government in taxes. The member spoke of choice, but this amount does not give parents the choice of child care in the evening, on weekends or when they want it. Child care centres do not exist simply because the government is giving people money for child care. That is the big problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec already has child care centres. The government is giving us $258 million. That hurts the province, because the money is being given to the people, who are not necessarily paying for child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Quebec already has a child care system, how is it that he did not support it earlier, when the other provinces considered it a model system?</div>

What I heard over and over again was that they were concerned about a fundamental unfairness in the Liberal plan, which would basically send all of the money to fund one option, to fund what I would say is perhaps an ideologically based option, to use terminology that the Liberals seem to favour using right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I heard at the doorsteps is that people want something that is fair for all parents, whether they send their kids to a nine to five day care system or choose to raise their kids at home or have a neighbour or grandparent watch them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will focus on and reiterate what we have accomplished. As I said in my speech, there are 1.9 million children, through money being received by 1.5 million families, receiving $100 per child under the age of six. Those families now are able to make the decision that they feel is best for their own families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is what my constituents asked for.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something that we see only with the government's actions in the House of Commons.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminating child care spaces, summer job programs for students, national literacy programs, programs designed to improve the advancement of women in our society, and legal help for those trying to defend their charter rights: these are only a few examples of the government's disconnect with the values and dreams of the majority of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government looks at the federal budget like a ledger, as simply numbers on a page that can be crossed off if the title does not fit the narrow vision of the Conservative Party. Of course, if this is reflected in the polls they will change their strategy until a majority is in hand, but they will never change their minds when it comes to Canadians. The Conservatives will re-announce the previous Liberal plan with a new blue banner and a catchy phrase. It is very simple for them, really, as if it is some sort of a game.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a game. These numbers are not just abstract accounting notes. They reflect the efforts of this country to make the lives of ordinary Canadians better. They reflect the Canadians who try to find early learning and child care spaces for our children. They reflect the efforts of teachers to help Canadians read and write. They reflect the advocacy efforts of women trying to break glass ceilings. They reflect the work of committed Canadians trying to exercise their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They reflect the efforts of this country to make itself a better place for its citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that the impacts of what the Conservatives are abandoning will only get worse.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gets worse.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government has continued this social policy rampage by turning back the clock on women's equality. It has shut down the Status of Women Canada offices across the country. It has removed the word “equality” from the mandate of its women's program and it has cut $5 million from Status of Women Canada. This important avenue for the achievement of women is being destroyed, and I would say that it is shameful.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government is cutting $55 million from the youth employment services. It will save $10 million with the elimination of the international youth internship program and another $10 million with the elimination of the Canadian volunteerism initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those cuts will have a devastating impact on students and young people in my riding of Newton—North Delta. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the Conservative government's agenda is its cancellation of $6 million for the court challenges program. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s chief of staff is on record questioning whether this program should exist. His opinion obviously won out in the backrooms of the Prime Minister's Office. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess some organizations should be viewed with more suspicion, at least from the Conservative Party's perspective. The government needs to stop groups that may use the court challenges program to advance equality and language rights under the charter. Those suspicious on the Conservative list include but are not limited to: Alliance for Equality of Blind Canadians, The B.C. Human Rights Coalition, the BC Coalition of People with Disabilities, the Canadian Association of the Deaf, the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Women's Health Network, The Canadian Hearing Society and even the Brain Injury Association network are on the Conservative Party's hit list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court challenges program was responsible for allowing deaf people to fully participate in Canadian society by mandating translation services in sign language so they could interact with the government. This success alone is enough to justify the continuation of the program. Those are only a few examples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a country where a young mother will not be able to find a child care space or even afford one if found. It will be a country where this mother will have vastly reduced access to literacy and adult education programs. It will be a country where job opportunities through youth employment programs will not exist for this mother. It will be a country where, if this mother's rights are violated, she will have no access to the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose the Conservatives believe that ignorance is bliss and that the ignorant will vote Conservative. However, I, along with the Liberal Party, will work to stop this from happening, even if the NDP continues to support this ultra-conservative agenda.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just about child care. It is also about early learning. My son will be turning three this coming Monday. When it comes to child care, I am fortunate to have my parents at home. Every medical study has shown that early childhood learning is what counts for children between the ages of three and six. The $100 benefit really becomes $70 in my case even though I have not applied for it. The $100 is taxable. </div>

I will concentrate on the egregious cut and elimination on human rights and justice issues.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para430269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I would like to start with the elimination of the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am from Moncton, New Brunswick. It is the cradle of Acadia and its capital. We have many Acadians who speak French. It is very important to emphasize that Acadians know what it is like to be a minority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the obligations of members of parliament, the most important and vital is to protect human rights, civil rights, the rights of individuals across the country. Throughout Canada we have minorities with religious and language rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moncton, New Brunswick has a long history of fighting for the minority rights of Acadians.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para430273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story really starts in the 1700s when the Acadian people settled most of the parts of what is now New Brunswick and what was then Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia was split into two parts, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, with New Brunswick being the better part, seeing no members from Nova Scotia near me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened is that the Acadian population in 1755 was put to an egregious deportation in the time of colonial wars, which we will not get into, but essentially they were from that time forward treated as second class citizens in the region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a long time from 1755 to 1960 but in 1960 the first French Acadian premier of a province that is 33.5% bilingual, or French and Acadian in population, was elected. His name was Louis J. Robichaud and he instituted a program of equal opportunity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will paint a picture of New Brunswick in the 1960s. French, a language spoken by one-third of the population, 40% in the city of Moncton, was not spoken at municipal hall meetings nor spoken in the provincial government. This was long before Pierre Trudeau's visionary Official Languages Act and, I might add, in a brief moment of non-partisanship, long before the vision of Progressive Conservative Premier Richard Hatfield of New Brunswick who brought forward the official languages act at the provincial level in the 1980s. It also was long before 2002 when the city of Moncton, where the largest number of Acadians live in the province in one place, became officially bilingual. This is a continuum from 1755 to today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important to remember is in New Brunswick in the time that I grew up, notwithstanding the great numbers of population who were French speaking Acadians, they had very few schools. They were fighting to keep their own hospitals. I will keep it at schools and hospitals because the other pillar I believe of social justice requires that we look at the judicial system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judicial system, because it was more federally regulated than the other two pillars that I wish to delve into, was very much ahead of its time with respect to according linguistic rights to the French speaking minority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the realm of schools let me paint the picture that many French speaking Acadians in New Brunswick were told. They were told that they would not go to school but that they would learn a trade. The schools in the area of Moncton, in southeastern New Brunswick and in other parts of New Brunswick did not have sufficient spaces for francophones until equal opportunity and Louis J. Robichaud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital care was not what it should have been either. It was primarily religious in nature. It eschewed public funding and did not get the public funding it deserved. With time and, I will say, with the progressive measures of people like Richard Hatfield, following on Frank McKenna as well, measures were adopted to certainly visit égalité dans ce secteur. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This drives me to the main point of how the cuts with respect to linguistic minorities in this country are absolutely shameful. The Conservative government should be ashamed of turning the clock back on the advances that have been made over time, particularly with respect to minority rights. With that I am speaking about the wholesale elimination of the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be asked, “Isn't that just a fund”, as the Conservative hyperbole would lead us to believe, “that funds lawyers to fight cases and otherwise increase their income?” No, it is not. I will give two good examples of what the fund is about. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it helped to ensure the survival of Montfort hospital in an area where the minority population required health care. This program provided funding for the new school L'Odyssée, which will open its doors in Moncton, New Brunswick.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para430284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are but two examples that I hope bring home to the Conservatives the importance of the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Montfort Hospital we do not have to speak about in great detail. It was a very well publicized case with the Mike Harris government. There are vestiges of the Mike Harris legacy in this House and in the government. We see it with the discussions and in the cuts that are made with respect to how government operates today. It is very much like Mike Harris in Ontario. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go into a complete brief of that. There is not the time, but there is time to explain that the Mike Harris government and many of the people who represent the Ottawa region in this House for the other side were all in favour of closing a hospital that served the needs of a French-speaking minority in this region. That was unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge was put under the court challenges program and it was won, legally and then politically. That is an important process to remember. Often the political battle is won after the legal battle is won. This may be another non-partisan moment where I say all governments are going to comply with the law, which is why we are so confident on this side that Kyoto will be implemented by the government because it will obey the law. The law told the provincial government of Ontario at the time that it must keep the Montfort Hospital open and it did.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the other case that is real and has a connection to the elimination of the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people in Moncton, New Brunswick decided, because of their growing numbers, that they deserved a school for their school-aged children, grades one to nine, in Moncton. They filed the brief against the provincial government. They started the action. The action was never pursued because when it was publicized and a copy was sent to the provincial government of the day, it agreed to build the school.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program does not challenge the federal government, as the former minister of justice suggests. It challenges other levels of government that have less open laws toward minorities, and it should have been kept. It is there to protect people who cannot protect themselves. It is there to encourage municipalities, boards, agencies and commissions, and even provincial governments, to do the right thing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are two cases that exemplify the reason why the elimination of the court challenges program is an unacceptable measure. It shows the meanness, the narrowness, and the unconstitutional posture of the government. It shows that it is just Mike Harris writ large, on the blanket of this country, and right-thinking Canadians will not stand for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is why I am very proud that our leader and other members of this chamber have risen today and said this is enough. There is no vision that includes everyone in Canada on that side. We will take the time it takes in this House to show to Canadians that the vision from that government is not a vision that will sustain a country. It may sustain pockets of people who think like it does, but it does not sustain a patchwork of Canadians who deserve equality rights for minorities and a better country in the future.</div>

It is where I come from. It is what I have lived as a municipal politician for some time. However, I do understand the growth of minority communities, in general, in Canada, and I do understand that there are language needs that surpass the Official Languages Act, but are nevertheless met with the Canada Health Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were quite gratified to meet officials in western Canada who provide, in British Columbia, for instance, at the provincial level, services in health and education in many languages. If those were to be denied, the court challenges program would be in place to guarantee that a member of a British Columbia Sikh community, for example, who was denied health care in his language so that he could understand what the doctor was saying to him and the doctor could understand what he was saying, could use it if it was egregious.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I compliment the Government of British Columbia but I do not think that is the case. But if it were, if it were flatly denied by policy, by a government agency, board, commission, then the court challenges program would have been there to respond to the needs of all minority populations in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a shame that the Conservative government does not care about the Acadians in Moncton, New Brunswick, and it does not seemingly care about the Sikh community in British Columbia. What a shame that it just does not care.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, minority communities all across our country, and increasing numbers in these days, support the government. They come from parts of the world where they understand what it means to have solid values. Often they line up more with small “c” conservative values. They are hard-working, industrious and entrepreneurial people. They come into this country and they have a value base. They have a work ethic that is very much in sync with the goals and the aspirations of all Canadians that this party clearly supports.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask if the member might be more accurate on the record, a little more charitable actually in his remarks, and acknowledge the fact that this party does in fact have the support of a lot of immigrant people and ethnic communities across our country instead of putting the misinformation as he did in the manner before?

    </p><a name="Para430308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few hours I have been re-reading the Liberal Party opposition motion. This is nothing short of a motion of defiance. I would say we are on the brink of having an election, judging by this motion. There is so much to criticize about this government that has been in power for a year and a few weeks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start with the opposite of what my colleague from Moncton said. In other words, I will start by talking about court challenges. I sat on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights and we heard from representatives of Canada's linguistic minorities. They explained to us the importance of this right to bring a challenge in the courts and what a small portion of the federal budget this right represented, compared to the impact it will have on the stakeholders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is devastating. I hope that someone from the other side of the House will listen. What this government did by cutting this program, that barely cost anything but gave rights to the communities, is devastating. I am talking about francophone communities outside Quebec and, of course, anglophone communities in Quebec. With respect to francophones outside Quebec, just one example will suffice to show this House the importance of the court challenges program. I am talking about the Montfort Hospital. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard from people representing the hospital. They explained that the few thousands of dollars they received allowed them to appeal to the Supreme Court. The minister, who was President of the Treasury Board, but has since changed portfolios and is now the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105835,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105835&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Environment</A>, said that he was proud to announce to the representatives of the Montfort Hospital that they had won. I find this outrageous and hypocritical. I could use other words that are unparliamentary, but I will let you use your imagination. These people had to fight the government, but they managed to win their case before the Supreme Court. If the government, represented then by the now Minister of the Environment, had truly been in agreement, then it should have just reimbursed all the legal costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the court challenges program must be brought back in as soon as possible because it is critical to the survival of cultural minorities in this country. Over the next five or six years, several francophone communities could disappear if they do not get the rights they have a right to—pardon the redundancy—to file appeals with the courts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go a little farther with that and talk about this government's hypocrisy—yes, hypocrisy—with respect to the summer career placement program. I live in a region called <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78785,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78785&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</A> that I am proud to have represented for nearly two and a half years now. We never thought that the summer career placement program was a social assistance program for students. We still do not think so. We fought for it and we asked for a program that would bring students to our regions, keep them there, and enable them to pursue their studies in areas that interest them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I saw students in pharmacy, accounting, administration, tourism and more come back to <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78785,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78785&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Abitibi—Témiscamingue</A> to spend the summer there rounding out their studies.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330">(1330)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para430315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just do not understand. Nobody, not even the minister, has been able to explain to us why they are cutting such an important program. Even if they tried, they could not find a better way to score a direct hit on Quebec than to cut the summer career placement program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because unfortunately for young people from Abitibi—Témiscamingue, there is no pharmacy school in Abitibi—Témiscamingue. Unfortunately for us, forestry engineers are still being trained at Université Laval. Same thing goes for mining engineers and everything that has to do with tourism development. They get their training somewhere other than Abitibi—Témiscamingue. Young people from our region who want to further their education in those sectors have to go to university or even CEGEPs or vocational schools outside of our region. For example, the closest veterinary school is in Saint-Hyacinthe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer career placement program provided an opportunity to bring first-, second- and third-year students back to the regions, where they could find a job in their field of interest, such as with farmers or veterinarians, or even in accounting firms in the regions. Thus, students were able maintain a link to our region. By cutting this program, the government is forcing our students to stay in Montreal, Quebec City, Saint-Hyacinthe, Jonquière, or elsewhere in Quebec, rather than returning to our region for the summer to develop their skills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are preparing ourselves for the worst in our regions. We will fight this. I also hope that someone on the other side of the House will become enlightened, whether by the Holy Spirit, Mohammed or Buddha, and understand how important it is for the regions to preserve the summer career placement program. It is essential for our regions. If the Conservatives fail to understand, they will be reminded once again during the next election, certainly in Quebec and likely in other areas across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that were the only issue, we could probably accept it once again, but there is something else. I would like to talk about the judiciary. Let me just mention what the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> said yesterday in the House. It was rather strange. Yesterday, in response to a question asked in this House, the Prime Minister said that they want to make sure that they are bringing forward laws to make sure to crack down on crime and make our streets and communities safer. So far, I think everyone can agree on that. Where he went wrong is when he said that they want to make sure that their selection of judges is in correspondence with those objectives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call that profiling. That is what the government is doing. This is condemned by the Barreau du Québec and the Canadian Bar Association. The government is telling us, quite openly, that there will be profiling. This is unacceptable, completely unacceptable.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, because I have sat on judicial selection committees. What we want to know about future judges is whether they can hand down a judgment and whether they can do so independently of political and public opinion. This is an essential quality that we look for in judges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the announcement the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> made yesterday, we think that this will no longer be the case. The risk is that candidates for judgeships in the highest courts—the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal, the Superior Court of Québec and the Court of Appeal—will be asked whether they are willing to be harsher, lean more to the right and enforce more strictly the legislation we could adopt. This legislation has not yet been adopted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given what Canada is going through at present, it is a good thing that this government does not have a majority. It is a good thing. I hope that Canadians and Quebeckers will understand that if an election is held, this government must not be given a majority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look closely at this government, it is easy to see that it is a right-wing government modelled on George Bush's government in the United States. That is very dangerous for us. We have only to look at the role right-wing ideology is playing in judicial appointments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights was told that the government wanted to have police officers on selection committees and was asked why appeal court judges were on the committees. We believe, we hope and we know, because we have frequently pleaded before them: judges are independent and want to stay that way. Judicial independence should be a priority when judges are appointed in this country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore a $5.2 billion shortfall. This money was earmarked in the budget and was withdrawn and transferred elsewhere by this government. The residences in the aboriginal communities of this country are currently still in the 19th century. We all know how cold it is outside. This evening, when I go back to my riding, I will go by an aboriginal community in the La Vérendrye wildlife sanctuary. In this community, which is called Kitcisakik, people still get water with a pail. In Winneway, an aboriginal community in Témiscamingue, there is so much mould on the walls of a number of the homes that they have to be destroyed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shortfall of $5.2 billion, which was allocated and which will not be there to help the aboriginal communities make up for lost time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand homes were to be built for the Inuit and the aboriginal peoples of this country, and that will not be done. Knowing that the birth rate among aboriginal women of this country is 3.4 per woman, we realize that there is currently a population explosion. If nothing is done, there will be major health problems.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that today, in 2007, aboriginal communities have the highest rate of tuberculosis in Canada? That is unacceptable. That does not make sense. This government must absolutely listen to reason and realize that it is headed down a dead-end street. It must get back to reality and realize that the first nations need additional monies to survive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I will say that we will be voting in favour of the Liberal motion because the one thing we want is for this government to understand that it can no longer continue down the path it has taken. This has to stop. It must rethink its decision and understand. There is no way we are going to allow right-wing judges, with a conservative ideology, to be appointed in this country. There is no way. There is no way we are going to axe programs such as the summer career placement program. That is unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is totally unacceptable for the $5.2 billion earmarked for aboriginal peoples to be reallocated. This government must be made to understand that we can no longer tolerate this situation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my day, we had English-language schools. They were called French, but they were English. The teachers were francophone, but all the books we had to read were in English. The administration was francophone, but the classes were taught in English. After grade 12, when I went to a French-language university, I was at a disadvantage, in terms of language, and that was very difficult. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics in Canada tell us that in the Atlantic provinces, particularly for minority language groups, the literacy rate is very low.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, jobs are also being cut for young students who are now in universities and schools and preparing for their future. They are losing their funding, as are women who want to enforce their rights. At the same time, this government says that it supports the Charter of Rights, but it supports it by taking away the oxygen it needs to survive.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it hard to imagine that this government can have gone this far.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They say that they want to abide by the Charter of Rights, and I agree with them entirely.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was interested in his comments about the aboriginal issue. During the election campaign, the Conservatives promised to honour the Kelowna accord.

The Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development quietly let me know that they did not want to recognize the Kelowna accord because nothing was signed and the government was not committed. We suspected—and I still suspect, with all due regard—that they do not want to recognize the Kelowna accord because it comes from the Liberals. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would go further, though. If only they had made the same $5.2 billion available, in whatever form they wanted. They can call it the Calgary accord or the Kashechewan accord, if they want. That is what we criticized the government for. It is not true that the government has invested more money than would have been spent under the Kelowna accord. We have all the figures. This $5.2 billion is what the aboriginal peoples were supposed to receive. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is what is unacceptable and that is why our aboriginal peoples in Quebec and Canada and our Inuit in the far north now find themselves in need. Even their basic needs are not being met. There will be lawsuits coming up in regard to health care. The department is going to have some serious problems over the next few months. </div>

It is a motion that really speaks to the track record of the Conservative government since being in power for the last year. This motion speaks to the fact that the minority government has failed. It has failed when it comes to the issue of the environment. It has failed to provide leadership when it comes to the issue of health care. It has failed to provide leadership when it comes to an issue that is important to so many families and parents across this country, and that is the issue of child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the social development critic, I have had the opportunity to meet with numerous child care advocacy groups and Canadian parents. I have listened to Canadian families and the struggles and challenges they face on a daily basis because the government has neglected its promise and commitment to create child care spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives promised over 125,000 child care spaces, spaces that they would create for Canadian families, and that they would invest in early learning and childhood development. We have seen that the government has broken its promise because it has delivered zero of 125,000 spaces. It is unfortunate that child care centres, child care advocacy groups and parents are now struggling to find out what they will do on April 1 to ensure that children actually have the very best. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month we heard from child care advocacy groups. They provided a report card for the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the Conservative government. In a number of different areas child care advocacy groups gave the government a failing grade. On universal child care the Prime Minister was provided with a grade of F. The report stated that the Prime Minister has trouble understanding some basic concepts, and his major term project, the universal child care plan, is certainly not child care because it is certainly not a plan and it is certainly not universal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that many Canadian families and parents are going to be in for the shock of their lives when they file their tax returns because they will realize that the $1,200 a year child care plan by the Conservatives is actually taxable. Many Canadian parents and families will have to give money back to the government. They are going to have to give almost $31 a month per child back to the government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In true soldier fashion, Sergeant Tower insists that he was just doing his job when he led two of his comrades through 150 metres of enemy fire to help a group of Canadian soldiers who were pinned down and had suffered heavy casualities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that day Sergeant Tower learned that four soldiers, including his best friend, were killed during the battle. His courage and selfless devotion to duty figured significantly in the survival of the remaining platoon members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier since the age of 17, Sergeant Tower is proud of his troops, his country and his mission and he humbly points to those who did not come home as the true heroes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when heroes do manage to come home, like Sergeant Tower, it is a privilege to recognize and thank them for their service to Canada, to peace and to democracy, and I am humbled to do so today. </div>

    </p><a name="Para430414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some crime is down in Canada, but violent crime is increasing at an alarming rate. It is time for a new approach. Hard-working families in Surrey deserve to feel safe on their streets and in their homes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting smart on crime means focusing on the three Ps: prevention, policing and punishment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevention is important to stop crime in the first place. It costs a few hundred dollars to help a youth in Surrey get a summer job. It costs $150,000 a year if that same youth gets involved in a gang instead and gets sent to prison.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate policing is crucial. We need to ensure that the Surrey RCMP has the people and the resources it needs to keep our street safe When a person commits a crime, there should be appropriate punishment. This guiding principle is needed to protect our community from those who would prey upon it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many politicians talk about getting tough on crime, and I agree, but not with oversimplified answers to complex questions.</div>

    </p><a name="Para430657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, since getting elected, has had no plan of action and no leadership when it comes to addressing the issues that are important to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin, Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78535,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78535&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg South Centre</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was speaking previously, I was talking about child care and the fact that the government has failed to provide leadership. It has failed to have an action plan when it comes to addressing the issue of child care spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give an example for the parents and families who are watching today. A two income family from Ontario, each of whom earns $40,000, will be in for a shock when they complete their taxes. They will need to pay back almost $31 a month per child to the government. That is almost a third of the money that Canadian families have already spent on child care. This tax grab of $224 million is in addition to the $400 million that the government has made by cancelling the young child supplement. This amounts to $624 million that the Conservative government will be making on the backs of Canadian families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unacceptable to think of the impact that this will have on low income parents. How will low income parents and Canadian families be able to provide for their children and invest in early learning and child care? In the long run, I believe it will be the Conservative government that will cash in on this particular deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that last week, child care advocates, Canadian parents and families released a report card. I received many calls from my own riding of Brampton--Springdale and listened to the frustrations of parents who live in Brampton. I also listened to the frustrations of parents who live out on the west coast, the east coast and up north. They were all frustrated with the fact that there are simply no child care spaces because the government has failed to deliver spaces, despite the fact that it promised over 125,000 spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this report card that was given by child care advocacy groups, it spoke about the fact that when it comes to a parent's choice, the government would receive a D-minus, because the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> had sent cheques, as promised, but the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> actually ignored parents who said that they needed quality child care spaces.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First nation leaders need to make a difference for this generation of children and redress the breach of rights for children of generations past, but unfortunately, we know that the Conservative government has failed the children of the first nations community by cancelling the Kelowna accord and by cancelling investments in the area of health, of education and of infrastructure. It has failed the first nations communities all across the country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us talk about the issue of homelessness, another area where the Conservative government has failed to deliver. As a result of its inaction and the inadequate leadership that has been demonstrated, millions of Canadians who are homeless will be left out in the cold. Shelters are being left in the limbo. The homeless are wondering what they will do next. All of this because the government has failed to demonstrate leadership. It has failed to have an action plan because the funding is in limbo.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about homelessness and having affordable housing, the Liberal government put forward the SCPI program, which helped over 150,000 Canadians who experienced homelessness each year. The SCPI program was an essential tool and an effective approach to ensure that the needs of homeless people were addressed. However, at the end of the day, the Conservatives once again have failed to deliver. They have failed to ensure that these types of great programs can address the people who need it most, the homeless in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have made numerous cuts. They have cut over $1 billion to important social programs, important programs that matter to Canadians regardless of where they live. They have cut $18 million to the national literacy program, $55 million to student summer programs, $45 million to affordable housing and $10 million to the Canadian volunteer program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask ourselves this. What does the minority Conservative government have against the most vulnerable in our society? What does the Conservative government have against the women in our country? What does the Conservative government have against children, seniors, visible minorities and first nation communities? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for the government to step up to the plate and get the job done. Canadians are counting on them.</div>

He broke both promises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, budget 2006 presented the Conservatives an opportunity send a strong signal to aboriginal communities that they honoured them, celebrated them and valued them. From the outset, they have done nothing but insult the aboriginal people, beginning with their refusal to honour the Kelowna accord. It is clear that the issues surrounding Canada's aboriginal peoples are not of primary concern to the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know Kelowna was an important initiative. It was an initiative that was built on relationships among the Government of Canada, the leadership of first nations and the leadership of the 13 provincial and territorial governments. We had 18 months of consultation and 28 round tables, dealing with issues of housing, water, education, economic development, governance, capacity building, all of which the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Prime Minister</A>, in a radio ad during the election campaign, promised to honour. As soon as the time came for him to show that he meant what he said, it was gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to underline that we all know this money was booked. The Department of Finance confirmed it. The former minister of finance confirmed it. The commitment to aboriginal people is, at best, tepid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to program cuts, the Conservatives have abandoned the aboriginal procurement policy. They have abandoned, as my colleague said, child care funding for first nations. They have eliminated the first nations' stop smoking program. Aboriginal language funding, which the minister took pains to speak about this morning, has been slashed, and we have heard an outcry from aboriginal leadership across the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own province the doors of Aboriginal Literacy have been closed and people have been laid off.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital projects have been cancelled. Capital projects that have been promised and designated for schools have been eliminated. Just this week I heard of a school in which the walls were caving. The teacher has chosen to have the class at home in the living because the school is not big enough or conducive to education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are hearing a lot of rhetoric across the way and we are seeing a lot of inaction, a lot of juggling moneys around to make it look like they are doing something, but not much is happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear much about how the government is the champion of human rights. This party will not take second place to anybody on human rights. The Conservative government not only opposed the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People, but it opposed it. Twenty years of work was done by our aboriginal communities to ensure it had a place at the United Nations and the government chose to lobby against it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now hear a great deal about the repeal of section 67 of the Human Rights Act. I want to make it clear I have sympathy for the intent and I support it. However, the government is going about it all wrong. The minister said this morning that the act was introduced 30 years ago and he said that he thought 30 years of consultation was enough. That is an insult to aboriginal peoples. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that it is a complicated issue. We know that it deals with the issue of collective rights versus individual rights. We know that it has many ramifications in first nations communities and as I said in question period, we have this attitude of father knows best and we will tell them and they will do it. Aboriginal women from coast to coast to coast do not appreciate this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to speak to the issue of women's programing. As I said at the outset, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, during the election campaign, along with other leaders at the request of women's organizations, signed a pledge that indicated that he would honour the CEDAW declaration to support women's human rights and agreed that Canada had to do more to meet its international obligations on women's equality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the government do? Taking consultation from one particular group who I will quote from later, REAL Women, it determined that equality seeking organizations in this country have no place any more. Advocacy has no role. It is time just to provide services. It is a noblesse oblige charitable approach to women's issues. Women need the advocacy dollars. They need the support for equality seeking issues.</div>

Its comments are that the cuts are only offensive to the special interest groups of feminists whose extremist views are not supported by mainstream women. Mainstream women include the YWCA, the University Women's Club, provincial councils of women across the country, and the National Association of Women and the Law. There is a whole host of women's groups that would not like to be categorized as marginal feminist groups and that is who the government chooses to listen to.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard said that there are members opposite who indicate that the court challenges program cut was their favourite cut. How dare they? The court challenges program, which provided an opportunity for women, aboriginal people, and francophone Canadians to challenge inequities, to provide the resources for them to have someone speak for them in the courts, has not only been reduced but absolutely and unequivocally cut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be supporting the opposition motion. I find it reprehensible that government members are choosing only to listen to and govern for that narrow majority who will see them re-elected. Canadians do not want this kind of government. Whether they agree with the government or not, they expect their government to govern for all Canadians. Even Conservative supporters would want the government to govern for all Canadians. What we have is a very narrow casting of policy development and program initiatives.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the hon. member is this. If these advocacy groups were Conservative in nature, if they were advocating for policies that were friendly to the government, policies that are for rural Canada, women's networks, for conservative issues, for child care payments directly to mothers, and to take the Liberal's favourite whipping organization, REAL Women, if REAL Women or organizations like that were funded, would the member not call for funding cuts to those organizations?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinion on this side of the House is that all advocacy should be done privately and not through taxpayers' dollars. I wonder why the hon. member supports government subsidies only for certain points of view.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am speaking to when I speak to the issue of women is advancing the interests of women.

The women's health clinic is not ideologically driven. The women's health clinic looks at the indicators of poverty as it affects women's health and a major study has been funded by the Status of Women. That program received research.

What it found is that between 1997 and 2003 Canada's economy was the fastest growing among G-8 countries, but the problem is that there has been a decline in the quality of life for middle income people. Poverty is rising among children and new immigrants, and it is very difficult for the middle income earners to afford post-secondary education for their kids.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal spending stands at 11% of the economy, down from 16% in 1993, well below the national historic average. Only 38% of unemployed workers received government benefits, down from 75% in the early 1990s. More than 1.7 million households live on less than $20,000 a year and most are very precariously housed. They do not own their own home and spend more than 30% of their income on rent. This is during a time when we were having an economic boom. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the nineties there were steep cuts when the Liberal government was in power. What have the Liberals done to our economy and what are they planning to do? They have wrecked the middle class dreams of having a good standard of living with the steeps cuts in the mid-nineties.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among a myriad of issues, the motion before us today attacks the government on the process of appointing judges.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a desperate attempt to distract Canadians from the fact that the Liberals are in the process of rendering this country vulnerable to future attacks by terrorist organizations by gutting key provisions of the Anti-terrorism Act.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand why the Liberals would want to hide from this irresponsible and short-sighted position, but the House should not just take my word for it. Let us hear from some prominent Liberals quoted in recent media reports on this very issue.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another well-known Liberal, deputy prime minister and chair of the cabinet security committee, John Manley, said, “The most important responsibility of government is the preservation of order and the protection of its citizens.” I agree that one of our highest responsibilities as a government and as a Parliament is the protection of Canadian citizens.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these criticisms coming from within their own ranks, it is easy to see why the Liberals are asking the Canadian people to look away from their irresponsible choices and attempting to fabricate news on the government's judicial appointments with the mock self-righteous indignation that only Liberals can muster.</div>

What I find remarkable is that just over a year ago the Conservative, Liberal and NDP campaign platforms all called for tougher sentences for violent crimes, mandatory minimums for gun crimes, and a crackdown on organized crime and gangs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remember that each and every member of the three federalist parties, the NDP, the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, was elected to the House with a mandate to get tough on crime and specifically to introduce tougher mandatory minimum sentences for those who use a firearm in the commission of a crime against another Canadian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we have a year after the election? We have Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> which is before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights right now. While the Conservatives are holding up their end of the bargain by introducing and supporting the bill, we see the NDP and the Liberals seeking to gut provisions of that bill that would bring in tough sentences for people who use firearms. Cities, towns, villages, police, victims groups and everyday Canadians across this country are calling for these measures and we see the Liberals and the other opposition parties failing to support them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have a right to feel safe and secure in their communities. In fact, safe streets and secure communities have been touchstones of Canadian society since Confederation. Of course we all know, unfortunately, that in recent years this hard won reputation has been put to the test by rising rates of crime, particularly involving guns, gangs and drug activity. Our government promised to tackle this problem head on and that is exactly what we are doing. Since taking office last year, we have brought forward no fewer than 11 new legislative proposals that will help reduce crime and create safer communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of all parties in the House, we brought into force Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A> which creates new offences that specifically target street racing. We also passed legislation to strengthen the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. These changes will help to ensure Canada continues to be a global leader in combating organized crime and terrorist financing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government has committed further to provide $20 million over two years to support community based programs that provide youth at risk with positive opportunities and help them make good choices and avoid the culture of guns, gangs and drugs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made some progress, but there are still nine bills in Parliament that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> is committed to bringing into force. Among other things these bills would restrict the use of conditional sentences and impose mandatory minimum penalties for gun crimes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first bill dealing with conditional sentences was Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172003,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172003&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-9</A>. Again we witnessed at committee opposition members who were elected with a mandate to get tough on crime acting to gut this bill. This means that people who are convicted of luring a child, arson, auto theft, among other things, are going to be able to serve their time in the comfort of their own homes rather than serve time in prison.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have legislation to ensure tougher sentences and more effective management of dangerous offenders, including imposing stricter conditions on repeat offenders to keep such criminals from reoffending. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced legislation to strengthen the law against alcohol and drug impaired driving and to protect youth against adult sexual predators by raising the age of consent, the age of protection in fact, from 14 to 16 years. I believe there is a broad consensus among Canadians that raising the age of protection is the right thing to do. We know it is strongly supported by many who work with youth or advocate on their behalf.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward we will also focus on other initiatives that will improve our justice system. For example, we will continue to work toward establishing a victims ombudsman's office. I should add that as we hear testimony before the justice committee on any number of these bills, it is often the victim who is the forgotten voice in all of this. It seems that when an incident takes place too often the focus is on all areas but the perspective of the victim. It is time that we restored a role for victims in our justice system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our last budget committed $13 million per year until 2010 toward these types of initiatives. The government also committed to develop a new strategy to deal with illicit drugs. The strategy that we will introduce will put greater emphasis on programs that will reduce drug use and help Canadians, particularly our youth, lead healthier and safer lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on and on but I see that my time for debate is almost up. My point is that government is representing the concerns of Canadians and communities large and small. I am proud of our commitments in the field of justice and even more proud of our record for carrying them out. This is what Canadians expect of us and this is what we deliver.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to remind the hon. member that his government is a minority government, and in fact, was elected by a little more than a third of the electorate. The result of that is that his government cannot govern as if it has a majority. On this fearmongering on crime which seems to be the favourite touchstone of the Conservative government, he should recognize that the majority of Canadians also want their say on what the Criminal Code looks like.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the hon. member recognize that in a minority government he has to work with all the parties who collectively represent all Canadians, and that his party does not and cannot speak for all Canadians?</div>

It is unfortunate because the Liberals and the NDP both were elected with a clear mandate. I could read from their election platforms. The Liberals called for a doubling of the mandatory minimum sentences. The NDP called for an increase in the use and the terms of mandatory minimum sentences, as did our party, the Conservative Party. Yet when it comes time to put the rubber to the road, when it comes time to actually get something done, when it comes time to live up to our commitments that we made to the voters, our party is delivering.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder, when the member goes back to his riding, if he does go back to his riding, whether his constituents are telling him to take a soft on crime approach, the way his party's members on the justice committee seem to advocate, or whether they would appreciate a tougher on crime approach, an approach that respects the victims, an approach that respects public safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we clearly have here is a situation where all federalist parties represented in this House were elected with a mandate to get tough on crime and unfortunately, as I said earlier, there is only one party that is delivering. That is the Conservative Party of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for the hon. member and his colleagues in the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party to get their act together. They should stop obstructing justice reforms in this country. They should get with the program, get with Canadians and get tougher on crime.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada recognizes diversity as a fundamental and enduring characteristic of Canadian society. This country represents a coming together of many peoples who have learned over time to respect and mutually accept each other. This is what sets Canadians apart.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost 20 years ago, in 1988, the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney implemented the Canadian Multiculturalism Act, making Canada the first country in the world to adopt official legislation related to multiculturalism. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Canadian approach to embracing and managing diversity is a distinguishing characteristic of our country. The government actively aims to foster social cohesion and to build an inclusive society that is open to and respectful of all Canadians no matter their ethnic origin, race or religion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a solid legal framework that supports the principles of diversity, multiculturalism and the rights of all individuals. The Government of Canada is fully supportive of these principles. We believe this foundation enshrined in our Constitution helps ensure Canadians are protected from racism and discrimination.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to address emerging issues so that all Canadians have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential. We are working to strengthen the bonds of trust and loyalty, to build a strong Canadian society which recognizes and promotes its shared values in Canada and internationally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the multiculturalism program of the Department of Canadian Heritage, the government is working to build connections across diverse communities, connections that translate into cross-community and cross-cultural commitments to principles of freedom, mutual respect, and respect for the law. These principles are the foundation that enables diversity to flourish in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has built relationships with a large number of ethnocultural communities and organizations to strengthen the social cohesion and the inclusive society that we are committed to foster.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Departments and agencies are working together to help ensure Canada is an equitable society. An example of such an initiative is the Cross-Cultural Roundtable on Security, in which the Department of Canadian Heritage is working with the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to ensure that security measures which are essential to public safety do not have an adverse effect on our ethnocultural communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The round table engages Canada's diverse communities in an ongoing dialogue in matters related to national security. It provides a forum to discuss emerging trends and developments arising from national security matters. The round table also provides insights on how national security measures may impact Canada's diverse communities and promotes the protection of civil order, mutual respect and common understanding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important role because, as we all know, there are challenges associated with preserving human rights and civil liberties in this time of heightened security. I think we could all agree that we must continually work to achieve a proper balance between preserving those rights and freedoms and ensuring a safe and a secure society for all our citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is recognized worldwide as a nation where the principles of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law are respected and practised. Nations from around the world look to this country as a model of a healthy, well-functioning pluralistic society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of this international recognition can be found in the Aga Khan's decision to partner with Canada to establish a new Global Centre for Pluralism in Ottawa and also in His Holiness the Dalai Lama's decision to locate his international centre for peace and education in Vancouver.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Global Centre for Pluralism, to which our government has committed $30 million, will promote pluralism internationally as a means to advance good governance, peace and human development. It will support academic and professional development, provide advisory services and support research and learning in developed and developing countries. This is just one example of how we are proud to share our experiences and success with other nations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is moving forward to provide an additional $5.9 million annually over the next five years to the multiculturalism program's budget of $13 billion. This additional funding will allow for improved targeting of programs to address issues and challenges ethnocultural and ethnoracial communities are facing today. It will allow us to do more by paying a particular interest to issues such as marginalization of ethnocultural and ethnoracial youth, labour market integration of foreign trained professionals, and ethnocultural and ethnoracial official language minority communities and the ability of these communities to work effectively with the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will increase our outreach efforts to vulnerable ethnocultural and ethnoracial communities across the country to help them address these emerging and critical issues. Through the inclusive institutions initiative, we are encouraging federal institutions to take action to create a level playing field for Canadians of all ethnocultural and ethnoracial backgrounds. This initiative of $12.5 million over five years will provide matching funds to federal institutions to develop tools for building internal capacity to respond to ethnocultural and ethnoracial diversity and support community based projects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of historical recognition, this government did the right thing when the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, as promised, made a formal apology on June 22, 2006, in the House of Commons on behalf of the people of Canada for the Chinese head tax. This action was long overdue. It recognized a historical wrong that had a profound impact on the Chinese Canadian community, a community that has made a great contribution to the building of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government also announced that it would make symbolic ex gratia payments of $20,000 to living head-tax payers and to the spouses of deceased head-tax payers in order to give deeper meaning to the apology. We have followed up on our promise to put this symbolic payment program into place quickly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78766,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78766&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Canadian Heritage and Status of Women</A> announced two programs designed to commemorate the historical experiences of all ethnocultural communities that have been affected by immigration restrictions or wartime measures such as internment. We want to educate Canadians, particularly youth, about these experiences and to highlight the contributions of these communities to Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The community historical recognition program will make available $24 million for community projects and initiatives. As well, the national historical recognition program will devote $10 million to federal projects and initiatives that will ensure the experiences of these communities become known as part of the official story of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been consulting with the Chinese Canadian community, the Indo Canadian community, the Ukrainian Canadian community, and the Italian Canadian community and will continue to meet with communities that have been affected in order to ensure that these events of the past, which are so out of keeping with our present-day values, are widely known and never repeated. The government is also consulting with other communities affected by past wartime and immigration restrictions in order to recognize their historic experiences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to work together toward common goals to build a strong and inclusive Canada. One of these common goals, as stated by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, is the full participation of all Canadians. Our government is fully committed to achieving this goal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear to me that programs and initiatives that eliminate racism and discrimination, support full participation and make institutions reflective of the diverse population they serve, are crucial to creating a more inclusive and respectful society, one where every person, regardless of race, ethnicity, colour or religion, contributes to building a greater Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Canada we are building, a Canada where multiculturalism and respect for diversity are fundamental characteristics and values.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the Wheat Board director elections this past fall, the minister decided that he should manipulate the election. First, he had the gag orders, then he changed the voter list, taking 16,000 farmers off of it after the election was underway. In spite of those threats and undemocratic interventions by the Government of Canada, farmers returned a majority of pro-board directors in the election.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it gets worse. We in the House have been long calling for a clear vote on the future of the Wheat Board on barley and wheat. In fact, the farmers put forward what they believed should be a ballot with a question on it that was clear, concise, direct and not confusing. It passed the agriculture committee, was debated in the House and on December 12 of last year, in a vote of 165 to 121, the majority of members in the House voted that the government place before western grain farmers the question for which farmers had asked. What did the minister do? He ignored that. He showed contempt for the House. It goes on and on.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the Canadian Wheat Board is a farmer run organization. It was set up in 1998 with a board of directors and five appointed directors.

The Government of Canada never intervened before with directives, but the current government almost, on a weekly basis, sends directives to that marketing institution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were five government appointed directors on that agency, appointed for their expertise in marketing and international business. What did the government do?

As I stated in the House the other day, I am a fourth generation Saskatchewanian. My family still owns the land my great grandfather started to farm and my dad is still cropping it this year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People should know that when the monopoly power of the current Wheat Board was put into place, it was not voted in by farmers. It was put in during World War II by the government to lower the price of wheat, something the hon. member should have noted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the hon. member should also note and remember, particularly coming from a party that has been hostile to agriculture, its elimination of the Crow rate being one example of that, is that when farmers took the freedom to sell their own wheat what did the hon. member's former government do? It threw them in jail because they took the wheat they had grown and harvested, the wheat that they were unable to sell to the Wheat Board in some cases and tried to sell it to willing customers. That is the hon. member's agricultural policy, throwing farmers in jail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If farmers are so strongly supportive of the hon. member's party, why has it been a complete disaster in the Prairies, election after election for the last 50 years? In my riding, in nine out of the last ten elections the Liberal Party has finished in third place. If the hon. member supports western farmers and is speaking for them, why is his party so soundly rejected by the Prairies?</div>

    </p><a name="Para430866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want members to remember three numbers. The first is $25 billion. The second is $5 billion. The third is $0.5 billion. I know that by the end of my speech members will appreciate those three numbers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of $25 billion represents the biggest single loss to unit holders and shareholders on a Canadian stock exchange in one day. The figure of $5 billion represents the cost of a one per cent reduction in the GST. The figure of $0.5 billion represents the alleged tax leakage from income trusts. These three numbers represent the ultimate in incoherence and incompetence of any Canadian government, save except possibly the Mulroney era, but even the scandal plagued Mulroney government did not sink to that level of incompetence and incoherence.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government has no plans. Whatever plans it has on the environment and on the economy and on social economy, it really is not sharing with anyone else in this chamber or in this country. Members of the government, frankly, would not know a plan if it kicked them in the backside and that is clearly demonstrated by those three numbers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the $25 billion, members will recollect that during the election, the neo-conservatives said they would not tax trusts. At every whistle stop across the country, the Conservatives said that they would not tax trusts. On every occasion, the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the then finance critic said exactly the same thing, in spite of the serious questions raised about tax leakage in the Department of Finance paper in 2005.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of waiting for all of the evidence, he made this promise, and to the everlasting dismay of thousands of hard-working Canadians, they relied on that promise, to the detriment of their portfolios.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having gotten themselves inside the doors of power, they are now faced with the discipline of power, but for the first while, they frankly ignored all of the advice the Department of Finance would give them on various issues. If the Department of Finance said that a GST cut was not a very good idea, they ignored that. If the department said that tax credits would result in an incoherence and an inconsistency in the income tax system, they decided to ignore that as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the department said that the best thing to do was broad-base tax relief so that all Canadians received the same relief, that thresholds move up and rates move down, they instead raised the rates and then went on this propaganda campaign and said that they had lowered the rates. They demonstrated a unique technique, unique to the government, namely, take a lie, repeat it over and over until it takes on the force of truth.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incoherence mounting on incoherence mounting on misinformation; plans are not part of the lexicon of the government. The budget is generally written by the last guy out the door of the finance minister's office. This is, frankly, retail politics run amok.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ignored the advice that an entity tax judiciously applied to the point of leakage would probably address the major part of the issue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What quickly became clear at the hearings is that the minister had done no market analysis. Nothing. He had no idea of the consequences of his action. He did no study. He phoned no one. He was completely surprised, like all other Canadians, that this was going to cost Canadians $25 billion. He had nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when the committee asked for the basis for his analysis, he sent out blacked out documents so no one could make any kind of a reasoned analysis as to whether, in fact, he knew anything or if he did know something, on what basis he made his decision.</div>

I would like to give the House a bit of history. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Parliament a subcommittee was set up under the justice committee to investigate the methodology used for judicial appointments, not Supreme Court of Canada appointments but all other federal court appointments. A motion was brought forward by the Bloc Québécois which was prompted by a comment by a federally appointed judge in the province of Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge made a statement saying that lawyers who were sovereignists should not be considered for appointment to a federal court bench. That, quite frankly, was scandalous, but it seems a pattern that the Conservative government is prepared to emulate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, fairly extensive investigations were carried out over a period of six to eight months. An interim report was issued and we were working on the final report when the election intervened.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those investigations found that there was still an element of partisanship in the committees that screened judges for federal appointments. I have to say with no equivocation that there was no suggestion along the lines of the statement made by the judge in Quebec. The ideology was considered by those screening committees. It was found that partisanship was still intervening to some degree. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate has gone on in the House and around the country over the Conservative government's determination, and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister's</A> determination in particular, to politicize our courts. The Prime Minister is determined to make it a condition of appointment that one has to be “a strict constructionist” of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and of the Constitution and, and this is the most offensive part, that the candidate must support the initiatives of the government. That is as offensive as anything can be to the democratic process in this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have pillars of democracy in Canada. The House is one of those pillars. Elected representatives are significant pillars, but so is an independent judiciary. It must be as pure as we can make it. The judiciary has to be absolutely independent. </div>

We are in a situation where we simply cannot tolerate that position. Every member in the House, including every member of the Conservative Party, should appreciate that. The government should alter its course in this regard. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at a very severe risk of politicizing the judiciary. It seems to be the clear intent of the government. There are some 13 screening committees across the country. As a result of the government's approach to appointments at the screening committees, we are also at a high risk of politicizing police officers and police associations across the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just being reminded and I apologize to the House for this, but I intend to share my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78928,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78928&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Nanaimo—Cowichan</A>, who will be addressing the House in her usual eloquent fashion but on a different topic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to the politicization of police forces, what is being seen by the general public is the Conservative government lining up police agencies across the country on its side by appointing them not only to the screening committees but by making their vote the determining vote. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What used to happen before, if there was a tie, the judge who was on the committee would be the one casting the deciding vote. The government has taken that vote away from the judges only in the situation where there is a tie. Before, they had a vote on all occasions. Because of the structure where there are four government appointments and three that come from other sources, the law society, the bar association and the judiciary, the balance is now swayed in favour of the government appointments and the police officer representative is the one who has the balance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to conclude with these comments.

I too will be speaking in favour of this motion. I am going to address two parts of the motion. I want to talk specifically about budget spending cuts directed at aboriginal people and I also want to touch briefly on child care spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to budget cuts affecting aboriginal people I want to reference two documents. There has been much discussion about the appalling state of poverty for many first nations, Métis and Inuit people. In a document entitled “Federal Government Funding to First Nations: The Facts, the Myths and the Way Forward”, I want to highlight the fact that in this document it says that funding for core services such as education, economic and social development capital facilities and maintenance has decreased by almost 13% since 1999-2000. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document was written in 2004 so it is not talking about the current fiscal situation. We are all very well of the fact that there has been a 2% cap on spending for first nations people. That cap remains in place despite the fact that this population is growing much faster than the national average in many first nations communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to highlight the situation around poverty for first nations communities, the Assembly of First Nations is currently conducting a Make Poverty History: The First Nations Plan for Creating Opportunity. I will not quote from all of this document, but it clearly outlines the challenges facing first nations communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It talks about the fact that one in four first nations children live in poverty compared to one in six Canadian children. About one in three first nations people consider their main drinking water supply unsafe to drink and 12% of first nations communities have to boil their drinking water. Mould contaminates almost half of all first nations households.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the overall health and well-being of the communities, applying the United Nations human development index would rank first nations communities 68th among 174 nations. Canada has dropped from first to eighth due in part to the housing and health conditions in first nations communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those numbers are shocking. We have recently seen international organizations coming to Canada to highlight the desperate conditions on some of the reserves. I would argue that it is well past time for the House to come together and address in a meaningful way the conditions in many first nations communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to speak about child care, specifically the lack of affordable quality child care spaces that have been created in this country. Many of us in the House know that there is currently a campaign called Code Blue for Child Care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, in my province of British Columbia many child care activists have been writing, emailing, phoning and marching to raise awareness of both the federal and the provincial politicians about the state of child care in British Columbia. I know it is the same in other provinces, but because I am from British Columbia I specifically want to talk about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Code Blue for Child Care campaign is a nationwide campaign which attempts to have federal-provincial-territorial and other local elected officials work with the child care community to ensure that child care plans are being developed that address the needs in our communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Code Blue for Child Care is campaigning for four key areas. It is looking at restored multi-year federal funding so that provinces and territories can put in place systems that work for their communities. It is looking for federal child care legislation that lays out the principles of a pan-Canadian strategy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that point, in the previous government after many years of not moving forward on the national child care strategy, finally there was some movement. However, under the Liberals we failed to enshrine that in legislation when we had the opportunity to do that. Under the Conservatives we saw whatever gains we had made being stripped away and replaced by a program that is not creating child care spaces.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Code Blue talks about effective income support for families, in addition to quality child care and dedicated capital transfers for community based child care services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Child Care Advocacy Association of Canada had some very harsh words for the current state of child care in this country. Its press release states:</div>

I was quoting from a newspaper article that appeared in the <i>Lake Cowichan Gazette</i> on Wednesday, February 14, 2007. The newspaper reporter talked about the cuts in provincial funding by $2 per day per child aged three to five and $4 per day per child under three years old. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a couple of points around this. First, I wonder where the plan was to create child care spaces. We do not see a plan to create child care spaces. We do not see new child care spaces being created.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the $100 a month is taxable. We know that, on average, parents will end up with $80 a month and many parents are in a position where that does not remotely cover the true cost of child care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that what we have been asking for is a national child care program with concrete funds assigned to it, time lines attached to it and involvement from the child care community to ensure the plan is adequate. I would argue that is what we have always asked for and promoted and we will continue to advocate for it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para430952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to reiterate the government’s very firm commitment to the Official Languages Act and our unfailing support for linguistic duality throughout Canada. I also wish to talk about the achievements and policy and program directions that the new government has and continues to put forward with a view to advancing the equal status of both official languages and enabling the country to take full advantage of the riches afforded by this linguistic duality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a consensus on official languages, namely that the country’s linguistic duality is an essential component of the Canadian identity and an extraordinary asset for all of society. A recent CROP poll indicated that over 80% of Canadians share this opinion, which shows the great popularity of this Canadian value. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government has taken a clear position in favour of the Official Languages Act. We are making sure that English and French have the same status regarding their use in all parliamentary and governmental institutions. We support the development of official language minority communities and we will help them to contribute fully to the prosperity of our country. We are promoting the full recognition of English and French throughout Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have demonstrated our support for linguistic duality on numerous occasions. Indeed I would remind the House that we contributed to the adoption on November 25, 2005, of the Act to Amend the Official Languages Act, which reinforced Part VII of the act. This part states the commitment of the Government of Canada to foster the development of official language minority communities and to promote the full recognition and use of both official languages. A collective resolution by the caucus brought about the passing of this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I recall that this act was passed in spite of the opposition of the Bloc Québécois, which claims to be the great defender of francophones but which refused to support this positive measure for francophones outside Quebec?</div>
    </p><a name="Para430957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to mention the personal and complete commitment by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister </A>himself to official languages, particularly the French language, which he uses frequently.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government’s support for linguistic duality as a foundation of Canadian society remains unequivocal. I wish to add that, for us, this support includes the recognition of the Quebec’s key and crucial role in the vitality of the French factor in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, we are committed, unlike the previous Liberal centralizing government, to practising an open federalism that recognizes the unique place of a strong and dynamic Quebec within a united Canada. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para430960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have five priorities on our government's agenda that will enable us to come closer to our ultimate goal of building a stronger, more secure and better Canada. In my view, I cannot imagine a strong Canada without the contribution of our official language minority communities, big or small, located across Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I now want to mention the policy and program directions that the minister has brought forward in carrying out her mandate and point out the many accomplishments over the last year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have many challenges to meet in maintaining and further enriching the impressive heritage bequeathed to us by former generations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, there is education, where we need to redouble our efforts in order to ensure that young francophones not only start their educational paths in French but complete them in French as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why we have signed bilateral education agreements with all the provinces and territories worth a total of $1 billion over four years. These agreements will enable young people from minority communities to go to school in their own language. In addition, they will help all young people in Canada to learn their other official language. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to these agreements, the official language minority communities are able to implement programs adapted to their realities. Young people receive an education in their own language and attend schools managed by their community. They flourish in their own language from a very young age while developing an even stronger sense of belonging to their community. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In partnership with the provincial and territorial governments, we also announced the construction and renovation of community spaces in New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We count on immigration as well to ensure the demographic and economic growth of our communities and country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last budget, our government announced an additional $307 million for immigrant settlement in Canada. We also brought forward measures to establish the Canadian agency for the assessment and recognition of foreign credentials. This will also help the French-language minority communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of official languages requires the involvement of many different partners and that is why we have paved the way for open, respectful cooperation with all levels of government and organizations from all sectors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that this spirit of cooperation that the government is fostering among the various official language stakeholders was very present at the Ministerial Conference on the Canadian Francophonie, which was held last October and co-chaired by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78775,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78775&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister for La Francophonie and Official Languages</A>. At this meeting, along with the ministers from the provinces and territories, we decided to focus our action on young people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young Canadians are open to linguistic duality and all its advantages. They are more and more bilingual, mobile and attuned to the new technologies. They represent our future, a future full of promise. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our support for the communities could be seen as well in the creation of the Assemblée franco-ontarienne and our $660,000 grant to the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada to organize its 2007 summit of francophone and Acadian communities. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have signed a cooperation agreement with the anglophone community sector in Quebec. We want to maintain an open and honest dialogue with this community which contributes significantly to Quebec's national and international reputation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that the needs and the challenges of anglophones in Quebec are different and varied. Moreover, members of this community are models of bilingualism. This is why we must continue to work together to highlight our linguistic duality across the country.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para430975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also signed important agreements totalling nearly $64 million over four years for minority language services. Together, these agreements will allow members of official language minority communities to strengthen their ties and ensure that their voices are heard, loud and clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what can be accomplished by cooperating, not only with federal partners, but also with other levels of government and with the private sector, and by developing ways to focus on the economic, cultural and social benefits of linguistic duality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new government's cooperative approach has also proven itself in other areas, particularly in health care. In this area, innovative partnerships have been created with minority francophone and anglophone communities, and this is producing tangible results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the new Government of Canada intends to defend bilingualism with passion and heart. We want to work to increase equality between the two official languages in all federal institutions, to reinforce minority official language community vitality across the country, and to make sure that the two major linguistic communities in Canada understand and mutually enrich each other better.</div>

Her rhetoric was very nice and she read the text well. Unfortunately, there is a disconnect between what she said and what is really going on. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, one of the things this government did recently was cut the court challenges program for linguistic minorities in Canada. Basically, the government is telling minorities that if they think their language rights have been violated, they can just deal with it themselves because the government will not be giving them any money and will not help them defend their rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para430982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we recently learned that senior army officers will no longer be required to be bilingual. I find that completely unacceptable. I would like to know what my colleague thinks about that. Does she think it makes sense that our senior military officers do not have to be bilingual?</div>
    </p><a name="Para430983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we have recently seen that the government cannot even offer services in French to parliamentarians here on the Hill. Many government ministers do not have a single person on staff who can answer our questions in French. Some of these departments are very important. People in our offices—members who have francophone staff here—have all experienced that. They cannot find a single staff member in a minister's office who can speak French. </div>
    </p><a name="Para430984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Conservative Party member agree that rather than trying to teach the Liberals a thing or two—we all know they did not do their job—her government should set an example? Should the government not require all senior military officers to be bilingual? Should it not reinstate the court challenges program for linguistic minorities? Should ministers not set an example in their own offices by offering services in French to those House colleagues who need them?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A percentage of young people aged 13 to 15 reported being overweight. The new health commissioner said that today's overweight teenagers are tomorrow's heart attack victims.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the hon. member support a national health and nutrition program for every child under 18 in schools and community centres? This would be based on a flexible, made in Canada community development model, building on the existing knowledge base of local organizations and parent groups so kids would not be hungry and would have decent, healthy, nutritious meals in schools. Then they could learn properly, whether it is English, French or any other subject.</div>
