<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 11 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-222, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of 
expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required in 
employment), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak today to this private member's bill from the hon. member 
for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to make the cost of tools deductible 
from a mechanic's or auto worker's income. 
I approve of it 100% for this is a matter of 
fairness, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All professionals, for example health professionals such as 
dentists and physicians, like the hon. colleague over there, who 
is a well-known West Island doctor, have always been able to deduct 
every year from their income, or depreciate to some extent, 
their equipment and everything used in their practice.  The 
expenses incurred for this equipment or these tools may 
therefore be deducted from the income derived from their 
professional practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, that possibility is not available to 
professionals in the automotive field, those whose livelihood 
depends on their practising their trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a former life I spent a good 15 years as a mechanic for 
a mining company on the North Shore, at Sept-Îles. 
Although that was as long ago as 1972 or 1973, I remember a 
simple pound and a half hammer, about 1,600 grams in today's metric 
terms, cost about $24 or $25 each at the time, and that was nearly 
30 years ago. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1105

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone working as a mechanic knows how easy it is to lose or 
damage a tool or even break it and have to replace it.  None of 
this can be deducted from the worker's income, and I find that 
terribly unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect to the bill that I question.  This would 
be an incentive to young people graduating from technical 
schools, from motor mechanics' training, for example.  This 
would be an incentive to entering the trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether young people are studying philosophy or motor mechanics, 
they run into unavoidable costs such the costs of food and 
housing for the period they are taking their training and all of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the profession may be less noble than that of law or 
medicine or some other career, these people need to eat.  They 
generally run up a debt like all the other students in the 
various professions.  They come out of technical school or Cegep 
vocational training with just as much debt as those graduating 
from the same level in the academic course and heading toward 
the priesthood or some other field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have a lot of debts.  Unfortunately, auto mechanics 
do not earn as much as my colleague opposite, to whom I referred 
earlier, as an eminent medical practitioner. 
These workers face major expenses when they buy their 
professional material, yet they cannot deduct these costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this deduction would be an incentive in that it would 
encourage young people to become automotive mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early sixties, with the quiet revolution in Quebec—but the 
same is also true for the other provinces—education became free 
under the social programs that were put in place. People used 
terms such as “universal” and “free” anyway. Education was for 
everyone. Anyone who wanted to get an education could have 
access to training, right up to and including the university 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result was that we ended up with large numbers of 
philosophers, lawyers, notaries, medical doctors and geologists. 
People shifted away from traditional occupations. 
Now, after 30 or 40 years of this somewhat easier access to 
higher education, we realize that we have moved away 
significantly from traditional occupations. There are shortages 
in certain trades, including plumbing, worksite mechanics and 
automotive mechanics where, unfortunately, salaries are not very 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of automotive mechanics, a lot of additional 
training is required outside working hours and is not paid. 
This includes all the new car models and all the electronic 
systems that are now an integral part of automotive mechanics. 
Generally speaking, those who want to do well, who want to take 
a step further and upgrade their skills must do so during their 
spare time, in the evening or on weekends, at a college or even 
a university, without being paid for their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They may also have to learn things in the electrical field, 
since this is now a major component of automotive mechanics. 
Indeed, the mechanical and electrical fields often complement 
each other for the greater benefit of automobile owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people make a huge personal contribution and they take 
their own work performance very seriously. 
In my opinion, the least we could do would be to make the costs 
of providing tools required to pursue such of a career—often a 
lifelong one—deductible or depreciable under a provision that it 
will be up to Revenue Canada to establish. At the very least, 
there should be a kind of yearly tax depreciation which could be 
scaled over not too long a period, perhaps two or three years, 
in order to reduce the fiscal cost of providing the tools 
required for employment.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, given his good nature, if the minister feels able 
to do it and if he is committed to make these professions or 
trades accessible, he could not only apply that new provision to 
auto mechanics but extend it also to worksite mechanics or 
electricians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Snap-On tool like an 8-inch screwdriver costs $20. When it 
touches a contact a spark can result. That will wreck the tip 
of the screwdriver and there goes $20, perhaps one-quarter of 
the electrician's or mechanic's daily pay. 
If he touches two wires with the tip of the screwdriver, his 
salary for a quarter of his day's work is already gone. This is 
if he did not get a ticket for parking on the street in front of 
his employer's building. At that point, he would have nothing 
left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is a tax equity concern. A credible government 
must respond to the expectations of all its citizens, of all 
those who ply a trade, often much more to the benefit of the 
government than their own. These people pay taxes. We know our 
tax system. It is not on a straight line but on a rising curve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reason for concern. This should have been done a 
long time ago. Under the bill of the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, we must at all 
costs allow these mechanics to deduct from their income the 
amounts required to buy a tool kit that is essential for their 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the Minister of Finance to agree to the request of my 
colleague from Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans and 
to have a little compassion for those who, unfortunately, were 
not lucky enough to become a finance minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Peschisolido (Richmond, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour to speak to Bill C-222. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell a story about my growing up in Toronto.  My 
father was a labourer who worked very hard as a painter.  His 
tools were very important to him because they were very expensive 
and they were his key to advancing in Canada.  I can therefore 
relate to mechanics and to individuals who want to move ahead for 
themselves and for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that I am somewhat surprised by the government's 
reaction to this private member's bill.  The government talks 
about upward mobility and fairness.  It talks about educating and 
training our citizens for the future.  Here is a very simple, 
cost effective and equitable way of doing just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where mechanics because of their jobs are 
forced to buy tools.  This is a condition of their employment. It 
seems common sense to me and basic that these individuals are 
acting like business people.  Yes, they are on an employment 
contract but they are acting as entrepreneurs.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our tax code we put forth certain elements to deal with the 
situation.  Members on the other side have argued that it is an 
employment contract.  However I point to other sections of the 
tax code that deal with musicians, loggers or chain saw operators 
where this type of provision is there to take into account their 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know mechanics in my riding of Richmond who have had to spend 
$40,000 to $50,000 to get tools for their trade.  The bill makes 
sense, particularly at a time when Canada needs trained mechanics 
and blue collar workers.  I read in a report the other day that 
there is a shortage of over 60,000 workers in this field alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this is not the ideal way of dealing with the problem. 
However it is a reaction to a Liberal government that deals with 
the rhetoric of upward mobility and education of the workforce but 
which, when it comes to dealing with concrete situations, does 
not act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a small, family run automotive parts business in my 
riding.  It has six or seven mechanics.  They would love to hire 
more individuals but they simply cannot find skilled, trained 
people to hire.  Hiring new people would have an impact on the 
economy. I am not an economist, but I believe there are similar 
situations across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Quebec has talked about situations he knows of 
personally.  I urge all members in the House to go beyond party 
affiliations and look at the merits of the bill.  The bill does 
not deal with professionals who are making $200,000 to $300,000. 
It does not deal with individuals who have access to lobbyists. 
There will not be many wine and cheese parties to discuss this 
type of thing.  The individuals the bill will affect are the 
backbone of our country.  They are the small, middle class people 
trying to move up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking passionately on the issue because it touches me. 
My parents came here from Italy with nothing.  They used this 
type of work to move up the ladder that I call the Canadian 
dream.  At the end of the day, when we vote as a House, I urge 
all members to look at the merits of the case and vote positively 
for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Duplain (Portneuf, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I wish 
to inform the hon. member for Chambly, who referred to mechanics 
as a less noble trade, that this trade is as noble as any other. 
In my opinion, it is a very important trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill would amend the Income Tax Act to 
help mechanics pay for the cost of providing tools for their 
employment if they are required to do so under the terms of 
their employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment would permit mechanics to deduct purchase, 
rental, insurance and maintenance costs of their of tools. 
Mechanics would benefit from a tax deduction applying on the 
cost of tools under $250. This amount could be adjusted for 
inflation. The cost of tools exceeding this amount would be 
subject to a kind of capital cost allowance, which would be set 
by special regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada understands the situation that this 
bill aims to solve. We are aware that tool costs can be 
significant, particularly at the start of a career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that, I am happy to say that there is merit in the 
idea behind the private member's bill and I wish to congratulate 
the member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans for 
his dedication and perseverance. However, I must also point out 
that this bill ignores some very important issues, such as the 
need to ensure that our fiscal system remains fair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial aid to one particular group of employees can be 
justified only if those employees have to spend substantially 
more that others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanics do not form an homogenous group.  There are many types 
of mechanics.  Members need just think about the car maintenance 
technicians and all those specialists who repair brakes, 
transmissions, radiators and fuel injection systems; the members 
know what I am talking about.  There are also the bus and truck 
mechanics and even the automotive body repairers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is at this point that I begin to have some doubts. 
What about the aviation mechanics or heavy machinery mechanics 
who repair the large vehicles used in forestry, mining and 
construction?  Do they have to spend large sums for the purchase 
of their tools? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we must give a tax break, it should be given to the 
appropriate persons, to those who must incur employment related 
expenses substantially higher than those of the others. The 
persons I have just mentioned are all mechanics. However, they 
do not all have the same expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with a problem.  If we grant a tax benefit to all 
mechanics, we will find out that some mechanics do not incur 
major expenses whereas some others do.  For some of them, the 
expenses are comparable to those of carpenters or plumbers, for 
example. 
Why, then, should the member make a distinction that would 
amount to discrimination against other trades, and why should 
the same tax break not be granted to all? How could we explain 
to many other employees that this tax measure is for mechanics 
only, even if they incur similar costs in their job? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not extend this measure to all employees? We have to 
recognize that this would be very costly, potentially over $1 
billion. It would limit the government's capacity to grant tax 
cuts to all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, it would be difficult to ensure that the expenses are 
effectively incurred for employment purposes. Many items can be 
used for personal as well as professional purposes, like 
computers, software and cell phones. 
A tax deduction for employment expenses for all taxpayers does 
not seem to be advisable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do have a tax break, we believe it should be only for 
taxpayers who incur exceptionally high employment related expenses, 
especially when compared to their income. Is this really the 
case for mechanics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, let us take a mechanic who already has his tools. 
How much should he spend to maintain and upgrade these tools? A 
survey by the Canadian Automotive Repair and Service Council 
shows that the average expense is about $1,500 annually. Some 
spend more and some spend less. It is reasonable to think that 
many other employees have employment related costs similar to those of 
mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, is there any reason to believe that these expenses are a 
heavier burden for mechanics than for other workers? The members 
of the House know full well that mechanics are not rich. 
However, mechanics make a better living that other workers. Let 
us try to put them in the proper perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, when the last census was taken, the average annual wage 
of an automotive service technician was approximately $38,000. 
The same year, the average wage of a university graduate was 
slighter higher than $42,000. Workers with no university diploma 
earned, on average, $26,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the situation of mechanics is good compared to the 
national average. And their situation is also good compared to 
many other trades such as bricklaying and woodworking, where the 
average annual wage is approximately $34,000.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not appear that, as a whole,  mechanics form a group 
that incurs employment related expenses that are substantially higher, 
in proportion to their income, than those incurred by other 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to another point. When we recently debated a 
similar bill, I was astonished to hear all members, except for 
one, talk about the effect that the cost of tools is having on 
all the mechanic apprentices entering into the trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years, the Automotive Industries Association of Canada 
has made a priority of the recognition for tax purposes of 
expenses incurred by mechanic apprentices. According to the 
association, the cost of tools represents a barrier to the 
recruitment of mechanic apprentices. 
I would like to take a few moments to address this position and, 
more particularly, the proportion of their income mechanic 
apprentices spend on tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the first question is, how much does it cost for a 
starter toolbox and tools? Well, the CARS council says it can 
cost between $3,000 and $4,000. This is just the basic starter 
kit. The apprentice would add more tools as he or she progressed 
through the apprenticeship program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a typical four year apprenticeship, it would not be 
unheard of to spend $15,000 and sometimes more. And so let us 
compare that to what they earn. The average annual income is 
about $20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would certainly be a challenge for a mechanic apprentice to 
buy $3,000 worth of tools on an annual income of $20,000. In 
some cases the costs might even make someone think twice before 
going into this line of work, as industry representatives have 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill before us today has some laudable goals, 
but it also has some significant shortcomings.  It does not take 
into account the different circumstances of various kinds of 
mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one level, we have apprentices who pay somewhere around 
$3,000 a year for tools, on an annual salary of $20,000. And we 
have mechanics spending around $1,500 a year on tools, but 
making a great deal more.  The bill fails to distinguish between 
those who can reasonably afford to cover tool costs and those 
who might really need some help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax relief proposed in this bill needs to be better 
targeted.  I therefore urge members of this House not to support 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with great pride that I rise to speak to the bill and I 
want to congratulate the Bloc member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The particular bill is one that I think can be described as 
being very straightforward and common sense in its approach to 
assisting a segment of our economy, mechanics specifically, that 
works extremely hard and is looking for a simple incentive, some 
signal on the part of the government that its contribution is 
valued and is recognized through tax relief.  It is to permit 
mechanics to deduct the cost of providing tools for their 
employment if they are required to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as if mechanics have a choice in the matter in terms 
of getting by without tools.  It is aimed specifically at 
mechanics who cannot benefit from either borrowed tools or tools 
that are owned by their employers and are required as a condition 
precedent to purchase tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many tools of the trade are extremely expensive, which can be quite 
a deterrent to individuals trying to enter the particular trade. 
The bill is aimed specifically at offering those individuals who 
have made a career choice some relief to enter into this chosen 
profession.  I commend the hon. member for bringing forward the 
matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many motions and bills in the House, this bill has been 
debated in the Chamber on numerous occasions, and quite 
ironically has seemingly received broad support.  Yet my fear, 
and I am sure the hon. member's fear, is that when it comes to a 
vote the government will not support this bill.  We got the 
inkling from the previous member's words that the government was 
not inclined to support this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, our party has brought forward similar motions 
and will support this legislation.  That comes as a result of 
having spoken to many individuals involved in the actual trade 
who are looking for such relief and are looking to parliament to 
show some leadership, vision and originality when it comes to 
offering tax relief to those who are most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, I met with numerous mechanics in my constituency 
of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  At their request, I brought 
this very issue to the attention of the current finance minister. 
Unfortunately, after doing so on their behalf, the Minister of 
Finance indicated that there was really little that could be done 
and little that he and his department were willing to offer as 
relief for those who found themselves in a position where in 
certain instances they were required to shell out anywhere in the 
range of $15,000 to $40,000 as a start-up cost to entering the 
trade of being a mechanic.  This is at time when the average 
mechanic's salary, as I am told and the statistics seem to 
support, is in the range of $29,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the high level of technology that is involved now with 
mechanics, there are occasions where they will in essence be 
required to, somehow through a mortgage, or a loan or otherwise, 
shell out more money than they are actually taking in in their 
first year.  This presents a significant hurdle as well as a 
disincentive for those who wish to enter into the profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult, as in many instances in many trades, to attract 
new persons who want to get involved in automotive repair and 
other types of repair.  This industry has seen a decline in those 
who go to trade school and attend community colleges, like the 
very impressive and ever improving Nova Scotia Community College. 
Enrolment in some of these areas is actually down as a result of 
this outlay of capital required to get into the working field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hasten to add that it also contributes to this increase 
in brain drain.  We are seeing attractive, young, hardworking, 
talented, motivated individuals lured south of the border by the 
promise of better taxation and higher rates of salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk endlessly about Canada's quality of life, and I 
would be the first to praise what we have, but if a person's 
salary and their tax rates result in a greater return on their 
investment in their future, that quality of life can be 
purchased.  That is the basic reality and choice that many young 
people decide to face which eventually leads them to go to the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us has been assailed by the government in some 
instances as it would focus on only one segment of society. 
Clearly, there are others who in our current Revenue Canada tax 
scheme have been afforded the same type of option, for example, 
and I believe previous members have alluded to them, those 
individuals who work in the forestry industry and operate 
chainsaws.  They are afforded a tax break on their equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, musicians and others who are reliant upon a specific 
tool or instrument are afforded a break, a recognition that they 
are required, by virtue of that chosen profession, to use a 
certain instrument or a certain tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that mechanics in this instance are looking for is a 
recognition in legislation that would allow them to write-off 
some of the expense involved in using this type of equipment. 
Again, it bears repeating that it is pricey equipment. 
Mechanics' tools are extremely expensive and this presents a 
considerable obstacle for those who want to enter into that type 
of work.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this type of change was so specific, our party initially 
had concerns because it would perhaps complicate an already 
overly cumbersome tax code.  However, in many ways it simplifies 
the tax code because it is a straightforward recognition and 
encompasses what we should always look for in this place, and 
that is parity and equal treatment for all under the tax code. 
As I mentioned, other industries can claim tax deductibility on 
equipment which is necessary to complete a job.  Therefore, it is 
about parity and fairness in treating mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 and 1997 the House of Commons finance committee 
recommended that we move toward ensuring the tax deductibility of 
equipment and tools necessary for mechanics.  If that had 
happened, we would not have had the necessity of this legislation 
before us now.  It would be a small step forward but an important 
step nonetheless, and one that all members of the House should 
support at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would benefit Canadians and provide them with a 
fairer, more progressive and innovative tax system which would 
create a culture of opportunity.  This is essentially the 
motivation behind this and should be the motivation for much of 
the legislation that we see in this place.  We need to ask 
ourselves how can we improve the quality of life and 
opportunities for those who are making significant contributions 
to the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very much support the bill.  I have a similar motion that 
encompasses the same spirit that we see in this bill.  I would 
request that all members give close attention to this issue and 
support this member, as our party will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I want the House to be cognizant that 
there is approximately 10 minutes left for debate on this bill. 
The Chair is going to recognize the hon. member for Provencher. 
Because I see that more than one person wishes to rise and speak 
to this issue, may I ask if the member for Provencher would agree 
to split his time of 10 minutes thereby giving 5 minutes to 
another colleague.  Is the member for Provencher agreeable to 
this suggestion? 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>   That is 
agreeable with me, Mr. Speaker. 
I rise in support of Bill C-222, an act to amend the Income Tax 
Act.  The purpose of the act is to permit mechanics to deduct the 
cost of providing tools for their employment, if they are 
required to have these tools according to the terms of their 
employment. It allows for a full deduction of costs up to $250 
and the capital cost for tools over $250. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Provencher is a mainly rural riding, yet this was 
a very big issue in the last election.  Steinbach, which is the 
largest urban centre in my riding, is known as the automobile 
city because of the number of automobile dealerships.  There is 
also a number of agricultural service centres and implement 
dealerships, all utilizing the services of mechanics who require 
tools for their trade.  These are hardworking, strong work ethic 
individuals who want to work and who are also looking for 
fairness.  Canada needs these skilled workers, and this is one 
step toward attracting more workers to this profession and 
keeping the existing mechanics working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted with some concern the comments of the Liberal member. 
His comments were essentially attempting to put up roadblocks 
rather than assisting in the resolution of the problem.  We 
should not be looking at technical problems because these are 
problems that we can overcome.  We do not need excuses.  We need 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports measures that might in any way 
lower the tax burden on Canadians.  This is one such measure. 
Since industry is expected to train and educate its workforce, 
the government can play a role by removing impediments that 
discourage job seekers from pursuing the training and education 
needed to find employment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been noted that mechanics have been known to spend many 
thousands of dollars, certainly in excess of $15,000 or $20,000. 
Of course, depending on the exact requirements, it could even be 
in the range of $50,000 or more.  They cannot declare these 
employment related expenses while many other professionals can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of equity.  Others, for example artists, 
chainsaw operators and musicians, can use the tax act to 
write-off the cost of their tools.  The Liberal member knows it. 
Every member in the House knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House not to simply set this bill aside again as it 
has done so often.  I urge members on both sides of the House to 
vote in favour of this commendable bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond :</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Since I am the member who introduced the bill, I ask for 
unanimous consent to have the floor for the few minutes left in 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have already spoken during the first hour of debate, I 
must seek unanimous consent. Let us not forget that this bill 
has been deemed votable. I therefore must get my colleagues' 
unanimous consent to close the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to give the hon. 
member the few minutes left in the debate, which is about four 
minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, two years ago the subcommittee on private 
members' business produced a report in which it recommended to 
the House that certain criteria be met before a private member's 
bill could be made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among these were: that the bill address matters of certain 
public interest; that the bill and motions address matters not 
covered by the government's legislative program; and that greater 
priority be given to measures relating to matters of more than 
purely local interest and not partisan in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully submit to all 
hon. colleagues on both sides of this House that Bill 
C-222, despite its imperfections to which my colleague from 
Portneuf has referred—I know it could be improved—is a matter of 
fairness to a category of men and women, more often men since 
this is an untraditional career for women.  Mechanics should be 
able to deduct the purchase cost of their tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the government could think of extending this in 
future to other categories of workers who might also need it.  I 
believe, however, that there has been unanimous industry support 
for this for more than 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind my colleagues that last year in the last 
parliament we did get the House, all opposition parties and the 
majority of government members as well to vote in favour of 
referring this bill to the Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the vote to be held today or tomorrow—the government whip 
ought to introduce a motion to defer it until tomorrow—I appeal 
to the sense of honour and fairness in all colleagues here in 
the House.  In the division on Bill C-205, we had 218 votes in 
favour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that Bill C-222 is based on the exact same 
criteria as Bill C-205, which had the support of 218 members, 
namely all members of the opposition and a majority of Liberal 
members. Only 11 Liberals voted against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind hon. members that the bill goes beyond party 
lines and that it has nothing to do with partisanship, the 
right, the left, federalists or sovereignists. In each of our 
ridings, we have automotive mechanics who work in service 
stations or car dealerships. We met with them during the 
election campaign that ended last November 27. 
We promised we would listen to them and respond to their 
needs and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I appeal to the common sense of hon. members who 
were present in this House during the 36th parliament and who 
voted in favour of the previous bill to support Bill 
C-222.  I ask the 45 new members who did not have the 
opportunity to take a stand on the previous bill to support Bill 
C-222 as well. After the vote at the second reading stage, the 
bill will be referred to the Standing Committee on Finance 
where we will have the opportunity to improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members sitting on the committee will have an opportunity to 
bring amendments to the bill. I only wish to improve it. I ask 
that, by the vote, the bill be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Finance and that automotive mechanics and 
technicians have, once and for all, their status recognized by 
the House of Commons. They expect justice and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 11.47 a.m., pursuant to order made 
on Friday, May 18, 2001, all questions necessary to dispose of 
the second reading stage of Bill C-222 are deemed put, and a 
recorded division is deemed demanded and differed until later 
today, at the ordinary hour of daily adjournment.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  The House was nice enough 
to give its consent for the member to continue speaking beyond 
the deadline as specified.  I would like to ask the same 
consideration for one of our own members who also wishes to speak 
on the motion before the House for five to seven minutes.  If we 
could allow that to happen as well, then I would be prepared, as 
the member has referred to, to move the motion to defer the vote 
until tomorrow night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent for 
the hon. member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot to 
speak for seven minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the very impassioned 
remarks of the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, who has 
proposed a bill that has been given very serious consideration by 
the House.  It is an important bill, but I do have to say with 
some regret that it is not a bill that I am prepared to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to all the arguments in the House and indeed I was 
here in the House when we had this debate on similar motions 
before.  I find it difficult because I think the bill as written 
runs on a rock that is very difficult to recover from even in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very simply there are three questions we have to ask ourselves, 
about the bill when we look at it.  The first 
question is:  what is a mechanic?  The second question is:  what 
is a tool?  Finally, we have to pay attention to the fact that 
the bill would allow the rental of tools, whatever they are, to 
be deducted from taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans said in his 
original speech that he was referring to auto mechanics, but in 
fact a mechanic is not defined adequately in the income tax 
legislation.  We rely on provincial governments to define what 
mechanic means. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1150

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mechanic may extend beyond auto mechanics.  It may actually 
extend to the person who fixes the hard drive in our computer. 
It may extend to the people who work on ships and make repairs to 
the sophisticated technology that is now occurring in all areas 
of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is the definition of tool.  Everyone seems to be assuming 
in this debate that we are talking about socket wrenches, box 
wrenches, screwdrivers and those kinds of thing.  Even in the 
auto industry, auto mechanics have advanced enormously and it is 
no longer a question of a mechanic having a box wrench, pliers or 
whatever else.  What it really is a question of is the expensive 
diagnostic equipment.  Not only is it a question that mechanics 
need things, like the machine that enables them to change truck 
tires, radial tires and those kinds of things, but automobiles 
have changed so dramatically that a mechanic now is a person who 
goes in and replaces sophisticated computerized components.  That 
is what being an auto mechanic is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem there is that if that is what a tool now becomes, 
then what we are talking about in the legislation is the tax 
deductibility of equipment that is worth thousands, if not tens 
of thousands of dollars, that any individual mechanic cannot 
afford to buy himself and is likely to rent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation shows us what we would be creating.  The 
legislation would have been perfect 20 years ago but it does not 
fit as written today.  I have to say to my own government side 
and the speaker for the government that this aspect of the bill 
has been overlooked in the government's speeches on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that we have passed the point in time when a 
mechanic can be viewed as simply a person with a box of tools 
that he has to renew from time to time or gets renewed when the 
Snap-On truck comes.  The Snap-On truck is an enterprise that 
goes around to various auto shops and offices to replace their 
tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in the computer age.  An automobile is something that 
requires sophisticated diagnostic equipment just to determine 
whether the exhaust is working properly.  What this would do is 
create a situation where mechanics would no longer acquire tools 
whatsoever.  What would happen is that we would be indirectly 
subsidizing those enterprises that rent out this kind of 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the House has to carefully consider the legislation and 
carefully ask itself whether it is something that can be fixed in 
committee.  I do not doubt for an instant the sincerity of the 
member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans 
in bringing the legislation forward.  I also do not doubt for a 
moment that the House was quite correct in its heart of hearts to 
want to support it in the times preceding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the reality is that the legislation, I am sorry to say, 
belongs in the past. The auto industry, auto mechanics and all 
mechanics, including computer mechanics, ought to be covered by 
the legislation. Times have changed and I think we need to go 
back to the drawing board on this particular piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  There is general agreement among the parties that it 
would be preferable, notwithstanding a previous order of the 
House, to have the vote on the bill tomorrow evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, pursuant to discussions that have taken place among 
all parties concerning the taking of the division on Bill C-222 
scheduled at the conclusion of government orders today, I believe 
you would find consent that the recorded division scheduled to 
take place at the end of government orders today on second 
reading of Bill C-222 be further deferred until the end of 
government orders on Tuesday, May 29. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the chief government whip have 
the unanimous consent of the House to put forward the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>REPORT STAGE 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-7, an act in respect of 
criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other 
acts, as reported (with amendments) from the committee, and of 
Motions Nos. 1 and 3. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak again to 
the bill, which was under consideration prior to the 
parliamentary recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw the attention of the House to an important 
event that took place on our final day of debate on this 
matter, and that is the motion passed unanimously in the Quebec 
national assembly.  It was a joint motion by the Liberal member 
for Bourassa and the Quebec minister of justice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the National Assembly call on the Government of Canada to 
make provision within the criminal justice system for young 
persons for a special system for Quebec under the Young 
Offenders Act, in order to fully reflect its particular 
intervention model. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the players in the field, those who work with young 
people, all expressed their opposition to Bill C-7, the Quebec 
national assembly, the only legislature in which Quebecers form 
the majority, decided unanimously last week that it wanted 
Quebec to have its own system, that of the existing law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position is in fact based on the interpretation of a former 
chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, Mr. Dickson, who 
said that the federal government could, if it expressed the 
political desire to do so, apply the law with full flexibility 
so that Quebecers could retain the Young Offenders Act, with the 
results they have obtained in rehabilitation and re-integration 
into society that are the envy of all of Canada.  They would 
want this flexibility to be used by the federal government so 
they could assess the results over a period of time, such as 
five or ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Quebecers, all stakeholders in this area and all parents in 
Quebec are prepared to bet that the outcome of this operation 
will be an even lower crime rate in Quebec and an even better 
performance in terms of rehabilitating our young people. This 
would show even more clearly that Quebec, which wants to 
continue to apply the law based on its own vision, should not be 
forced to follow this government's right wing offensive to 
impose a national way of doing things that does not reflect 
Quebecers' views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on that note. It is important for all members of 
the House, particularly those who represent ridings from Quebec 
and including all the Liberals who were elected at the last 
general election, to remember that if they support the bill they 
will go against the unanimous consensus reached in Quebec and 
against the motion unanimously passed by the Quebec national 
assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I call on them to think about this issue and to vote 
according to the interests and priorities of Quebecers, not the 
priorities set by this government to please a right wing group 
in its ranks and in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to vote in that fashion this evening when we 
vote on the bill at report stage and then at third reading. 
It is important that all members from Quebec join forces with 
the Quebec national assembly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, before becoming Speaker, you sat on the benches 
opposite.  Debate in the House can sometimes be intense, 
exchanges sharp, sometimes caustic, perhaps overly so.  The very 
layout of the House, with benches on opposing sides, 
unfortunately, perhaps contributes to an often confrontational 
attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a tendency, of which I am very proud, to defend my 
party's position tooth and nail based on internal discussions. 
I owe no one any apologies for this tendency, nor do I ask any 
members of the House to apologize for positions they are 
defending on behalf of their party.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on Bill C-7 must be completely non-partisan.  We must 
eliminate every ounce, every trace of partisanship from a 
debate such as this because what is involved is the future of 
our youth.  It is in this non-partisan spirit that I rise to 
speak today to the young offenders bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm has just returned from a 
tour of Quebec.  He met with people from various sectors in all 
regions of Quebec.  I congratulate him on his 
excellent work on this issue. 
During this tour, he confirmed in a concrete, not an abstract, 
way the very broad, I would even say almost unanimous, consensus of 
Quebec's stakeholders with respect to the young offenders 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All stakeholders, judges, lawyers, including the bar 
associations, social workers, youth groups and so on, were almost 
unanimously in favour of keeping the existing Young Offenders 
Act.  They rejected the unfortunate new approach of the Minister 
of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This consensus so completely transcends party lines that the 
three parties represented in the national assembly, parties 
whose views differ on sovereignty and on a whole spectrum of 
issues ranging from left to right unanimously agreed to a motion 
calling for the existing Young Offenders Act to be maintained 
intact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec there is a strong national desire to retain the system 
in place today, which has proven itself.  It has given Quebec 
the lowest rates of youth crime and of recidivism by young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble understanding why a system that is working 
properly would be shunted aside, destroyed by the Liberal 
government out of mere political calculation aimed at pleasing 
people on the right wing who are often the western voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week new stakeholders made their voices heard. They are the 
aboriginal communities of Quebec.  Rosario Pinette, chief of the 
Sept-Îles Innu community, met with my colleague, the hon. member 
for Berthier-Montcalm.  Speaking on behalf of Matthew Coon Come, 
the grand chief of the Assembly of First Nations, he took a 
strong position against the provisions of Bill C-7.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-7 is passed, it will not get into our community.  It 
will be kept out because it attacks aboriginal people outright. 
It is an imposed law that does not respect our cultural reality. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pretty strong language.  He went still further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mistakes are quickly forgotten.  In 50 years, there may be a 
compensation fund to undo the damage done by Bill C-7, as there 
was for the residential schools.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we see an alliance between the aboriginal nations and the 
Quebec nation in demanding that this government not put in 
place, not enact, not pass Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there perhaps a compromise?  I am very open to that.  Let us 
ensure that Bill C-7 allows provinces which so desire to withdraw 
from the new system the Minister of Justice is putting in place 
and allows those provinces which so desire to retain the present 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanism is possible. 
Mr. Justice Dickson, the former chief justice of the supreme 
court, said so in a legal opinion which, I hope, most members of 
this House and particularly Liberal members from Quebec have 
consulted and read. This legal opinion provided that it was 
quite possible to adopt such a mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another legal basis is the concept of distinct society. This 
government had a motion passed to the effect that the government 
should take the distinct character of Quebec into account before 
passing a bill. We could base our decision on that. Let us 
ensure that Quebec, if it so desires, and heaven knows it does, can 
be exempted from implementing the harmful system that would be 
put in place through Bill C-7 and can continue to apply the 
existing Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may wonder, and many actually do, why this government is not 
using the bill to promote its political option. It could easily 
say “Look how open federalism is, look how it promotes 
diversity. We are allowing Quebec to withdraw from the 
application of this bill”. The government could earn brownie 
points. It always pays to listen to what the public wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely call on the Liberal government and Liberal members 
from Quebec to not support Bill C-7 or at least to ensure that 
Quebec can apply the existing Young Offenders Act. 
It is not too late to respect the consensual choice repeatedly 
expressed by Quebecers through various forums, including the 
House of Commons by a majority of members from Quebec, the 
national assembly or the various stakeholders representing 
civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask Quebec Liberal members to vote with us and to ensure that 
Bill C-7 does not apply to Quebec.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK23">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-7, an act in respect of 
criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other 
acts, as reported (with amendments) from the committee, and of 
Motions Nos. 1 and 3. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will 
frequently be hearing the same appeal in the various 
interventions by the Bloc Quebecois, an appeal aimed primarily 
at our friends and colleagues, the federal Liberal members from 
Quebec, to whom we extend a hand one last time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the countdown to the passage of Bill C-7 becomes more 
pressing, the extension of this hand is becoming more 
pressing for our Liberal friends and colleagues from Quebec.  We 
ask them once again to listen to the consensus expressed 
throughout Quebec society in opposition to C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a motion that was introduced at the Quebec national 
assembly and passed unanimously, as mentioned by my colleague 
from Charlesbourg earlier.  I would like all Liberals from 
Quebec to listen. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the National Assembly call on the Government of Canada to 
make provision within the criminal justice system for young 
persons for a special system for Quebec under the Young 
Offenders Act, in order to fully reflect its particular 
intervention model. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that when we analyze the motion introduced in the 
national assembly properly, we see that it is, in every respect, 
rational and adaptable to the requirements of federal government 
parliamentarians.  If we read this motion properly, we see that 
it is not calling for the bill to be withdrawn outright or 
scrapped, nor is it describing the bill as terrible for Quebec 
society.  It is asking whether there is a way of including 
provisions in Bill C-7 to preserve what is working well in 
Quebec, and the system is working well in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-7 is to provide solutions to problems in 
certain regions of Canada but if there were a problem in 
Quebec it seems to me that it would be very difficult to get 
the unanimous approval of Liberal, ADQ and PQ MNAs for a motion 
calling on the federal government, unanimously as I keep 
repeating, to consider the possibility of including provisions 
in Bill C-7 to recognize the distinctive character and the 
successful approach of the government of Quebec in its policy in 
this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Berthier—Montcalm repeatedly mentioned and as 
he also pointed out during his tour—which was much appreciated by 
the public—with Marc Beaupré, the actor who played the character 
of Kevin in <I>Deux frères</I>, they made a non-partisan tour of Quebec. 
For a politician, it is very difficult to seriously say that we 
have been on a non-partisan tour because we are always for the 
Bloc Quebecois or sovereignty, but with this bill, we tried to 
behave in a non-partisan way; this is why the actors agreed to 
join the Bloc Quebecois on this tour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice critic for the Bloc Quebecois and the young actor 
who went on the tour heard the same message everywhere: if the 
rest of Canada wants to implement Bill C-7, there is no problem. 
If it is more acceptable elsewhere, culturally speaking, to have 
Bill C-7, there is no problem but we want no part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Charlesbourg said earlier, the Liberal 
Party voted on a motion recognizing Quebec=s distinct character. 
Since then, Liberal members have never used this for a House of

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Berthier—Montcalm went on the tour. We, on this 
side, have tried to meet, one by one, all Liberal members from 
Quebec to ask them why they would vote with their government 
and therefore against their constituents on Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about this in speeches at general meetings of the 
Bloc Quebecois in some ridings. I must admit the answer was 
quite surprising and rather weak as an argument. 
The answer we heard was: “We know you have the unanimous support 
of Quebec groups because they are funded by the government of 
Quebec and therefore have no other choice”. I find it despicable 
for Liberal members from Quebec to assert that we bought the 
support of different groups in Quebec by giving them some 
financial support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Liberal members from Quebec to explain how  the 
government of Quebec, sovereignists, can financially support the 
Liberal Party of Quebec. I would like to mention that the MLA 
for Brome—Missisquoi, Mr. Pierre Paradis, voted for the unanimous 
motion of the national assembly. I do not believe he is being 
funded by Mr. Landry, no more than his colleagues of the Liberal 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Association des chefs de police et de pompiers du Québec is 
against Bill C-7 and I do not think it is funded by the 
government or has a real say in decisions or ties to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Charlesbourg said earlier, other 
organizations are against this bill, like the Innus, the British 
Columbia Criminal Justice Association, Tim Quigley from the 
University of Saskatchewan, Dr. James Hackler from the Sociology 
Department of the University of Victoria; I doubt they are 
funded by the Parti Quebecois. I do not believe that the League 
for the Well-being of Children of Canada is funded by the Parti 
Quebecois either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told the members from Quebec that they may be right 
in part and that we may be biased in terms of our defence of or our 
opposition to Bill C-7, 
but that they also have to realize and acknowledge that they are 
somewhat biased.  We recognize that both the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Liberal Party are biased on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested to them that we have a list of 23 
individuals, organizations, institutions or associations that 
are against Bill C-7, choose anyone of them at random and ask 
them what they think about the positions taken by the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Liberal Party and that they could and why they are against 
Bill C-7. I was not asking them to talk to one particular group 
that happens to share the views of the government of Quebec, 
which is subsidizing it. I was telling them to choose anyone of 
them at random. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been making this request to Liberal members from Quebec 
for the last two weeks and, from what I understand, none of them 
have even tried to find out why the people in the field in 
Quebec—not the officials of the justice minister—are against 
Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that, with the kind of unanimity found in Quebec, with 
23 organizations opposed to Bill C-7 and the 
national assembly, which passed a unanimous motion to that 
effect, not to mention the Liberals in Quebec, the government 
members who argue that the Bloc Quebecois is being stubborn in 
opposing this bill ought to respond to the motion passed by the 
national assembly.

the Government of Canada make provisions within the criminal 
justice system for young persons for a special system for 
Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would ask the government to listen to what the 
people have to say, to reach out to them and look at what is 
being done in Quebec to meet the aspirations of those who work 
to fully rehabilitate young offenders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saddened by the attitude of the government for the 
umpteenth time, if not the 69th, 70th, 72nd or 75th time, is 
gagging the opposition. This morning a time allocation motion was 
agreed to. It is always a little sad to see the government refuse 
to listen or have an indepth debate on a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Bloc Quebecois has been so steadfast in its opposition to 
the bill it is not for the mere pleasure of playing its role as 
an opposition party. Everyone has certainly noticed how relentlessly 
and how hard my colleague for Berthier-Montcalm has being working 
on this for the past year and a half or two years. I take this 
opportunity to acknowledge his perseverance and the unique work 
he has been doing on this bill. My colleague has travelled across 
the province of Quebec. He has met with various people.  He has 
discussed the bill with every stakeholder in Quebec, bar none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we have compelling arguments but the justice 
minister refuses to hear them. The current Young Offenders Act 
has been in force in Quebec for close to 30 years. So far, it has 
been successful because it has been properly implemented. The 
government should ensure that the act is correctly enforced in 
the rest of Canada instead of trying, as the minister is doing, 
to go along with a far right trend coming mostly from western 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that being from the west she is trying to hang on 
to some votes. I hope this is not the only reason why the justice 
minister is not more attentive to the 23 groups mentioned by my 
colleague for Repentigny. I have here the list of these 23 groups 
in Quebec but I will not name them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are among others the Centrale de l'enseignement, the 
Conseil permanent des jeunes, the Commision des services 
juridiques, the Assocation des centres-jeunesse, the Conférence 
des régies régionales de la santé et des services sociaux. There 
is also the Association des avocats de la défense du Québec, the 
Canadian Criminal Justice Association, and the Child Welfare 
League of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They all support the Bloc in its opposition to Bill C-7. These 
are not people with grey hair like you and I, Mr. Speaker, these 
are people who work with young people on a daily basis. What 
should people with grey hair do? They should look at what is 
going to happen to young persons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We sould think about it.  It could be our grandchildren who we will be 
sending to the school for crime at 14 years of age by throwing 
them in jail. We will be sending them to the school for crime. 
It is a shame to send our young people to the school for crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Young Offenders Act were applied properly in the rest of 
Canada, as it is in Quebec, people would see a 23% drop in the 
youth crime rate. Quebec has the lowest youth crime rate in 
Canada because it has applied the current legislation properly 
using the available tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth crime rate in Quebec is still too high, with 500 young 
offenders per 10,000 youths, compared to 900 young offenders per 
10,000 youths in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throwing our children in jail is not the answer. It will not 
help. We must look closely to see why a youth has gone down that 
path and what we should do to help him instead of giving him a 
criminal record. We must help him instead of making him a 
criminal for the rest of his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young father, the member for Berthier—Montcalm understands 
that. When he studied this piece of legislation, he looked at 
the future of his young children: his daughter who is about 10 
years old and who is a skater, and his son who is about 12 
years old. 
If one of these children had the misfortune to commit an 
offence, how could we get them out of this mess? Certainly not 
with the Minister of Justice's Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus in Quebec. A motion was brought forward 
last week and agreed to unanimously. It tells the minister that if 
she wants to win votes in western Canada, her law sould apply 
there, but that she sould exempt Quebec from legislation that will only more 
criminals in our prisons. That is what Bill C-7 is all about. 
That is the ultimate goal of Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, at the beginning of March, not too long ago, I 
received a letter from Geneviève Tavernier, the secretary of the 
ASRSQ, an association dealing with criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read this letter so that members can understand 
properly. I hope the members opposite, as well as those to 
my right and to my left, will listen. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although specializing in dealing adults in trouble with the law, 
the volunteers and professionals belonging to our association 
are interested in the situation of the young offenders and are 
well aware of the needs of the youth at risk. This is why our 
association studied Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling on you today to reiterate our opposition to Bill 
C-7. We remain part of the Coalition pour la justice des mineurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on the basis of our great expertise in the area of 
criminal justice for adults that we want to raise awareness 
regarding the pitfalls of this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Coalition has said, and as we have also said regarding 
other bills, we are convinced that the legislative elements 
contained in this bill promote the categorization of crimes by 
creating automatic reactions that will have a major impact on 
the way these people are dealt with. It is important to 
understand that the nature of the offence does not always 
reflect the offender's true personality. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three more pages I could read, but the only thing that 
I would like to say in closing is: Let us think about it. Let us 
not make criminals out of our youth. Let us not send our youth 
to the university for crime for no good reason. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
take part in this debate, although I had not intended to, and to 
say that in the opinion of all Quebecers there is absolutely no 
comparison between this bill and the act that now applies in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Rivière-des-Mille-Îles said, and it was well 
put, that the current legislation in Quebec is designed to 
promote reintegration of young offenders into society. One can 
make all sorts of mistakes in life but in Quebec we believe in 
reintegration. We believe that the sometimes tragic mistakes of 
youth do happen, and I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in my riding five young people killed an 81 year old 
woman after breaking into her home. Obviously such a crime does 
not leave us indifferent in Quebec. 
It affects all of us. I am especially affected for it happened 
in my riding, in the beautiful city of Chambly that I have 
represented in this House since 1993. I admit it has affected 
the whole community. The crime was despicable if not downright 
heinous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However society should not seek revenge. Society must manage 
our legal system, our criminal justice system, and ban terrible 
acts like the one I have mentioned. It is not there to seek 
revenge. The penalty for seeking revenge is very heavy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having a young person who made a mistake at age 14, 15 or 16 
years of age dealt with by adult court and sentenced to 5, 8, 10 
or 15 years in prison, under the rules applying to adults, to 
hardened criminals, is in fact, as the hon. member for 
Rivière-des-Milles-Îles was saying, sending that young person to a 
university for crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All young people are seeking to find themselves, whether they 
are young people who have made a mistake or students trying to 
choose a career. Sadly, in this quest for a future, for good and 
evil, some are doomed to failure. The social environment has a 
major impact. The famous Dr. Mailloux would speak of “maternal 
deprivation”, a concept that has been greatly overworked. For my 
part, I do not believe in it. In many cases, we are just dealing 
with a single mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no reason to turn them into hardened criminals, to send 
them to adult prison where they will complete their education 
as criminals. We can bet a hundred to one that those young people 
who live through this situation, who are sentenced and treated 
like hardened criminals will, in 10, 12 or 15 years, at the end 
of their sentence, be a bit older, old enough to look for work, 
since we are asking for their reintegration into society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In their resumes, they must indicate that they spent 10 years at 
Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines or 12 at Kingston or Port-Cartier. What 
employers would take such a risk? They do not know who they are dealing 
with. They will not hire these youths, even if they are deeply repentant 
and have chosen to live a respectable life on all accounts. If we 
do not want to give them a chance and to reintegrate them into 
society, what option have they got? Once again, they will turn to 
crime and we will have repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, crime is not praised, crime is not forgiven 
indiscriminately. We try to guide youths, under close 
supervision, toward specific goals. Psychiatric evaluations are 
done. There are also tests similar to those applied to young 
students looking for a goal in life. We supervise and help 
young offenders. We say “You are good at this. You can complete 
your post-secondary education. Go for it, the state is behind 
you.” We are not out for revenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a few years of training, the youth often gets a diploma, 
which does not mention where he learned and which is delivered by 
an authorized educational institution. The youth has then been 
reintegrated into society. The success rate is absolutely 
convincing. In Quebec, it is beyond all expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those involved in the fight against crime in Quebec, 
including the Quebec bar association, are unanimous in saying 
that the provincial law is in itself a success. 
The rehabilitation rate is well above what any legislator might 
have imagined, even in his wildest dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the federal justice minister has come up with her infamous 
Bill C-7 to try to please western Canada and get the support that 
has eluded her so far and will continue to elude her. In the end, 
this bill is only an indication of the revenge some members in 
this House are looking for. Whatever it takes, whatever needs to 
be done, they are out for revenge. But it is not up to society or 
the government to meet these kinds of expectations and to seek 
revenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the government is to build a good relationship 
between its citizens and to create sustainable peace within its 
borders. I know from personal experience that members of a 
political party do not always agree but we learn to cope and to 
accept our differences of opinions. The same thing goes for 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With her infamous Bill C-7, the Minister of Justice is sending 
the following message “We no longer believe in social 
rehabilitation. Young offenders will be criminals their whole 
lives”. This is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are young or not so young, we have all made our share 
of mistakes and blunders. A few years ago, we found out, shortly 
after an election that a respected member of this House, who had 
been elected in a riding in the heart of Montreal, had made a 
rather huge mistake when he was young. He had committed armed 
robbery when he was 18.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was done to that man was terrible. Twenty years after 
committing the offence, he was truly rehabilitated, as evidenced 
by the fact that he was elected to represent a large segment of 
the population. His political career was destroyed because of 
his past. Such things must never be allowed to happen again. We 
must be able to support our youth, guide them, accompany them, 
supervise them and make sure they stay on the right path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Bill C-7 introduced by the Minister of Justice does 
not do. I know, Mr. Speaker, that you are not allowed to take 
part in this debate, but if you could, I am sure you would agree 
with me.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2

</I></B></P><P align=left>“services to young persons shall disclose to any”

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to 
speak to the amendment which, given the length, breadth, width 
and complexity of the legislation, would classify as an 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without getting into a full debate on the merits of the bill 
itself, the amendment would in essence change but one word in the 
legislation.  I know the Minister of Justice is very interested 
in the amendment and I know she would not want to miss my 
comments on how to improve her own bill.  The amendment would 
change the word “may” to “shall”.  It would make it 
obligatory for the justice system, mainly the courts, upon making 
a finding, to mandatorily inform the school boards, that is, to 
give them relevant information that could be used in a very 
productive and, in some instances, protective way to enhance the 
rehabilitation of a student and, perhaps equally if not more 
important, other students and those in the educational community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment has the important backing and blessing of those 
who are most affected, short of the students, which is the 
teachers themselves.  The Canadian School Boards Association, the 
Canadian Teachers' Federation and the Canadian Association of 
School Administrators have all expressed their unanimous support 
and their desire for the amendment to take place in the current 
youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They, among a plethora of other representatives who wished to 
have input in the drafting of the bill, were denied the 
opportunity to appear before the committee. 
They were denied the opportunity to have input into Bill C-7 
prior to it being introduced in the House, as they were on the 
previous bill, Bill C-68.  They were not given the opportunity to 
speak to the specifics as to why the amendment was necessary. I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to give members the 
opportunity to put their thoughts on the record.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the justice minister's justifications for not permitting 
or for not endorsing changing of the word “may” to “shall” 
was that it would impinge upon a young person's privacy or 
confidentiality with respect to having been involved in the 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without being too dismissive, I do not believe that is a 
relevant response.  Teachers routinely and as a matter of course 
in their profession deal discreetly with sensitive information. 
As part of their own ethics, as a school teacher and as a person 
working within the system, they are required to positively 
enhance a young person's life.  To say that this would somehow 
jeopardize the privacy and the sensitive information about a 
young person trivializes what an important role teachers play in 
the development of our youth. It is akin to not giving doctors 
all the relevant information they need to make a diagnosis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing the courts to transfer relevant information to teachers 
for a specific purpose would allow teachers to provide the 
necessary attention to young people in order to help enhance 
their rehabilitation and to ensure that when they go back into 
the school system their specific needs will be addressed.  It 
would also recognize that if a young person had been involved in 
a violent act or if the act itself involved aggression toward 
other students, a teacher or property, it would allow the teacher 
to have all of the information when approaching that child.  The 
teacher could take into consideration the child's education, the 
education of other students in the classroom and other students 
with whom the young person might come in contact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment is very straightforward.  It should not require a 
great deal of consternation on the part of the department or the 
minister herself.  It is one that has broad support among the 
teaching community and the education systems, the ones which 
would be most effected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth in question are already protected by other sections of 
existing legislation, namely the Young Offenders Act, and by 
virtue of confidentiality sections that are contained in the 
current bill.  It is still a criminal offence to disseminate or 
use information about a young person's conviction or the terms 
thereof for a non-specified purpose.  This would specify that it 
would only be used for the purpose of informing schools, 
principals and teachers.  Therefore, to suggest that it would 
perpetrate a stigmatization of a young person or cause a young 
person's privacy to be jeopardized or brought into question is 
simply incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the House that the amendment, if it is supported and 
passed, would enhance legislation that is drastically in need of 
improvement.  It is a complex and cumbersome bill.  Those who 
were allowed to appear before the justice committee indicated 
that it was unworkable and that it would be extremely costly and 
impossible to administer by those in the provinces who would have 
the task to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment would have a profound effect by changing one word. 
It would make it mandatory for the youth court system to share 
information about a young person with teachers and school boards. 
It would significantly enhance the ability of the schools to do 
their work in conjunction with the criminal justice system. 
Sharing of information for a specific purpose has its merit.  It 
is something that those who have worked in the justice system or 
those who have been teachers will be quick to embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to hearing what other members have to say about 
the amendment.  It is one I urge them to support.

in a most concentrated way with young persons.  It therefore 
stands to reason that they should be given the information, the 
support and the backup to carry out their very important duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I will put on record the words of Marie Pierce, 
executive director of the Canadian School Boards Association. She 
said that inconsistencies in the way information is relayed to 
school boards could pose a serious threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her comments specifically suggested that lack of information 
could in some cases cause a serious problem.  I illustrated by an 
earlier example that if a young person has a propensity for 
violence and has been convicted of a violent offence, it is 
common sense to suggest that the school board, the teacher and in 
some instances the principal of the school should know about it 
so they can act accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marilies Rettig, president of the Canadian Teachers' Federation, 
said justice officials were misguided if they were concerned 
about the confidentiality of a student's past.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason to deny us access to information we need to 
work effectively with justice officials in helping offenders 
while fulfilling our commitment to all students. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about the greater good.  It is about ensuring that the 
community is protected but that the efforts of teachers do not in 
any way infringe upon privacy concerns.  It is specifically aimed 
at helping students and ensuring that a person in their class 
does not interfere with the education of others or put others at 
risk in terms of safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment addresses just that.  It addresses safety concerns 
in the classroom.  It specifically touches upon the sharing of 
information in a specific and protected way to give teachers a 
better ability to know the student, to know the background of the 
person who is in part the focus of their daily existence.  The 
teacher is in many cases trying to focus on what is wrong in the 
young person's life outside what takes place in the classroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of information sharing in specific instances would be 
addressed effectively and specifically by support for the 
amendment, the changing of one word.  I hope that in their wisdom 
members of the House, and particularly those on the government 
side, will also support the amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motion as it is identical 
to a motion I submitted.  It has been put forward because of 
evidence presented to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian School Boards Association, the Saskatchewan School 
Trustees Association and others have presented an argument to the 
effect that subclause 125(6) of the bill be changed to mandatory 
language from its permissive nature.  What I mean is that the 
subclause uses the word may and the motion changes the word to 
shall.  Instead of saying that maybe we should be getting schools 
involved with the youth justice process, we would be saying that 
we shall get schools involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schools are an important partner in the youth justice process. 
Our schools, by law, must be accessible to young offenders.  Our 
schools are obliged to facilitate attendance and educational 
success.  Like any employer, our schools have a statutory 
obligation to ensure the physical safety of their employees, to 
say nothing of their obligation to protect the safety of their 
students.  These are all noteworthy objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as with most noteworthy objectives, there is often a 
but or an exception.  In this case it is this:  To properly 
participate in the rehabilitation and reformation of young 
offenders, schools must be informed when young offenders enrol 
within the school environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have stated, our schools have a number of obligations to 
the various participants in the system.  The interests of 
employees, students, the community and the school system must be 
considered along with the interests of the young offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present wording of Bill C-7 states that the provincial 
director, youth worker, attorney general, peace officer, et 
cetera, may disclose to those engaged in the supervision or care 
of a young person, including schools and other educational 
institutions, information contained in a youth record if such 
disclosure is necessary to ensure compliance with an order of the 
court, to ensure safety of staff or students or other persons, or 
to facilitate the rehabilitation of the young person.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the motion is saying is that if it is necessary to ensure 
compliance with a court order, to ensure safety of a school 
population or to assist in the rehabilitation of a young 
offender, the necessary information from the youth records shall 
be disclosed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will argue that this type of mandatory disclosure will 
abuse the privacy rights of the offender.  First, I have 
difficulty swallowing that argument when the legislation already 
permits disclosure in some circumstances.  The clause says that 
information may be disclosed.  Where is the privacy protection 
there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second and far more important are the security rights of staff 
and other students at the school.  The institution must know the 
background of the student to provide proper safeguards for all to 
work and learn in its surroundings.  Surely this is an example 
when the rights of the many should come ahead of the rights of 
the few, especially when the many are innocent and law abiding 
and the few have voluntarily decided to break the laws of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other critics talk about the fear that education professionals 
will not respect the confidentiality of the information.  That is 
also bogus and it is a red herring.  Bill C-7 already permits the 
disclosure of this type of information.  It is just not 
mandatory. There seems to be little concern for breach of 
confidentiality in these few cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well educational people are professionals.  They deal with 
confidential material every day whether it has to do with child 
welfare involvement, police investigation or even student 
disclosure in confidence.  There is little, if any, concern about 
abuse of confidentiality by school board personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly there is the argument of civil liability.  I can readily 
foresee, especially with the way society has been rapidly moving 
toward holding others civilly liable for damage and harm, that we 
may be placing the taxpayer at risk by failing to provide this 
type of information to school board officials.  I can imagine a 
day when a violent young person is released from custody and 
placed in one of our high schools without anyone knowing the 
background of the youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should that youth commit another violent crime such as a sexual 
assault and it becomes known that there was a previous record of 
violent behaviour, I cannot help but think that the victim and/or 
her parents would have a case to pursue to obtain compensation 
for damages and suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, we have the state permitting a young person to 
surreptitiously enter the community and the school, yet we are 
not providing any notice whatsoever to prepare unsuspecting 
school employees and students.  It is like putting a time bomb in 
a school and not telling anyone.  Surely our courts will hold 
someone accountable when this occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's feeble response to the cries of our citizens to 
replace the despised Young Offenders Act is most disappointing. 
For the past number of years I have been actively involved in the 
review of Bill C-7 and its predecessors, Bill C-3 and Bill C-68. 
The minister and the government have been quite clear that there 
is to be no deviation from or improvement on the government's 
idea of what is best for Canadians when it comes to youth 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not holding my breath for the government to accept this 
motion.  However it is my job as a critic to present changes such 
as this motion after hearing from various groups and witnesses 
from many parts of the country.  Nonetheless I urge members of 
this place to have a serious look at what is a relatively simple 
proposal.  I also urge members to consider whether they want to 
be responsible for failing to support school boards and 
institutions across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by reading a paragraph from a letter I received 
from the British Columbia School Trustees Association.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As school boards, we have the responsibility to ensure the safety 
of our staff and students, and to provide the best educational 
opportunities for every student in our care.  We also work 
through our school communities to prevent crime.  Young offenders 
are often students in our care.  In order to provide a safe 
school environment and also facilitate the education (and 
rehabilitation) of a young offender, it is vital that we have 
access to information about the young offender.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an amendment to a bill that basically seeks to impose a 
tougher and much more punitive approach to young offenders. It is 
important that we do not consider this amendment only in the 
context in which they have tried to present it, that is as 
something that would minimize reality, that would not constitute 
an indepth change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also an amendment that adheres to the broader reality 
of this whole bill, which seeks to make the management, the 
approach and the policy that will be adopted regarding young 
offenders, much more punitive and, in the end, to send them 
directly to the penitentiaries, to what can be called a school 
for crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly in Quebec, however, we have developed over several 
years a rehabilitation and reintegration approach, one that is 
very demanding for young poeple.  This is something that 
should never be forgotten. It is an approach that requires 
youths, while in an institution, to meet daily with social 
workers, with people who try to make them aware of their 
responsibility, because this is the root of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill introduced by the government provides for punitive 
solutions to acts committed by a young poeple. These solutions 
send them the following message “You have committed an 
unacceptable act; we are giving you a very severe penalty. But we 
are not making any effort to let you know that we would like you 
to understand that you cannot do that again; we would like you to 
know that your act had a negative impact; we would like you to 
understand that your whole future might be affected if you do 
that again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we could send them a different message. We could tell 
them that if they came 
under the current act as it is now implemented in Quebec, they 
would have to give some thought to these questions and find out how 
they can get back on track”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It works and it works very well. Crime rates are going down. 
The rehabilitation rate for young people is also very high. In 
the end, it makes it possible to correct situations and, in a 
practical way, it ensures that individuals who made mistakes will 
not have to bear this burden for the rest of their life. They 
have the opportunity and the good fortune to have access to the 
resources necessary to correct the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today will have as a result that within six 
months, one year or two, there will be an increase in the demand 
for resources to build new prisons, and to support a punitive 
system, when we could have continued to make available the 
resources necessary to support rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such a context, the Bloc Quebecois does not believe that the 
amendment put forward today would correct the situation. What 
would correct the situation would be for the government to decide 
that in the end Quebec would be allowed to keep on implementing 
the act as it is doing currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If other provinces in Canada want to have a more punitive 
approach under which a young person is not viewed as being 
responsible for his actions, but which takes into account the 
action itself and which punishes him hoping that he will be able 
to return to society after spending some time in an institution 
where he will not learn—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, a man charged with 
diplomacy, has recently been anything but diplomatic.  He has 
made offensive remarks about Canada's head of state.  I refer to 
his recent remark that “the Queen does not represent Canada; she 
represents Great Britain”.  That is wrong.  Queen Elizabeth is 
the Queen of Canada and as a minister of her crown he ought to 
know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The monarchy is a fundamental aspect of our distinctiveness as a 
nation.  The crown defines a distinct Canadian identity contrary 
to that of the republic to the south.  An elected president, and 
perhaps that is what the minister aspires to be, would owe his or 
her election to a political faction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister seems to prefer republican partisanship over our 
longstanding historic institutions.  Perhaps he ought to listen 
to the Prime Minister who said “The monarchy is not a problem in 
Canada.  It is not an issue at all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is insulting for the minister to suggest that the Queen 
cannot truly represent us.  Fifty years of public service given 
freely sets a standard of service that all Canadians should 
attempt to emulate and not attack.

Some 180 of those amendments resulted from defective drafting by 
her department in the first place and many were to correct 
discrepancies between English and French versions.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, if passed, will not enter our community.  It

</I></B></P><P align=left>The errors are quickly forgotten.  In fifty years, perhaps they

has worked for aboriginal youth.  This is a country that 
incarcerates more young people than any other western democracy. 
Unfortunately a great many of those young people are aboriginal

are documents to indicate that the Minister of National Defence 
has concealed from the public the advanced state of 
contamination of the drinking water wells in the town of 
Shannon, out of concerns that are far more about image than 
about public health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that DND, while aware of the situation, 
preferred to keep the entire population in the dark for fear 
that Quebecers would realize how badly served they are by the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that is not the case at all.  We are working very 
closely with the town of Shannon.  In fact the mayor of Shannon 
and a delegation came to see me just a couple of weeks ago. We 
have entered into a very substantial expenditure of money, over 
$2 million, to try to get to the bottom of what is causing the 
problem and to find ways of remedying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking this matter very seriously and we are being very 
responsible.  We are communicating with the town, its mayor, its 
people and the environment ministry in Quebec.

document goes on to say “Although we are all equally 
responsible, the main thing is to clean up our land and show our 
good will to the municipality of Shannon.  The message that has 
to be put across is not guilt, but partnership”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister going to acknowledge that this document is 
evidence of his department's concern for its image far more than 
any concern for protecting public health?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B>

</I></B></P><P align=left>We were one of the top allies of NATO in providing the kind of

in operational missions with our allies.  In Kosovo we had to 
borrow from the Americans to equip 12 CF-18s with precision 
guided targeting equipment.  This level of readiness is 
deplorable and disgraceful for a G-8 country.

well equipped.  In fact, we are spending some $872 million in a

allow them to sell 60% of their durum crop.

Commissioner George Radwanski. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough stated that 
in his letter to Mr. Reid the privacy commissioner had carried 
out what amounted to an attack on the information commissioner, 
an officer of parliament.  He argued that this alleged attack

constituted a contempt both of the House and its officers.

the discussion of this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small number of individuals have the special distinction of 
being officers of parliament. 
So great is the importance which parliament attaches to the 
responsibilities entrusted to these individuals that they are

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the special relationship that exists between these 
officials and the House of Commons, any actions which affect 
them or their ability to carry out their work are watched with 
particular attention by members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has brought 
before the House legitimate concerns about a situation involving 
the attempt of the privacy commissioner to influence the 
information commissioner.  This attempt has been carried out by 
way of a letter—an open letter, not only made public but widely 
disseminated by the signatory—at a time when the case in point is 
being appealed to the supreme court by the information 
commissioner. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are in my view two questions which need to be addressed in 
the case before us.  Has there been interference in the 
information commissioner's ability to carry out his duties?  Has 
the privacy commissioner conducted himself improperly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have examined with great care the letter sent by Mr. Radwanski 
to Mr. Reid.  The letter unquestionably attempts to influence the 
information commissioner and seeks to exert that influence by 
reference to the interpretation of statutes and court decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not my place to weigh the arguments which the privacy 
commissioner has put forward, nor will I speculate on whether or 
not the letter will prove persuasive to the information 
commissioner, but I must conclude that in itself the presentation 
of views by one commissioner contrary to those of another cannot 
be considered as interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, it must be recognized that there is a natural tension 
between the concepts found in the Access to Information Act and 
those enshrined in the Privacy Act, so that it can come as no 
surprise that the officers charged with the responsibility of 
implementing these two acts may well hold differing views on 
issues of great substance.  Thus, the letter does not in my view 
interfere in the information commissioner's ability to carry out 
his mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now to the matter of the conduct of the privacy commissioner, 
irrespective of the views which the privacy commissioner's letter 
contains or even the egregious language in which he chooses to 
express those views, I can find nothing in his letter which might 
be taken as a threat or intimidation.  One may regret that this 
representation has been made by way of an open letter and one may 
be dismayed that this has been presented in the media as an 
unseemly squabble between one officer and another, but these are 
matters of opinion or judgment and as such are not for the Chair 
to address. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point to be considered is whether the action of the 
privacy commissioner in writing, sending and making public this 
letter constitutes a contempt of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough stated that, in 
his view, the privacy commissioner had overstepped his statutory 
role by his attempt to influence the information commissioner in 
this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as the hon. member himself went on to point out, it is not 
part of the Speaker's mandate to comment on points of law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker of the House of Commons has no role in interpreting 
the mandate of the commissioner under the Privacy Act.  However, 
as the remarks made by the government House leader and the 
parliamentary secretary indicate, there are differing views as to 
the proper role of the privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may conclude that there is a need to examine the role of 
the privacy commissioner and, more to the point, the privacy 
commissioner's own understanding of his role.  There already 
exists a forum for such an examination and that is the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights.  I would commend that 
committee to hon. members as the body to which they should have 
recourse to pursue questions of mandate, where the issues of 
appropriate communication might be further explored with both the 
officers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the privacy commissioner nor the information 
commissioner is an agent of the government.  They are both 
officers of parliament.  It is their responsibility as well as 
ours to see that their relationships to each other and to 
parliament are maintained and strengthened.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to present a petition from citizens of the Peterborough area who 
are concerned about the genetic engineering of food, plants and 
animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that the techniques and the science 
involved are very new, yet the practices are expanding very 
rapidly.  They also point out that this genetic engineering now 
involves the manipulation of the most basic building blocks of 
life and that the long term effects of genetic engineering of 
plants and animals on human health and the global ecosystem are 
completely unknown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call upon parliament to persuade the federal

another petition from citizens of Peterborough who are concerned 
about the sanctions in Iraq.  These petitioners, as before, are 
appealing that the sanctions be lifted.  They point out that the 
sanctions are not having an effect on the government of Iraq and 
Saddam Hussein, but are in fact having a tragic effect on the 
children of Iraq in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This petition has involved a vigil by the petitioners at my

Peterborough as a business centre, an educational centre and a

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT

<A NAME="LINK200">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-7, an act in respect of 
criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other 
acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of 
Motion No. 2. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I resume where I left off before question 
period, when I still had a few minutes left to debate Bill C-7. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1515

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During question period it was obvious that the federal 
government either totally misunderstands the situation or lacks 
the political will to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister himself said that the legislation put forward 
by the justice minister would allow Quebec to continue to 
implement the current legislation. However, he was totally 
incapable of giving us a clear answer when we asked: “Why then 
not include that provision in the legislation?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all of us legislators and we all know that when we 
specify or not something in a legislation, we do so deliberately. 
If the justice minister refuses to grant Quebec the right to 
continue living with the current legislation, even if the rest of 
Canada would have a more punitive law, a more rigorous law which 
would encourage young offenders to end up in prison, if this is 
the type of legislation the rest of Canada wants, let them adopt 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, as he said, the Prime Minister really wants Quebec to 
continue to enforce the existing legislation, I think that is 
most important. It is a fundamental question which goes well 
beyond the Conservative amendment.  It is an important question 
because there is an extraordinary consensus in Quebec on this 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All stakeholders are against Bill C-7. They say that we must be 
allowed to keep the existing legislation, which is giving good 
results because it has reduced crime and permits social 
reintegration and rehabilitation of our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is not so easy on young persons.  They have to 
answer questions and they have to understand their responsibility 
in what they did. The success rate is very high and few of 
them return to a life of crime, whereas the model proposed by the 
government is influenced by the strong right wing current 
spreading in the United States.  It is also flourishing in 
western Canada and in Ontario.  Ontario also wants amendments 
that would make for a stricter legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the solution not then be for the minister to make it 
possible for us to end up with a bill that would allow Quebec to 
continue to enforce the Young Offenders Act while the rest of 
Canada enforces another law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like us all to rise to this challenge.  If the Minister 
of Justice accepted this decision, this approach, then in five 
or ten years we would be able to provide clear proof that the 
Quebec model yielded the best results, that it was the one to 
enable our youth to be reintegrated into society and not sent to 
the school for criminals.  I hope we will have that latitude. 
The government still has the leeway to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are engaged in debating the provisions of the bill at 
the report stage, along with the proposed amendments.  One 
introduced by the Bloc Quebecois has been turned down. 
These amendments will be voted on this evening.  In the end, the 
government will also have the opportunity of deciding to redo 
its work, not start the third reading debate too precipitously 
but to give itself an opportunity to again consult those who are 
opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a partisan approach.  It is not the Bloc Quebecois 
calling for this, nor the Parti Quebecois.  It is all the Bloc 
Quebecois MPs here in Ottawa, along with the entire national 
assembly, which is unanimous in Quebec on this matter, along 
with all the stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the federal Liberal MPs representing Quebec ridings 
will be in solidarity with this position.  If the Liberal 
members vote in favour of Bill C-7, then they will be quite 
simply voting totally against the wishes of all Quebecers who 
want the present legislation to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are faced with a fait accompli.  In the report stage 
debate on the Conservative amendment, this view is important. 
It is not merely changing the details in a bill.  No, for Quebec 
what is important is for this bill, as tabled by the federal 
government, not to apply to Quebec, for us to have the right to 
opt out and continue to enforce the existing legislation in 
order to get the results we have in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at 
the outset I offer the fact that I am heartily sick of the bill. 
It has made its way through three parliaments and three separate 
incarnations.  It has gone on for over seven years and has been 
subject to a 30 hour filibuster by the Bloc.  At some time or 
another enough is enough.  The bill has morphed through many 
changes over those years, but it is important to get it as right 
as possible since it will become the bible for youth justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The filibuster by the Bloc was quite irritating.  It will never 
be happy unless it gets its own criminal code and youth justice 
bill.  There is nothing the Government of Canada could or should 
do to try to make the Bloc happy.  The Bloc cannot be 
accommodated.  We should move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with a filibuster is that only one person gets to 
speak.  It is the ultimate insult to parliamentary democracy.  I 
have to listen to the member but he or she does not have to 
listen to me.  The corollary result is that it leads to 
legislative fatigue and amendments such as the ones introduced by 
the minister do not get the scrutiny they deserve because debate 
time is eaten up by those who were implacably hostile to the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after the reintroduction of the bill and the committee's 
somewhat reluctant willingness to open up to deputations from the 
provinces we heard some evidence on funding and other issues. The 
evidence was somewhat dismal.  I do not know whether the 
additional money is adequate, but when the deputy ministers and 
others were asked directly about additional increases to the 
CHST, both in cash and transfers, their responses were somewhat 
platitudinous and disingenuous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cynic might suggest that the ministers from the various 
provinces send their minions to Ottawa for one last squeeze at 
the federal government after they had already won or lost 
their internal provincial dispute within their 
departments over the allocation of the new federal money that had 
already been transferred through the CHST.  It is a bit of a 
mug's game and every province always claims that it never has 
enough resources, read money, to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc filibuster resulted in much less time than one would 
have liked to review the amendments.  Just before the rise of the 
last parliament the minister introduced quite a raft of 
amendments in response to the evidence to which she had listened 
over the course of a number of months.  For instance, the 
amendment which gives regions, read Quebec, the option to raise 
the age of exposure to adult sentences from 14 to 16 for the six 
presumptive offences offends the notion that there is one law for 
all youth regardless of where they happen to reside in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the name of flexibility a youth on one side of the Ottawa 
River runs one risk and on the other side a lower risk of 
receiving an adult sentence for the same offence.  Sometimes 
local needs and circumstances create a Swiss cheese result across 
the nation.  Allowing provinces to opt out would however be 
ridiculous, but allowing a province to dictate the threshold to 
obtain flexibility is somewhat problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the name of flexibility we have created a patchwork which 
begs for a constitutional challenge.  Assuming that Ontario has a 
low age threshold of 14 and Quebec has a high age threshold of 16 
for the six presumptive offences, a well advised youth might well 
do his criminal work in Hull rather than in Ottawa. How much 
sense does that make?  How ironic, for in some bizarre way it 
almost attracts criminal activity to Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec made certain claims that it had a kinder and gentler 
system.  The evidence however suggests otherwise.  Mr. Bégin 
claims to have a system geared to rehabilitation.  What Mr. Bégin 
has is a system of diverting youth from the criminal justice 
system, which has specific sentencing and evidentiary 
requirements, to a child welfare system where periods of 
incarceration are sometimes indefinite and frequently longer than 
specific sentencing requirements.  The evidence for the offence 
is somewhat less rigorous than one would get in a criminal court. 
Again, if our proverbial delinquent is well advised, he should 
commit his crime in Ottawa rather than in Hull, as the offence 
would be dealt with in a more rigorous fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lord help us from those who claim to be locking them up or 
treating them for their own good.  That is a great way to lose a 
kid in a system over a relatively minor offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disingenuous argument of Quebec is even further disingenuous 
when it is contradicted by the fact that Quebec actually had the 
second highest rate of transfers to adult court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario the government holds to the myth that punishment 
alone protects society.  Research does not support that view.  It 
could be argued that if protection is the most significant issue, 
as is punishment alone, it is counterproductive and only leads to 
a well trained young criminal as opposed to an amateur.  Adult 
time for adult crime is a catchy phrase but just awful youth 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite incensed by some of the incidents I read about in 
newspapers.  If individuals are locked up and the proverbial key 
is thrown away and then they are pitched over the proverbial 
prison wall after they have done their time, a criminal disaster 
is waiting to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is rampant with contradictions.  It was invited to 
participate in the parliamentary hearings and declined to do so. 
Having done so, it then set up its own hearings.  Ontario's big 
thing is moving kids from the youth system to the adult system. 
It has made repeated statements to that effect.  Unfortunately 
the evidence does not support its contention because last year it 
only moved six kids from the youth system to the adult system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I realize the member is making a fine speech regarding a 
certain issue, but it does not really pertain to Motion No. 2. 
Before he ends his speech I would like to hear his comments on 
Motion No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  We have heard the 
comments of the member for Wild Rose.  I am sure that at some 
point in time the hon. member for Scarborough East will tie in 
his previous remarks in the two minutes left in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought I was speaking 
somewhat tangentially to the issue before us.  We are dealing 
with a filibuster.  We are dealing with a motion which has to do 
with the issue of whether we should continue to debate this ad 
nauseam after seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I wonder if the Chair could inform the hon. member that 
it is impossible to have a filibuster when we already have time 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his limited edification on such an obvious matter.  As I was 
indicating before, the issue before us is the time that Bill C-7 
has taken up before parliament and in particular the time that 
has been wasted by the rampant contradictions of members opposite 
and their provincial counterparts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am following the order

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had a discussion with 
the parliamentary secretary who I thought was going to speak for 
the government.  I did not rise at the time because I thought I 
was allowing the government to speak.  Instead, another 
government member spoke and now you are telling me I lost my 
spot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I would like to inform 
the hon. member again that we are in the second rotation.  Nobody 
from the NDP rose during the first rotation.  We will have a

agreeable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to register my 
disagreement with the Chair's interpretation of the events.  It 
does not make any sense to me whatsoever.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I do not intend to take up a lot of the House's time with respect 
to the motion put forward by the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  The motion would change the 
wording of the bill to require that the authorities shall rather 
than may notify teachers who have young offenders in their 
classes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After much thought I want to say that it is our intention to 
support the motion of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  It is tempting to leave this 
kind of discretion with the courts, the judges or the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon reflection, to not require that this kind of information be 
passed on to teachers is to single out teachers as the one class 
of professional that deals with young offenders that will not 
have access to the information to which all other professionals 
who deal with young offenders will have access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the government that I think I understand its position 
without having heard it expounded on the floor of the House.  The 
parliamentary secretary has not yet had a chance to speak and the 
Liberal member who just spoke did not address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an element of discrimination against teachers.  It may 
be unintended.  It may be done with the best intentions to build 
a certain amount of discretion into the system.  I understand 
that.  On balance, we come down on the side of the amendment 
which changes the language from may to shall because it would 
seem to us that when all things are considered teachers should 
not be excluded.  The possibility of teachers being excluded from 
access to this information should not be enshrined in the bill in 
the way it is now.  For that reason I wanted to rise very briefly 
to indicate our support for the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to hear the member from the New Democratic 
Party support the amendment because I likewise support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back in history to 1980 when I was appointed principal 
of a school in Alberta.  From 1980 to 1984, whenever a transfer 
student came in from anywhere, accompanying the student would be 
all kinds of records.  These would include not only school and 
academic records but behavioural records and even criminal 
records if that were the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, when someone arrived at our school who had a 
past history of criminal activity, it made it a whole lot easier 
for the school to accept him and to enter into specific programs 
or interventions that would make it easier for the populace to 
accept him.  It also made it a whole lot safer for people around 
the individual depending on what the circumstances were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 the Young Offenders Act became law, and suddenly there 
were numerous people transferred into our school without any 
indications other than academic records.  When phone calls were 
made to other school boards or schools they had attended, no 
information was released regarding their behaviour or any 
activities outside school they may have been engaged in that 
could be a danger or threat to other students in the school body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result I saw a very significant change begin to happen.  It 
only took a few months for the first one to come about.  I 
thought a normal schoolyard scrap was developing between two 
individuals.  When we managed to get to the scene and break up 
the so-called fight, I quickly realized that it had gone beyond a 
schoolyard squabble between two young people.  One of then was 
trying to put an end to the life of the other individual.  It was 
that serious.  He had attacked him with a weapon and his 
intentions were to really hurt the young fellow.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time an investigation was done by the police because we 
brought charges.  The investigation involved parental input.  We 
learned that the young individual had taken part in cult 
activities where he had come from, and believed in these kinds of 
activities as a way to resolve difficulties with other people. In 
other words, the individual believed the violence and severe 
assaults he had committed in previous years were legitimate and 
that he should continue that way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we known this was the kind of individual who was coming into 
our school, we could have taken steps that would have possibly 
prevented any threat to other students or other individuals in 
our community who were accessible to the young fellow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1984 until 1992 when I finally retired and went into a new 
profession much like the previous one but where the kids are 
older, it was impossible to determine the kind of individuals we 
were getting with transfers to the school.  I would get reports 
from the city, for example, that the reason certain individuals 
were coming to my school out in the country was because they were 
no longer accepted in any school in the city.  They had been 
expelled from every school in the city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been nice to have been able to determine that 
before they arrived.  It would have been nice to know that they 
had gone through a great pile of difficulties in the city, that 
no school or school board in the city would accept them and that 
they had to move in with relatives in my community and start 
school there.  However I was not allowed to know anything about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This happened so many times that I could almost write a book 
about it.  Why would I want more information on students who were 
being transferred to my school?  Why should the government 
support the amendment that my colleague from the Conservative 
Party has brought forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, when I came here, I have heard that prevention is 
the real key to stopping youth crime.  I agree.  However I would 
like someone from the Liberal government to stand and tell me 
that making sure school authorities do not know the facts about a 
new student is a good measure of prevention.  Prevention of what? 
It makes the community at large unaware of the kind of 
individual living in it.  It makes the teachers and other 
students unaware.  They go on as if the individual is a normal 
human being and that they should not be alerted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if one has the brains of a freshwater trout, common sense 
ought to dictate that it is safer to know what kind of situation 
one is dealing with than not to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the people on that side of the House over the past 
seven years have constantly refused to change the Young Offenders 
Act to give it real teeth.  Along comes an amendment from my 
colleague in the Conservative Party that would add teeth and 
makes perfectly good common sense.  I do not think a school in 
the whole country would not agree to the full disclosure of the 
records of violent young people being transferred into schools. 
The information should be available for the safety and the 
prevention of harm to others.  If the Liberals cannot buy into 
that then they are as bad as I think they are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil (Beauharnois—Salaberry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to recall the facts about Bill C-7 now under 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament, the government introduced a bill to 
amend the Young Offenders Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT49"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT49"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already had a Young Offenders Act which was enforced 
differently in different regions of our country. Each province 
would enforce it in its own way and Quebec is a model in that 
regard. Quebec has its own culture and thus its own way of 
approaching problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois was very much opposed to the first bill 
tabled at that time. 
It had even received the unanimous support of the Quebec national 
assembly, which had passed a motion in November 1999 asking the 
federal Minister of Justice to suspend passage of Bill C-3 and to 
allow Quebec to continue implementing an intervention strategy 
based on prevention and rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois had moved almost 3,000 amendments. In fact, 
it had moved 2,977. That was a lot of amendments for one bill, to 
delay what we call at home—in political language or at least in 
parliamentary language—filibusters. We came back and we moved 
amendments; we moved them to play for time and to prevent passage 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 2001, the Government of Canada introduced in the 
House of Commons Bill C-7, the youth criminal justice Act. There 
was also a reason for this.  Most of us, Liberal members 
here in Ottawa had met with some members of the Quebec national 
assembly to know about the inherent objections to passage of Bill 
C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, after some discussion, five points stood out and we 
made representations to the federal Minister of Justice. A 
specific answer was given to the five points raised by the 
members of the national assembly in their letter. Of course, not 
all the members of the national assembly signed the letter.  We 
did not have consultations with the sovereignist members of the 
national assembly. We had consultations with the federalist 
members of the national assembly because this is also a federal 
bill. We really wanted to know their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We answered the five concerns raised about Bill C-3. We have 
amended the bill to completely resolve these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now learn Quebec's national assembly has unanimously agreed 
to another motion expressing its opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Including the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil:</B> Yes. We still wonder why. For what 
fundamental reasons? We still do not know why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Oh, come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil:</B> When the Bloc Quebecois says that it 
believes Bill C-7 favours— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> You're better at bridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish I could speak without 
hearing all the barnyard noises across the way. The Bloc 
Quebecois believes that Bill C-7 favours repression over the 
rehabilitation of young offenders. Even the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm said in this regard “that the new legislation 
continues to focus on repression by neglecting the needs of young 
offenders. Once more, the federal government has rejected the 
consensus in Quebec that focuses on rehabilitation, an approach 
that is working in Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read this in the press release he issued at that time but we 
are still asking the question. We get the impression that we are 
not reading the same bill. There are two sides to a coin. They 
read the bill one way, and we read it another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that the objective of the federal government 
in Ottawa is not to marginalize young offenders. The purpose of 
this bill is to prevent crime, to ensure the rehabilitation and 
the reintegration of minors into society and to show that when 
they commit an offence there are real consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot oppose such objectives, which will 
make our communities safer as well as allow for the 
rehabilitation of young offenders. We are talking about 
rehabilitation, we are not talking about repression. 
This is why the bill provides that young offenders who have 
committed a serious crime and gets an adult sentence will be held 
apart from adult criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these young poeple are in custody, they are supervised and 
those in charge will provide them with any therapy or other 
program needed for their rehabilitation into the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should realize the obvious: the Bloc Quebecois exaggerates 
all the time. It is a grand master of the art of blowing things 
out of proportion. The balloon eventually blows up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government is not intent on repressing adolescents. 
The measures in the bill give the preference to rehabilitation 
and the reintegration of young offenders into the community. We 
should speak the truth. Some, especially in that party, have a 
tendency to tell the opposite of the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want young offenders to get the help they need to develop in 
our society. A young offender is just starting in life. The 
bill's purpose is to help young offenders through a difficult 
period in their life in the best way possible so that they can have a 
fulfilling life afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is asking the government to withdraw the bill 
or to give Quebec the right to opt out so it can continue to 
implement the current Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> That is the unanimous consensus 
reached by the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil:</B> According to the Bloc, there is a broad 
consensus in Quebec on the effectiveness of the current 
legislation. In this regard, Quebec wants the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that even though there is a Canadian criminal law 
framework for young offenders, Quebec implements its own 
legislation. As the Prime Minister said once more today in the 
House, the proposed legislation would allow Quebec to continue to 
implement its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of the regions would have its own criminal law 
framework. The bill would allow each region of Canada to adapt its 
approach. This frees up resources that can be used for more 
positive action for the young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed bill would give a lot of freedom to provinces. As we 
will see, it will be implemented and if there are problems, we 
will solve them. We will solve them one at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces can apply the bill according to their own needs and 
taking into account their own situation as long as they respect 
the guidelines provided for in the federal act. They are 
guidelines. It is a criminal law framework. What is a framework? 
It is a set of rules that allow each of the regions of Canada to 
adapt and to put forward a particular approach, as has been the 
case until now and as still is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada recognizes the success Quebec has had 
in rehabilitating young offenders. Have members ever seen a 
government pass legislation that goes against well applied 
legislation, against a successful approach put forward by a 
province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur: </B>Yes, the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil:</B> To think that way is to be defeatist, as 
they usually are, and negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon:</B> So Quebec is rather negative? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil:</B> It also encourages Quebec to continue its 
efforts. The federal bill is flexible enough to allow Quebec to 
apply its own legislation regarding young offenders effectively. 
The provisions of the bill meet the needs expressed by the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the youth criminal justice act is founded on federal 
powers governing criminal law and criminal proceedings. There 
should be only one youth criminal justice law framework in Canada 
but with the possibility for each region to apply its own 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that the Bloc Quebecois speaks on behalf of 
Quebecers. I am sorry but when I rise in the House I speak on 
behalf of Quebecers also. We got more votes than they did. I can 
say that I speak on behalf of the majority of Quebecers— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil:</B> —and if I add the Conservative federalist 
vote and the NDP vote, we have more than 60% of the votes in 
Quebec. Therefore when I rise in the House it is an honour for 
me to speak on behalf of the majority of Quebecers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to debate Motion No. 2 to amend Bill C-7.  I 
would like to draw the attention of the House to the content of 
the motion itself, which amends the word may to read shall. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the significance of that word?  That word tells the 
judge that he shall make information available to the appropriate 
school authorities, among other people.  They have to be people 
in a responsible position who need to know information.  That is 
what we are trying to achieve.  Why is this so important? Without 
knowledge, it is impossible to deal with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act deals with young offenders.  Sad to say, there are 
among our young people those who commit violent acts and do 
things they are not supposed to do, things which society says 
should not be done.  Some people would argue that the only way to 
deal with them is to put them in jail or incarcerate them 
somewhere.  That is not the only way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to help young people to understand what they 
have done wrong and how they can right it without first knowing 
who they are.   We need to know who they are if we are going to 
have a program of rehabilitation and a program that will prevent 
future behaviour of this type.  That is the absolute number one 
requirement.  That is what this amendment does.  I am very 
surprised that there are members in the House who are avoiding 
this amendment.  That amendment should pass unanimously in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might ask why are some people not supporting this 
amendment.  I have to refer back to question period today.  I was 
terribly surprised at the response from the Minister of Justice 
to a question raised by the member for Fraser Valley concerning 
two children who were forced to visit their father.  The 
conditions of that particular order were such that we had to 
wonder where the common sense was in this situation.  Rather than 
sympathising with these poor children who did not want to visit 
their father, the minister said the system said they had to go. 
A social worker had to intervene in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was absolutely atrocious that the Minister of Justice, who 
had the golden opportunity to sympathize, to show compassion and 
recognize that there was perhaps a flaw in the system, did 
nothing.  She defended the system, then the law.  She did not 
recognize that there could be a problem.  There are problems not 
only in this instance, but also in a variety of other instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a lot of things can be adjusted in this young offenders 
act, this is an instance where there should be no quarrel.  Yet, 
we had to bring to the government's attention not only at 
committee level, but at report stage the fact that some changes 
had to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that the reason why school officials need 
to know is because they act in loco parentis.  It is significant 
to recognize what this phrase means.  This phrase has been used 
for school boards, teachers and principals.  Teachers who act in 
loco parentis act in the same position as a well meaning 
judicious parent.  It is not only their actions, it is also their 
responsibility.  They have the responsibility to look after our 
most precious resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people in this House who have children.  Probably 
the most traumatic experience we face is when our five or six 
year old youngster leaves home for the first time to be entrusted 
to a teacher.  We are giving teachers custody of our children and 
we have to trust them to act in our best interest as parents and 
in the best interests of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our judges ought to be acting in that same way.  They need to 
recognize the responsibility that exists in our schools.  They 
need to recognize the responsibility of teachers and principals. 
Judges should take the same care as if their child were being 
accused of certain things.  What are they trying to do? 
Hopefully, they are not punishing the child but helping him or 
her to grow into responsible citizens.  That is what the purpose 
of this should be and that is what it is.  That is why we want 
the word shall in there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We want it so that the judge shall make it possible that those 
who are charged with the responsibility of looking after our kids 
will do so in a manner that will reflect the values of our 
society and the best thinking among our professional people and 
among us as well-meaning parents.  That is why the word shall 
should be in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now refer to a speech made very recently by the ex-prime 
minister of Great Britain, Margaret Thatcher.  She was at a 
college in the United States recently and reminded the assembled 
group of a visit she had from Mr. Gorbachev just before the 
system changed in the communist U.S.S.R. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She made the observation that he recognized that the system was 
not working and that an attitude had to change.  The attitude 
that had to change was that human beings need to have the 
incentive to do what is right coming from within them, that the 
government could not force upon them a certain behaviour pattern. 
The government tried that for 50 years.  It did not work. Finally 
the economic system broke down.  The social system broke down. 
The judicial system broke down.  Fear itself was no longer strong 
enough to bring these people under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Thatcher said there is one thing we need to recognize, 
which is that the human spirit requires liberty in order to evoke 
the best and most noblest of emotions.  That is what we need to 
engender in young people.  We need to recognize that the greatest 
liberty for youth is to be able to walk down the street safe from 
the threat of punishment or violent attack.  The same thing 
should happen in the corridors of schools.  As well, teachers 
should know that they are free and have the liberty to work with 
these youngsters without feeling the threat of being violently 
attacked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do that we have to know who these people are.  That is not an 
infringement on their privacy.  They took the public action of 
committing violent acts.  Those acts were not done in secret. 
They took it upon themselves to make victims of us all, because 
when one of us is attacked we all suffer, directly or indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many of us did not empathize with the two young kids who had 
to go and visit their father, a convicted sex offender?  Who did 
not?  It would be a very callous, heartless person who would not 
sympathize with that.  We did sympathize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we want to create an environment where school officials will 
indeed have the knowledge and then develop the skills in order to 
treat these people.  Can it be done?  Yes, it can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to an interview in the Vancouver <I>Province</I> 
with RCMP inspector Rick Betker.  He has been a cop for 30 years 
and has seen every type of bad guy and heard every sob story 
excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Inspector Betker waxing so enthusiastic about a program 
in which the bad guys do not go to jail, do not go to court and 
do not even get charged?  For him the answer is simple:  because 
it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this program?  “Probably for me it is the most positive 
thing I have seen in 30 years of policing”, he says of the 
community justice forums he has now started in Victoria's western 
suburbs, where he commands the RCMP detachment.  The idea of the 
forums is to bring offenders and victims together face to face, 
with a trained facilitator, to talk about what happened and to 
work out a resolution that leaves both happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inspector Betker says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very powerful...You can see the remorse (in offenders). 
You can see...this may be the first time they really realize how 
their actions have affected not just the victim, but their own 
family as well. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an RCMP officer with 30 years' experience who shows us a 
way.  It is not the only way, but it is a way that works.  Will 
we give that kind of tool to our educators and school 
authorities, which is what we are talking about today?  Will we 
tell the judges they shall make it possible for them to do that? 
Yes, we should do that.  I hope we all support this amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to this bill on criminal justice for young persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the week of recess, the Bloc Quebecois members were 
working; we went on a tour. My colleague from Berthier—Montcalm 
went on a tour of all the Quebec regions to meet with people. 
Unlike the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, we met with people 
and asked them their views about the young offenders bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, many representatives of organizations with a 
particular expertise on troubled youth or young people with 
delinquency problems have a different approach. They told us that the 
bill was unacceptable and that it was a major change of direction with 
respect to the rehabilitation of young persons who have committed 
minor or serious offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that we do not deplore the fact that these 
young people are committing criminal offences, serious offences 
against some people, and that it affects society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the new member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, who got 
elected on the promise to have a bridge built in that riding, say 
that once again the Bloc Quebecois wanted to delay the passage of 
the legislation and that we were in bad faith. I remind the House 
that we have done some field work. In my riding, representatives 
from 15 different organizations, people who are working with 
street youth or in youth centres, came to tell us that this 
legislation represented an approach totally contrary to the one 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Jasmin committee was struck to 
conduct a study aimed at improving the approach used to work with 
young people who have committed serious criminal acts. What we 
wanted in Quebec was to act more swiftly, ensure consistency of 
action and give more room to parents and victims, and to have a 
good measure at the right time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation put forward by the minister ignored that 
approach. To illustrate what we mean when we say that our 
approach is different in Quebec, and that it brings a good 
measure at the right time, I will summarize Hughes' case and how 
under Bill C-7 that young person would be accompanied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hugues would appear before a court after his offence. Given the 
antecedents of the accused, the crown would deny him a release on 
bail and Hugues' counsel would agree by strategy. After a 30 day 
period, at best, the trial would begin and Hugues would finally 
be found guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen then? A pre-sentence report would be 
requested. After a minimum of 30 days, the report would recommend 
eight months detention. Hugues would have already served two 
months of temporary detention. The judge would sentence him to 
four months in prison. Hugues would serve two-thirds of the 
sentence; he would really serve 80 days, at worst. 
Note that during the 80 days of detention, Hugues will not have 
access to rehabilitation programs; he will be left to himself. 
Finally, our specialists, teachers and scholars will become 
prison guards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the bill this member, who says he is a Quebecer, will 
support.  He will support the federal minister.  Under the 
existing Young Offenders Act, there is a totally different 
approach providing immediate support.  This is what the Jasmin 
committee requested: quick action in dealing with young persons 
who have committed a serious crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be an appearance before the court and a request for a 
report on the adolescent.  His background will show that his 
belonging to a street gang is the problem and that he is 
retrievable. The crown and the defence attorney will probably 
agree on a training and social reintegration program where he 
will be kept away from his gang. With a six or eight month social 
intervention program, Hugues has a chance. He will be working 
with specialists who will be more demanding 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can clearly see that the approach we offer in Quebec is 
different.  I do not understand how the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry can say this comes from the Bloc 
Quebecois.  It goes well beyond the Bloc, it is a consensus. 
Therefore, one must think twice before supporting this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another event occurred last week.  A motion was unanimously 
passed at the national assembly.  I must stress that the Parti 
Quebecois and Bloc Quebecois members are not the only ones to 
oppose the minister's bill.  There are also federalist members in 
the national assembly who adopted a motion asking for 
Quebec to be excluded.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, as a matter of fact we are 
against the amendment, if that is what the hon. member wants me 
to say. We are opposed to the amendment because we do not want 
piecemeal amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want piecemeal amendments but rather for Quebec to 
opt out. We want Quebec to be excluded from the application of 
the act that the minister is trying to impose on Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of what flexible federalism is not. This 
is another example, like the millennium scholarships and 
parental leave. The fact is they do not understand the way 
Quebec does things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that members of the Alliance Party do not 
agree with us because they want a tougher bill, whose approach 
is the exact opposite of the one taken by Quebec. They are at 
the other end of the spectrum from what Quebec wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say they want to accompany young offenders with this bill. 
To the contrary, they will analyze the seriousness of the 
offence allegedly committed by the young offender rather than 
his background to find ways to postpone measures which would be 
more efficient if implemented at the right time. What does that 
mean? It means that young offenders would not be made aware 
immediately of the seriousness of their offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it toured Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois had the support of an 
actor who portrayed a young offender who had committed a serious 
crime against a person, a crime against life. He was part of a 
gang of young people. 
This young comedian, Marc Beaupré, who played Kevin, spent two 
days in jail to really get into his role of a young offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treating a young offender as an adult will teach him to become a 
criminal instead of teaching him to take responsibility for his 
actions. This was what this young comedian learned during those 
two days. He learned what it was like to go to the school of 
crime, to become part of the network of adult criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the current act resulted in a 23% decrease in the 
crime rate among young people. We have groups in Quebec—there are 
so many that I could not mention them all today—that have thought 
things over. 
These are people whose approach is geared to the needs of young 
people. They are not, as claimed by the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, people who want to delay the passing of 
the bill and who seem to be talking through their hats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's bill involves a major change in direction and we 
deplore the fact that the government does not accept Quebec's 
ways of doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even said that Quebec's model is envied and that it 
generates interest on the part of various stakeholders dealing 
with young people at the international level. We are even told 
that officials from centres in Chile and Brazil came to Quebec 
to see how the act was implemented and how we were dealing with 
young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfortunate because, as with parental leave, Quebec is a 
model but it is being ignored and, more important, it is not 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this act, like the parental leave scheme, will show 
the public just how inflexible the federal government is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to respond today to Motion No. 2 to amend Bill C-7, 
the youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 calls for clause 125 to be amended to make the 
disclosure of information about young persons mandatory rather 
than permissive.  Clause 125, like the Young Offenders Act, 
specifically recognizes the interest that a school, professional 
or other person engaged in the supervision or care of a young 
person may have in receiving information when a young person is 
dealt with in the youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 125 would allow the provincial director, the attorney 
general, a peace officer or any other person engaged in the 
provision of services to a young person to disclose identifying 
information to any professional or other person engaged in the 
supervision or care of a young person, including a representative 
of a school under the following circumstances: first, to ensure 
compliance by the young person with a court order; second, to 
ensure the safety of staff, students or other persons; and, 
third, to facilitate the rehabilitation of the young person. This 
can be done without a court order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clause expands the Young Offenders Act provision that was 
included in 1995 by adding the authority to disclose information 
to facilitate rehabilitation of the young person.  It is 
important to remember that privacy protections are a hallmark of 
the youth justice system in Canada.  Any disclosure of 
identifying information in the youth justice system is dealt with 
as an exception to the general rule that no person shall be given 
access to the record of a young offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-legislative approaches could be developed to assist in 
implementing and supporting the disclosure provisions of the 
youth criminal justice act.  Provinces could develop guidelines 
for police officers, probation officers and others on the issue 
of disclosure of information.  Provincial government officials 
have indicated that they prefer guidelines rather than mandatory 
disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice has provided funding for the Canadian 
School Boards Association to develop an information sharing guide 
and protocol for the education community relating to information 
sharing between schools and professionals in the youth justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disclosure provisions in Bill C-7 strike an appropriate 
balance between the need to support a constructive role for the 
educational system and others working with young people, ensuring 
that pertinent information is disclosed, and the need to respect 
guaranteed privacy protections and to avoid stigmatization of a 
young offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike an automatic notification approach, the approach in Bill 
C-7 would enable the exercise of professional judgment which 
takes into account the circumstances in individual cases, the 
protection of the public and the impact on the rehabilitation of 
the young person. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am speaking to the report 
stage amendment to illustrate as an example the larger difficulty 
with Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment to change the word may to the word shall at page 
129, clause 125, line 4, is a case sample of fundamental 
philosophical confusion.  The Liberals cannot manage and they 
really do not hear the public either for they perpetuate the 
outdated system agenda rather than an accountable people 
community agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that the enactment would repeal and replace 
the Young Offenders Act and provide principles, procedures and 
protections for the prosecution of young persons under criminal 
and other federal laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sets out a range of extra judicial measures.  It is to 
establish judicial procedure and protection for young persons 
alleged to have committed an offence.  It is to encourage 
participation of parents, victims, communities, youth justice 
committees and others in the youth justice system.  It sets out a 
range of sentences available to the youth justice court.  It is 
to establish custody and supervision provisions.  It sets out the 
rules for the keeping of records and protection of privacy.  It 
provides transitional provisions and makes consequential 
amendments to other acts.  Those are the claims of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the government has failed, particularly at 
the operational community level, and at the levels of broad 
themes and societal objectives.  The Minister of Justice tabled 
legislation three times and three times she struck out.  For 
example, the minister once again fails to restrict conditional 
sentencing.  It is open to repeat offenders and it is open to 
violent offenders.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of presumptive offences for which an adult sentence may 
be imposed is severely restrictive.  The list includes murder, 
attempted murder, manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault. 
However it does not include sexual assault with a weapon, hostage 
taking, aggravated assault, kidnapping and a host of other 
serious violent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will further weaken the legislation by limiting 
presumptive offence procedures even more.  For example, in clause 
61 any province may decide that only 15 or 16 year old offenders 
who commit offences such as murder could be transferred to adult 
court.  Ten and eleven year olds are still not to be held 
criminally accountable for their crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would create a patchwork or chequerboard system 
of youth justice as many of its provisions would permit the 
provinces undue discretion whether to seek adult sentencing, 
publication of names and access to records, just to name a few. 
The legislation would provide some movement toward victim rights 
but even those are not ensured and would still be inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia has had a legislative basis for diversion since 
1968, some 33 years ago.  Parliament has been struggling with a 
criminal set of rules since 1908 to address the specialness of 
young offenders.  Now we have a bill that is so complex it caves 
in upon itself to accomplish the original broad objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to clarify the basics.  We are striving for a set of 
rules that outlines how criminal law would apply to a child or a 
young person.  It is assumed that there is a diminished capacity 
for a young person to appreciate criminal acts and therefore 
should not be subject to the full weight of the law.  As the bill 
shows the Liberals have fallen all over themselves.  They have 
tied themselves in knots because they do not have a guiding 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each province we have social welfare legislation with large 
systems of care, including social workers who have the legal 
capacity to take into care with the full authority of a legal 
parent any child who is deemed to be in need of care and 
protection.  If we had a wise but simple and more circumscribed 
youth criminal justice act, it could complement and support the 
social welfare mandates of the provinces.  However the latest 
managerial disaster of the government is off target in this 
respect because philosophically the Liberals do not stand for 
anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A dichotomy is revealed in the bill. Through many convoluted 
provisions it tries to deal with the principle of diminished 
capacity for young people but in a most complex way tries to 
accommodate violent offenders and criminal code precepts such as 
protection of society and denunciation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the community expectations of a government providing 
peace, order and good government are not met in the bill.  The 
anger in the land over public observance of how young offenders 
are dealt with generally in the courts will not be diminished 
with this prime example of Liberal ideological confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the symbolic yet substantive amendment is very 
important.  It is about knowledge to care.  If a social welfare 
agency, a social worker or school authority is to be part of the 
community response for children in conflict with the law, they 
must be knowledgeable and fully informed.  That must not be 
discretionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous minister of justice had no satisfactory answer when 
I asked him in question period about the principle of disclosure, 
all the secrecy around the operations of the law, and to deal 
with the theory of preventing community shame for young people to 
give them a fresh start.  How can pursuing that theory be 
justified when its very operation has caused unnecessary deaths 
as a consequence?  The government persists in pursuing its 
unsubstantiated theory even though people have died because of 
it.  Secrecy has no place in young offender court proceedings and 
its final judgments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the bill is so misguided that it will be back to the 
House in the future.  It is not based in its substance on a 
reasonable canopy of values.  The preamble of the bill is nice 
sounding fuzzy mush.  Then comes the substance of 171 pages that 
does not put to rest what communities want: predictability, 
reliability, clarity, being operationally pragmatic and having 
political legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report stage amendment before us today reveals the utter 
confusion upon which the bill is based.  My community does not 
support that kind of a bill and I cannot justify it either. 
Consequently I will be voting against the bill at third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
many things were said about Bill C-7. I listened to the speeches 
made by some Liberal members and I am very disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one issue where we must avoid playing politics, and 
I try to avoid it myself, it is the young offenders issue. 
I sincerely doubt that if they have to rise to vote for this 
bill as they did for the motion to curtail the debate, these 
members will do it with great relish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent 14 days doing a whirlwind tour of all Quebec's regions. 
I met with judges, lawyers, Crown attorneys, stakeholders, 
victims, persons in charge of centres for victims of crime and 
senior citizens. Even the Quebec Federation of Senior Citizens of 
some administrative regions supported the approach, not the 
Bloc's approach, and it was more a social than a political tour, 
but the purpose which was to defeat Bill C-7 proposed by the 
Minister of Justice and to allow Quebec to continue enforcing the 
Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met at least 20 organizations per region or more than 400 
people. Right from the beginning I knew there was a consensus in 
Quebec. After the tour, it was obvious that we should not talk of 
consensus but of unanimity. 
Everyone I met unanimously said that the justice minister was on 
the wrong track and that by wanting to impose her own vision of 
things she was jeopardizing the Quebec approach, that shows 
beyond any reasonable doubt that we have a winning formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke from a non-political point of view in a non-partisan 
way. As members know I was accompanied by Marc Beaupré, the young 
and talented actor who played Kevin in the TV series <I>Les Deux 
frères</I>, in order to reach a segment of the population that we, 
as politicians, are unable to reach simply because we may enjoy 
the credibility we justly deserve. Our credibility among people 
in general is not very high. This actor was very surprised to see 
that nobody was in favour of the minister's legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand Quebec Liberal members who rise to say the 
opposite of what their constituents are saying. Earlier as I was 
listening to the speech by the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry—I do not want to play politics—I was 
wondering if he was on the same planet as I was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced he was simply reading from a speech prepared for 
him and which he was delivering without being aware of its 
content. He went as far as making light of his Liberal friends in 
the national assembly who unanimously voted with the government 
in favour of a motion asking the Government of Canada for a 
special allowance so that Quebec might continue implementing the 
Young Offenders Act. He even ridiculed his colleagues in the 
national assembly saying that they did not know what they were 
doing. Imagine that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly I realize that the justice minister might have made 
commitments to her constituents in western Canada who, under the 
influence of the Canadian Alliance and the right wing movement in 
Canada, are asking for a much more punitive legislation to deal 
with young offenders. 
Coming from Alberta, the minister undoubtedly made such a 
commitment.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to bring up politics but the minister can, if she 
wants to, answer all the expectations of the west as well as 
those of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have moved the only amendment which should be accepted here. 
The amendment we are talking about would add a couple of words to 
a subsection without changing the ultimate purpose of the 
legislation. We are totally against such an amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rotten apples will stay rotten apples, no matter what. The same 
is true with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the only acceptable amendments, to please everybody 
as well as to make concessions are the two proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois. According to one of those amendments the lieutenant 
governor in council of a province may, by order, exempt from the 
application of Bill C-7 a young person between 12 and 18 
years of age. In such a case the Young Offenders Act would 
continue to apply in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would please both sides. Those who wish a stricter 
legislation would have Bill C-7 which will be passed and those 
who wish to continue enforcing the Young Offenders Act will be 
able to do so since one section would allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will ask if this is legal, if it is constitutional. 
I would not promote something that was not.  Some may have doubts 
and questions when it comes from me but a legal opinion was 
tabled in the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three constitutionalists, people doing law involving young 
people, examined these amendments or similar ones.  With the 
decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada on the application of 
criminal law, on regional differences and the social aspect of 
criminal law, they concluded that it was legal and feasible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can do it but one thing is lacking: political 
will.  When I reached out to the Minister of Justice this morning 
I was sincere and am still.  It is not too late.  Let the 
minister set her bill aside.  Together we will repeat the tour of 
Quebec I did in the past few days. She will be able to see for 
herself.  She will hear for herself what the regional 
stakeholders have to say.  She will see how the Young Offenders 
Act is applied daily.  No one will support her proposed repeal of 
the Young Offenders Act, on the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I have the clear impression that the minister is in a 
glass bubble here in Ottawa.  She is defending a bill drafted by 
public servants in Ottawa's fine office towers who have 
absolutely no idea how the Young Offenders Act is applied on a 
daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today these officials have made it a personal issue.  They want 
the bill passed at any cost, even at the risk of threatening a 
Quebec approach that shows how well we succeed in Quebec.  We 
have the lowest crime rate.  They want to implement it at any 
cost and win, as if they had something to win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not too late.  If the Minister of Justice and the Prime 
Minister are sincere when they say they want to allow Quebec to 
continue to enforce it, I would hope that they will act on it, 
that the minister will first agree to tour with me and that she 
will then vote in favour of the amendments we have proposed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise on behalf of the constituents 
of Calgary East to speak to the Motion No. 2 at report stage 
consideration of Bill C-7 dealing with the issue of young 
persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act has been the talk of Canadians for a 
long time.  I have received numerous calls and petitions in my 
riding in reference to the Young Offenders Act.  The government 
is now making an attempt to address these concerns, but like 
everything else it does it is a haphazard attempt to address the 
concerns of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to my colleague from the Bloc who said that whatever 
amendment was done was because the minister was from the west.  I 
should like to tell him that there is uniformity across the 
nation in asking that the Young Offenders Act be reviewed, that 
proper amendments be made and that concerns be addressed. The 
government has failed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government brought in closure on the bill.  It left 
the impression that it is serious about the issue of young 
offenders and was bringing in closure in order to pass the bill. 
However the history of the government on the bill has been very 
poor.  It has been in the process for six and a half years.  The 
government dissolved parliament without thinking about the impact 
of that on the bill.  I hope Canadians do not see closure as an 
attempt by the government to take the issue seriously because it 
is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the motion in amendment put forward by my colleague 
in the Conservative Party because a concern has been expressed by 
teachers, and rightly so, that they need to know what they are 
dealing with.  I will repeat what some teachers in Calgary have 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to statistics Calgary schools are no strangers to 
violence.  In the 1999-2000 school year more than 1,300 students 
in Catholic and public schools were suspended for incidents 
related to drugs, alcohol, weapons and assault.  That is a huge 
number.  We are putting an undue burden on teachers.  Naturally 
they need the tools by which to deal with rising violence in 
schools so that they can protect students and provide 
rehabilitation for those who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not related to this, only yesterday there was an unfortunate 
incident at a Calgary high school where two young students went 
outside to fight.  Regrettably one of the students lost his life. 
The incident has shocked everyone in Calgary.  It underlines the 
fact that teachers need the tools to stop these kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all very saddened that a young, promising individual lost 
his life.  For what?  From the newspaper I understand that it 
dispute had been brewing in the corridors for a while.  If 
teachers had known about it, I am sure they could have addressed 
it and cooled passions, and a young man would not have lost his 
life.  School boards are requesting that they be given the tools 
to address the issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual the government only went halfway by saying that it may 
disclose information on violent offenders to school boards if it 
feels it is necessary.  Those involved in teaching and school 
affairs have said that such a system has not worked.  Let us look 
at what they have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Alberta School Boards Association, says the 
provisions do nothing to improve the release of information to 
schools.  Let me quote her: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking for the amendment because we believe without it 
you are going to get the haphazard (situation) that we have right 
now. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one has to share information so it is left to the person to 
decide who needs to be told.  That has not worked.  It is left to 
someone else to decide what information is important and what 
information is not.  When the decision is left to someone else, 
the right information may not go fast enough.  As a result, we do 
not know what kinds of situations there are in our schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to create an environment of safety.  Schools need a safe 
environment.  They are where our children learn.  Our children 
are the future of the nation.   What children learn in school 
will form and shape the society of the future.  They therefore 
need a safe environment in school where they can go and learn 
without fear or intimidation.  Newspaper reports across the 
country and across the continent have shown an increase in school 
violence and this is creating concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a son who goes to Lisgar high school in Ottawa and at 
times I am concerned about violence in school.  I am concerned 
about the atmosphere in which he is growing up.  At times that 
puts pressure on me to find out what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is commendable that teacher associations have raised these 
issues.  They are looking after the best interests of students, 
and rightly so.  We should give them the tools.  However the bill 
would leave the decisions to someone who is not in the school 
system.  It would be up to someone outside the school system to 
decide whether the information should or should not be released 
to schools.  As a parent I am saying that it should be released 
to the schools and to teachers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the argument of my colleagues from the Bloc who are 
opposing the motion.  They say they do not want to go this route 
because, if I understand correctly, youth crime is not very high 
in Quebec.  At the end of the day we need to create a safe 
environment in schools so that students can study, which is what 
they are there for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I feel it is very important that we support the 
motion.  I am happy to support it although I do not support the 
bill in totality.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague from 
Berthier—Montcalm when he spoke about his amendment a few 
moments ago. I wish to draw to the attention of the House the 
fact that there is an error in the text of the amendment as shown 
in today's order paper and notice paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed by my colleague should read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.1 The lieutenant governor in council of a province may, by 
order, fix an age greater than twelve years— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says 10 years in the document but it should say 12. I 
know the member for Berthier—Montcalm will see to it that the 
necessary correction is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment that was tabled and signed by the member says 
“twelve years” but there is an error in today's notice paper. 
You should have this information, Mr. Speaker, so the necessary 
correction can be made. My colleague is taking care of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to Bill C-7. I listened to the member who 
spoke before me and he expressed his support for the amendment 
proposed by the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand this amendment, one has to look at the bill 
because the text of the amendment itself makes absolutely no 
sense. If one reads paragraph 125(6) of the bill, one will 
see that it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>125.(6) The provincial director, a youth worker, the Attorney 
General, a peace officer or any other person engaged in the 
provision of services to young persons may disclose— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposes to replace the word “may” with the word 
“shall”. This kind of amendment can only be characterized as 
trivial. In a bill containing such a large number of pages and 
clauses, an amendment is proposed to replace the word “may” with 
the word “shall” in one particular paragraph but not anywhere 
else where there can be disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 125 is all about disclosure of information. It says “may 
disclose” in virtually every paragraph. Why is it that all of a 
sudden, in paragraph 125(6), it should no longer be “may disclose 
information” but “shall disclose information”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clause said that information may be disclosed to teachers. I 
do not understand why this should be turned into an obligation. 
It is not always necessary to disclose information to all 
teachers involved with a young person. In comprehensive schools, 
there is not just one teacher in charge of a group of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A student who is considered an offender could have classes with 
10 or 12 teachers in a single week. Should the information 
be disclosed to all of them? We might as well brand him or her on the 
forehead so that everybody knows he or she is an offender. It would 
be like in the United States, where convicted offenders have to hang a 
sign at their doorstep saying “A pedophile lives here”, or “A 
sexual offender lives here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are we heading with this kind of policy? In all 
simplicity and truthfulness, I worry very much about the future 
of Canadian society when I hear some of the debates we have had 
in the House since 1993. If this bill is passed, I hope Quebecers 
will understand that they do not want to be part of a country 
that deals with its young people is the way Bill C-7 would. 
We should get out of this country. It 
is urgent. It is a fundamental reason for leaving when we cannot 
agree on such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard what the Ontario attorney general had to say. He wants 
the bill to be even more repressive. Let those who want to travel 
that road do so but give us a chance to maintain the status quo 
because it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister not want to understand? Why do the 
ministers of the Canadian government who represent Quebec not 
want to understand? I have often heard the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the Minister for International 
Trade say “Quebecers are well represented in cabinet. We are 
Quebecers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how Quebecois they are if they cannot understand the 
message sent by Quebecers who do not want Bill C-7. What are 
they waiting for to stand up and say to the minister to go back 
to the drawing board? This does not make any sense. This is 
unacceptable. I fail to understand why the federal Liberals from 
Quebec are the only ones to agree with this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the representatives of the people in the national assembly, 
who represent the people of Quebec, unanimously said no to Bill 
C-7 “We must keep the law as it is; we want to continue to make 
the crime rate go down; we want to continue to rehabilitate our 
young people who are experiencing difficulties”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young person who is experiencing a delinquency problem at age 
12 is not a criminal. He is not a bandit. Unfortunately he is a 
child who was poorly raised, who was neglected by his parents and 
who was badly influenced in school, by a movie or something else, 
but something happened to him. 
He was not born an offender. He became an offender but he was not 
born so. At the time of their birth, children have the potential 
to become balanced and honest people, good workers, sincere 
persons and so on. Society shapes them. Then they become 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we not approach children in a way which would treat 
them as victims rather than criminals? It is irresponsible on the 
part of adults not to acknowledge the importance of taking care 
of children and rehabilitating them instead of putting them 
behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the opportunity to meet young Marc Beaupré, who helped my 
colleague from Berthier—Montcalm on his tour of Quebec and who 
met several colleagues. He told us that in order to portray his 
character on TV, he spent short periods in prison. This allowed 
him to learn things to better play his role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish he could be a member of parliament for one day in order 
to stand in the House and tell members what inmates tried to 
teach him during his short stay in prison so he could become a 
real criminal. He was taught the tricks of the trade. Prison is 
not the appropriate place for children. Coercion is not the way 
to rehabilitate young offenders. They must be taken charge of and 
given the support they need to become rehabilitated and honest 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, some children had the misfortune to commit 
reprehensible actions. Society as well as justice took care of 
them. There are even people who did reprehensible things when 
they were young and who have since become ordinary citizens and 
active members of their community. They have become fathers and 
mothers who take good care of their children and raise them the 
right way. 
It is a lot better than to have sent them to prison where they 
would have become bad seeds, which is exactly what this bill 
wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the amendments brought before the House is a cosmetic one. 
Members know as well as I do that when applied cosmetics do not 
last long and do not mean much. We know what cosmetics are worth. 
It is only a cover-up attempt that does not deal with the real 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague has put forward some basic and fundamental 
amendments. The lieutenant governor in council of a province 
should have the authority to exempt his or her province from the 
application of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During question period today, my colleague from Roberval told me 
“If the minister refuses to write it down, she must have reasons 
to do so. She knows full well that it will be not be possible 
afterwards”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Papineau—Saint-Denis, among others, has 
some influence in cabinet, I strongly urge him to stand up and 
say that as a true Quebecer he supports Quebec's demands.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, despite the interest and concerns that Canadians have 
expressed over the failure of the Young Offenders Act to deal 
effectively with youth crime, the Liberal government seems to be 
at a loss for finding a solution to this problem.  Today the only 
solution the Liberals are willing to impose is closure. 
I am very disappointed in the response as there are serious 
issues that remain to be debated. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice introduced the legislation into the 
House, but unfortunately the new legislation contains very 
little, if anything, that will address the ineffectiveness of the 
Young Offenders Act.  The lack of substantive change is not 
surprising, given the lack of consultation and the failure to 
listen to the many Canadians who have reasonable solutions to 
offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a substantive way, the closure being imposed today by the 
Liberals is symbolic of the seven years of not listening to the 
people of Canada and to the concerns that they have over the 
Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate some of the comments raised by members of the Bloc. 
There certainly are issues that need to be discussed.  However I 
would suggest that the Bloc need not worry about this bill 
sending anyone to jail.  The bill is so convoluted that I would 
be surprised if the youth will ever get out of court and out of 
the clutches of judges and lawyers.  They will certainly never 
see the inside of any type of rehabilitative program that could 
assist them.  In that sense I certainly agree that the law is not 
a good law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also would express some sympathy in the Bloc's desire to 
ensure that the programs that it already has in the province that 
are working should be allowed to continue under the act.  There 
should be a measure of flexibility to account for different 
programs and different issues that we face in different parts of 
the country.  We can do this without taking the drastic and 
radical step of suggesting separation.  I think the confederation 
is flexible enough to take into account some of these 
differences.  However, given that the Liberals are imposing 
closure in the matter, there are a few things that need to be 
discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the specific issue of notification to school and 
child welfare authorities in respect of young offenders.  The 
Canadian School Boards Association, the Canadian Association of 
School Administrators and the Canadian Teachers Federation have 
called on the federal government to make the disclosure of this 
information mandatory.  I also received letters from a number of 
local school boards in my riding and across Canada which called 
for parliament to support the amendment to Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the concerns expressed regarding a possible failure to 
keep the information confidential.  These organizations and the 
people who are in these organizations, our school administrators, 
are well acquainted with the requirements of confidential 
information and how to utilize that information in a legally 
appropriate way so as to assist other students and, indeed, the 
young offender himself or herself in the context of the school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with representatives from the school boards.  They 
impressed upon me the need for school authorities to be informed 
if there were, for example, dangerous offenders among the 
students.  They are not asking for a broad publication, but 
simply that the school authorities know so that that information 
can be taken and used for appropriate purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment would not only provide for safer learning 
environments, it would also enable schools to direct necessary 
assistance to those young people who were in the process of 
rehabilitating themselves back into society. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These school boards want to be real and effective partners with 
the government in the process of keeping our young people safe 
and secure.  However, the federal justice minister refuses to 
take the step to help school officials provide such a safe 
learning environment.  She has said repeatedly that the provision 
already exists in the proposed youth criminal justice act and 
permits provincial officials to provide this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it should be pointed out that the present Young 
Offenders Act already provides for this discretionary sharing of 
information in these cases, but as we all know that process has 
failed.  The new bill simply reintroduces past failures.  The 
minister ought to listen to reasonable people across Canada who 
want to provide every possible support.  The executive director 
of the CSBA has said “Without an amendment requiring information 
sharing we simply can't do our job”.  She says “Our surveys 
indicate that information sharing has been inconsistent—sporadic 
at best”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other significant shortcomings of Bill C-7 is its 
failure to make provisions to assist youth under the age of 12. 
I have raised this issue in the past but the government has done 
nothing to remedy these shortcomings, to put in place a system 
that will prevent under 12 year olds from becoming repeat 
offenders and indeed hardened criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the minister attempts to justify this failure on the basis 
that the provincial child welfare system would deal with children 
under 12 who are involved in criminal activity, it is clear that 
the child welfare system on its own, without the assistance of 
our youth courts, is not equipped to deal with children whose 
criminal conduct brings them to the attention of the authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is evident from recent statements by the Minister of Justice 
that the real reason for Liberal reluctance to improve the 
proposed youth crime legislation is the financial commitment that 
would be required in order to assist children under the age of 
12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has proposed that we provide the courts 
with the power to allow them to provide to these children the 
same rehabilitative measures offered by the act to those over 12 
years old.  Working together with provincial child welfare 
authorities in a co-operative and co-ordinated fashion, the youth 
courts could supervise these children and ensure that we save them 
from a life of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most significant issue aside from legislation and the lack 
of substantive reform in this new bill is that the minister has 
refused to financially partner with the provinces on a 50:50 
basis.  When asked why, she has said that the federal government 
does not have the money.  This is a federal program, a federal 
initiative, and yet she expects the provinces to pick up, in 
effect, 75% of the cost of her program.  The minister is asking 
us as local taxpayers to pick up the cost that the federal 
government will not pick up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there is some initial funding over the first number of 
years, the funding, as is well known with other federal programs, 
becomes discretionary.  As we know all too well, the funding will 
eventually diminish if not disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, the bill is a complex bill.  Mr. Rob Finlayson, a 
committee witness from the province of Manitoba and assistant 
deputy minister, said on April 25 of this year: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the complexity in proceedings and drafting, the complexity of 
the YCJA is perhaps the first thing that strikes a person who 
attempts to read it.  This complexity has two undesirable 
consequences.  It makes the act extremely difficult to 
understand, and it will create delay and cause court backlogs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Finlayson, the assistant deputy minister, has a long history 
of working in the courts and indeed at one time was in charge of 
youth prosecutions in the province of Manitoba.  He understands 
the issue.  Canadians understand the issue.  Why does the 
Minister of Justice not understand this problem? 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the constituents of Surrey 
Central to participate in the report stage debate on Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government appears to have only reintroduced its 
previous legislation, Bill C-68 and Bill C-3.  In Bill C-7, the 
name of the bill was changed for window dressing but the problems 
remain.  On top of that, using closure to stop debate and move 
the bill through clearly shows the government does not care and 
lacks the political will to have effective legislation in the 
youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask if this is what happens to the top priority 
of the justice minister.  It is shameful.  The amendment we are 
currently debating, put forth by the fifth party in the House, 
calls for a requirement to divulge the identity of a young 
offender to any professional or other person engaged in the 
supervision or care of a young person.  This requirement to make 
known the identity and record of a young offender falls on the 
shoulders of the provincial director, a youth worker, the 
attorney general, a peace officer or any other person engaged in 
the provision of services to young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment kicks in if such disclosure of this information 
is necessary, and the bill says it is necessary to ensure that 
the young person complies with orders under the act, to ensure 
the safety of staff, students and other persons, and to 
facilitate the rehabilitation of the young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is reasonable.  It is the least of what this side 
of the House is asking of the government.  It is a shame the 
Liberals are stuck with their heads buried in the sand, refusing 
to allow even basic amendments to their bill even though they 
have introduced or accepted 182 amendments, 180 of which are just 
technical in nature, which shows that when they drafted the bill 
it was poorly drafted from just a technical point of view as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment we are debating today is what the Canadian 
Alliance asked for at committee stage of the bill.  People in our 
society such as teachers, counsellors, camp counsellors, 
volunteers, sports coaches, supervisors at religious events and 
many others need to know that there is a young person in their 
midst who is capable of violent behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with regret that I watched the infamous video clips on 
BCTV when a student in a school badly beat his schoolmate while 
other kids watched.  Someone from the group secretly videotaped 
it.  I saw in yesterday's or today's news that this aggressor has 
joined boxing to let off steam.  I believe that Canadians want 
such aggressive behaviour or the offenders in those cases 
identified, in this case to the coach and to other officials who 
are responsible for management and supervision of other youths in 
that group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The refusal of the government to accept an amendment that would 
notify people in supervisory roles about the presence of a young 
offender in their midst is typical of the way the government has 
handled the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After months of review and after hearing so many experts on all 
aspects of youth justice systems, the only changes the government 
has agreed to make are technical amendments proposed by the 
government to correct the technical errors of Bill C-3, the 
predecessor to Bill C-7.  The government has not been open to 
changing any aspect of its legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the opposition parties except the Bloc presented 
substantial amendments to Bill C-3.  Those amendments did not 
receive debate in parliament.  What a shame that we are not 
debating those amendments here.  They were not accepted in the 
committee.  They do not appear to have been considered by the 
government at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has tried this legislation three times 
and three times she has struck out.  The Canadian Alliance, 
through its former version, the Reform Party, and the justice 
committee first endorsed alternative measures for first time 
non-violent offenders.  The minister has once again failed to 
restrict this form of conditional sentencing.  It is open to 
repeat offenders and it is open to violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of presumptive offences for which an adult sentence may 
be imposed is severely restrictive.  The list includes murder, 
attempted murder, manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault.  It 
does not include sexual assault with a weapon, hostage taking, 
aggravated assault, kidnapping and a host of other serious 
violent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-7 the minister has further weakened the legislation by 
limiting presumptive offence procedure even more.  Through clause 
61 any province may decide that only 15 year old or 16 year old 
offenders who commit offences such as murder could be transferred 
to adult court, while 10 year olds and 11 year olds would still 
not be held criminally responsible for their crimes.  There is a 
free ride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would create a patchwork or checkerboard system 
of youth justice as many of its provisions permit the provinces 
undue discretion in deciding whether to seek adult sentencing, in 
publication of names and in access to records, to name just a 
few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation provides some movement toward victims' rights 
but even those are not ensured and are still woefully inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces will be tasked to administer this legal nightmare 
but the federal government does not seem to care.  This weak 
Liberal government, which is so arrogant, which lacks vision, 
which lacks backbone, does not care.  The Liberals have not been 
open to a serious discussion of the proposals in their youth 
justice law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have promised $206 million over the first three 
years for the implementation of the bill, but that will not even 
come close to meeting their responsibility of providing 50% of 
the funding for youth justice.  The Liberals have allowed federal 
funding to slip to about 20%.  The provinces have to carry the 
can financially for these proposals, the costs of which will rise 
dramatically through legal argument and procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initial review of Bill C-7 indicates that the government has 
made it even weaker, likely to appease the Quebec government and 
the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the presumptive offence provision that moves youth 
14 years of age and older automatically to adult court for murder 
et cetera, now permits the provinces, that is, Quebec, to raise 
the age to restrict the transfer to only 15 year old and 16 year 
old offenders.  Age of application remains at 12 years to 18 
years, and there are still restrictions on naming violent 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill still has an emphasis on attempting to understand the 
circumstances underlying criminal behaviour and on rehabilitation 
and reintegration.  The protection of the public plays second 
fiddle. 
Denunciation and deterrence seem to be foreign words to the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the legislation passes, the complexities and loopholes would 
cause horrendous delays and costs to our youth criminal justice 
process.  Legal bills would be phenomenal.  The government should 
understand that deterrence should not be a motivation to commit a 
crime.  The amendment, if accepted, would provide for deterrence. 
It would also provide an opportunity to develop solutions for a 
safer environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
debate started on Bill C-7, I have learned how effective the 
Young Offenders Act was in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This all began with the press conference my colleague for 
Berthier—Montcalm held in Sept-Îles, which was attended by many 
organizations dealing with youth, including the police chief. On 
that occasion, I collected many testimonials about how well youth 
had been helped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recess, I travelled around my riding. I met with 
parents and of course the discussion dealt with Bill C-7. I heard 
very emotional testimonials. A mother, with tears in her eyes, 
told me how, in Quebec, her husband had been helped when he was 
young. Who did not make any mistake? Who among us can boast that 
he never made a mistake? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That woman told me that today he is out of trouble and he is 
angry because this government is so pigheaded. Never in the 
history of any government have we seen a government so stubborn 
in its position against another government, against a nation, 
over a law that is so good and that has proved so good in Quebec. 
An expert from Montreal told us “It has been said before, and I 
say it again, that law is universally approved in Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another witness told me “My kid is 14 years old; he is too young 
to buy cigarettes, too young to buy booze, too young to vote. 
But the federal government says that he is not too young to be 
judged like an adult, that he should act like an adult. Giving a 
last chance is not an option”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put ourselves in the shoes of the parents of these 
children. I do not know how many of the members have children. If 
one of their children was to tell them that they have made a 
mistake, a serious mistake, they would ask for another chance,

asked. How will they react? How will they vote? That is something 
we have been asked. How will they vote? I disappointed a lot of 
people by saying that we are used to seeing them follow. When the time 
comes for a vote, their leader gets up and they all follow, 
voting as he did. They do not have the right to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is great in the Bloc is that we have the right to speak. 
We have the right to express ourselves. I think the Bloc's 
history in Ottawa proved that a long time ago.

that and barge into an area of provincial jurisdiction, of Quebec 
jurisdiction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind the House in the few minutes that I have left of 
the history of the Canadian environmental process as opposed to 
the history and claims of Quebec in terms of environmental 
assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite ironic to see former members of the Quebec national 
assembly, members of the Robert Bourassa government that defended 
Quebec's interests and who are now federal Liberal members, 
getting ready to pass this bill which goes against everything 
that Quebec wanted under Robert Bourassa, René Lévesque, Jacques 
Parizeau, Pierre-Marc Johnson and every Quebec government since 
1975, since the beginning of the environmental process in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal environmental assessment initiative is not new. 
On June 18, 1990, the federal government decided to introduce a 
bill, Bill C-78, dealing with the federal environmental 
assessment process. In many respects, this bill represented 
duplication and invaded provincial jurisdictions. It was a bill 
of which, at the time, Quebec's national assembly was very 
critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers were so firmly opposed to the bill that in 1990 
Quebec's minister of the environment, Pierre Paradis, well known 
by members of the House—he always defended Quebec's 
environmental powers and prerogatives—wrote a letter to the 
federal minister of the environment, Robert René de Cotret, to 
ask him for two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, what we wanted in 1990 was for Bill C-78 to 
introduce some flexibility with respect to Quebec's environmental 
assessment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, Quebec's then minister of the environment, 
Liberal Pierre Paradis, asked that the legislation not duplicate 
the process because we had an environmental assessment process 
responsive to Quebec's initiatives, and we still do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the letter, unfortunately,—and as usual it was a 
Liberal government in Quebec that realized this—the federal 
minister of the environment refused to amend the bill dealing 
with the environmental assessment process. Given the federal 
government's systematic refusal, Quebec's then minister of the 
environment even wrote a second letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 17, 1990, the Quebec environment minister wrote a 
second letter to the same Canadian environment minister clearly 
demonstrating that the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
encroached on provincial jurisdictions. In this letter, of which 
I have a copy, the Quebec minister demonstrated this invasion into 
provincial jurisdiction and the negative impact of the Canadian 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of repeated requests, the Canadian government of the 
day did not seem to get the message. In May 1991, the government 
came back with essentially the same legislation, Bill C-13, the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the federal government's lack of understanding and 
recognizing that the Canadian environmental assessment bill was 
essentially an exact copy of the old one, Quebec's environment 
minister wrote a letter dated November 22, 1991. To whom was this 
letter addressed? To the Canadian environment minister, Mr. Jean 
Charest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Paradis wrote to the federal environment minister, Jean 
Charest, to reiterate Quebec's position. What was Quebec's 
position at the time that prompted Quebec's environment minister 
to reiterate it to the federal minister? First, it recognized 
that the environment was a shared jurisdiction. We recognize 
that, we even recognize the federal government's power to do 
environmental evaluations of projects for which a federal 
decision is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that matter, the Quebec government has drawn the federal 
government's attention to a supreme court judgment, the Oldman 
decision. In his decision, Justice La Forest said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, an initiating department or panel cannot use the 
<I>Guidelines Order</I> as a colourable device to invade areas of 
provincial jurisdiction which are unconnected to the relevant 
heads of federal power. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following this decision, Quebec's environment minister wrote to 
the federal environment minister. In his letter dated February 
28, 1992, the minister of the environment, Pierre Paradis, 
reiterated his concerns. However it is clear that his concerns fell 
on deaf ears in Ottawa. Consequently, the legislation was not 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the constant arrogance of the federal government, 
and it's repeated efforts to impose by 
legislative means its environmental evaluation process, Quebec 
responded through it's national assembly on March 18, 1992. 
Certain Liberal members who are in the House today were part of 
the Quebec consensus expressed on March 18, 1992 when the 
national assembly unanimously passed a motion to denounce the 
federal government's determination to impose its environmental 
assessment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's political context, when men and women elected by the 
people to represent them want to maintain a minimum of 
credibility, the one fundamental value that they have to adhere 
to is consistency in their ideas. One cannot, in 10 years, do a 
complete about face and say “I supported the national assembly's 
consensus, I was part of that unanimous decision, but today I am 
voting in favour of a bill that totally ignores all the work that 
has been done in Quebec”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the Quebec experience proved inconclusive, I might have 
understood why some members would be reluctant to vote against 
the bill. However, let us not forget that the environmental 
assessment process has been around for a long time in Quebec. It 
dates back to 1975, when the need for an environmental assessment 
process was recognized in the James Bay agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we created the Bureau québécois d'audiences publiques en 
environnement, the BAPE, it was in response to the following 
basic expectation: a transparent process that would be open to 
the public and that would not be a self-assessment of government 
projects. The BAPE is an arm length's agency, contrary to what 
the environmental assessment bill is proposing, that is the 
possibility for the federal government to conduct environmental 
self-assessments. The BAPE does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, transparency in terms of public participation, 
the fact that the Quebec process is at arm length's as compared 
to the federal self-assessment approach, the fact that not as 
many projects are excluded thus providing a better environmental 
protection, all that proves that it is effective. The Quebec 
environment minister has regulations and amendments to the act 
passed on a regular basis in order to be able to adequately 
protect our environment. It is part of the normal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is what happened last week.  The Quebec 
environment minister announced that from now on any hydro 
projects of more than five megawatts had to undergo an 
environmental assessment, whereas only a few weeks ago and for 
years before that only projects of more than ten megawatts had to 
undergo one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental assessment process in Quebec is not static. It 
changes as projects and their impact on the environment evolve. I 
think we must be consistent in our approach. It is rather 
peculiar; I was reading a moment ago notes from a speech by the 
then Quebec environment minister. This Liberal Quebec environment 
minister was saying, concerning Bill C-13 on the environmental 
assessment process, that “Bill C-13 is a steamroller condemning 
everybody to a forced uniformization, which might in turn 
jeopardize the environmental assessment process in Quebec and 
needlessly bring into question all our efforts in this area”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not Quebec's current environment minister, whom 
opponents would dismiss as a sovereignist and a separatist. This 
is Quebec's former Liberal environment minister, who is still a 
member of the national assembly and who was part of the unanimous 
consensus in that assembly, which has just told the federal 
government “We have a process that works; leave it as it is”.

on the part of members opposite to introduce legislative 
amendments or bills in order to destroy the Quebec model, 
anything produced by Quebec that is working well—from the 
environmental assessment process to the Young Offenders Act—and 
move their centralizing agenda ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is really a desire to protect youth, if there is really 
a desire to protect our environment, why not let the Quebec model 
do what it is designed to do?  It is a model which is working 
well and which has stood the test of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the reactions of some members opposite; I would not want 
to name these members, who were part of the consensus in Quebec, 
who voted in favour of the unanimous motion in the national 
assembly, but a number of them could be found in this House and 
are listening to me now.  It is a bit surprising to see them 
reacting in the places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, in politics, credibility is based on consistency.  If 
one cannot be consistent about how one votes in this House, one 
would do better to defend other interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us, it must be remembered, goes against the 
Quebec model.  In 1978 Quebec set up its own assessment system, 
which it incorporated into the environment quality act.  As I 
said, the environmental assessment process in Quebec had its 
origins in the James Bay and northern Quebec agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years later, three years later to be exact, an 
environmental assessment system was put into place within the 
framework of the Clean Water Act. In 1980 the Bureau des 
audiences publiques sur l'environnement was created. Of course, 
it called for a renewal of the Quebec environmental assessment 
act, and the government of Quebec acted accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading over notes published in 1992 by the government of 
Quebec at a time where a Liberal government was in power in the 
province and while the MNA and minister of the environment 
in Quebec was still a member of the national assembly. The 1992 
reports from the government of Quebec said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is indeed a risk that the latter— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This refers to the federal Environmental Assessment Act. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—will constantly be duplicated, disputed or subordinated to the 
application of the federal process. Yet, the Quebec procedure has 
been well established for ten years already; it is well known by 
the general public and the promoters from Quebec; and it has 
proven itself. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The areas where the federal authority can get involved are 
somewhat limitless, given all the levers one can find in the bill 
itself to force the mandatory examination of projects by the 
federal authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months the federal government has been shamelessly tempted 
to destroy the Quebec model. We hope that all the members from 
Quebec, at least those who voted unanimously at the national 
assembly, will be able to vote against this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing better than real striking examples to show 
those watching, and those in Quebec in particular, under what 
conditions this legislation is being received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for nothing that in 1992 the government of Robert 
Bourassa decided, with the unanimous support of the national 
assembly, to oppose any federal intrusion in provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in the Outaouais region we have and still are witnessing 
the construction in the city of Hull of a highway called axe 
McConnell-Laramée. Concerning this construction project, which 
has been announced and will of course be carried out under a 
federal-provincial cost sharing agreement, I would like to ask my 
colleague to explain what could be the cause of the delay 
following that announcement. The Quebec transport minister had 
already asked his federal counterpart to co-ordinate his 
environmental intervention with that of the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to my colleague for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie is this: 
What would be the impact of this bill on the McConnell-Laramée 
project in the Outaouais region? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, the impact of this bill and 
of the federal legislation more broadly passed in 1995 arises 
precisely from the concerns of the government of Quebec of the 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote documents of the Quebec minister of the environment from 
1992: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13, if passed as it stands, will mean submitting to 
federal evaluation many environmental projects that have already 
gone through the Quebec environmental impact examination and 
assessment procedure.  This situation will therefore create a 
serious duplication problem in Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once Quebec has a guarantee that the environmental assessment 
process is solid, rigorous and includes public participation, I 
see no reason to support the one that comes under a federal law, 
that would simply, in the end, delay viable economic projects 
that are important to the infrastructure of the Outaouais region, 
for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think therefore that, in this case, the Quebec environment 
assessment process should be the only one to apply in the case 
before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. colleague across the way has some interesting 
points regarding federal-provincial relations with respect to the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with the name:  Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act.  Why do we not call it the confederal environmental 
assessment act?  The federal government is really the creation of 
the provinces.  It came into existence at the will of the 
provinces.  When they came together in 1867 to create 
Confederation, it was an instrument of the provincial 
governments, the colonial governments.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague across the way support the idea of renaming 
the bill the confederal environmental assessment act?  Does he 
think that would be an improvement over the word Canadian? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposed subsection 2(1) makes reference to the territories.  We 
know the territories are under the thumb of the federal 
government, that they are oppressed and that the federal 
government regularly comes in to scavenge their resources at 
will.  How would my hon. colleague from the Bloc feel about 
provincializing the territories and allowing them a greater share 
of resources?  How would he feel about allowing them to get out 
from under the evil thumb of the federal government as we all 
want to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposed paragraph 2(1)(a) talks about the federal government's 
powers over waters and airspace.  How might my hon. colleague 
respond to that in terms of provincial rights in those areas or 
in terms of property rights for individuals? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, in a few words it must be 
understood, and we acknowledged the fact, that environment is a 
shared jurisdiction. We recognize that fact and we are ready to 
admit that the federal government has a right to intervene in 
environmental matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Supreme Court of Canada and especially Justice La 
Forest ruled in the Oldman case that the federal government 
cannot use a decree or any other measure to intervene in areas 
which are not in a federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, it seems clear to me that this bill represents, in 
terms of environmental assessment, a scandalous federal 
encroachment on Quebec's jurisdiction, all the more so if one 
considers that the environmental process put in place by Quebec is 
working very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that councils of environment 
ministers have in the past directly denounced the federal 
strategy concerning environmental evaluation assessment. 
Therefore this is not something new. Since 1992 Canadian 
environment ministers have been asking the federal government not 
to intervene in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, through this initiative the federal government is 
obviously continuing to encroach upon provincial jurisdiction in 
the area of environmental assessment and to create undue 
duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will not necessarily mean improved efficiency 
but will rather slow down certain economic projects which could 
improve the quality of life of our fellow citizens. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will continue along the 
vein of questions I had for my hon. colleague from the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In proposed paragraph 4(b.2) it says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>to promote cooperation and coordinated action between federal and 
provincial governments with respect to environmental assessment 
processes for projects; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the hon. members in the House said the proposed change 
would extend a welcome hand.  Surely, I ask my hon. colleague 
from the Bloc, are there not examples in the past where the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK227">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-68, an 
act to amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-19, an 
act to amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting that the federal government should 
introduce such a bill when we are clearly under the impression 
that the Minister of the Environment adopted the wait and see 
approach to know exactly what Mr. Bush would say, what he would 
do, how he would proceed, how he would retract and where he would 
stand on the environmental issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This basic legislation passed in 1995 provided for a review 
after five years. When we debated this legislation in 1995, we 
probably told the government all the improvements that ought to 
have been made to it but being a majority government, it 
completely ignored these recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the government could understand that a majority of seats 
and a minority of votes do not mean it can rule the roost. 
It is high time it started listening to the opposition 
parties to know what the interesting points are. The more people 
have a say, the more ideas will be brought up, and debate is the 
key to enlightenment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view it is important that the government consider the 
views expressed by the opposition and try to amend the bill in a 
way that would allow us to improve it even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary Southeast—I hope I am not giving the 
wrong riding—reminded us that the government had added two 
amendements to clause 2 of Bill C-19 dealing with the purposes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT76"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT76"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amending clause 2 of Bill C-19, section 4 of the old act, 
by adding the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>.2) to promote cooperation and coordinated action between 
federal and provincial governments with respect to environmental 
assessment processes for projects; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it wants to promote co-operation, the federal government should 
show good faith and stop saying “I am the biggest; I am 
the strongest; I am the country; I am right and you are 
necessarily wrong”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operation with others requires mechanisms of consensus, 
consultation and co-operation to be created if there is to be 
successful co-operation between the federal and provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>.3) to promote communication and cooperation between 
responsible authorities and Aboriginal peoples with respect to 
environmental assessment; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other salient point in this bill.  The Canadian 
International Development Agency is to be subject to this 
legislation, to the environmental assessment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is good news that CIDA can also be subjected to this 
process. We in the biggest and most beautiful country in the 
world can stop being ashamed by our involvement in certain 
countries that have been soundly criticized because environmental 
measures have not been taken into consideration and we are 
polluting elsewhere when we would not do it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another important point: the bill creates the position 
of federal environmental assessment co-ordinator for projects 
that involve several federal or provincial authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that they will take the trouble to select a bilingual 
co-ordinator who will be able to understand what goes on in 
Quebec and be capable of truly ensuring co-ordination and not the 
interventionism of which this government is so fond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also authorizes the use, as an assessment criterion, of local 
knowledge, aboriginal knowledge and traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, we have an extremely important point to make. 
Sometimes I think the federal government does a reasonably 
good job at drafting documents but when we watch it in action 
afterward we find that there is a dichotomy between what it 
says and what it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is true that the government intends to take into account 
local knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge, we could 
end up with better results those that we are getting now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who have the best knowledge of things are those who live 
close to them.  The government will also have to show that it 
truly intends to do that.  However since the past is an indication of 
what the future holds, I am very skeptical as to what the outcome 
might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill broadens the minister's discretionary power to get 
involved in projects on the Quebec territory. I find it extremely 
dangerous whenever the discretionary powers of a minister are 
broadened. It is always very dangerous because it depends on how 
that minister will want to use his discretion, to be 
discretionary or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this afternoon it was mentioned, in another debate and 
also during oral question period, that when ministers want to do 
something they put it in writing in the act. The Minister of the 
Environment wants to have the right to use his discretionary 
power so he puts it in the act to make sure he will be 
able to use that power. Therefore this should not come as a 
surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This suggests that, with respect to the other bill, we were 
right to contend that the minister, who does not want to include 
certain provisions in the legislation, is very likely to want to 
implement the Young Offenders Act in the same fashion all across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is at stake for us in this bill?  You will be 
surprised, Mr. Speaker, but you will not fall off your chair 
because you are well settled. Bill C-19, as it stands, is not a 
bad bill.  It is a considerable improvement on the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, particularly by extending its 
application to CIDA and certain crown agencies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Participant funding and the consultation of aboriginals are 
other very interesting features of this bill but, and there is 
always a but, I paid the government a compliment and I hope it 
will be well received—the problem lies with the very principle 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act represents interference in Quebec's fundamental 
jurisdictions.  This is the problem.  The government could have 
stuck to improving its bill without interfering in our 
fundamental jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was introduced in 1992, the legislation was interpreted 
as an attempt by the federal government to reintroduce some 
discretionary leeway in its environmental assessment process. An 
interesting discussion of this can be found in the M.A. thesis of 
Luc Juillet, who studied this issue in 1992 at the University of 
Ottawa.  This was a student at the University of Ottawa, not at 
UQAM or a Quebec university.  He studied this discretionary 
leeway the government wanted to introduce in its bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, clause 22 of the bill clearly broadens the 
federal government's authority to interfere in one of Quebec's 
areas of jurisdiction.  The minister reserves discretionary power 
for himself by adding “the Minister is of the opinion”. The 
minister's opinion will not be up for discussion. 
There will always be a possibility for him to say “This is my 
opinion and it must be taken into account since I am authorized 
by law to change things according to my opinion”. This type of 
discretionary power on issues as important as the environment is 
cause for concern. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>46.(1) Where no power, duty or function referred to in section 5 
is to be exercised or performed by a federal authority in 
relation to a project that is to be carried out in a province and 
the Minister is of the opinion that the project may cause 
significant adverse environmental effects in another province, 
the Minister may refer the project to a mediator or a review 
panel in accordance with section 29 for an assessment of the 
environmental effects of the project in that other province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will realize that this is the infamous section 46.  The 
government only slightly modified the French version by adding 
the words “et peut, à son avis, entraîner des effets”. Therefore, 
the minister will really take that as a basis.  He will look at 
that and of course, he will call on his advisers, but he may not 
feel like taking their advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see how, in other departments, the ministers do not 
consider the collective well-being of our great country but 
rather their electoral map and the adversaries they have in their 
own riding.  We can see clearly how the presence of the Canadian 
Alliance in western Canada has affected the Liberal Party, so 
much so that it is now beyond all recognition and the 
Liberal Party of Quebec is trying to shift to the left to see 
what it feels like to be Liberal these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the federal Liberals, we no longer have a model 
of what it means to be a Liberal in Canada. 
With the NDP, those members were the ones with the so-called progressive 
ideas. Today, they are so afraid of the Canadian Alliance that the 
Liberals cannot even recognize one another. We do not know what a 
Liberal is supposed to look like either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather worrisome to see that the government does not 
manage this country for the public good, that it does not have a 
great vision for the development of this country called Canada, 
so that it can still be an interesting country to live in during 
the 21st century. What counts for the government is watching what 
the Canadian Alliance says and does, finding out what will bring 
in votes so that Liberals can stay in power as long as possible 
and go on using public funds to do whatever they like.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let met tell my good friend, the Minister for International 
Trade, that I would like the bill to apply to his Export 
Development Corporation, but that is not the case. Things have 
been taken care of. The minister did not stand in cabinet to ask 
that the bill apply to the corporation as it does to CIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> It is too twisted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Those are your words. I do not dare say 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had many problems with this corporation and we will have 
more because the minister does not have enough courage to bring 
it under this bill. 
He did not speak to his colleague to say how important it was to 
introduce this concept in the bill.  No, he preferred to say 
nothing.  If nothing is said, the matter is not discussed.  However 
we must look at all the problems that occurred abroad and that 
brought us shame in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies have embarrassed us by exploiting and 
polluting other countries.  They are not satisfied with polluting 
here, they go and pollute elsewhere.  We have to ask ourselves 
where all of this is headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 provides for the creation of the position of federal 
environmental assessment co-ordinator.  This shows clearly that 
the federal government decides and wants to insinuate itself into 
the Quebec environmental assessment process.  It is because the 
federal government intends to act in Quebec's area of 
jurisdiction that it has to create the position of co-ordinator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With whom does it intend to coordinate?  With itself?  We have 
seen in many other bills how it overlaps with itself: fisheries 
and oceans overlaps with heritage and with environment in the 
creation of areas of protection for this and that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is creating a co-ordinator, and therefore co-ordination, 
position, because it will have something to coordinate 
and it will have to co-ordinate with the provinces.  The 
government will present itself as the big brother, the all 
powerful, the one with the billions, money coming out of its 
ears, the one wanting to impose the law of money, of power, of 
the many on the little provinces, which will have to comply.  It 
will say to them “If you do not comply, you will not get this. If 
you do not do this, you will not have that”.  This will be a 
position that could be dangerous for bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government stuck to its own areas of 
jurisdiction, co-ordination would not be required, but because it 
wants to create a system that will enable it to tramp over other 
jurisdictions, it needs a co-ordinator position to ensure that 
if it spies some way in which it can meddle in the affairs of 
others, it will do so at will and with pleasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially the provincial governments, including Quebec and 
Alberta, were the leaders.  They criticized the Canadian 
legislation and demanded major changes that would have made it 
possible for provincial processes to be used in place of federal 
assessments but there were few federal concessions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill appears to introduce discrimination between the 
promoters of projects associated with federal authorities and 
those that are not.  For example, a partially federally funded 
project would be covered by the law but as soon as the federal 
level is not involved, another system kicks in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague was very eloquent in his treatment of this.  We saw 
earlier in this House someone from the province of Quebec, the 
hon. member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies to be precise, who 
was president of the BAPE in Quebec—at least I believe he was. 
Our colleague, the chair of the standing committee on heritage, 
used to be minister of environment in the Bourassa government.  A 
number of Liberal members in this House are former Quebec MLAs, 
for instance the hon. member for Westmount—Ville-Marie.  The 
member for Papineau—Saint-Denis was not a member of the 
national assembly but he was very close to the government and 
worked for Mr. Ryan, so he was very much up to date on everything 
that was going on within that magnificent government that did 
something very significant for the environment.  These are not 
innocents; they are very much up to date on events.

<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. colleague from the Bloc raised questions about 
federal government violations in provincial jurisdictions.  That 
is a good angle from which to view the bill.  Clause 8(b) states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>the Crown corporation or corporation controlled by it makes or 
authorizes payments or provides a guarantee for a loan or any 
other form of financial assistance to the proponent for the 
purpose of enabling the project to be carried out in whole or in 
part; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key operating phrase is that these are crown corporations 
which would provide loan guarantees.  It talks about using 
taxpayer dollars to extend the long arm of the federal government 
to exert influence on the provinces, whether it be Alberta, or 
Quebec in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member think of the whole idea of crown 
corporations being able to use taxpayer dollars to influence 
business practices in the provinces?  It has been rightfully 
pointed out that it would be a violation of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part that I would like the member to comment on is the 
reference in clause 9 to the Hamilton harbour commissioners.  In 
the act that we are amending there is a reference to the Toronto 
harbour commissioners.  If we are able to make reference to both 
the Hamilton harbour and the Toronto harbour, might the member 
postulate for us why there is no specific reference made to the 
province of Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I mentioned the confusion 
with respect to clauses earlier.  I want to be careful to refer 
to the same clause as the hon. member.  It is clause 6 which 
amends sections 9 and 10 of the existing legislation referring to 
the Hamilton and Toronto harbours, and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always comes back to the same principle.  We are legislators. 
We therefore make bills, debate them and look at how they are 
drafted.  When something is written down, we can understand what 
it means.  Evidently there are commissioners appointed under the 
Hamilton Harbour Commissioners' Act because there is a specific 
reference to Hamilton harbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no specific reference to Quebec but there is a tiny 
clause, which I mentioned it earlier, that says “the Minister is of 
the opinion—”. If the minister is of the opinion that he should 
interfere in Quebec, he will go right ahead and do so.  The bill 
specifies nothing specifically—this is a pleonasm, forgive 
me—but it is so vague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am worried about this aspect of the bill.  There is a danger 
of federal interference in provincial jurisdiction.  The member 
for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie quite rightly said that we accept the 
fact that it is a shared jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is shared and if we want it to work the parties must 
respect each other's jurisdiction.  That is the only way it will 
work.  If the government does not want it to work, it creates 
all sorts of mechanisms, as it has done in this bill. Provisions 
are included or, if not, there is some little all purpose phrase: 
“at the discretion”, “the minister's discretionary power”, or 
“where the minister is of the opinion” so that the minister will 
be able to do as he pleases. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member for her speech. She 
has drawn my attention to an aspect of the bill that has not been 
covered and that I would have liked to have talked about earlier in my 
own speech but did not have the time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite ironic, since in principle the legislation is 
supposed to cover projects solely under Canadian jurisdiction, 
pursuant to section 5 of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the Export Development Corporation is exempted 
from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act when about two 
weeks ago a group published a report demonstrating 
clearly that the Export Development Corporation gives a financial 
hand up to businesses that violate environmental legislation 
contaminates and threatens the environment in certain other 
countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that this corporation is exempted from this 
legislation in spite of the fact that many organizations are 
demanding that it be subject to it? That is my question for the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am really quite happy 
with this question because I raised it briefly when you motioned 
to me that I only had a little time left. I was only broaching 
the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was outraged to read that in the newspapers. We also read 
in international magazines that Canada is a polluter and that it 
pollutes with Canadian taxpayers' money. A federal crown 
corporation uses our money to encourage people and companies to open 
plants and to pollute abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is scandalous and I hope the minister will wake up in 
time and move an amendment that will ensure that this corporation 
is subject to this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to follow up on a 
couple of points made by my hon. colleague from the Bloc.  She 
mentioned that CIDA should be subject to an environmental review. 
She talked about how we should not be having taxpayer promoted 
pollution.  I agree with the hon. member.  I happen to think that 
there are a lot of CIDA projects where Canada is using taxpayer 
funds to promote questionable things overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also mentioned the whole idea of broadening ministerial 
discretion.  The federal government almost always continues to 
expand its influence and give its ministers more jurisdictional 
ability to put their fingers in more pies.  I congratulate her 
for bringing this issue forward.  Would she be able to expound on 
that in some way? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, as important as it is that 
ministers be accountable for what happens in their areas of 
responsibility, it is also important that they be given as little 
discretionary powers as possible based solely on their opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is extremely dangerous because we do not know on what it is 
based. If, for example, the wording was: “Following the formation 
of a research group that will have demonstrated that the minister 
can use the results and make a decision other than”, it would be 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is the minister's opinion. No one knows on what a 
minister's opinion is based when such opinion can be used to 
justify the use of discretionary powers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as other members have said, these amendments have arisen as a 
result of a review of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
which was conducted over the last couple of years before Bill 
C-19 was tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reflects an attempt on the part of that review committee to 
deal with some of the problems we have had under the act. The New 
Democratic Party has certain reservations as the bill does not 
adequately address some of the severe problems which have shown 
up under the act.  In quick summary, we are very concerned about 
its ability to deal with those problems and that in fact it may

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a common ground of the proponents of development and those 
who might have problems with it or are outright opposed to it 
that it is extremely important for the process to be transparent, 
meaningful and efficient.  The amendments to Bill C-19 would only 
address the issue of efficiency.  Without total prejudgment it is 
our opinion they would probably not be effective or transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may speed up the process.  The minister and a number of 
speakers on the government side stated that it would be a more 
efficient process, that the process would be harmonized to the 
extent that it would be more efficient.  There is serious doubt 
on this side as to whether it would be more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that we raised in opposition to the bill as it 
stands now is the way that it looks at traditional land use and 
more specifically the involvement of the aboriginal population in 
the process.  Paragraph 2(b.3) talks about promoting 
communication and co-operation with the first nations.  It is 
obvious that there are very few provisions in the bill which make 
that a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the establishment of co-operation between 
provincial and federal jurisdictions leaves very much to be 
desired.  My friends from the Bloc have addressed this issue 
extensively, but it is clear, despite some of their other 
concerns, that it would not do anything to improve the 
relationship if there are to be assessments at the provincial and 
federal levels.  The development of meaningful interaction is not 
contained in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We constantly hear the term harmonization, but we are concerned 
that it is an attempt to streamline the process, to make it less 
costly and to speed it up, which would be done at the expense of 
valid, accurate and meaningful environmental assessments.  The 
end result raises serious doubts about its ability to act as a 
mechanism to protect the environment from inappropriate, unwanted 
and environmentally damaging proposals or developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see no thrust in the bill to amend the current legislation to 
increase protection for the environment by building in more 
structures that would protect it rather than providing 
limitations.

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise on a question I asked originally on April 3 
about softwood lumber.  At the time I pointed out to the minister 
that everyone involved with the softwood lumber issue, even the 
United States industry, had acknowledged that Atlantic Canada 
should be exempt from countervail duties.  The actual petition 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petitioners do not allege the softwood lumber production in the 
Atlantic provinces benefits from countervailable subsidies.  This 
portion of Canadian production should be treated the same as it 
was in 1991-92. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was very vague in the answer.  He has not given us 
an answer.  We want the maritime accord reinstated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have repeatedly asked the minister to bring the industry 
together, the CEOs, consultants and all other parties involved, 
and week after week the parliamentary secretary and the minister 
stand and say they are not ready to bring them together. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1920"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now understand that the minister has extended invitations to 
the industry to come together on Wednesday at the meeting of the 
deputy ministers from all the provinces, the CEOs and the 
consultants, just as we have been asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like the minister or the parliamentary secretary to 
confirm both the meeting and what is on the agenda.  Are we going 
to get the maritime accord reinstated? 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all let us 
be clear that the minister and the government share the member's 
concern for wanting an extension or a new exemption for Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is working very diligently toward that end.  Of 
course that is part of a larger solution, which should be free 
trade for softwood lumber from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid that my colleague will have to speak with the 
minister directly vis-à-vis the agenda for such a meeting.  I can 
tell him that for some time now the minister has been holding 
open the idea of calling the stakeholders together but that there 
has not been a consensus among the stakeholders themselves that 
the time was right.  If we are at that point this week— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  We are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  If we are, then the minister will 
certainly be convening that meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague knows, the minister has raised this issue with 
U.S. trade representative Zoellick and with secretary of commerce 
Evans in Quebec City and the Prime Minister has raised this 
personally with President Bush.  We are looking for the kind of 
exemption for Atlantic Canada that existed in years gone by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is, as my colleague knows, that it is a decision for 
the American government to make.  We very much hope that they 
will take that step and that the Atlantic provinces will be very 
happy with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Speaker knows very well with the riding he represents, 
this is a national problem which requires a national Canadian 
solution that is good for all Canadian producers from coast to 
coast to coast.  We ask for a united Canadian position that we 
can take forward because the facts very clearly support the 
Canadian industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my colleague for his question.  I hope he will 
continue to lend his enthusiastic support to the united Canadian 
position.

<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question was for the minister responsible for the environment. 
We talked about infrastructure funding especially as it relates 
to the cleanup of St. John's harbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that when I finish tonight I will get a prepared response 
from the parliamentary secretary, but I will say that I am 
looking for answers to specific questions and I hope that the 
member in responding will answer my question and not give me the 
same diatribe that we got from the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about funding for the cleanup of St. John's harbour 
we talk about the specific funds committed to by three parties: 
the municipalities, the provincial government and the federal 
government.  This is something that has been discussed for years 
and has been promised every time there is talk about an election, 
as we saw the Minister of Industry promise when we had the 
election in November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in fact, my colleague from St. John's East, who is 
sitting here with me, and I were supposed to be taken out of the 
political picture by two candidates who would, according to the 
Minister of Industry, help him deliver the funding for the 
cleanup of St. John's harbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities in the region and the provincial government 
have committed their share of the funding, one-third of the total 
amount each, the total amount being approximately $100 million. 
The federal government is supposed to have promised and committed 
the other one-third. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the issue is raised the government says it gave its 
infrastructure funding to the province.  That is not being 
truthful.  The infrastructure funding given to the province was 
the regular program funding that all municipalities across the 
country have available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are talking about specific funding for a specific 
purpose.  Everyone knew the intent when the original agreements 
were talked about.  Let me ask the parliamentary secretary, 
when she responds, to tell us if the province has come asking for 
specific funding.  If so, why has the government not delivered as 
the government originally promised to do?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there has been a significant 
groundswell of interest in environmental protection in 
municipalities right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of St. John's, the enhanced awareness of the need 
for sewage treatment and the high priority stated within the 
community can be attributed in large measure to the hard work and 
dedication of the St. John's Harbour ACAP, which is a volunteer 
group of citizens.  Its work has been supported by the Department 
of the Environment at the federal level as well as the 
Newfoundland government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The infrastructure Canada program for Newfoundland and for all 
provinces is intended to assist municipalities to deal with their 
priority needs, with a focus specifically on environmental needs. 
The priorities established in Newfoundland by all levels of 
government have been drinking water quality and rural 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solutions to this problem are complex and require 
significant investment.  The solutions to the problem cannot be 
reactive and will not be ad hoc.  A long term approach must be 
found at a national level and must include all levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada recently hosted a national forum on municipal 
wastewater effluent.  This session was attended by various 
stakeholders including provinces, territories, municipalities and 
their associations, environmental non-government groups and first 
nations.  The objective of this national forum on municipal 
wastewater effluent was to share examples of best practices, 
information and ideas being employed to address municipal 
wastewater management issues right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the Prime Minister's task force on urban issues 
is also an important step in addressing this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sensing that perhaps I am out of time.  Let me conclude by 
saying that the Government of Canada and the task force will 
continue to work with the provinces and the municipalities to 
identify appropriate mechanisms through which we can address the 
needs of municipalities across the country.

stands adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock, pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
