  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, although you have not ruled on a matter identical to the one at issue today, you have addressed the question of the confidentiality of bills on the order paper. In a ruling rendered on March 19, 2001, you said: “—the convention of the confidentiality of bills [on the order paper] was necessary, not only so that members themselves would be well informed, but also because of the pre-eminent role that the House plays [and must play in the] affairs of the nation”. </div>
</p><a name="Para1637610" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that same year, the House Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs considered a point of order concerning the disclosure of the contents of a bill and commented as follows in its 40th report: “The Committee reiterates its position that it views the disclosure of bills prior to their tabling in the House of Commons, while on notice, with extreme seriousness. Members of the Committee are committed to protecting the privileges of the House of Commons and of its Members in this regard”. </div>
</p><a name="Para1637611" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two passages indicate that there is a convention requiring that the contents of bills on the order paper not be divulged. I believe that the convention exists because members of Parliament have an important role to play as legislators. Consequently, they should be the first to know the contents of bills so that they can do their work well, and the Speaker must do everything in his power to honour that role and enable members to fulfill their duty.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637612" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a ruling issued on November 6, 1997, the Speaker of the House at the time said that issues affecting the role of members of Parliament as legislators were not insignificant. Even then, he warned the executive that “this dismissive view of the legislative process, repeated often enough, makes a mockery of our parliamentary conventions and practices”. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take our role as legislators very seriously, and we do not vote on a bill until we have carefully examined all of its provisions.

By increasing pressure on me and on all opposition members to make a decision about this bill before it was introduced in the House, the ministers wanted to prevent us from doing our work with all due diligence and care. The laws that we enact are not mere political tactics; they are measures that will apply to all citizens of this country for a very long time.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not all. I believe that the actions of two government ministers on Monday constituted a serious offence against the dignity of this House, and as such, constitute contempt of Parliament. By publicly disclosing the contents of a bill—while the bill was on the order paper—to admittedly put pressure on Parliament, the ministers undermined the authority and dignity of the institution of the House of Commons.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think the parliamentary secretary misrepresented the facts when he said that the minister made no comments to the media before the embargoed copy of the bill was given to opposition members. Again, we got the embargoed copy after the minister's news conference, the following day. By then we did not even need to read the embargoed copy, because we could have read any one of a number of daily newspapers that covered all of the details in the bill, which was released the following day.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue raised here, with respect, is not about embargoed copies. It is fairly customary for ministers to provide embargoed copies of bills to opposition critics just prior to the introduction in the House. It is a courtesy that helps the other parties, the members and the critics to prepare in doing their work. This is not about the giving over of embargoed copies. It is about a minister and the government pre-empting the role of Parliament by having a news conference about a bill before it is introduced in the House. </div>
</p><a name="Para1637637" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I as a member did not get an embargoed copy of the bill and did not have an opportunity to see this. Apparently, the news media had an opportunity to hear comments from the minister.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637638" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may suggest, Parliament has always regarded these matters quite strictly. There is a reason that a bill is secret before it is introduced in the House. It is marked secret and it is secret. It is not just a pro forma little stamp that is put on a bill. However, this may be another attempt by government to do what governments want to do politically and that is go out and sell the thing before it is in the marketplace.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637639" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Parliament cannot let that happen. This may be an example of the thin edge of the wedge. It may also involve informal discussions among House leaders prior to the introduction of the bill. However, as a member of the House, none of that matters to me. What matters is that a bill cannot be placed out for public debate in the public domain, through press conferences or whatever, before the members of the House have an opportunity to see that bill.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this bill is clear and simple. It would amend the Criminal Code to improve the justice system's response to the sort of large-scale fraud we have been hearing about so much lately. The bill would send a message to those who think they can outsmart Canadians and dupe them into handing over their hard-earned savings. On the contrary, the bill would make clear that fraud is a serious crime for which there are serious consequences.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637654" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also designed to improve the responsiveness of the justice system for victims of fraud. These proposed measures would send a strong message to the victims of fraud that the crimes committed against them are serious and the harms they suffer will be taken into account and addressed to the greatest degree possible. Overall, the measures in this bill would do much to increase Canadian's confidence in the justice system.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637655" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I describe the measures in the bill, it is worthwhile to consider the current state of the law. The Criminal Code already addresses all known forms of white collar crime, from security related frauds, such as insider trading and accounting frauds that overstate the value of securities issued to shareholders and investors to mass marketing fraud, theft, bribery and forgery, to name a few of the offences that may apply to any given set of facts.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637656" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum penalties set out in the code are high. In particular, for fraud with a value over $5,000, the maximum term of imprisonment is 14 years. This is the highest maximum penalty in the code, short of life imprisonment.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637657" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, mandatory aggravating factors for fraud offences are already in place. They require sentencing courts to increase the penalty imposed to reflect, for example, where the value of the fraud exceeds $1 million, the offence involves a large number of victims and, in committing the offence, the offender took advantage of the high regard in which he or she was held in the community.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637658" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our courts have clearly stated that for large scale frauds, deterrents and denunciation are the most pressing objectives in the sentencing process. The courts have been clear that a serious penitentiary sentence must be imposed in large scale frauds. We routinely see sentences in the four to seven year range for large scale frauds. Most recently, of course, Vincent Lacroix was given a 13 year sentence for the massive security fraud he perpetrated in Quebec just a few years ago.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637659" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts are starting to take these frauds seriously but this government believes that still more can be done to strengthen the Criminal Code's responses in these cases to send a clear message that Parliament is in agreement with this trend toward tougher sentencing. To this end, Bill <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',4144434,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=4144434&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-52</a> proposes reforms that are designed to ensure that sentences imposed in these cases adequately reflect the severe impact they have on the lives of the victims, many of whom have lost their life savings or retirement savings.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637660" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure in this bill that is particularly significant is a new mandatory minimum penalty of two years for large scale frauds. As I mentioned, more and more courts across the country are recognizing the devastation that can be caused by large scale frauds and have emphasized that deterrents and denunciation must be front and centre in sentencing offenders in these cases. The government wants to carry this message forward and clearly establish a minimum penalty for frauds with a value over $1 million. </div>
</p><a name="Para1637661" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many frauds cheat Canadians out of significantly more than $1 million. We have read recently of frauds in the hundreds of millions, but the line must be drawn somewhere and this government believes that if a person orchestrates and carries out a fraud of at least $1 million, this is a very serious crime that demands a term of imprisonment of at least two years.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637662" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this two year mandatory jail term is a floor, not a ceiling. If Parliament declares that a $1 million fraud must result in at least two years in prison, then, naturally, larger frauds will result in even higher sentences. The application of aggravating factors to the sentencing process will also help guide the process for determining the ultimate sentence. The Criminal Code already contains several aggravating factors that can be applied to a fraud conviction to enhance the sentence.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would add several more aggravating factors, such as: if the fraud had a particularly significant impact on the victims taking into account their personal characteristics such as age, financial situation and health; if the fraud was significant in its complexity or duration; if the offender failed to comply with applicable licensing rules; and if the offender tried to conceal or destroy documents which recorded the fraud or the disbursements of the proceeds. </div>
</p><a name="Para1637664" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These aggravating factors reflect various aspects of fraud that are deeply troubling. The clearer Parliament can be with the courts about what these factors are, the more accurately sentences will reflect the true nature of the crime.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637665" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important measure in the bill is the introduction of a power which would enable the sentencing court to order that a person convicted of fraud be prohibited from having control or authority over another person's money or real property.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restitution is defined as the return or restoration of some specific thing to its rightful owner.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restitution is the payment by the offender of an amount established by the court.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An order for restitution is made during the sentencing hearing of a convicted offender. It is part of the overall sentence provided to an offender as a stand-alone measure or as part of a prohibition order or a conditional sentence.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restitution orders may be particularly appropriate in the case of fraud offences. In several recent high profile cases, we hear from media accounts of thousands of dollars taken by offenders. These shocking cases of duplicity have deprived many innocent Canadians of hard-earned savings, and in truly awful cases, of retirement funds. It will be the decision in each trial as to whether restitution will be appropriate.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proposals provide that, in the case of fraud, the sentencing judge must consider an order of restitution as part of the overall sentence for the offender. The court shall inquire of the Crown if reasonable steps have been taken to provide victims with the opportunity to indicate whether they are seeking restitution. This step will ensure that sentencing cannot happen without victims having had the opportunity to speak to the Crown and establish their losses.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further assist victims, our proposals include an optional form to assist victims in setting out their losses.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Code currently provides that judges may consider a statement made by a victim of a crime known as a victim impact statement. The purpose of this provision is to provide the sentencing judge with additional information on the harm or loss suffered as a result of the offence.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurisprudence has indicated that the victim impact statement serves three purposes: to educate the offender on the consequences of her or his actions with some rehabilitative effect, to provide a sense of catharsis for victims, and to provide sentencing judges with the information on the impact or effect of the offence. The provisions in this bill to create a community impact statement provision for fraud offences share these three purposes: education, catharsis and information.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637681" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Code indicates that the victim impact statement should describe the harm done to or loss suffered by the victim. The Criminal Code details the procedure for presenting the victim impact statement, which includes a requirement that the statement be in writing and be shared with the Crown and defence. The victim impact statement provisions of the Criminal Code also provide that the court shall consider any other evidence concerning the victim for the purpose of determining the sentence.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts have given the term “victim” a broad interpretation, so the people other than the direct victim, including communities, have been permitted to provide victim impact statements. Victim impact statements made on behalf of communities that have been considered by the courts include: a victim impact statement made by a synagogue on behalf of the members in an arson case and a victim impact statement from a first nations band describing the impact of the theft of band money, and the murder of a first nations child on a first nations community. These cases and others offer examples of the courts' recognition that communities are affected by crime.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proposal would make the recognition clearer in the law. We are proposing that, when a court is sentencing an offender for the offence of fraud, the court may consider a statement made by a community describing the loss or harm to the community. The statement must be in writing, identify the community, clarify that the person can speak on behalf of the community and be shared with the Crown and the defence.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our view that these community impact statements will affirm several principles of sentencing that are laid out in the Criminal Code: denunciation, deterrence and rehabilitation. A community impact statement will allow a community to express publicly, and to the offender directly, the loss or harm that has been suffered to allow the community to begin a rebuilding and healing process. It will show the community denunciation of the conduct of the offender. It will assist offenders in their rehabilitation to understand the consequences of their actions.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, this bill would help to improve the responsiveness of the criminal process for victims of fraud. It would require the sentencing court to consider if restitution should be ordered and it would permit the court to receive a community impact statement in cases where a community, in addition to individuals, has suffered from the fraud.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill represents an important step forward toward improving the current criminal justice system response to serious fraud. By creating a mandatory minimum sentence for fraud over $1 million, adding aggravating factors for sentencing that highlight the serious consequences of fraud, introducing a prohibition order as part of a sentence, and requiring mandatory consideration of restitution for victims, this bill represents a complete package of reforms to reflect the seriousness of fraud offences for communities and individuals.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if the member could comment on the new sentencing tool for this particular offence. It is preventing the commission of further crimes. Indeed, the court can actually order that people who are found guilty of these particular crimes or are under court order are not able to participate or continue to help, for instance, non-profit groups, or deal with money, securities or land. In particular, this will help people not commit further offences nor commit further aggravating factors. We know they have already committed the offence. They are already under the jurisdiction of the court. This will ensure that they cannot deal with money and other securities. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw one particular clause of this proposed legislation from the Conservative Party to get tough on crimes and that was in relation to data from 2006 and 2007 only 20% of fraud convictions resulted in a restitution order. Those victims, who are as a result of whatever activity of a criminal, are out of money and out of pocket. They often are looking for that. It was a bit shocking to see that only 20% of those people who are actually damaged in this way would receive a restitution order from the court.</div>

But some people conveniently forget that they have put money in accounts in other countries, and they conveniently forget to declare it. Consequently, those countries become tax havens.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two important points here. The first, which I already addressed, is that tax havens must be eliminated. We have already asked the minister about this. This is about criminal law. Some of us have practised criminal law. I did for 30 years. I can say for sure that during my entire career, I never saw anyone sentenced to less than two years for fraud involving over $1 million or $2 million. I have never seen that.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Burns from the Trois-Rivières area just pleaded guilty to fraud involving $4 million. He stole $4 million. Does anyone really believe that this man will be sent home to put his feet up and relax, as the members across the floor would have us believe? Please. The proof is that the organization that monitors Quebec's financial markets prosecuted Vincent Lacroix and managed to get a sentence of 12 years. That sentence was reviewed, re-examined and reduced by the court of appeal.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not the end of it. Mr. Lacroix was convicted and has just pleaded guilty to fraud in the amount of $150 million. Is it possible that he will be given a sentence of less than two years? What is he going to do? I will tell you what he is going to do. He has pleaded guilty and the judge has sentenced him to 12 or 13 years. If the one-sixth rule is not eliminated, he will be eligible for release after serving one-sixth of his sentence. That has been requested. Let us do the math: dear Mr. Lacroix will be eligible to get out of prison after one-sixth of his sentence, in a year and a half or two years. He will then be 50 years old. And what will he do then? He will get on a boat or a plane or a train or a subway, or get in a car, or all of them if necessary, to get as far away as possible and go to whatever tax haven he has put his money in. That is why speedy action must be taken.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is really too bad, but this bill does not meet society's needs at the moment. This is something the Bloc has criticized and will continue to criticize. In addition, the bill could send the wrong message. Fraud in the amount of $2 million or more warrants a sentence of two years or more in prison. In other words, someone committing fraud in the amount of $1.5 million would deserve a six month prison sentence perhaps. That is what it says. It runs the risk of sending the wrong message and resulting in lesser sentences. At the moment, the average sentence for fraud of over $2 million is at least five years, and I checked out only the sentences in Quebec and some elsewhere in Canada. I did not look further afield. It is a minimum of five years. What have they done with this bill? We do not need this. The sentences already exist and they are longer than two years. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other things must be dealt with. They have been telling the Bloc for a very long time that their tough on crime policy requires a series of measures that, in combination, will ensure that crime is fought properly. For example, a police squad has to be established. We have to stop thinking the RCMP is limited to catching drug dealers. It will have to become specialized. There will have to be special squads, which some of us call the accountants or auditors, that may consist of police officers. Some officers did not know the other side of this. In the past, there were police officers who knew about drugs. That is good and can continue, but special squads will have to be set up and the people in them will have to be able to read a balance sheet and follow a trail. </div>

I do not think he understood, so I will explain a little more to him. Does he think that the funds appearing on balance sheets exist? Those who commit fraud for huge sums do all sorts of things. They are really brilliant. They can have balance sheets say things that practically no one can understand. It takes special squads. The banking regulations must be tightened. Bank secrecy is all very well, but today, in our situation, the banks must cooperate with the police squad on the trail of white collar crime. The Income Tax Act must be amended. </div>

They buy themselves a house and maybe a cottage, but all the money is in tax havens. Often, the house is not in their name but in the name of their brother or sister.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would go even further. Although I was a criminal lawyer and defended people accused of serious crimes, I have always said and will continue to say in the House that parole should be earned. That should be included in the bill because people who do nothing, who just sit in prison and wait for a quarter or a sixth of their sentence to go by, are not doing anything to earn their release. They are just sitting and waiting in these schools for crime, which is what penitentiaries are. If they do nothing, they do not deserve parole. It has to be earned. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programs have to be made available. If people do not participate in them, they should serve their full sentences. That is what we say and what I have been repeating in the House ever since I was elected in June 2004. Criminals must serve their sentences. We do not need minimum sentences. They do not solve anything. But criminals must serve their sentences. As things stand now, people sentenced to three years in prison do not even serve eight months. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing can be done with people like that. They are sent to prison for three years and get out after eight months. They have learned nothing.

If we want to deal seriously with crime, we have to deal seriously with the reason why criminals are able to get out most easily, and that is parole. We have to put an end to this system which allows people to be released after serving one-sixth of their sentence. They do not even serve a third of it. Conditional release has to be earned.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 14, I was at the Centre jeunesse in Lévis, which is doing excellent work in the Chaudière-Appalaches region. Officials there told me that when it comes to preventing crime and encouraging young people to stop committing this type of crime, the idea of restitution is very important. So there is something in this bill about restitution for both adults and minors.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill would require judges to consider restitution from the offender in all cases of fraud involving an identified victim with ascertainable losses. There are different measures to allow for this. It would also require the Crown to advise the court what steps have been taken to allow victims to set out their readily ascertainable and quantified losses to the court so that restitution can be considered.</div>

I would like to ask my colleague whether he plans on supporting these measures in the bill. Does he plan on supporting the bill in the House, but also, when the time comes to vote, will he rise in this House to support it?</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now answer my colleague's question. If he were to read section 718.2 of the Criminal Code, he would see that everything in this bill that has to do with restitution is already in the Criminal Code.

There is no need to include this in the bill, because it is already in the Criminal Code. This is what we would call needless redundancy. The government is not tackling the real problem, but sending up a smokescreen by saying that this is a major measure. It is not a major measure at all. It is already in the Criminal Code. There is no need to put it in again. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of a series of crime bills which are brought before the House as part of the government's PR attempt to make it look as if it is tough on crime and other people in this House do not seem to be. I say that with some deliberation because it is part of the PR campaign. Otherwise, why would the government release this bill to the media before it even presented it to the House? I know that was the subject of a debate earlier today, as to whether it is a breach of privilege or not, and I understand the Speaker will rule on that at some point, but as part of the government's approach to this, it seems this is aimed at public relations.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that does not mean we will not support it because I think Canadians do want to know that parliamentarians care about white collar crime.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this bill would not create any new crimes. In fact, the real problem with white collar crime, in particular frauds of this nature, is not the lack of sentencing tools available but the lack of prosecution and proper investigation. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to be tough on crime, supposedly, we ought to be very adept at conducting prosecutions, doing investigations and providing resources for that particular purpose, but that is where our system is lacking.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the provisions of this bill, and perhaps even the major provision that the government likes to wave around, is one that would provide for a two-year minimum sentence for frauds involving over $1 million.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a sentencing in our province of Newfoundland and Labrador six or eight months ago involving a fraud of considerably less, perhaps less than $200,000, and the sentence given was two years less a day for a fraud involving about one-fifth of the million dollars that has been put forth here as a minimum sentence.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill itself is not a very strong reaction to the need to provide protection to the public on issues of fraud, particularly fraud affecting the markets, securities and the type of fraud that goes on in our country that receive a lot of headlines when they happen. It is the tools of prosecution and the tools of investigation that seem to be inadequate. On the sentencing end, that is a different story.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we have here? Well, the judges can consider restitution. In fact, the Criminal Code has provision for restitution orders under sections 738 and 739. There is no compunction here for the individuals to pay restitution. It really just stipulates that the court shall consider making a restitution order under sections 738 and 739.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suspect that the judges do not need to be told.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strong is that in terms of an additional tough on crime sanction?

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggravating factors must be considered and I do not see anything particularly wrong with enumerating them, but they are also part of the precedence of our court.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most significant deterrents to criminal behaviour is not necessarily the sentencing, and this is also true for many other criminal laws, it is whether people will be caught. That is a big, or bigger, deterrent. There is no point in having a sentence available if they are getting caught and we see no prosecutions. We see individuals not being investigated properly.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a lot of media attention being paid to the kind of sentences that take place in the United States. Recently, Bernie Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in jail. Somehow people think that is a great disincentive to committing a crime. I do not see how that is more of a disincentive than 120 years, or 130, or 75 to a 60 or 70-year-old man. It is only foolishness.</div>

The Government of Canada needs to play a stronger role. It is not simply a matter of the government saying it is tough on crime. It wants to have mandatory minimums for any crime it can think of and make it look as it is tough on crime but the other parties do not support that. There has to be some sense in this kind of amendment. We just cannot willy-nilly amend the Criminal Code and hope people will believe that somehow they are better protected.

Will that convince someone only to defraud someone to the extent of $900,000 instead of $1 million? Can they get under the wire and avoid the mandatory minimum sentence?

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, we can give greater than two year sentence for a fraud of significantly less than $1 million when it is deserved, when the aggravating factors are there and when premeditation is there.

They can be a deterrent to a proper sense of justice. I am not suggesting there may easily be circumstances where someone defrauds more than $1 million is not entitled to a sentence greater than two years. I do not think we need to tell judges that. In fact, perhaps all we are doing, by suggesting a mandatory minimum of two years, is playing catch-up with what the judges are already doing. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who closely follows sentencing decisions, the courts always take into account what the community feels, the reaction of a community to a particular type of crime.

I do not assume anybody who is charged is guilty, but it should be brought quickly to the courts. A proper investigation should be done and the matter should be brought before the court.

When people are dependent upon an income from funds they have deposited so they can live in an apartment and have a lifestyle for which they have saved and are all of a sudden thrown out of that and cast into poverty, it is absolutely devastating and ought not to happen.

When someone does complain, it should raise a red flag, an investigation should be triggered and it should be stopped and prevented long before it gets to the stage where hundreds and perhaps thousands of people have been defrauded and have lost their savings and investments. A more vigorous approach to investigation, prosecution and prevention are the important factors we would like to see pursued, not merely some changes in the Criminal Code, which are frankly quite weak.</div>

A few years ago a funeral director took money from hundreds of people for their funerals and spent it money on his own lifestyle. When people died, their family looked to this individual for the funeral costs. In Newfoundland it is colloquially called burying money. It is very important for seniors, certainly in my province, who believe they have a responsibility. They do not want to be a burden on anyone when they die, so they save money for their funeral costs. Even people who are not at all wealthy ensure they have a small fund available to take care of the burial costs when they die. The pity of it is individuals who are concerned about that have entrusted their money to an individual and then find that trust has been betrayed by a fraud. It is particularly devastating.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was that fixed? Obviously by criminal prosecution, but also by establishing particular rules for setting up trust funds, reporting and regulation. A better set of regulations is needed. When people take funds from individuals, they have to be regarded as the trustees of those funds and there should be control of those trusts. There should be a regime of inspection and reporting.</div>

Lozinski said her sister, Edna Coulic, called her to tell her what had happened. “She said she lost everything,” Lozinski explained. “I asked her to elaborate and she said she [just] got conned. Lozinski said Coulic was convinced that she was set to get a big return and that the people involved did everything to convince her that was the case. “They had her believe she had to get a safety deposit box”, Lozinski said. When she realized there was not going to be a return, Coulic contacted the people involved several times, pleading with them to return her money, said her sister. “Edna became Edna no more,” her sister said. Her demeanour had changed. She became anti-social and depressed. Shortly after, she took her life. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technically, fraud or financial crime is not a violent crime, but as the previous speaker pointed out, it is a crime that inflicts a form of violence on people.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl Jones would prey on people who were emotionally drained. For example, perhaps someone who had been caring for an ill loved one who had since died simply wanted someone to settle the estate and do the paperwork which unfortunately accompanies the death of a person. Earl Jones would convince such people, especially widows, to give him power of attorney so that he had control over their lives.

In the last couple of years, as Earl Jones became financially squeezed, he would not pay the bills and the individuals in question would not know that the bills had not been paid because the late payment notices would go to Earl Jones. People suddenly woke up to the fact that their insurance had not been paid for a year and they were not insured, or that their taxes had not been paid for a year and a half and they were at risk of losing their home.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is a step in the right direction but a couple of issues need to be addressed. One is the fact that even if the bill were to pass, it would still be possible for fraudsters, who have received a minimum two year sentence for defrauding their clients, to apply for parole after one-sixth of their sentence. Therefore, it is possible that, despite the public relations value of a two year minimum sentence, fraudsters would only serve a few months in jail. I do not know if the public would take very kindly to knowing that the bill leaves a gap in the current situation.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637951" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that this is not just a question of sentencing reform. Getting to the bottom of financial crime or preventing financial crime is not just a question of tightening the sentencing regime. These crimes can be complex. I would refer to a case in Calgary where the police have been investigating for a number of years but could not find evidence of wrongdoing until very recently. One of the reasons was that the financial arrangements were so complicated that it took a great deal of time, energy and effort to try to understand them. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we are going to stop financial crime in this country, we need to give the RCMP the resources it needs. It may only need to hire more officers or more forensic accountants, for example, but it is very important to give the RCMP the resources it needs to track what is happening when it suspects there might be some criminal activity. The government should be investing more in the RCMP and perhaps other police services to give them the capacity to follow these developments.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637953" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem many victims have, and we have heard this first-hand from the victims of Earl Jones who have come to see me and from some of my colleagues, is that the banks are very slow in providing information following a fraud. For example, after a fraud it is very important that the victims obtain financial statements and different kinds of information from the banks but the banks are not required to provide this information within a specific period of time. The Liberal Party proposes that the banks be limited to 30 days for responding to an information request from victims of a fraud as that would accelerate the process of investigating and perhaps charging the alleged fraudster.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637954" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue raised by victims of financial fraud is that when a fraud is discovered it turns out that previous tax returns going back many years often become a fiction and they have no way of going back beyond maybe the immediate year to amend tax returns and get some tax relief in the process. Victims have told me that when they go to see the tax authorities, whether they be federal or provincial, the tax authorities themselves do not know how to handle the situation. They just do not know what to tell these people. It is not just a question that their hands are tied by the law or by regulation. They do not even know where to begin. We may need to put more resources into training tax collectors or the people who work for Revenue Canada in how to deal with these situations, how to go back and look at previous tax returns so that maybe the victims can get some tax relief.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion was brought to my attention. The government could require companies that operate under federal jurisdiction, like banks or telecommunications companies, to temporarily ease the burden for these victims. For example, for people who must continue to pay their phone bills, the companies could maybe give them a little 12-month break. Obviously, these customers would later reimburse the money they owe. As things stand, we can imagine a situation in which a telephone company would suddenly decide to cut off a victim's service because they had not paid their bills for a few months. Perhaps we should do something on this end to help victims of financial crimes, but obviously not with this bill.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to raise the issue of a national securities regulator. I am pleased the government adopted an idea from the Liberal platform on this issue, which was to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for some kind of guidance as to whether the federal government would have the constitutional authority to create a national securities commission. As the House knows, this was an idea put forward by the Liberal Party. It is much better to do that than to propose a commission and then to spend years in court when challenged by provinces like Quebec, Alberta and perhaps Manitoba in court waiting for a decision on whether the federal government has the constitutional responsibility or not.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637957" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the government to provide more information on how a national securities regulator could prevent financial crime from happening in the future. I personally that the reason the government is proposing a national securities regulator is not so much to do with financial crime. That is a convenient reason in the current circumstances. Obviously, the government is looking at creating a national securities regulator perhaps as a means of integrating the Canadian economy more than it is presently in the hopes of stimulating more economic growth, and that the real reason is not to stop financial fraud.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637958" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, no one on the government side has told us exactly how a national securities regulator would prevent financial crime. What will prevent financial crime is pouring more resources into police authorities so they can do the investigative work that they need to do.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637959" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it would be helpful if the government would spell out exactly how creating a national securities regulator, how replacing one bureaucracy with another, would prevent financial crime. Perhaps there are some reasons why that would happen but they have not been highlighted yet.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing I would like to add to my remarks is that it would be a good idea for the government, separately from this legislation, to begin international negotiations on a convention or some kind of agreement that would bring countries together to combat financial crime.</div>
</p><a name="Para1637961" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when there is a financial crime, it might be hard for the banks of one country to get the information they need from the banks of another country. We have international agreements against terrorism, obviously, and we have international agreements to track other kinds of criminal activity, such as financial transactions involving money laundering and so forth, but maybe it is time for the government to take a somewhat multilateral approach to this and try to kickstart negotiations toward an international protocol to combat financial crimes.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the United States and the case of Mr. Madoff, Harry Markopolos found out about this Ponzi scheme 10 years ago and turned over all the information to the SEC.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just recently developed money laundering laws that require real estate and insurance people to report suspicious transactions. The key here is the banks.

They have cash in the bank. They have sold their farm. They have had their farm sale and they have the proceeds from the sale of the machinery. They have paid off some debts.

If the lawyer steals the money, the money will be reimbursed through the law society. They know they are protected when they deal with security dealers. If the money disappears, the security dealers are properly registered and properly bonded.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the issue really becomes why people like Earl Jones are able to operate in an unlicensed, not bonded, unregulated environment. That is why there have to be further regulations put on the banks, just as we have federal regulations dealing with money laundering, where real estate agents across the country have to report suspicious activity. I believe lawyers are supposed to as well, at least that is what they talked about last year. Certainly life insurance agents have to report suspicious activity. If that onus were put on the banking system, these people would be unable to operate very long.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not forget, they are transferring money out of the country to tax havens in the Cayman Islands and other places. For all of these fraudsters that is the common element. They deal with banks. Banks are heavily regulated. Bank people are trained to spot suspicious activity. In fact, by law, they have to report deposits in cash over $10,000. It is not that much more difficult to train them to spot suspicious activity on the part of people like this.</div>

I know, as the member has already mentioned, banks are required to report certain action that they may see when people walk in and withdraw $50,000 from a bank account or anything over $10,000.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look across the way and I see a colleague from the Liberal Party whom I sat with on a national security committee. We have studied this. We know those types of withdrawals can be used for terrorist activities. My colleague is correct. It is organized crime.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not specific to pyramid schemes. Pyramid schemes are an offence in themselves and are listed somewhere else. However, a lot of this can also be the $4,000, $5,000, $6,000 investments multiplied over hundreds of people, which banks would not recognize it on the one side from those who are investing or losing the money. I think what the member is alluding to is they had better recognize it on those who are perpetrating that activity.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me very clear. Very seldom do these individuals use one little local bank and everything is there under one account in one branch or in one banking institution. Organized crime uses hundreds of different institutions. Those people are masters in being able to launder money, but they are also masters in being able to put it into a place where there is going to be very few questions asked.</div>

There have been a number of cases where the courts deemed differently because of mitigating circumstances such as first time offence, others with no criminal record or a case where it involved the community's best people. These were people who were volunteers in minor hockey programs or in their communities, but they were also involved.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638041" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In R v Cioffi the accused was authorizing loans to fictitious people. She was charged with fraud over $5,000. The fraud amounted to more than $4 million and lasted for four years. The scheme was set up by another person who was accused merely of implementing the program that someone else had set up. The aggravating factors in that case, the court found there was a huge abuse of trust. A large number of fraudulent transactions over a long period of time had taken place, so it was not just that she was caught up for a short period of time. The mitigating factors in this case: she never had an extensive criminal record. The accused did not personally benefit because she had set it up for someone else and the accused was also a victim of fraud. She ended up with two years less a day and the stay was granted.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638042" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, R v McCarthy, the accused was charged with three counts of fraud over $5,000 related to two loans totalling in excess of $3 million and the ongoing trading of shares. The court found aggravating factors: breach of trust, considerable amount defrauded, significant number of victims. The mitigating factors were: no criminal record, no threat to the community, a record of community involvement. He received a conditional sentence. The $3 million impact to the economy is one thing that we did not really get into, but a $3 million fraud received a conditional sentence of two years less a day followed by a year of probation. The list is long. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638043" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the differences between governments is that when the former Liberal government tried to make it look like it was toughening up on this type of crime, it extended the maximum sentence. The courts simply did not give very many people the maximum sentence. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill says there will be a minimum sentence, a minimum of two years in prison for any fraudulent activity where people are charged and sentenced. Again, the bill also says we will look to restitution. That is what Canadians want. They want to know that there will be a degree of restitution where we can find it. That is what the bill does.</div>

For two days now, the Bloc Québécois has been asking the <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</a> to provide a list of the cases in which criminals and fraud artists defrauded people of over $1 million and were then given sentences of less than two years.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638055" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For two days, our Conservative colleagues have had their research service working on it. This has to be examined, because we must never forget that the legal system we have inherited from our parents and our grandparents is based on precedent, and so is obviously a constantly evolving system. I hope the examples the Conservatives have cited for us are recent law and are new decisions or the most recent decisions.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638056" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is too easy to engage in demagoguery, particularly when it comes from the Conservatives, because they have decided to do politics the easy way. It pays to be tough on crime, because often the public listens to the media, and obviously both the press and the electronic media often sell papers or attract viewers by inflating a news item and trying to sensationalize it. That is how our democratic societies work, and that is fine.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638057" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public can make up their own minds. They watch more than one television network. They are not all the same. They can read more than one newspaper and they do not all have the same opinions on a subject. That is fine. Except that when a political party like the Conservative Party decides to jump to conclusions, it is very easy and it is demagoguery at its worst when they try to take a single trend and apply it to a party’s agenda. And they think this is the way to win elections.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638058" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, they may think this has borne fruit for them, except that in Quebec, Quebeckers are much more vigilant in terms of how justice is administered, and they get to the bottom of things. That is why, election after election, a majority of the members they elect to this House are from the Bloc Québécois, which gets to the bottom of things before taking positions.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638059" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Quebec, we have had to deal with major white-collar crime cases. We are talking about the Norbourg case, with Lacroix, and the Earl Jones case. Obviously, these are perfect examples of criminals who have abused the system. These fraud artists had built up their system over a number of years. These were not occasional frauds. These are criminals who built an entire empire, one that made a lot of profit for them personally. They were able to live the high life, they had a wonderful life, and obviously, with the outcomes we have seen when the economic crisis hit, everything collapsed and all the houses of cards they had built crumbled.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This clearly left victims, people who lost a lot of money, in distress. Once again, when I talk about a government’s skill at exploiting public opinion, that is what it is trying to make us believe, that Bill <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',4144434,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=4144434&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-52</a> is going to solve the problem.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the victims of Vincent Lacroix and Earl Jones are looking for is to recover their money. It is wrong to say that the bill will enable victims to do so. It will not make recovery of the money possible. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638062" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, it is all very well to say the guilty person will be required to reimburse something, but they have to have assets left to do so. The fact of the matter is that, in the cases of Vincent Lacroix and Earl Jones, it becomes clear very quickly that the money has disappeared because they had set up the system years previously. Perhaps the Conservatives are fooled, but we in the Bloc Québécois are not. The money has disappeared and is probably to be found in tax havens protected by the government. The Bloc has, for a number of years now, called on both the Liberals at the time and the Conservatives to abolish tax havens, and they do nothing about it. This bill is not going to make it possible to recover all the funds in tax havens that might be held by white collar criminals. It has absolutely no impact on tax havens. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638063" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, once again, the victims are stuck and for good reason. The <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</a>'s strategy was to publicize this bill before introducing it in the House. Today, the leader of the Bloc Québécois rose on a point of order about this. I know that the Chair will consider the matter and rule on the Conservatives' new approach, which is to short-circuit the House of Commons. Our prime objective, however, is to enact legislation. This is the first time in the history of Canada that a government has decided, in an effort to influence public opinion, to release the bill directly in the media before parliamentarians have seen it. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638064" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, why did they do it? Out of sheer partisanship. This is the Conservative approach to politics. I repeat. Quebeckers are not fooled. The people of the rest of Canada, however, clearly are fooled by the Conservatives' behaviour. That is their problem. Quebeckers have understood the messages. Nevertheless, for non partisan purposes, the Bloc, on our return to the House of Commons in September, sought the unanimous consent of the House to table a measure regarding the abolition of the granting of parole after one-sixth of a sentence has been served. The Conservatives will try to convince us that there must be a minimum sentence of two years for crimes involving over $1 million. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638065" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that that accomplished—the fact that the Conservatives waited—is that criminals in Quebec, the Vincent Lacroix types of this world, are pleading guilty. Earl Jones is in the process of doing the same thing. Vincent Lacroix decided to plead guilty in September. Earl Jones is getting ready to plead guilty. They are doing so precisely to avoid having a bill, such as the one introduced by the Bloc Québécois to abolish parole after one-sixth of a sentence has been served, come into effect before they are sentenced, so they can be paroled after serving one-sixth of it. That was the twisted part. The victims are not reimbursed, and these criminals can be released after serving one-sixth of their sentence. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638066" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent Lacroix was sentenced to eight years in prison. He got out after serving one-sixth, or 15 months, of his civil court sentence. He was sentenced in criminal court as well as a result of legal proceedings instituted by the AMF. He decided to plead guilty to these criminal charges. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison but will be eligible for release after serving one-sixth. This means we will see Vincent Lacroix back on our streets after two and a half years. That is what the Conservatives are trying to stuff down the throats of Quebeckers.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638067" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Quebeckers have already moved on. They know we have to get rid of conditional release after one-sixth of the sentence for these criminals. Why? These criminals are obviously not what are usually considered dangerous. They have not committed armed robbery. Ultimately, though, they are just as dangerous because they get to their victims psychologically. I know, of course, that the Conservatives have a bit of a difficulty with psychology and things like that. I know quite a few of them who find that sort of thing difficult. But that is where Quebeckers are now, and that is what the Bloc Québécois expected. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638068" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a spirit of non-partisanship, therefore, the Bloc Québécois is saying today that it will vote in favour of this bill so that it can be sent to committee and improved. As it now stands, it will not resolve the problems of the victims.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minister’s attempt to hold a press conference to unveil his bill failed miserably because the victims were not convinced when it came to their two major problems: the reimbursement of their money and ensuring that these criminals do not return to our streets after two and a half or three years. This bill does nothing to resolve these two problems.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638070" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard because we are dealing with a government that has the entire bureaucracy and tremendous resources at its disposal. It uses them to promote itself. It even makes cheques out with the Conservative Party logo on them. It is quite the thing to see them in action. They use government advertising dollars to sing the praises of their own political platform.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives will not succeed, though, because they are not achieving the objectives, at least in Quebec.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the message the Bloc is delivering here. That is the hand that the Bloc reached out to the government in September. First the Bloc Québécois tried to show that there are criminals who are prepared to plead guilty because they will be eligible for parole anyway after serving a sixth of their sentence. Why not unanimously support a Bloc Québécois bill to abolish conditional release after a sixth of the sentence? That would prevent the Vincent Lacroix’s and Earl Jones’s of this world from serving a two-and-a-half year sentence when they should be serving 15 years. Even if they got a 25-year sentence, they would only serve a couple more years if they served just one-sixth. In that case, they would serve four years instead of two and a half before returning to the streets. That is the reality. We do not know whether a two-year minimum is enough. Lacroix got eight years and was released after 16 months. If he pleads guilty, he will be sentenced to 15 years in prison but will be back on our streets after two and a half years. That is the reality and that is what the victims find so infuriating.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638073" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem has to do with restitution. There is no mention of compensation or a compensation fund in this bill. The Conservatives are introducing a compensation process by saying that the guilty party will have to compensate his victims. That already exists in the Criminal Code. The problem with organized fraud by the likes of Vincent Lacroix, Earl Jones or Cinar is that there is no solution in this bill. For weeks, the Bloc Québécois and its leader have been saying in this House that there was fraud in the case of Cinar. There was collusion at the Department of Justice under the Liberals. The press took note of that. Again, the <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</a> rose in this House to ask whether we had new information to reopen the case. We see new information in many of the newspapers in Quebec. They probably do not read newspapers from Quebec. We can see what impact it has on them politically not to do so. They would be well served to read the Quebec media, which has all the details on this affair. The people of Quebec have decided to clean house. They truly want white collar criminals to stay in prison for the duration of their sentence, be it 15, 20 or 25 years. Criminals have to serve their sentence.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who lost their money want to be compensated whether it is the government that does so or not. Some may have submitted requests, but they want someone to go after the money hidden in tax havens by the criminals. People are under the impression, and I agree with them, that when the criminals get out after serving one-sixth of their sentence, or after a year and a half or two years and a half, they get on a boat or plane and are never seen again. They will live out their days under the sun thanks to the money they stole from their victims. It will be thanks to the Government of Canada because the elected members of this House will not have been intelligent enough to understand what the Bloc Québécois has been trying to say for over three years now.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look back in history, Eliot Ness was finally able to charge Al Capone with the help of the US Internal Revenue Service.

It is easy to fit into speeches. The Conservative members have been well trained, like sheep, and they all know how to say “tough on crime”. However, actually being tough on crime is something else entirely. My colleague raised some good points about that.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proclaiming that one is tough on crime is not what it takes to unanimously pass a bill eliminating conditional release, as the Bloc Québécois proposed, to prevent white collar criminals from being put back in the community after serving 16 or 18 months of an eight-year sentence. That is what happened with Vincent Lacroix, who is expected to spend two and a half years of his 15-year criminal sentence in jail. He was sentenced to eight years on civil charges. He will be back on our streets in two and a half years.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638095" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was simple enough. We were not trying to play partisan politics, and we were not getting all dramatic, saying we were tough on crime. We just did not want criminals to be back on the streets after serving one-sixth of their sentence. It was not that hard to understand, but apparently, it was a little too complicated for the Conservatives.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevance of his remarks was very much appreciated. I think that they helped clarify the intentions of this bill. The bill's title in French is meaningful. The French title refers to “châtiment”, meaning retribution or punishment, on behalf of victims of crime. That is the word used, and the root of that word comes from the French for “sharia”.

Under a similar bill, he could have been the victim of some of these measures. These measures would be identical to those applied to someone who did something as horrible as stealing more than $1 million, when he simply gave contradictory evidence in court.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said earlier that the problem with the Conservatives is that they do not read the Quebec papers. It was very telling to see the analyses in the press, even the ones by legal experts, because they were clearly divided on the issue. Most said, though, that under this bill, people like Guy Lafleur would have automatically been sentenced to prison. It is amazing how the Conservatives are determined to replace the justice system. There is a reason we have been asking them for two days to cite one case where a criminal who committed fraud over $1 million was sentenced to less than two years in prison.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, a Conservative finally gave us an answer and named cases. The Bloc Québécois experts and I have taken note of them. We have to be careful. We are talking about cases, crimes and sentences in recent case law. There have been many such cases in Quebec and the rest of Canada recently. We are talking about case law that is up to date, because it evolves. Obviously, cases affect other cases and form case law, which evolves over time. It is therefore important to consider the latest cases and trends. We will check. Lately, at least for rulings handed down in Quebec in the case of fraud over $1 million, offenders have been sentenced to more than two years in prison.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638103" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the problem. Vincent Lacroix was given a civil sentence of eight years imprisonment because the sentences were for terms of less than two years cumulatively. He was able to get out after 16 months incarceration because he was eligible for parole after serving one-sixth of his sentence. That is the problem identified by all victims and all Quebeckers who saw Vincent Lacroix plead guilty immediately after the Bloc Québécois presented its motion.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638104" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had unanimously requested in this House that the provision of release after serving one-sixth of sentence be abolished for white collar criminals. The Conservatives said no. Two days later, Vincent Lacroix pleaded guilty in order to avoid serving his full sentence of 15 years, which would have been the case under the Bloc Québécois proposal to abolish parole after serving one-sixth of a sentence. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638105" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives' inertia made it possible for Vincent Lacroix to be sentenced and to be free in two and a half years. That is the reality. That is how the Conservatives play petty politics with the topic of the day. The Conservative members say they are tough on crime but in the end they just follow along blindly. The result is that Vincent Lacroix pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment but will be out on the streets in two and a half years. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill contains six measures, all of which are designed in some way to enhance the sentencing process for offenders convicted of fraud.

Many Canadians are affected by this. We as a government are committed to ensuring that this practice will stop as much as possible and that those people who do commit these crimes actually pay, so we discourage future criminals from committing those crimes.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should mention that this mandatory minimum penalty acts as a floor to ensure that there is some consistency with judges and justices throughout this country and that people who do commit this crime have a clear message from the government that they will do the time if they commit the crime.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638125" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second element is in relation to aggravating factors. This is an excellent case of where the government is taking some common sense approaches to ensuring we protect victims and punish criminals. There are currently four statutory aggravating factors for fraud under section 380.1 of the Criminal Code, and the bill would add new aggravating factors to the list. We believe, as a government, that these new factors would go further to deterring criminals and ensuring victims are considered in all aspects of these matters.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638126" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first factor is the impact of the fraud on its victim. The victims would prepare a victim impact statement and provide that to the court so that the court can see first-hand how this particular offence and how this particular criminal has affected them, their family, their friends and their future life. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638127" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my past life as a litigator for some 11 years, I saw this impact directly, not just on individuals, Canadian families and seniors, but also many times on clubs: curling clubs, skating clubs and many non-profit groups that actually rely on these funds and then find out, after they have appointed somebody to a position of trust to manage these funds and take care of them, they find after three or four months, sometimes even years, that all of a sudden all the money is gone and all that is left is paperwork. The criminal has spent it either on gambling, which many times is the case, or just simply on a lavish lifestyle. That would be the first of the new aggravating factors to be considered by justices and judges across this country.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638128" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor that is important for today is the complexity and magnitude of the fraud itself, because these criminals are becoming much more adventurous, much more intellectual as far as the crime itself and how they go about committing it. We want to ensure judges consider this in the sentencing provisions themselves.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638129" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aggravating factor is the failure of the offender to comply with the applicable rules and regulations as set out by the particular situation they are in, and, off course, that speaks for itself. </div>
</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355">(1355)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para1638130" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the fourth statutory aggravating factor that would be added to section 380.1 of the Criminal Code would be any attempt by the offender to conceal or destroy records relevant to the fraud, which obviously shows the offender's bad faith and intention to try to get away with the crime even after he or she is caught.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638131" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these issues are extremely important. Criminals and victims themselves should recognize that this Conservative government is standing up for them and ensuring their priorities are met.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638132" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third measure is what judges have considered as aggravating and mitigating circumstances. This would require the sentencing court to state on the record, which is very important, which aggravating and mitigating factors it has applied. The reason for this is to ensure consistency. As we know, we have a system of law that relies on case law and precedents to ensure that judges that make future decisions are able to examine what past judges have done and make decisions based upon that to ensure consistency across the country from province to province and coast to coast, which is very important. This is also to ensure transparency in the decisions themselves made by the judges so that when they make a decision, which may not be normal or may fall outside of the boundaries, they state it clearly on the record.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I had left off was in relation to the six measures that this particular bill contains, and I had outlined at least three of them. The first was in relation to minimum mandatory sentences; the second being the additional aggravating factors that would be added to section 380.(1) of the Criminal Code; and the third being that the judge or justice state on the record those aggravating or other factors that determined his or her sentencing in relation to the alleged accused as a result of being convicted.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638428" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth is a new sentencing tool. I really think this is a good factor in relation to this particular bill because it would give the courts a brand new sentencing tool for fraud offenders, aimed at preventing the commission of further frauds and victimizations. Indeed, often these particular individuals who commit these types of crimes will continue to do so because this is the only mode in which they earn a living.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638429" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court, in this case, would be able to order as part of the sentence that the offender actually be prohibited from having work for remuneration or in a volunteer capacity, often these types of cases involve some sort of volunteer non-profit organization, and that involves having any authority whatsoever over another person's money, over another person's valuable securities, or over any real property that a person would have. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638430" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order is discretionary and available for any period of time. What I like the best is that it can actually be ordered for life and in some circumstances, it certainly should be, especially where we see that particular person continuing to behave in that same manner and continuing to travel around the country.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638431" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, myself, had a case in which this actually took place. That person defrauded a curling club in one location in the province and then moved some 400 or 500 miles to a new location and then defrauded a particular service organization of upwards of $50,000, in that particular case. It could have been prevented if this type of order would have been in place. In fact, the gentleman's credentials were such that, in the first case, he received a two years less a day conditional sentence, which means it was provincial time and he, in this case, would not have to serve that time in jail. He actually served that time at his house and as a result of that, he moved, went to a different location, got a job as a manager of a restaurant, and then defrauded that person of up to $50,000.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this is a really good addition to the Criminal Code and I think it will be used by justices and judges according to need.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two final measures are actually aimed at improving the responsiveness of the justice system and the sentencing process to the needs of victims.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data from 2006-07 showed that approximately 20% of fraud convictions resulted in a restitution order. I was somewhat shocked at that. However, in order to encourage greater use of these orders, first, sentencing courts would be required to ask the crown prosecutor in the case whether reasonable efforts were made to give victims a chance to indicate whether they want restitution. I cannot imagine many cases where a victim that has been defrauded would not want restitution. That is usually not the case. As a result of that, courts would also be required to consider restitution in all fraud cases and to provide reasons if restitution is not ordered. That would set this as a new precedent, another proof that we in this Conservative government will stand up for victims of crime.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to digress for a moment and speak about a particular part of my practice that I found very refreshing from the federal government. It was approximately 11 to 12 years ago. It was in relation to child support guidelines.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638437" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a practitioner in northern Alberta, I would see cases, especially because we had justices from all over the province of Alberta come up to Fort McMurray at that time, with the same circumstances where court orders would be double the amount for children or even half the amount for children in other cases. So, the child support guidelines giving clear indications to judges and justices across the country as far as what people made, as far as income and what they should pay in child support is very similar to this.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we will find this to be a very welcome approach, not just for crown prosecutors but also for justices so they know the starting point, the absolute minimum and what those aggravating factors should be once case law is established, and what people should receive based upon what kind of offence they committed.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638439" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three points of caution are needed. First, no criminal law reform can change the bottom line, namely, that if the offender does not have any adequate assets there cannot be restitution. Indeed, it cannot help. Our hearts go out to that, which is why we are looking at other regulations and doing consultations across the country to stop this before it actually happens, and to put in place regulations so that fraud of this nature cannot continue to happen.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638440" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be kept in mind that the crown prosecutor is responsible for making the sentencing submissions and victims will not have standing to advance their restitution requests. They need to work with the crown prosecutor and ensure they fully disclose how much this has hurt them and their family through a victim impact statement. They also need to disclose how much was taken by providing proper accounting records in order to prove the case and then the crown prosecutor can put that forward to the justice.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638441" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last measure in the bill would specifically acknowledge that courts may consider a statement prepared by a representative of a community or definable group for consideration at sentencing for fraud cases. This is new but this is a great application to allow all those victims who have been taken advantage of by a particular criminal or criminal organization to put forward exactly what this has done.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638442" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most cases, as I have mentioned, the victims are primarily seniors and retirees, but curling clubs, not for profit groups, hockey clubs, figure skating clubs and even arts clubs have also been victims. It seems that criminals will stop at nothing to take money and to personally enhance their own lives. Especially bad is defrauding church groups, flying clubs and, therefore, taxpayers and the government because, ultimately, we, the people of Canada, the taxpayers, must pay that. When they defraud the Government of Canada, it is we, the taxpayers of Canada, who ultimately pay because they are actually stealing from us.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an excellent bill but I would like to go over some of the case law. There have been some suggestions by the Liberals and even the Bloc that this is not the case, indeed when is there a two year or less sentence for these people who steal that kind of money. As a result, some investigation was done and a review of case law does suggest that the average sentence for large frauds is around four years, although some people do receive much longer sentences and some shorter. When people receive lesser sentences, it usually is in a case where there is a joint submission by a crown prosecutor and a defence lawyer. They come together and negotiate a plea based upon a certain amount of time being spent in jail and then present that to a judge based on usually good evidence. Sometimes they negotiate it for other reasons, primarily as a result of getting an early guilty plea so victims do not have to deal with it. Now we have a two year minimum and it needs to be over that.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638444" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk a bit about some cases that have come forward. In one particular case, the Queen v. Cioffi in 2009, where the accused was convicted of fraud, more than $4 million were taken and the scheme lasted four years. It was quite a complicated scheme. It required some form of planning and a large number of fraudulent transactions. However, in this particular case, the accused had no criminal record and did not personally benefit. Someone else benefited. The individual who stole this money received two years less a day, which means provincial time. It is not even under federal jurisdiction. Two years less a day means that the individual is eligible for house arrest, which, quite frankly, I do not think should be allowed in these particular circumstances. Now people will not be allowed because this government has that two year plus mandatory timeframe.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, R. v. McCarthy, a 2008 case, two loans were involved totalling in excess of $3 million, aggravating factors included, obviously the breach of trust, a considerable number of victims and there was no criminal record in this case either. The individual in that case received a conditional sentence of two years less a day as well, followed by a year of probation. So, $3 million and two years less a day in jail.</div>

</p><a name="Para1638447" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of R. v. Lafleur, it was 28 counts of fraud spanning four years and totalling over $1.5 million.

Aside from some semblance of house arrest, the person still had the big screen TV and all the rest of the amenities. More than $1.1 million in that particular case was defrauded.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years in jail usually means maybe 15 months in jail, at the top, or two-thirds of the time.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill provides a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for a term of two years for fraud with a value that exceeds $1 million. I questioned the government this morning about how it determined the $1 million because it seems to me that fraud is a serious issue no matter how big it is. In law it is certainly something that lawyers thrive on. I am sure that we will find lawyers trying to argue whether or not fraud was $1 million or whether it was under $1 million, and there will be huge arguments about that.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill provides additional aggravating factors for sentencing. It creates a discretionary prohibition order for offenders convicted of fraud to prevent them from having authority over the money or real property of others. It requires consideration of restitution for victims of fraud and it clarifies that the sentencing court may consider community impact statements from a community that has been harmed by the fraud.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back to the issue of restitution for victims of fraud. This is a provision of the bill which on the surface sounds good. I certainly hope that victims see some restitution as a result of this particular provision, but I would not want people to get their hopes up very high on this particular issue.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole argument about schemes, frauds and Ponzi schemes really boils down to issues of people who are less than honest, bilking people of hard-earned savings and monies, and then in fact spiriting the money away into tax havens. While the economy is good, these schemes tend to thrive because if the stock market is going up and as the economy is expanding, it is easy for them to cover their tracks and hide the fact that they are engaging in a fraudulent activity.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638479" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suspect there are many more of these beneath the surface.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to use Bernie Madoff as an example, where Harry Markopolos was able to uncover Bernie Madoff 10 years ago. Ten years ago Harry Markopolos, who was working at the time for Rampart Investment Management in Boston, was asked if he could duplicate Madoff's strategy. It makes sense that if people are competing in a market and can offer 30% returns on 90-day certificates that they will have a lot of customers, but in addition to having a lot of customers, there are going to be a lot of people who want to duplicate their system and compete with them because they are obviously making a lot of money.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he knew it was a fraud in about five minutes. He took his information to the Securities and Exchange Commission. When he went to the Securities and Exchange Commission, he was rebuffed because Bernie Madoff had been a big, known figure at the time, had been involved in the industry, and had a good reputation. In fact, I believe one of Bernie Madoff's sons-in-law was actually working for the securities commission as an investigator.

We learned that we have to have proper regulatory bodies that are not populated by people from the industry, that it should not be taking people from the mutual fund industry, the securities industry, out of a company that they have worked for, for 20, 30 years, and they know all the players, and pop them in, sort of like a retirement package, the securities commission that is watching the same company that they have been working for all these years.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at our own securities commission in Ontario. One of the big arguments we have had in the House, and I know my Bloc colleague understands it well, is the whole idea of the national securities regulator. Being from Manitoba I know that over the last few years we have been opposed to that. I see the arguments for having a national regulator. The other G7 countries have it and it is probably a good idea, but what the government is missing in its analysis is not what it is called, whether it is a national regulator or 10 provincial regulators, it is who do we have running the regulators? Who is running the national regulation system? </div>
</p><a name="Para1638493" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had a national securities regulator and filled it with people who worked in the industry, then we would not have any better results than we have right now with the Ontario Securities Commission. It has a very sorry track record, a terrible record of imprisoning almost no one. It may have been lucky to catch three or four people in the last 10 years and this is even when the whole case was given to it. Even when the whole thing was put right in front of it, it still could not somehow take action.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, however, we see more activity in that area, but it comes from the judicial system in the United States. Let us take Conrad Black as an example. He did his crimes in Canada, as a matter of fact, I believe it had to do with non-competes that he was signing with CanWest when it was buying all those newspapers and there were $40 million worth of non-compete agreements in each one of these deals that he got, and his shareholders went after him when they realized that he was taking the $40 million when it should have belonged to Hollinger. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conrad was a Canadian. I know he became a British citizen at some point, but he was a Canadian. He operated here his whole life. He had his companies here and yet surprise, he is doing time in a Florida jail. By all accounts I gather he is having a great time down there. It does not seem like a very tough jail he is in and he seems like he is happy enough that he might want to stay there a little longer based on the last transmissions we heard from him. But, my point is that the public must have confidence in its government to protect it. When we see people like Conrad Black and Madoff literally just walking away and when they do get caught, they do not spend much in the way of jail time, it is a problem. It breeds cynicism within the public. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I was intrigued by another part of the Bloc's argument today that the sentences should be longer than one-sixth of the sentence. Mr. Vincent Lacroix, who is just one example of many, received an eight year sentence, but because people can get out of jail after serving only one-sixth of their sentence, this man was back on the streets in only two and a half years. So once again the public questioned this. If his sentence was eight years, then what is he doing knocking on my door after only two and a half years? What kind of a system is this that allows that?</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is the Bloc's intention to introduce an amendment at committee to rectify this situation or to deal with it in some sense, but if we are going to give Mr. Lacroix two and a half years, then that is what the penalty should be. Do not have a judge say that he is supposed to spend eight years and then after only one-sixth of his sentence, how does he get out of that? I would like to know how the government is planning to deal with that issue because once again, I thought that was a very good argument the Bloc had.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say at the outset that I am so impressed with the lawyers in this Parliament. I have never seen so many lawyers in one place outside of a legal convention. There are some extremely smart lawyers here, and the Bloc caucus is just one example that has several lawyers. The Liberal caucus and the NDP caucus have some, and I am sure there are a few really smart lawyers on the government side too. I have been listening to them very closely. However, their whole approach to the legal side of things has sort of been more along the lines of how it appears from a political point of view. That is the argument, I suppose, and they do not take the view of the legal family represented in the other parties in opposition. They simply go along with the government line that somehow, if they could showcase the bill as being tough on crime as opposed to smart on crime, that will pay off in getting votes back home. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we have to do is look at the minimum sentence laws in the United States. That is the subject of another bill which we will be getting to fairly soon. In the 1980s California had Ronald Reagan's three strikes and you are out regime. His solution was to build a lot of prisons, and of course his buddies were building private prisons, so he could reward his friends as well. They built wall-to-wall prisons and put people in prison. I do not have the stats handy, but the United States stands alone in terms of the number per hundred thousand people who are incarcerated. The crime rate in the states has not gone down one bit. It is probably even higher than it has ever been. Just recently, because of budgetary problems, Governor Schwarzenegger, who would hardly be soft on crime, and who is a Republican, though hardly a George Bush Republican, has had to release thousands of people from prison because it has been found that the minimum sentence laws do not work.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just pointing out to the member of the government that there are all sorts of evidence and examples of crime approaches that work, and there are examples of those that do not work. I gave examples before about car theft in Winnipeg, about how putting immobilizers in cars and having teams of police investigators going after the limited number of car thieves who steal the maximum number of cars has produced results. That is something that works. That is what the government should be doing. The government is mandated by the public to be here to find solutions that work, and not just stuff that knocks an MP's rating up five points in the polls overnight. That is what Conservative members have been doing.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other argument that the Bloc has made, which I find really important, is with regard to the issue of tax havens. We had a Liberal government for years and years before that had ample opportunity to deal with the whole issue of tax havens. We even had a Prime Minister who had a bunch of his boats registered in some foreign country. It might have been Panama.</div>

The Speaker has indicated I am running out of time, and I have a lot more issues to discuss here, but we have to deal with tougher banking regulations to make certain that banks report suspicious activities, more so than they are doing right now. I know they are required to report deposits in cash of over $10,000. We can make further requirements of the banks that will help solve this problem. We should be regulating the industry. We should require more bonding. We should require that the people who are involved in these businesses have proper regulatory authorities so that they can be watched, and so that they have to report. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things he pointed out in his speech, which I appreciated, was his indignation toward the fact that the courts were giving certain sentences and in just a few short months, in some cases, these individuals were being returned to the streets.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is statutory release in this country. In some cases, two-thirds of the way through sentences offenders can be sent back out on the street.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this concern, the bill includes a mandatory prison sentence of two years for any fraud or combined frauds which have a value of over $1 million. The mandatory prison sentence would act as a floor, for a variety of aggravating factors would also be applied to raise the actual sentence well above the two year range in many cases.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently four statutory aggravating factors for fraud in section 380.1 of the Criminal Code. This bill will add new aggravating factors to that list to set out additional characteristics of fraud which are particularly troubling. The new factors will focus on: one, the impact of the fraud on its victim; two, the complexity and magnitude of the fraud; three, failure of the offender to comply with applicable rules and regulations; and four, any attempt by the offender to conceal or destroy records relevant to the fraud.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure will require the sentencing court to state on the record which aggravating and mitigating factors it has applied.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also gives the courts a new sentencing tool aimed at preventing the commission of further frauds and victimization. The court will be able to order as part of a sentence that the offender be prohibited from having work or remuneration, or volunteering in a capacity that involves having authority over another person's money, valuable securities or real property. The order is discretionary and is available for any period up to life.</div>

I know that some members on the opposition benches often do not support mandatory prison sentences and mandatory penalties as a deterrent but I can say that we do on this side of the House.

The aggravating factors were abuse of trust and that large numbers of fraudulent transactions were made over a period of time.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the questions is why the proposed measures deal only with fraud and not other white collar crime offences. The offence of fraud really is extremely broad and flexible and can be charges in a wide range of conduct. While there are many different offences in the Criminal Code that can apply to any given set of facts, it is the offence of fraud that gets charged far more often than other offences. It remains the primary offence for going after those who deceive honest Canadians. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bill, we are introducing that mandatory prison sentence for fraud when there is a value over $1 million.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the best way to describe it is that a fraud of this size can only be described as large scale and would have been the result of a great deal of time, energy and planning and a significant amount of deception to have defrauded one or more people of over $1 million, all of which demonstrate a high degree of moral culpability.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law should be clear that any fraud of that scope must be met with a minimum term of imprisonment.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing that this mandatory prison sentence of two years is lower than some of the sentences that the courts are currently handing down. Some sentences, we hear, are in the four to seven year range for these large scale frauds, which would be much more than $1 million, but there is no minimum sentences set out explicitly in the Criminal Code. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the court can take into account some of the mitigating circumstances in individual cases and end up with a sentence that is lower than two years. Therefore, it is appropriate for this Parliament to give guidance to the courts and to Canadians by clearly stating that the mandatory sentence be laid out clearly in these cases, and the mandatory minimum would serve as a starting point for a sentence calculation. A variety of aggravating factors, which are often applicable to a fraud of this size, such as its complexity, its duration, its large number of victims and the fact that the fraud involved a breach of trust, would also be applied to raise the actual sentence. I hope the judges do in fact hand down sentences that are well above the two year range.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frauds that are of great concern to Canadians today are for these amounts that are well above $1 million, sometimes 100 times more than that amount and often above. Clearly, sentences for these types of frauds would be well above the starting point of two years, which is set for frauds of just the $1 million that we have been talking about. This measure would send a clear message to all that serious consequences await anyone who is thinking of getting wealthy by scamming Canadians.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing right now that there are some aggravating factors that are currently being considered by sentencing courts. There are already several mandatory aggravating factors for fraud offences in the Criminal Code. For instance, if the fraud involved a large number of victims or if, in committing the offence, the offender took advantage of the high regard in which he was held in the community, as well as under section 718.2 of the Criminal Code, there are generally applicable aggravating factors that could be applied.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of fraud, the factor that arises most frequently is if the offender abused a position of trust or authority in committing the offence. We see that all too often.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe this is something that has unfortunately affected too many victims in recent years. We have every right to expect the government to amend legislation to reflect this situation, which is not new. However, in the context of the deregulation of financial markets and changes in technology that now make possible operations previously impossible to hide or to carry out, it is clear that the government must modernize our laws in this regard. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638607" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the bill the government has introduced is way off the mark. In fact, it appears more like a public relations operation to show that the government is doing something. It looks more like a public relations move in keeping with the ideological battle the Conservatives are waging to introduce into Canada a sort of justice based on the American model, which is currently being challenged by the harsh economic reality. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In California, for example, more is spent on the prison system than on universities, because the laws have been tightened over the years automatically and without thought. The problem is a serious one. California, on the brink of bankruptcy, has had to release 40,000 prisoners because it could no longer feed them. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638609" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to avoid the extremes a number of American states had to face, it seems to me there should be a much more vigorous and broad public debate on the type of justice we want, rather than what the Conservatives are offering us. They in fact are offering us measures piecemeal that aim to establish a justice system that has nothing to do with the values of Quebeckers and Canadians, I am convinced, with no public debate and no real examination of all the aspects. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill is therefore off the mark, as it will not contribute in any way to fighting white collar crime. On the contrary, it includes a whole series of neo republican Conservative themes, on minimum sentences, for example. I will come back to this. </div>
</p><a name="Para1638611" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be a debate on the way to modernize our laws, in matters of justice, in particular, but it applies to everything to do with the regulation of the financial sector. It is very clear that we cannot continue in the environment engendered by the 1990s. There must be new regulations for the financial sector worldwide and within individual countries. The debate must get underway. It is in this context that the Bloc Québécois has decided to vote in favour of this bill, even if it does not meet the target it claims it wants to meet, so that it may be studied in committee. At that point we can introduce measures that might bring real solutions to white collar crime. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very clearly, this kind of debate cannot be held piecemeal, as the Conservatives are trying to do with nearly half of the bills before us amending the Criminal Code or dealing with the justice system. We have to have a genuine debate where all of the principles on which a justice system should be based are front and centre in the public discussion. Obviously, the members of this House must be participants, but Canadian and Quebec society as a whole must also take part. The bill will be considered in committee and a number of proposals will be made that seem to us to be much more promising than what we see in the bill.

We will have either suspended sentences or minimum sentences of imprisonment for two years. That is going to be completely untenable for judges. We will have situations in which accused persons who should have been given a conditional sentence, for example, find themselves with suspended sentences or with no sentence at all, in order to avoid a minimum of imprisonment for two years. There will also be people who will be sentenced to two years for whom a different approach should have been taken, in terms of rehabilitation.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minimum sentences serve no purpose.

That society has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world, and that incarceration rate in fact has a perverse effect, because it artificially lowers the unemployment rate. Every time the unemployment rate in Canada and Quebec is compared to the rate in the United States, we have to add 1 to 1.5 percentage points to it. There are so many people in prison, for all sorts of sometimes relatively minor offences that could be remedied by other kinds of interventions. As I said, the incarceration rate means that an entire segment of the population that could be in the labour force is artificially and temporarily eliminated from the statistics.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That does not have any dissuasive effect. The United States is not a society at peace with itself. People may feel safe, but they do not feel at peace. They close themselves off now in gated communities where they are isolated from society. This is not a well-integrated society at peace with itself. It is not even real safety, just the appearance of safety. This is what happens in a country that has increased the number of offences with minimum sentences. They have no dissuasive effect.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraud over $1 billion is pretty rare. Not only is it unusual, but when it happens, the sentences are for more than two years.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives created the impression they are passing tougher laws, but it is just a public relations exercise. This may also have been a bill that was quickly cobbled together by the Conservative government in view of the disgust expressed by much of the public and the victims of the various fraudsters. There were Vincent Lacroix and Earl Jones, of course, but also various other people in financial and business circles who have behaved badly over the last few years. I am thinking, for example, of the fiddling with the books at Nortel and at Enron in the United States. The government probably wanted to act in view of all the public pressure but did something that will not produce results. This bill is terribly makeshift.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have also added aggravating circumstances. If you look at the court's decision in the Vincent Lacroix case, you will find that all the aggravating circumstances put in the bill by the government—for example, the psychological effects of fraud on the victims—were included in the reasons given by the judge, in the Vincent Lacroix case, to justify his sentence.

This is one example, but we have seen a number of others over the several sessions since this Conservative government has been in office.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliminating parole after one-sixth of sentence would be an extremely easy thing to do. We could include it in this bill. We could even, in the cases of Vincent Lacroix and Earl Jones, make sure that the two of them serve a healthy portion of their sentences rather than what will be the case as a result of this government’s inaction. In January 2011, Vincent Lacroix will be as free as a bird, or very nearly. I cite these two examples again because they are the best known in Quebec.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill does not include those elements. Another major element that has not been talked about and that the government does not want to talk about is the question of tax havens. I come back to what I said a moment ago. This means that people commit fraud and think they will be able to come out of it just fine, based not just on the fact that they will be released after one-sixth of their sentence, but also on the fact that as a result of all sorts of mechanisms that are allowed under the Canadian Income Tax Act, that money will be sitting in tax havens, safe from the Canadian tax authorities. The negligence of the Conservative government on this issue is blatant. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago, Statistics Canada revealed that, if I recall correctly, there is $146 billion owing from Canadian taxpayers. These are mainly very wealthy individuals. As we know, an ordinary taxpayer does not have the resources to pay the accountants and lawyers they need to make use of all these mechanisms. There are also companies, the banks among them. We know that the Canadian banks, in particular, use tax havens to a huge extent. This is money that is sitting in tax havens, as a result of negligence on the part of Liberal or Conservative governments. Eventually, when these fraud artists are released, they are going to be able to get the victims’ money back, safe from the Canadian justice system and Canadian tax authorities and, it has to be said, with the complicity of the Conservative government of Canada.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is one of the examples we gave this week. It had to do with signing an agreement to weaken the border between Panama and Canada. Everyone knows that Panama is a tax haven. It is notorious. We just signed an agreement to make it even easier to transfer money from Canada to Panama. That is completely counter to current policy directions espoused by responsible governments, such as the administrations of President Obama and President Sarkozy, who have condemned the situation and are seeking solutions.

When the Conservatives were in opposition, they made much of the fact that Canada Steamship Lines, which belonged to the Minister of Finance, Paul Martin, who later became Prime Minister, used schemes allowed in Barbados to avoid paying taxes in Canada. Not only have they maintained the tax agreement with Barbados since coming to power, they have reversed a decision made in one of the budgets to prevent double deduction of interest in the case of foreign investment.

Today, we are still proposing the elimination of parole after one-sixth of a sentence, but the Conservatives are backpedalling on their 2007 proposal concerning double deductions of interest for Canadian investments abroad.</div>

The objective of the bill is clear and simple. It would amend the Criminal Code to improve the justice system's response to the sort of large scale fraud we have all been hearing so much about lately.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638673" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Canadians are among those who are vulnerable to fraud. They choose to come to Canada because they trust our justice system. They believe that those who commit crimes will be sentenced and put behind bars. However, when they unfortunately become victims of fraudsters they are appalled to discover that these criminals can easily walk away without any serious consequences and start committing those same crimes again. The victims cannot get their hard-earned money back and there is no protection for them.</div>

On the contrary, the bill would make clear that fraud is a serious crime for which there must be serious consequences.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also designed to improve the responsiveness of the justice system for victims of fraud. These proposed measures would send a strong message to the victims of fraud that the crimes committed against them are serious and the harms they suffer would be taken into account and addressed to the greatest degree possible.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638676" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the measures in the bill would do much to increase Canadians' confidence in the justice system.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638677" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak for a while about the restitution element of the bill. Restitution is defined as the return or restoration of some specific thing to its rightful owner. It is distinct from compensation which in the Canadian legal system is a scheme of payments managed and made by provincial or territorial governments to assist victims of crime. Restitution is the payment by the offender of an amount established by the court. The Criminal Code currently provides for restitution for criminal offences including: damages for the loss or destruction of property, bodily or psychological harm, bodily harm or threat to a spouse or child.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638678" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An order for restitution is made during the sentencing hearing of a convicted offender. It is part of the overall sentence provided to an offender as a stand-alone measure, or as part of a probation order or a conditional sentence.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638679" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restitution orders may be particularly appropriate in the case of fraud offences. In several recent high profile cases we hear from media accounts of thousands of dollars taken by offenders. These shocking cases of duplicity have deprived many innocent Canadians of hard-earned savings and in truly awful cases of retirement funds. It will be a decision in each trial as to whether restitution will be appropriate.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proposals provide that in the case of fraud the sentencing judge must consider an order of restitution as part of the overall sentence for the offender. The court shall inquire of the Crown if reasonable steps have been taken to provide victims with the opportunity to indicate whether they are seeking restitution. This step will ensure that sentencing cannot happen without victims having had the opportunity to speak to the Crown and establish their losses.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638681" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts have found that it is not possible to make an order when the amount is not readily ascertainable or when it is difficult to apportion the amount among several victims. To further assist victims our proposals include an optional form to assist victims in setting out their losses. The form identifies the victims, their losses and clarifies that the victims need to provide receipts, bills or estimates in order to assist the court in making the restitution order. In all cases these losses must be readily ascertainable.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638682" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put together, these proposals will increase the likelihood of orders of restitution being made. It is our hope that these proposals will increase the responsiveness of the legal system to victims of fraud.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would note that the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime recommended improvements to the restitution scheme in one of his first recommendations to the <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</a>.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning a member opposite asked what the government is doing to prevent offenders from committing further crimes.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address concerns about the potential for repeated behaviour, the bill includes a new sentencing measure which allows the sentencing court to order that a person convicted of fraud should be prohibited from having employment or engaging in volunteer activities that involve having authority over other people's money, real estate or other valuable securities. The court could prohibit the offender from engaging in such conduct for any length of time it considers appropriate, including any period during which the offender is serving a prison sentence. Breach of the prohibition order would be a separate offence.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By preventing the offender from having the opportunity to commit another fraud, the bill would help to minimize the further victimization of Canadians.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several prohibition orders already in the Criminal Code, such as the one which can be imposed on someone convicted of sexual offences against children, prohibiting them, among other things, from working in schools or other places where they would be in a position of trust or authority over young people.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident the measures in this bill will help send a strong message to the fraudsters out there that their time is up. I am also pleased that the bill can act as a springboard for discussion and raising awareness about fraud more generally. </div>

An unknown man entered the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce heavily armed and wearing a “dead man's switch”, a device utilizing a clothespin, wires, battery and dynamite, where the user holds the clothespin in the mouth, exerting force on the clothespin. Should the user release the clothespin, two wires attached to both sides of the pin complete an electrical circuit, sending current from the battery, detonating the explosives. After robbing the bank, the robber exited the CIBC, and was preparing to enter a city vehicle driven by undercover police officer Don Milliard. A sniper positioned across the street from the bank shot the Robber, initiating the sequence of events required to detonate the explosive. Recently, Kenora Police submitted DNA samples from the Robber's remains to identify him, but the suspect was never positively identified. </small></td>

People are taught to hate by some people. We need to do something about that.</div>

We are talking instead about all the activities that surround them. As soon as something is considered a terrorist activity, a serious of legal tools become available that can be used, for example, to get at the funding of the activity, the act of conspiring to commit these attacks, or encouraging someone to commit these attacks or failing to discourage them. A whole array of things can be done all around the possible perpetrators of suicide bombings, even though nothing can be done about the bombers themselves once they have carried out their attack. </div>

The second part of the definition includes terrorist activity which intentionally causes death or serious bodily harm or endangers a person's life.

</p><a name="Para1638853" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons that I support the bill is that Canada would actually become the first country that I know of to actually entrench such a bill into law. Many people would ask: What is the purpose behind the bill because it does not really mean anything? Is it more symbolic than anything concrete?</div>
</p><a name="Para1638854" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose one could argue that yes, that is quite conceivable because the bill basically, just with more certainty, speaks to the fact that anyone who either attempts a suicide bombing or is even successful should be considered a terrorist and that act an act of terrorism.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638855" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would say obviously that is an act of terrorism. Suicide bombings occur for a reason and that is because a terrorist, usually a terrorist cell, wants to create anarchy, fear and confusion in the civilized world and by the use of suicide bombings is able to create that level of uncertainty and fear. They are designed for that type of action and reaction.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638856" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, if a suicide bomber has been apprehended before he or she is able to complete the act, that person quite conceivably would be charged with attempting an act of terrorism, but the bill gives more certainty to that. I think from a symbolic standpoint it is extremely important because it allows our country to be the first country in the civilized world to say that we will not stand by and allow this type of action to take place without swift and severe retribution.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638857" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing that the bill also does, which I appreciate quite sincerely, is that it would allow posthumously, after a suicide bomber has completed the act, to go after the sponsors of that act for some form of restitution or retribution. Currently, that does not exist.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638858" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think the bill has important elements in it. It sends a very strong message to the rest of the free world, the democratic world, that this type of action, suicide bombings that are unfortunately so prevalent in the world today, should not be tolerated at any time and at any level.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last September, in his report “Raising our Game for Vancouver 2010: Towards a Canadian Model of Linguistic Duality in International Sport”, Commissioner of Official Languages Graham Fraser, pointed out, among other things, that ten or so federal institutions had dismal results in terms of the provision of services in French for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Vancouver.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see this pressure from the federal government for provinces to engage in the HST. When I raised this question on September 17, it was in the context of housing. A fellow by the name of Bill Tieleman in the province of British Columbia has been leading the anti-HST campaign. He said that when buying a brand new home, houses and apartments priced under $400,000 would get an HST rebate, but the problem with that is that 40% of all homes in British Columbia cost more than $400,000. He said not to forget real estate commissions. Those fees will go from 5% to 12% HST. With respect to condominiums, all building maintenance as well as property management firms will charge an extra 7% HST. We can see these direct impacts on people in British Columbia. </div>

According to a B.C. government document on transitional HST rules, if people want to beat the impending B.C. harmonized sales tax, they should pay for their funeral now, because it is one of the only things people will not be taxed an extra 7% on if the HST goes ahead on July 1, 2010. The B.C. government itself is suggesting that people prepay for their funerals so they will not have to pay HST once July 1, 2010 rolls around.</div>

As the member well knows, the sitting member for <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',128741,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=128741&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver South</a> and the sitting member for <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',128246,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=128246&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Toronto Centre</a>, former premiers of B.C. and Ontario respectively, have said in the past that the decision of whether or not to harmonize their provincial sales tax with the GST is the responsibility of provinces.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is well documented. I would point out that the premier of my home province of Saskatchewan, Mr. Brad Wall, has already stated that Saskatchewan does not intend to harmonize its provincial sales tax with the GST. In other words, it is strictly up to the province. Some provinces want to go down that road. They can see some advantages to harmonizing their sales tax provincially with the GST for business reasons and to attract business investment into the provinces.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638908" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premier Wall has stated that he does not want to harmonize Saskatchewan's sales tax with the GST because he feels that it might place too much of an added burned on the citizens. However, the decision is strictly that of the province, and the member well knows that.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the few moments I have left, I just want to point out that that is not the reason this member and other members of the NDP continually raise this issue. We all know that members of the NDP have never been known as tax cutters. In fact, they like to raise taxes because it is the tax-and-spend philosophy that they have always held.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason this member and her colleagues in the NDP are making the HST situation such an issue in the House is that there will be a federal byelection occurring very shortly in British Columbia. The member assumes, and perhaps she is correct, that this is a very hot-button issue with the residents of British Columbia.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638911" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By asking this and other questions during the regular question period on a day-to-day basis, she is trying to impress upon the residents of British Columbia that the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party are the ones who are trying to force this down the throats of consumers in British Columbia. By contrast, she is trying to portray her candidate in the federal byelection as the one who opposes the HST while the other main candidates do not.</div>
</p><a name="Para1638912" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the reason these questions are coming so frequently in the House. It is not because the NDP opposes harmonization. Given the opportunity, the NDP would raise taxes across the board in any environment and any jurisdiction. This member and her colleagues are raising this issue strictly for political reasons.</div>
