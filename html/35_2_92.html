	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a legal requirement that the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration rise in this House and 
table an annual plan on the immigration levels. This is a 
responsibility which I welcome this morning.
<P>
	The 1997 immigration plan is a tangible example of this 
government's pro-immigration philosophy. This government, and 
the Canadians that it serves, recognizes the importance of 
promoting immigration as an instrument of positive social and 
economic development. I would ask all the members of the House 
to not lose sight of what they represent when they look at the 
numbers I will be tabling today.
<P>
	Immigration policy is not about charts and graphs. Every 
number in every column represents a human being with dreams and 
fears and hopes. When you skim down the columns, think of the 
people in your neighbourhood. Your friends. Your colleagues. 
People in this House. Chances are they-or their parents or 
grandparents-were immigrants.
<P>
	We should never lose sight of the human face of immigration. 
Our government does not, and it is reflected in our policies. This is 
demonstrated in the 1997 plan I am tabling today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are clearly attracting the economic immigrants we need to 
strengthen our economy. We are also bringing in skilled workers to 
meet specific labour market needs. At the same time we remain 
committed to family reunification and the realization of Canada's 
humanitarian mission.
<P>
	Immigration is obviously a front and centre policy issue in this 
country. Immigration programs have a profound impact on all 
aspects of life in Canada. This is true now and it has been true for 
over 130 years.
<P>
	Even before Canada existed as a country, people recognized that 
immigration was the key to building the Canadian society. 
Unifying the British North American colonies was seen as a good 
way of attracting the farmers and labourers needed to kickstart the 
young economy.
<P>
	The visionaries who met in Charlottetown to create this country 
knew that immigration was the key to unlocking our potential. 
Immigration was a cornerstone of the national policy of Sir John A. 
Macdonald.
<P>
	Immigrants helped fuel the engine of Canadian growth. They 
worked in the factories of Toronto and Montreal; they tilled the 
land; they helped develop the Atlantic fisheries.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5770"> 5770 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	Laurier predicted that the 20th century would belong to Canada. 
He knew at that time that immigration would be a key to realizing 
this goal so he entrusted Sir Clifford Sifton to bring immigrants to 
open the west. Sifton did just that. Under his direction, waves of 
immigrants from across Europe made the leap of faith and came to 
this country. Their dreams and determination helped shape our 
destiny.
<P>
	More recently during the Pearson and Trudeau administrations, 
immigration was perceived as a way of not only strengthening our 
country economically, but also of bringing new ideas and new 
perspectives to Canada. Immigration policies in the 1960s and 
1970s helped shape Canada into the multicultural and multi-ethnic 
country we enjoy today.
<P>
	Immigration has served Canadians very well and it continues to 
do so. Immigration will be an important component in 
guaranteeing our future development.
<P>
	Our government is following a clear direction. Two years ago the 
Canadian government produced a 10-year strategic framework that 
committed us to building an immigration program that is fair, 
sustainable, affordable and based on partnerships. The 1997 
immigration plan represents our ongoing commitment to achieving 
those goals. That is why we have chosen to call the document 
``Staying the Course''.
<P>
	We have a very good plan which has set a reasoned path. In 1994 
we set a strategic course which we are following now. That is what 
good and responsible government is all about. As hon. members 
can see from the numbers, we are attaining the levels which were 
laid out last year. This means just over 200,000 people will come to 
this country in 1996.
<P>
	I would like to announce that the 1997 plan calls for the same 
level of immigration next year, between 195,000 and 220,000 
people. I cannot stress enough that this is not a quota. We do not set 
quotas in Canada. These numbers are targets. We do not and will 
not close the door on immigrants if we happen to hit the top level.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to announce that the 1997 plan calls for the same 
level of immigration next year: between 195,000 and 220,000, 
including 27,000 for the province of Quebec. But I cannot stress 
enough: this is not a quota. We do not set quotas in Canada.
<P>
	These numbers are targets. We do not-and will not-close the 
door on immigrants if we happen to hit the top level. These are not 
arbitrary numbers. They were developed in a fair and reasoned 
way, based on a variety of factors, such as Canada's needs, and our 
ability to integrate newcomers. The result is the numbers you see 
before you today.
<P>
	I draw your attention to our 1993 campaign promise laid out on 
page 87 of the Red Book: ``We need to target immigration levels of 
approximately 1 per cent of the population'', considering, ``our 
ability to absorb and settle immigrants''.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal government's 1997 immigration plan is in line with 
this commitment. I know that many of you might find it difficult to 
wade through the numbers and graphs in the document. Allow me 
to draw your attention to a few key points.
<P>
	In Citizenship and Immigration Canada's ten year strategy, we 
stated our intention to put a greater emphasis on attracting 
economic immigrants. This is a move which Canadians 
whole-heartedly endorse. We heard this time and time again during 
the nation wide consultations in 1994.
<P>
	Business professionals and skilled workers bring expertise and 
entrepreneurial strength which is important to our economy. They 
have the skills to integrate quickly and contribute to the 
community. They make a vital contribution to our standard of 
living and our lives.
<P>
	I think that the data and studies speak for themselves. Immigrant 
investors injected nearly $606 million in investment capital into 
our country last year. Current studies show that immigrants account 
for about half of Canada's labour force growth. This contribution is 
expected to increase as we move into the 21st century.
<P>
	We have all heard people say that immigrants take jobs away 
from Canadians. That is one myth that must be laid to rest. 
Evidence suggests the contrary. Immigrants create at least as many 
jobs as they take. Immigrants and newcomers also enhance 
Canada's ability to expand into global markets and to build trade 
links throughout the world.
<P>
	The value of these connections can be seen in the success of the 
Prime Minister's Team Canada missions. Many of the participants 
in these initiatives have been recent immigrants. Their connections 
and familiarity with international business practices have been 
invaluable. We are selecting the men and women who have the best 
potential to contribute to Canada's long term growth.
<P>
	I am happy to say that we are already seeing an increase in the 
numbers of immigrants to this country who come in under the 
economic designation. In fact, the number of economic immigrants 
exceeded our expectations. The 1997 plan anticipates that these 
levels will be maintained.
<P>
	But we are not just looking at the economic bottom line. 
Immigration is not-nor will it ever be-simply about dollars and 
cents with this government. There are other issues which must 
come into play. We are talking about future citizens of our 
country-not units on a balance sheet.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5771"> 5771 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We need to recognize the importance of factors such as family 
reunification when we address immigration policy. The bonds of 
family are very important to Canadians. The support and love 
which family members give is an essential part of life. I think that 
our commitment to family reunification speaks volumes about 
what kind of society we are. It shows what kind of heart and soul 
unite us together.
<P>
	I know that all Canadians can sympathize with the woman in 
Toronto who wants to be brought together with her husband in New 
Delhi. Or the son in Red Deer who wants to be joined by his father 
in Manila. That is why we offer priority processing to facilitate the 
reunion of Canadian families. We want to eliminate unnecessary 
anxiety.
<P>
	I know that many of you will look at the numbers and ask why 
there has been a gradual decline in the family class component. 
There are several factors that account for this, including the 
modification of the definition of family in our regulations in 1992 
and the somewhat tough economic times.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Whatever the reason for the declining numbers, I do not believe 
they are a cause for alarm. We should remember that family 
members accompanying independent immigrants are included in 
the economic category.
<P>
	I strongly believe that we need to keep our family class 
commitments in mind when drafting policies. For instance, as 
many will know, I am looking at various options to strengthen 
sponsorship regulations. Some people have asked why it seems to 
be taking so long. It is simple really. We want to get it right. The 
stakes are very high and we will not be rushed.
<P>
	We want to make sure that whatever regulations we develop will 
be fair and effective. I also want to make sure that they will not 
have an undue effect on numbers within the family class category. 
This is important to me personally and it is important to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to turn to another very important subject to 
Canadians, a subject that shows what kind of a country we are. I am 
speaking about our record in resettling refugees. We have always 
taken our international responsibilities very seriously. Canada 
prides itself on being a good citizen in the international 
community. Part of this is a commitment to respond to people in 
need.
<P>
	Since World War II this country has helped to resettle over 
700,000 refugees. We have provided a safe haven in a world of 
hunger, war and instability. I am proud of our accomplishments. I 
know Canadians are behind me when I say that we will continue to 
do what we can to offer a helping hand to those most in need.
<P>
	Right now the government is working closely with 
non-governmental organizations to develop strategies which will 
allow us to continue to meet our humanitarian commitments.
<P>
	For example, last year we responded to an urgent appeal from the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help resettle 
refugees from the former Yugoslavia. Canada committed to 
resettling a minimum of 500 refugees in this country. We 
developed the 3/9 project to do this, a partnership between the 
Canadian government and community groups. I am proud to say 
that at the conclusion of the program, Canada resettled over 1,000 
people. This is an example of what can be accomplished when we 
work together.
<P>
	I am happy to report that last year we met and even exceeded our 
refugee resettlement targets.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The document I am tabling today is a success story. It shows that 
we set goals and achieve them. As I have mentioned, we hit our 
global immigration targets.
<P>
	In 1996, slightly more than 200,000 people will choose Canada 
as their adoptive home. We believe that it will be the same for 
1997. We also achieved our refugee resettlement predictions. We 
are clearly continuing to move forward with a positive vision of 
immigration.
<P>
	In conclusion, Canada has a dynamic immigration program.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	This is crucial because immigration is going to become more and 
more important in the coming decades. Immigration has helped 
shape our past.
<P>
	We are what we are because of generations of immigrants. 
Immigration will continue to shape our destiny as we look to the 
21st century and beyond. That is why we must stay the course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened carefully to the speech by the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration. There is nothing new in what she says. The levels set 
by the government for 1997 are about the same as for this year.
<P>
	There are, however, a couple of changes. Economic immigrants 
take up far more of the total: 60 per cent of immigration. Canada 
will take in between 82,000 and 90,000 skilled workers and 
between 20,000 and 30,000 business persons. This, I feel, is a good 
decision, but one that was made at the expense of the family 
reunification program.
<P>
	The family reunification program, which involves spouses, 
fiancés, parents and grandparents, will account for only 35 per cent 
of immigration to Canada. Until the Liberals came into power, the 
family class and the economic class were almost equal. This is no 
longer the case. In all, there will be a total of between 168,900 and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5772"> 5772 </A></B>
<P>
187,700 new immigrants. With the refugees, that makes a total of 
between 195,000 and 220,000 newcomers to Canada in 1997.
<P>
	The minister does not, however, mention that some 80,000 
people leave Canada each year. The positive balance will, 
therefore, range between 115,000 and 140,000 new people in 
Canada.
<P>
	There is one other comment I would like to make. The 
government had created the category of provincial or territorial 
nominee. Last year, the objective for these persons to be nominated 
by the provinces or territories was set at 1,000. The number for 
next year will be the same. I have some questions, and the minister 
is not giving us any answers. Is this new category a failure? Are the 
provinces not interested in taking part in this program? The Bloc 
Quebecois believes that provinces ought to play a far greater role in 
immigration, a far more active role, because immigration is a 
jurisdiction shared between the federal and provincial 
governments.
<P>
	The minister does not indicate where these new immigrants will 
be coming from, either. As at present, two-thirds of the new 
immigrants will come from Asia, particularly Hong Kong, China, 
Taiwan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. The rest will come 
particularly from the former Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom, the 
United States and Pakistan.
<P>
	When I asked departmental employees this morning, they were 
unable to tell me how many new immigrants are expected from 
Latin America.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	There are no figures because the numbers have shrunk and are so 
small that Latin American countries do not rank among countries 
that provide high levels of immigration. In my opinion, Canada 
should make a special effort to attract more immigrants from Latin 
America, as we approach continental economic integration.
<P>
	NAFTA will be expanded to create a broad economic zone from 
Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, involving the mobility of capital, 
investment, services and goods. As far as mobility of individuals is 
concerned, however, problems on our own continent are increasing, 
and Canada is not very generous to Latin America as far as 
immigration is concerned.
<P>
	Africa has the same problem. Today, 42 per cent of the world's 
refugees come from Africa, this out of a total of 25 million. We see 
what is happening today in Africa, but the minister remains silent 
on these tragic events.
<P>
	However, I do want to point out that the Bloc Quebecois agrees 
in principle with the target figures proposed by the minister for 
1997, although the government is still far removed from the 
objective set in the red book, which proposed annual immigration 
levels equivalent to 1 per cent of the population of Canada.
<P>
	I am critical of the fact that the minister has considerably 
reduced the family component. There has been a major reduction in 
this class, which goes against the promises made by the Liberal 
Party in its red book, where family reunification was one of their 
priorities. That is not the case. I closely followed the proceedings 
of the convention of the Liberal Party of Canada on the weekend. 
They said their record was very positive: 78 per cent of their 
promises had been kept.
<P>
	The government's policy is a dismal failure as far as family 
reunification is concerned. Last year's target figures, which were 
much higher, were not met.
<P>
	Under the Conservative government, about 250,000 new 
immigrants were admitted to Canada annually, but this year, the 
real figure will be less than 200,000. It is expected that next year, 
the real figures will also be well below the target figures.
<P>
	The minister said in her speech, and I agree with her on this 
point, that we should never lose sight of the human aspect of 
immigration. However the immigration tax imposed by the federal 
government in the 1995 budget is certainly not indicative of a 
policy that is open and fair to all aspirant immigrants.
<P>
	The fact that each individual has to pay $975 to obtain 
permanent residence in Canada is a major hurdle for immigrants 
from developing countries. I realize that at this last convention 
some Liberals tabled a resolution to eliminate this tax. I also realize 
that some members, even Liberal members, as yet do not agree 
with this discriminatory tax, which goes against the government's 
family reunification program.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	This tax is even more irritating when applied to refugees. Even 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees expressed 
very serious reservations about this refugee tax. I think it goes 
against the spirit of the Geneva convention, which is aimed at 
protecting persecuted people, victims of conflicts, and so on.
<P>
	I must also point out that this tax is a significant source of 
revenue for the government, bringing in over $250 million a year. 
With the other fees immigrants must pay to have their files 
reviewed, obtain work permits, etc., the Department of Citizenship 
and Immigration's total revenues exceed $400 million a year, while 
its overall annual budget is only $600 million.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words on the issue of refugees and 
displaced persons. The situation is tragic. In addition to the 23 
million refugees I just referred to, there are over 100 million people 
displaced from one country to another or within their own countries 
as a result of wars, persecutions, natural disasters, racial or 
religious troubles, ethnic intolerance, political repression, poverty, 
and human rights violations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5773"> 5773 </A></B>
<P>
	I think that, without exceeding the general goals set by the 
minister today, we could make an additional effort for world 
refugees, especially women and children, who make up 80 per cent 
of all refugees and persecuted people.
<P>
	I was very affected by the horrific scenes in Zaire we recently 
saw on television. In the Goma region alone, 200,000 refugees 
have gathered in the past few days. With its 214,000 refugees, the 
new Mugumpa refugee camp is the biggest in the world.
<P>
	Again, as the Bloc Quebecois did yesterday, I call on the 
government to help these hundreds of thousands of sick people 
without drinking water or the basic means to survive.
<P>
	Even though the war in Bosnia is over, there is still a problem. 
Some people have returned to Bosnia, but the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees tells us it is still too early. Some are so 
traumatized by the war that they cannot return to Bosnia right 
away.
<P>
	There are problems in Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, the Sudan, 
etc. But it is mainly what is happening in Zaire that should concern 
the Canadian people. We must provide humanitarian assistance to 
the African continent. We need special programs to deal with the 
human tragedies facing Zaire and other African nations.
<P>
	Under the Canada-Quebec agreement, Quebec set its levels at 
27,000 new immigrants for the year 1997. I must point out that 
Quebec is the most generous province for refugees. In 1995 alone, 
Quebec welcomed 12,019 asylum seekers, compared to 11,546 for 
Ontario, the most populous province in Canada. Quebec welcomes 
47 per cent of refugee claimants, compared to 45 per cent only for 
Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	The minister makes no mention of it. In their recruiting 
campaign, Canada and the Canadian government should promote 
francophone immigration in Quebec. Quebec is the only 
French-speaking country, the only French-speaking nation, the 
only French-speaking state in America and, as such, it has to 
protect its French-speaking immigration. Quebec believes that it is 
enriched economically, socially and culturally through 
immigration.
<P>
	I would like to mention in passing a survey published today in <I>La 
Presse</I>, which indicates that the people of Quebec are quite open to 
immigration. A survey released yesterday by Quebec immigration 
minister André Boisclair shows that two Quebecers out of three are 
receptive to cultural diversity and pleased with the number of 
immigrants coming here every year.
<P>
	Quebecers are very tolerant, I have always said so, and they do 
not display any signs of xenophobia toward the minorities. This 
survey tells us that 67 per cent of Quebecers are receptive to 
cultural diversity; 56 per cent  believe that immigration promotes 
economic development; and 72 per cent regard immigrants as 
contributing to the province's cultural richness. Also, 64 per cent of 
Quebecers, or 11 per cent more than in 1992, believe that 
immigrants work hard to fit into Quebec society.
<P>
	Here is what this very serious survey conducted in April says. It 
shows how open Quebecers are, contrary to what some members 
have been saying, members of the Reform Party in particular and 
also members of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I agree, as I have just said, with the minister that the positive 
aspects of immigration should be emphasized. Immigrants make a 
substantial economic, cultural, social and political contribution. I 
notice that the minister did not address either, unfortunately, the 
hostility perceived today in Canadian society toward immigrants 
and more particularly refugees.
<P>
	Contrary to a certain statements, immigrants contribute more 
than they receive. They do not tend to use social services as much 
as people who were born in Canada. The crime rate is lower among 
them than among people of Canadian stock. This needs to be 
repeated in this House, and it is the minister's responsibility to 
educate the Canadian public on the enormous contribution made by 
immigrants and refugees as well, since most refugees are young 
and highly educated individuals fleeing persecution and looking for 
a better life for themselves, their families and their children. They 
come to Canada with all this energy they have. They are prepared 
to contribute to economic growth and to employment development.
<P>
	I will conclude with a few comments on the IRB. Time and time 
again the minister has said that the IRB is an independent tribunal, 
but in Bill C-49 before us, she is giving herself the power to 
remove the IRB chairperson at any time. Under the current 
legislation, the chairperson may be removed only after five years, 
coinciding with the end of his or her mandate. With this new 
legislation, she would be authorized to dismiss the chairperson 
after a year or two, then renew his or her mandate, chose someone 
else, and so on. For these reasons and others, the Bloc Quebecois is 
opposed to Bill C-49.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, almost a year ago the previous Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration rose in the House to announce the 
1996 immigration levels. At that time he painted a very rosy 
picture of Canada's immigration situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5774"> 5774 </A></B>
<P>
	This year the current minister paints a similarly rosy picture and 
says that this government will be staying the course. However, 
there are very serious problems with Canada's immigration 
system.
<P>
	The minister is aware of her own department's surveys which 
show that over 60 per cent of Canadians have little faith in this 
government's immigration policy. Why do Liberal immigration 
ministers stand in the House and tell the country how wonderful 
things are when they know that there are major problems with our 
immigration system?
<P>
	It is so typical of this government to put forth its don't worry, be 
happy philosophy instead of dealing with today's reality. The 
reality is our immigration system is in need of repair. The reality is 
that if Canadians are to regain their confidence and give their 
support to immigration, the government must act now to make the 
necessary changes.
<P>
	The first issue that needs to be addressed is the type of 
immigrants Canada is accepting. Last year the previous minister of 
immigration stated that he wanted to see the percentage of 
economic immigrants and their families increased to 50 per cent of 
the total. However, to be precise, we must remember that the 
principal immigrant, that is the individual who actually qualifies 
under the point system, made up only 37 per cent of the economic 
class. This year, while the number of economic immigrants is 
higher, the percentage of principals in that total has dropped to only 
25 per cent, which means that there are no more economic 
immigrants than there were two years ago. It is just that they are 
bringing more dependants with them.
<P>
	This still means that Canada chooses only about 14 per cent of 
the newcomers to this country each year. Or, to express it in other 
terms, when we include the dependants of economic immigrants 
with a family class immigrant that means that over 85 per cent of 
all immigrants to Canada are dependant immigrants.
<P>
	The ability of Canada to select immigrants based on their 
potential to contribute to our economy must increase beyond the 
current 14 per cent.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration has 
reviewed a number of studies that have shown that economic 
immigrants have had a positive economic benefit for Canada. The 
statistics are there. The average incomes of these immigrants are 
40 per cent higher than those of average Canadians.
<P>
	In addition, over the last 10 years the immigrant investor 
program has attracted more than 13,000 business people who have 
invested over $2.5 billion to the Canadian economy. These 
investments have created over 17,000 jobs. This is the positive side 
of immigration and must be promoted.
<P>
	However, there is a downside even to the economic immigrant 
portion of Canada's immigration plan. This  past January my 
community of Surrey was faced with a tragedy of one such investor 
immigrant who killed his mother, his wife and two of his three 
children before killing himself. It was later determined that this 
individual who committed the horrendous act was over $200 
million in debt in his native Taiwan. Despite the fact that this 
individual's financial woes were publicly known throughout 
Taiwan, he was able to immigrate to Canada on the basis of a 
$350,000 investment. Immigration officials apparently were 
unconcerned about the other financial situation.
<P>
	While this may be the most tragic example of the investor plan 
going astray, there are other cases that raise even greater concerns. 
On May 25, 1992 Canada admitted Lee Chau-Ping and her family 
as investor immigrants, as she was supposedly putting money into 
a fast food chicken franchise in northern Saskatchewan. In reality, 
Lee Chau-Ping never made it past Vancouver as she continued to 
run her other more lucrative business of trafficking in illicit drugs.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	Despite being under investigation by the royal Hong Kong police 
since 1986, Canadian immigration still accepted Lee as an investor 
immigrant. This case caused a Hong Kong crown prosecutor to 
make this statement: ``Canadian immigration is very much a 
laughing stock of criminals and Canada is being used by criminals 
such as drug traffickers as a soft spot for the entry of drugs into 
North America and as an exit point for the laundering of funds''.
<P>
	If there is one thing this government should be concerned about 
it is its investors program and the likelihood that it will be used as a 
money laundering scheme. It is a concern of academics who 
specialize in immigration matters and it is especially a concern for 
law enforcement officials.
<P>
	Earlier this year I had the opportunity to meet with members of 
the co-ordinated law enforcement unit in Vancouver. This unit 
contains members of the RCMP and other municipal police forces 
in the greater Vancouver area and specializes in organized crime.
<P>
	These members informed me that the investor immigrant 
program is an absolutely wonderful way for organized crime to 
launder money, for once these investors cash in their investment no 
bank in the world is going to question large deposits that came from 
the Canadian government. I hope that this government is not so 
desperate for money that it would close its eyes to funds earned by 
criminal activity.
<P>
	Notwithstanding these concerns, it is apparent that Canada has 
reaped the economic benefits from the independent class 
immigrant. Unfortunately, it has been equally apparent that when it 
comes to immigrants under the family class sponsorship 
breakdowns have caused Canadian taxpayers hundreds of millions 
of dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5775"> 5775 </A></B>
<P>
	Nobody argues with the validity of family class unification. It is 
a valid reason for immigration. But the underpinning basis of 
family reunification is that such immigration is not to have an 
adverse economic impact on the country. In cases of family 
reunification the sponsor makes a 10 year commitment to provide 
for the immigrant.
<P>
	In the past there did not seem to be any great effort to enforce 
these obligations. In 1993 a survey by the department found that 14 
per cent of sponsorships were in default, costing the taxpayers 
some $700 million in social services.
<P>
	This government likes to claim that it has made improvements in 
getting sponsors to honour their commitments. However, last year 
the previous minister made a big deal about setting higher financial 
requirements to ensure that sponsorships were honoured. And 
under this minister that announcement has gone where most 
Liberal promises have gone, absolutely nowhere, which means that 
this government will continue to ignore defaulted sponsorships.
<P>
	Most sponsors and family class immigrants are honest people, 
but there are some who abuse the system. My constituency office 
became aware of a situation where a woman was trying to sponsor 
her fourth immigrant husband in four years. It is situations like this 
that create a great deal of cynicism among the general public about 
the validity of family reunification programs. Is the program there 
to reunite loved ones or is it there for some Canadians to earn a 
quick buck by marrying foreigners so they can enter the country?
<P>
	Finally, we come to the area of refugees. This year the 
government is suggesting that Canada will accept between 26,000 
and 32,000 refugees. Canada has long had a reputation as being a 
compassionate country that accepts its fair share of refugees.
<P>
	The majority of Canadians have no problem with our accepting 
of genuine refugees who have been displaced from their homeland 
by war or other domestic disputes. However, the majority of 
Canadians also have a great deal of problems with a system that 
allows bogus refugees to remain in our country for years.
<P>
	The minister herself experienced some of these scams this past 
summer when she observed the process firsthand at some of our 
points of entry. The minister was surprised when the immigration 
officer had to admit the Ukrainian refugee claimant who stated that 
his claim was not based on a well founded fear of government 
persecution but rather on the fact that he was afraid of his 
neighbour. The minister then observed a Chilean refugee claimant 
who admitted that his claim was based on the fact that he could not 
find work in his native Chile.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	If this is the type of criteria that refugee claims are being based 
on, then Canada itself is home to millions of potential refugees.
<P>
	It is precisely these types of ridiculous claims that have brought 
the whole refugee process into disrepute. We now have the trend 
where people come to Canada, claim refugee status here and then 
get smuggled into the United States.
<P>
	We are being viewed around the world as a consolation prize by 
people smugglers. They might not get their clients into the United 
States but, at worst, their clients will be accepted in Canada. That is 
the problem with our refugee system. It rewards dishonesty and 
criminality.
<P>
	Last April a Hong Kong man was stopped at the Vancouver 
international airport and was found to be carrying four additional 
passports to his own. Sure enough, the other individuals from the 
same flight were claiming refugee status at the same time. These 
four claimants paid the agent thousands of dollars to get to 
Vancouver. The presence of these four refugee claimants in 
Vancouver is going to cost the Canadian taxpayer thousands of 
dollars.
<P>
	When we finally catch one of these people smugglers red 
handed, what do they get? One day in jail as a sentence. Won't that 
teach these people smugglers not to mess around with Canada? 
These guys must be laughing all the way to the bank.
<P>
	As bad as the situation was, there are even worse things that take 
place. In July Dennis Garcia escaped from a Montana prison where 
he was serving a 20 year sentence for viciously assaulting a female 
store owner. The judge who sentenced Garcia also designated him 
to be a dangerous offender. When Garcia was arrested near the 
border of British Columbia, everyone should have been happy that 
this dangerous individual had finally been captured.
<P>
	Unfortunately, that is not the way things work with the 
government refugee program. Instead of being immediately 
returned to the United States to finish his sentence, Garcia was sent 
to Vancouver and brought before an immigration adjudicator. 
Garcia claimed refugee status and, lo and behold, he was released 
pending his hearing; that is right, an escaped dangerous offender 
was released because he claimed refugee status.
<P>
	Did Garcia show up for his hearing? Of course not. He is an 
escaped fugitive. Garcia is dangerous but not stupid. That is a label 
that is reserved for our refugee laws that allow such a travesty to 
happen.
<P>
	As long as this government allows cases like Garcia to occur, the 
Canadian public will have little faith in our refugee program, much 
to the detriment of those genuine refugees who truly deserve our 
protection.
<P>
	This country was built on immigration, which makes it all the 
more ironic that so many Canadians have so little faith in today's 
system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5776"> 5776 </A></B>
<P>
	The system needs to be made fairer. Perhaps the minister could 
start this fairness by renegotiating the Canada-Quebec accord. This 
accord gives Quebec a flat rate of $90 million a year for settlement 
funds. That is approximately one-third of the total amount that the 
federal government spends. Is Quebec receiving a third of the 
immigrants to Canada? Actually, the number of immigrants that 
Quebec is receiving continues to drop.
<P>
	When the accord was first signed in 1991, Quebec received 22 
per cent of all immigrants to Canada. Last year that figure dropped 
to 13 per cent and this year Quebec, which gets to set its own 
numbers, will be taking in almost 10 per cent fewer immigrants. 
Even those numbers are deceptive. By the Quebec government's 
own numbers, between 70 and 80 per cent of investor immigrants 
to that province have left Quebec for other destinations in Canada.
<P>
	Yet despite these numbers, Quebec continues to receive over 33 
per cent of the settlement funds, which means that the two 
provinces that receive the bulk of Canadian immigrants, Ontario 
and British Columbia, receive a significantly smaller amount for 
each newcomer they accept.
<P>
	The current system is not fair and must be amended so that this 
government funds every immigrant and refugee at the same rate no 
matter what province they settle in. That is what Canadians are 
looking for in our immigration system: fairness. They want a 
system where everyone is treated in a fair and honest manner as 
quickly as possible. They want a system where dishonesty and 
criminality are not rewarded. Once the Canadian government can 
accomplish these goals, I am sure that Canadians will once again 
have confidence in our immigration system and will support it.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-35, in Clause 1, be amended by replacing line 12 on page 1 with the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``employee is usually employed or, if the employee works in more than one 
province, the minimum hourly rate of the province that is highest, and that is''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in today's 
debate, at report stage of Bill C-35, which, for all intents and 
purposes, eliminates the federal minimum wage, aligning it with 
the minimum wages established by the provinces.
<P>
	We supported Bill C-35 with the feeling that we had to do our 
work as the official opposition and help improve this legislation. 
This is why we proposed an amendment. Let me elaborate.
<P>
	As you know, the federal minimum wage was set at $4 in 1986 
and has not been reviewed since. The situation was a bit 
paradoxical: in a given territory, there could be two categories of 
workers. Indeed, workers doing the same job in the same company 
were not necessarily paid the same salary.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Three main considerations must be kept in mind when we deal 
with minimum wage. First, those affected are often part-time 
workers, employees whose jobs are precarious, and people who 
live below the poverty line, or just at that level. In this regard, the 
government should have introduced, along with the minimum wage 
review, a bill that would have truly targeted the causes of poverty.
<P>
	We can never say it too often: the issue of minimum wage should 
remind parliamentarians that, in Canada, one person in six 
currently lives below the established poverty levels. This 
proportion increases in the case of certain groups, particularly 
single parents.
<P>
	What does being poor mean in today's Quebec and Canadian 
society? We know what it means. It is not a reality that escapes us. 
We know precisely what it means. From a statistical point of view, 
a person is considered to be poor when he or she must spend more 
than 56 per cent of his or her salary on housing, food and clothes.
<P>
	It would have been a good thing for the government to deal with 
this issue. It is hard to square the minimum wage bill with 
something like the Employment Insurance Act, which is a factor in 
poverty, because we know for a fact that only 38 per cent of the 
labour force will qualify under that legislation.
<P>
	The amendment we are presenting today introduces a mobility 
provision whereby a worker employed by a company operating 
interprovincially, or conducting business in two or more provinces, 
will receive the minimum wage that is most to his advantage. It is a 
cause for some concern that the government did not think of this.
<P>
	When the minister appeared before the committee, we pointed 
out to him that the situation was, of course, clear when a worker 
was employed by Ontario. When he works in an area coming under 
federal jurisdiction but the head office of the company or the place 
where he works is in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba or Prince 
Edward Island, understandably everything is crystal clear, and he is 
paid the minimum wage in effect in that province.
<P>
	But what will happen when this same worker is required to work 
in one or more provinces, when there is no set place of work? Such 
a situation can arise. With the advent of telework, the whole 
question of interprovincial mobility and, of course, interprovincial 
transport, this is more than just an isolated case. Had the official 
opposition not been vigilant, there would have been an omission in 
the act that must most definitely be corrected today.
<P>
	I would remind members that the intention of the amendment is 
to have the legislation spell out very clearly that, when a worker is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5778"> 5778 </A></B>
<P>
called upon to provide services or work in more than one place 
within the  Canadian common market, he will be paid the highest 
rate.
<P>
	You know how widely the minimum wage varies in Canada. It 
ranges from $5 in certain provinces to $7 in British Columbia, the 
most generous province in this connection and undoubtedly the one 
with the most favourable financial situation.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize, for the benefit of viewers, just how 
much the situation varies. This must be borne in mind. We are 
certainly not talking about a uniform situation where the minimum 
wage is concerned.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	I will give the example of Alberta, where the minimum wage is 
$5. In British Columbia, it is $7; in Prince Edward Island it will be 
raised to $5.40; in Manitoba it is $5.40; in New Brunswick, $5.50; 
in Nova Scotia, $5.35; in Ontario, $6.85; in Quebec, $6.70; in 
Saskatchewan, $5.35; in Newfoundland, $5.25; in the Northwest 
Territories, $7; and in the Yukon, $6.86.
<P>
	It could, therefore, be a great temptation for a employer with 
interprovincial mobility to decide that the place of employment of 
a given worker is a specific province. If a worker works in three or 
four provinces, for example, the employer could have his choice of 
province. He could say: ``I consider that the place of work to which 
the worker is attached is the province with the lowest minimum 
wage.'' This is a trap which must be avoided for, as we have seen, 
there is a disparity between provincial wage levels.
<P>
	When speaking of minimum wage, we must keep in mind that 
often non-unionized workers are involved, people who lack the 
protection of a large union to which they pay dues, which looks 
after the rights of workers, which is certainly not the case for 
minimum wage earners.
<P>
	Generally speaking, this minimum wage covers 10 per cent of 
people in the work force. Ten per cent of workers therefore come 
under federal jurisdiction. Obviously, therefore, the bulk of 
workers are in areas where legislation other than that of the federal 
government applies. Nevertheless, 10 per cent of the work force is 
involved in the sectors of transportation, banking and 
communications particularly, but not exclusively, affected by Bill 
C-35. Of that 10 per cent, a very large majority, which the minister 
estimates at 60 per cent, are not protected by a union and work at 
minimum wage.
<P>
	It is, therefore, important to ensure that, if the government were 
preparing to defeat the official opposition amendment to Bill 
C-35-which I doubt, since I believe the parliamentary secretary is 
nodding that he will support the amendment by the official 
opposition-but at any rate, if the government were preparing to 
defeat the opposition amendment, well, then we would find 
ourselves in a legal vacuum. In the case of workers with several 
different places of work, working in more than one province, 
workers having to move about within the broad Canadian common 
market, it could be extremely tempting for the employer to make a 
decision that would not be to their advantage, choosing to attach 
them to the place of work where the minimum wage was lowest, to 
the workers' disadvantage.
<P>
	I will close my remarks by saying that, today, we are just 
beginning the process. Bill C-35 is the first indication that the 
government intends to review part I of the Canada Labour Code, as 
the hon. member for Québec is well aware-and I know she is very 
concerned about the plight of workers today. Parts II and III will 
also be reviewed.
<P>
	This review process has given rise to considerable debate on, for 
instance, the possible unionization of the RCMP and the issue of 
replacement workers. In report after report, year after year, the 
government has been urged to bring peace to the workplace and 
introduce anti-scab legislation that make the use of replacement 
workers an unfair practice and as such subject to sanctions by the 
Canada Labour Board. I know that the hon. member for Bourassa, a 
long-standing member of the labour movement, has some very 
specific proposals in mind.
<P>
	So as part of this review process, it will be very important to 
ensure, of course, that the Canada Labour Code is the locus for 
establishing a certain balance of forces, where the legislation 
defines a number of positions to be used in dealing with future 
labour disputes. But I think it is also important to ensure, in 1996 
and in the years to come, that the Canada Labour Code is also a 
weapon against poverty. Why not consider including provisions in 
the Canada Labour Code that would set limits on working hours 
and overtime?
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The minister told me he was regularly asked to authorize 
overtime in the private sector because a federal provision says that 
the minister's authorization is required for work in excess of the 
statutory number of hours. I think, at a time when one Canadian out 
of six lives in poverty, in other words, 2.8 million Canadians in all 
Canadian provinces, that we should ensure that the Canada Labour 
Code is also a weapon against poverty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have listened to the concerns of 
my fellow members with regard to the wording of the amendment 
and we have given the matter very careful study.
<P>
	The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and the 
opposition were originally concerned to clarify that employees who 
perform work in more than one province be paid the rate of the 
province in which they are employed. They were concerned over 
any loophole which would permit a lower rate than that of the 
employee's province of employment. Now the hon. member is 
proposing an amendment that is somewhat different. It is proposed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5779"> 5779 </A></B>
<P>
that where an employee performs work in several provinces, the 
minimum wage would be that of the province with the highest rate.
<P>
	While I appreciate my colleague's concern for clarity to protect 
the worker, I believe that the solution will create more problems 
than it will solve.
<P>
	The proposal would be cumbersome to administer. Even one trip 
across a provincial border could alter a truck driver's hourly rate. 
What would be the justification for this approach? Surely we would 
want to establish labour standards that reflect the conditions in the 
local area.
<P>
	The whole approach of this bill has been to align the federal 
minimum wage with regional economies. Why would the 
government impose the rate designed for one region on an 
enterprise within another? Furthermore, in the case of an employee 
who makes infrequent trips outside the province, it is unclear how 
long the higher rate would apply. Would it apply for a day, a week 
or a month?
<P>
	The amendment would impose unnecessary rigidities on an 
employer who might have to refuse small amounts of business in 
another province. Surely we do not wish to place additional 
complexities and paperwork on businesses, and small businesses in 
particular.
<P>
	The amendment would create inequities within an enterprise. 
For example, two employees travel the same distance but one 
travels across a provincial border while the other is going in 
another direction and does not cross that provincial border. Under 
this proposal the two drivers would not be entitled to the same 
rates.
<P>
	Most important, the amendment is unnecessary. Our legal 
advisors do not see any difficulties with the present French and 
English texts of the bill. The current wording refers to more than 
one province where an employee works. It relates to the overall 
employment relationship which includes the province where the 
employee reports to work, where he or she picks up equipment and 
tools, is supervised by his or her employer and where, for example, 
the provincial worker compensation laws apply.
<P>
	Similarly, the term usually or habituellement relates to where the 
relationship customarily takes place or commonly occurs, rather 
than simply the notion of time. When this was raised in the 
committee, the minister explained that in the case of a truck driver 
who drives across a provincial border the rate of the province in 
which the employee's home terminal was situated would be used in 
applying the law.
<P>
	Very few workers are paid the federal minimum wage. About 2 
per cent of workers come under the jurisdiction of the federal act 
and even fewer in the kind of employment that would take them 
outside the province. Since the minimum wage order came into 
effect on July 17, 1996 establishing the rates current in the 
provinces at that time, there have been no problems or complaints 
on the issue of concern to my hon. colleague.
<P>
	Given the problems with the amendment proposed and the 
assurance of the Department of Justice that the existing bill is 
enforceable, I cannot support the Bloc's amendment and ask 
members to pass the bill as it stands.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose of Bill C-35 
is to align federal minimum wage rates with the general minimum 
wage rates established by the provinces. The involvement of the 
federal government in setting minimum wages is only about 30 
years old.
<P>
	In 1935 Canada ratified an ILO Minimum Wage Fixing 
Machinery Convention which had actually been introduced in 
1928. It specified that workers would be guaranteed a minimum 
wage mainly in cases where wages were exceptionally low. 
However, it was 1965 before Canada actually began setting 
minimum wage rates. The Canada Labour Code covered less than a 
million workers so the government of the day did not feel pressured 
to establish a federal rule.
<P>
	Between 1965 and 1986 there were sporadic changes in the 
federal minimum wage rate but 10 years ago only one-tenth of 1 
per cent, or 7,000 workers under federal jurisdiction were directly 
affected. While updated estimates are not available from 
department officials, there is a presumption on our part that very 
little may have changed.
<P>
	The big changes for Canadian workers over the last 30 years 
have been the diminished opportunities and lack of security which 
they now endure. Today one in every four Canadians is afraid of 
losing his or her job.
<P>
	If the government was really concerned about workers and their 
wages it would not be sidestepping the real issue. It would be 
lowering the payroll taxes that kill jobs. At a time when 1.4 million 
Canadians are unemployed, about 2.3 million Canadians are 
underemployed and 500,000 Canadians have given up looking for a 
job, the best the government can come up with is a plan to realign 
minimum wage rates with the provinces. This is not even a decent 
band-aid.
<P>
	If the government was really concerned about helping workers 
make ends meet it would be launching a plan, like the Reform 
Party's fresh start proposal, that would give workers much needed 
tax relief. Canadian workers deserve a tax break because they are 
working harder for less money.
<P>
	The Fraser Institute estimates that the average worker's income 
has decreased by over $3,000 since the government was elected 
three years ago. Why are Canadians taking home less money? The 
government wants to lay the blame by pointing a finger at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5780"> 5780 </A></B>
<P>
employers. However, the real culprit is the ever increasing tax 
burden.
<P>
	In 1996 the average family pays a staggering 46 per cent of its 
income in taxes. Twenty-five years ago, when one income families 
were the norm, families could pay their way and even prosper. 
Today it takes two incomes just to scrape by. One partner works 
just to pay the taxes for the household.
<P>
	If the government was really concerned about Canadian 
workers' wages it would get its greedy hands at least part way out 
of the workers' pockets. If the government was really interested in 
helping workers it would streamline its operations and relinquish 
jurisdiction to the provinces in those areas that the provinces are 
best equipped to manage.
<P>
	Take Bill C-35, for instance. On one hand the government is 
saying that it trusts the provinces to set realistic and fair minimum 
wage rates. However, on the other hand it is saying that it does not 
trust future provincial legislatures to set realistic and fair minimum 
wage rates so it will retain the right to set its rates whenever it sees 
fit. The provinces have already proven that they are better fiscal 
managers than their federal counterparts. What governments in this 
country have succeeded in balancing their budgets? Provincial 
governments.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Now is the time for the federal government to show that it is 
serious about streamlining and delegating more power to the 
provinces. Instead of retaining the right to set the rate, the 
government should seize this opportunity to enter into agreements 
with its provincial counterparts to give them sole discretion over 
the setting of rates. The agreements could feature clauses 
stipulating that each province and territory retain a minimum wage 
rate. It would be obligatory. That would protect Canada's 
international commitments and the free trade agreement.
<P>
	The provisions of Bill C-35 have actually been in effect since 
July 1996. This is not a concern for Reformers since the overall 
intent of the bill is positive. However, there is still time to improve 
the bill.
<P>
	Section 178(3) gives the governor in council the option of 
``replacing the minimum hourly rate that has been fixed with 
respect to employment in a province with another rate, or fix a 
minimum hourly rate with respect to the employment in a province 
if no such hourly rate has been fixed''.
<P>
	An amendment has been tabled calling for the deletion of section 
178(3). If the government adopts this amendment the bill will 
receive our support, although with certain reservations. The 
amendment moved by the member for Edmonton Southwest, 
seconded by me, is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-35 in clause 1 be amended by deleting lines 1 to 8 on page 2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in this House to debate Bill C-35 at report stage. This bill 
tabled on May 9, 1996, is to align the federal minimum wage rate 
with the general minimum wage rates established from time to time 
by the provinces and the territories. Let me say right off the bat that 
I support the amendment put forward by my colleague, the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	This is a subject in which I have a great interest. As a previous 
speaker indicated, I was involved in the Quebec labour movement 
for a long time and, at every convention of the Fédération des 
travailleurs du Québec or of the Congrès du travail du Canada, 
resolutions were passed requesting that the federal and provincial 
governments raise the minimum wage, which is consistently too 
low.
<P>
	I have often criticized the federal government, arguing that, in its 
capacity, it should be an example to the provinces in the area of 
labour law in Canada. As a member of the International Labour 
Organization, the federal government is the one that signs 
international conventions respecting minimum wage and other 
principles important to the workers.
<P>
	Like the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, I think that 
the best way for low-wage workers to improve their conditions is to 
unionize. The unions can do something to improve the plight of 
these workers. Those who earn minimum wage are not even 
entitled to social benefits. I think that raising the minimum wage is 
a great way of fighting poverty.
<P>
	Under Bill C-35, the rate paid to any particular employee is that 
of the employee's province or territory of employment. The 
Governor in Council retains the authority to establish a minimum 
wage rate that can apply to employees on a provincial or territorial 
basis and that differs from the rate set by a province or territory.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	This bill is important to the official opposition, and it is in our 
best interest to support it. Of course, once this legislation is 
completed by the antiscab bill I tabled in this House last week and 
the other necessary amendments to the Canada Labour Code, we 
can then state loud and clear that the Canada Labour Code is in line 
with reality at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 
21st. Make no mistake about it, the Canada Labour Code still has 
some major flaws.
<P>
	I support this bill, which-it is important to emphasize 
this-concerns more specifically the most vulnerable in our 
society. For example, workers who are not covered by a collective 
agreement or who hold precarious, often part time jobs, 
increasingly concentrated in industrial and economic sectors that 
are sensitive to fluctuations, the soft sectors in the economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5781"> 5781 </A></B>
<P>
	Two thirds of minimum wage workers are women. Many are 
immigrants and young people. Of course, the harmonization of the 
minimum wage based on the rate in effect in the province or 
territory should be hailed. In fact, the Government of Canada has 
not raised its ridiculous $4 hourly rate since 1986. This rate is so 
out of step with today's cost of living, it seems like an 
anachronism. There was an urgent need to raise it as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	It is interesting to compare this $4 hourly rate with the rate in 
effect in the Canadian provinces, which average around $5.60. In 
Ontario, the minimum wage rate is $6.85, while Quebec raised its 
rate to $6.70 on October 1. I must point out that this increase is due 
in part to the women who, in May 1995, participated in the ``bread 
and roses march'' from Montreal to Quebec City.
<P>
	In the Prairies, the minimum wage rate hovers around $5 an 
hour: it is $5.35 in Saskatchewan, $5.40 in Manitoba, $5 in Alberta. 
I do not understand how a province as rich as Alberta can have such 
a low minimum rate. The minimum wage in British Columbia and 
the Northwest Territories is $7 an hour, compared to $6.86 in 
Yukon. It is $4.75 in Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, 
$5.50 in New Brunswick, and $5.35 in Nova Scotia.
<P>
	As I said before, it is quite clear that raising the minimum wage 
is an important tool in the fight against poverty. Such a policy 
makes the economy of a country or a province more dynamic, in 
that it helps reduce the underground economy, while stimulating 
the consumption of goods and services.
<P>
	Also, in the case of a welfare recipient, working outside the 
family home becomes more interesting when the minimum salary 
is more decent and in line with the costs involved. It is important to 
remember that, over the years, the gap between minimum wage and 
the poverty line has decreased.
<P>
	It would have been a good thing to table this bill and to announce 
at the same time the implementation of a true policy to fight 
poverty in Canada and in Quebec. One Canadian in six currently 
lives in poverty. The proportion is even greater in the case of 
women, children, immigrants and young people.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Canada's population is increasingly poor. I am not the only one 
to say so and to deplore this fact. The loss of jobs and the cuts in the 
federal public service payroll and in social programs are meant to 
help reduce the public debt, but they do little to put a stop to the 
impoverishment of our society.
<P>
	Moreover, this situation does not only affect the poor, but also 
social classes which were thought to be immune from a 
deterioration of their quality of life.
<P>
	This is why I can only support whatever attempt this government 
makes to help protect the interests of Canadian and Quebec 
workers. The federal government should show the way regarding 
minimum wage and everything that relates to labour law. 
Unfortunately, it is not the case.
<P>
	Still, the proposed legislation is a step in the right direction. This 
is why I support Bill C-35.

	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (for Minister of Industry, Minister for 
the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of 
Western Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for 
the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-57, an act to amend the Bell Canada Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the legislation before the House to repeal 
section 7 of the Bell Canada Act is an important step in the federal 
government's efforts to help Canadian industry compete, innovate 
and grow in the information economy.
<P>
	It follows through on commitments we have made to promote 
and facilitate the development of the Canadian information 
highway as a foundation for long term economic growth and job 
creation.
<P>
	We are now three-quarters through the government's mandate 
and the foundations for the jobs and growth  agenda are firmly in 
place. Deficit reduction targets have been met and exceeded. 
Inflation is at its lowest level in 30 years. Statistics Canada reports 
that the number of persons employed was up 82,000 in August, 
bringing year to date gains to 153,000 in full time employment.
<P>
	Building on these accomplishments, the government has 
highlighted three elements that form the core of the current phase 
of the jobs and growth agenda: youth, technology and trade. At the 
heart of the jobs and growth agenda is the information highway 
which advances all three of these priorities.
<P>
	In 1994 the government announced its vision for the Canadian 
information highway as an integral part of that agenda. The 
government's strategy envisages a low cost, high quality 
information infrastructure that gives all Canadians access to 
employment, educational, health care, entertainment, investment 
and wealth creating opportunities of the information age. We have 
a coherent government-wide program for the information highway 
and we have been steadily putting these elements in place.
<P>
	In 1994 we set up the information highway advisory council to 
examine key public policy issues related to Canada's transition to 
an information society and knowledge economy. Also in 1994 the 
federal government released an order in council outlining its policy 
on convergence, the merging of formally distinct technologies, 
industries and activities such as cable and telecommunications 
technologies. This policy focused on three broad areas: network 
facilities, Canadian content and competition in facilities, and 
products and services.
<P>
	The government asked the CRTC to hold public hearings on how 
best to implement these policies. The commission received more 
than 1,000 written submissions and heard 78 oral presentations. 
The CRTC's report ``Competition and Culture on Canada's 
Information Highway: Managing the Realities of Transition'' was 
referred to the information highway council for its review.
<P>
	The information highway council's final report, released in 
September 1995, made more than 300 recommendations. On the 
issues of convergence both the CRTC and the council supported the 
move toward greater competition. Both also supported policies and 
regulations that will allow cable companies to compete in the local 
switch telephone market and telephone companies to compete in 
the broadcasting distribution market.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Along with the CRTC report, the council's report provided 
valuable guidance to the government in formulating its 
comprehensive plan which was published last May as ``Building 
the Information Society: Moving Canada into the 21st Century''. In 
this report the Minister of Industry and other key federal ministers 
set  out a series of initiatives and milestones for developing 
Canada's infor-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5783"> 5783 </A></B>
<P>
mation highway. Included among these initiatives was the 
government's policy on convergence.
<P>
	Canadians now get a range of broadcasting and 
telecommunications services from their local telephone and cable 
television distribution networks. Recent breakthroughs in 
technology mean that each will soon be able to compete with the 
other in offering a full range of services.
<P>
	Soon, a range of industries, including telecommunications, cable 
television, publishing and entertainment, will be able to offer 
packages of services either in co-operation or in competition with 
each other. Convergence will change these industries dramatically 
and will bring businesses and consumers an array of new products 
and services. It will change the way we work, communicate and 
entertain ourselves.
<P>
	On August 6 of this year, the government issued the final text of 
its convergence policy opening the way for fair and sustainable 
competition between cable and telephone companies. The policy 
statement and implementation principles cover three major areas: 
facilities, content, and competition. They clear the way for cable 
and telephone companies to compete in each other's core 
businesses and further advance a series of initiatives aimed at 
introducing competition to the communications industry.
<P>
	The policy will allow for fair and sustainable competition 
between cable and telephone companies. Telephone companies 
may offer broadcasting services once the regulatory framework and 
tariffs for competition in local telephone services are in place. 
Competition could begin as early as the end of 1997.
<P>
	The policy statement is an important step toward fulfilling the 
government's commitment to ensure that Canadians can participate 
fully in the information society. It brings to a close a long process 
of public consultation and studies. The goal has been to create the 
conditions needed for fair and sustainable competition, expanded 
consumer choice and continued support for Canadian culture.
<P>
	The policy is intended to guide the CRTC as it establishes rules 
and regulations for broadcasting and telecommunications in the 
convergence era. It will also provide greater clarity and confidence 
for broadcasting and telecommunications firms as they enter each 
other's traditional markets.
<P>
	The policy statement included a commitment to amend the Bell 
Canada Act so as to remove the prohibition on Bell Canada and its 
subsidiaries from holding broadcasting licences. The bill we are 
discussing today will implement that policy by repealing section 7 
of the Bell Canada Act.
<P>
	Section 7 was put in place in 1968 to prohibit Bell from holding 
a broadcasting licence. At the time there  was a real concern that 
keeping Bell out of broadcasting and especially cable TV was 
necessary to prevent Bell from dominating the delivery of 
broadcasting services and give the fledgling cable industry a 
chance to develop. However, during the years since, these concerns 
have been overtaken by a number of technological and market 
developments which are leading to the convergence of the 
telephone and cable industries.
<P>
	I would like to point out here that the convergence policy 
framework will create more choices for consumers and ensure that 
Canadian content remains prominent on their screens. While new 
technologies allow telecommunications and broadcasting 
companies to offer similar services, the distinction between 
telecommunications and broadcasting will remain and will 
continue to be guided by distinct regulatory systems.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	For example, when a telecommunications company provides 
broadcasting services, those services will fall under the 
Broadcasting Act. Conversely, when a cable company provides 
telecommunications services, those services will be subject to the 
Telecommunications Act.
<P>
	Finally, the telecommunications and broadcasting industries are 
supportive of the government's goal to foster competition in all 
matters on the information highway. The Stentor companies, 
including Bell Canada, have made a commitment to make 
significant contributions to the Canadian broadcasting system.
<P>
	Bell Canada is anxious to move ahead with its plans to invest in 
the Canadian information highway. By amending the Bell Canada 
Act now, the company can plan for the future with a greater degree 
of certainty. We cannot afford to delay.
<P>
	The Clinton administration in the U.S. has launched its national 
information infrastructure initiative. The European Union has a 
budget of $3.8 billion U.S. to support the development of a new 
information infrastructure. In Japan, NTT has plans to wire every 
school, home and office with fibre optic cables by the year 2015.
<P>
	If we do not match the efforts of our competitors, they will seize 
the opportunities for network, product and service development. 
Failure to build our own information highway will lead to reduced 
competitiveness and a loss of high growth knowledge industries 
and high quality jobs.
<P>
	We will also miss the benefits of the so-called enabling effect 
cited in the 1992 report of the Information Technology Association 
of Canada. The report found that the effective implementation of 
technology not only enabled cost reductions and quality 
enhancement but also over time led to new products and services to 
better strategic management and eventually to new ways of doing 
business and meeting customer needs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5784"> 5784 </A></B>
<P>
	Telecommunications is a pivotal enabling technology and 
increasingly an integral part of all types of businesses and public 
sector agencies. Given our many accomplishments in information 
and communications technologies, the convergence of cable and 
telephone services offer Canadians many opportunities.
<P>
	Technologies at which Canadians excel are already creating 
whole new industries. Knowledge based industries are growing 
faster than any other sector of the Canadian economy. As one of the 
most wired countries in the world, Canada has the communications 
and network infrastructure necessary to take full advantage of 
information technologies such as electronic commerce.
<P>
	Technology has already eliminated many of the barriers to 
convergence. We can help to eliminate the legislative barriers by 
passing the bill before us. As the Minister of Industry has said, the 
role of government is not simply to reduce the deficit and then get 
out of the way. It would be foolish to think that people, businesses 
or entire industries will be able to take up the challenge of the 
information revolution without government involvement.
<P>
	Passing the current bill is a necessary step. But once we have 
established the policy framework and removed legislative and 
other barriers to competition, it will be up to industry to make the 
necessary investment and seize the opportunities to provide the 
services that consumers want.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-57 
contains only one clause. The bill's purpose is quite simple: it 
repeals section 7 of the Bell Canada Act, which currently prohibits 
Bell Canada and any person controlled by Bell Canada from 
directly or indirectly holding a broadcasting licence or operating a 
broadcasting undertaking.
<P>
	In tabling this bill, the Minister of Industry is following up on a 
recommendation made by the CRTC in its document on the 
information highway entitled <I>Competition and Culture on 
Canada's Information Highway: Managing the Realities of 
Transition</I>. In this document, made public on May 19, 1995, the 
CRTC wrote, on page 25, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bell Canada is currently prohibited from holding a broadcasting licence pursuant 
to the Bell Canada Act. Given the Commission's view that Canadian telephone 
companies have the potential to contribute to the objectives of the Broadcasting Act, 
and that they should be allowed to do so, the Commission recommends that the 
Government amend the Bell Canada Act to permit Bell Canada to hold broadcasting 
licences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Last August 6, when the Minister of Industry made public his 
policy on convergence, he announced that this bill would soon be 
tabled.
<P>
	As you can see, it fits into the broad and immediate context of 
the advent of the information highway, and more particularly of the 
convergence of telephone, telecommunications and broadcasting 
technologies.
<P>
	As you know, advances in these technologies now mean that they 
are converging and must, to all intents and purposes, be able to 
merge one with the other. Thus, telephone companies and cable 
distributors, to take one example, will shortly be offering the same 
services. It is because of this context that the bill is necessary, so 
that Bell Canada can eventually transmit television signals, since 
cable distributors, for their part, will be authorized to provide 
telephone services.
<P>
	Bell and its partners at Stentor will be able to provide 
broadcasting services, as soon as the government has regulated 
competition with respect to local telephone services, including 
rates, so that cable distributors and other companies will be able to 
set up competitive local telephone services.
<P>
	This convergence of technologies prompted the Minister of 
Industry to state in a press release this past September 19, and I 
quote: ``The real winners are consumers, who will ultimately have 
a choice in who provides their services.'' An interesting statement, 
is it not? Will the public see its quality of life improved as a result?
<P>
	The advent of the information highway will profoundly affect 
the lives of individuals in the first part of the next century. 
Business, information, recreation, entertainment, work, culture, 
consumerism, will all be linked to information highway 
technologies.
<P>
	This is the reason why, although the bill submitted by the 
government is not really complex, and might be a mere technicality 
in itself, the Bloc Quebecois feels that it cannot be examined 
except in conjunction with the entire aspect of the information 
highway.
<P>
	When the Minister of Industry states at the drop of a hat that his 
approach, based on competition at all cost, will ensure individuals 
and society of quality of life, we believe the minister is being naive 
at best, and committing a very dangerous error at worst.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Have the federal government's promises about protecting the 
interests of Quebecers and Canadians in implementing the 
information highway been kept, or will they be kept? That is the 
question. In the next few minutes, I shall direct the attention of this 
House to the pitfalls that are already a threat to us as individuals 
and as a society, and those that will be a threat in the short and 
medium term.
<P>
	The deregulation process in the telecommunications field has 
been underway for more than ten years, but the key decision dates 
back to 1992, when the CRTC introduced long distance competi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5785"> 5785 </A></B>
<P>
tion. This marked the  end of a long tradition in the 
telecommunications industry which has always been a monopoly. 
According to the Minister of Industry, the decision should benefit 
all consumers. But does it really?
<P>
	As shown in the report on long distance savings by the coalition 
for affordable telephone services, filed in February 1996, most 
residential subscribers of companies that are members of Stentor 
had enjoyed no substantial reduction in their long distance bills 
since the CRTC opened up the area to competition in 1992.
<P>
	As you know, the coalition is an umbrella organization for more 
than 60 associations across Canada. It includes organizations that 
represent consumers, senior citizens, unions and other public 
interest groups. It is probably the largest coalition of consumers 
nationwide.
<P>
	I would like to quote to the House what it says on page 2 of the 
coalition's report, which reads as follows: 
<P>
	``Last December, the members of the Stentor group convinced 
the federal government that they should be allowed to keep the 
increases-we are talking about increases in residential rates-and 
not have to reduce basic rates. If residential subscribers remain 
customers of Stentor for long distance services, they will pay not 
less than $700 million in 1996 and 1997, and over a ten year period 
up to $4.5 billion, an amount that would go to the telephone 
companies without giving the subscriber the benefit of discounts on 
long distance calls they pay for, discounts to which they are 
entitled''.
<P>
	The coalition goes on to say that long distance rates have gone 
down, but significantly so only in the case of wholesale users, 
mainly large corporations.
<P>
	In ruling 94-19 and 94-21, the CRTC announced that it would, 
among other things, authorize a re-balancing of rates between long 
distance and local services and would therefore allow three 
increases of $2 each in the monthly basic service rate over the next 
three years, each increase being $2.
<P>
	In exchange, the telecommunications companies would commit 
themselves to reducing the long distance bills of residential 
subscribers and small and medium-size businesses by the same 
amount. However, Bell Canada and seven other 
telecommunications companies that are members of the Stentor 
group objected to this restriction and filed a petition with the 
government asking that the restriction be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Forgetting his promises to consumers, the Minister of Industry 
approved this application by the Stentor group by maintaining the 
increase in local service rates-$2 in 1996, $2 in 1997 and a review 
of the $2 increase in 1998-while allowing market competition to 
continue to dictate long distance charges.
<P>
	Worse, as consumers were hit by an increase in local service 
rates without a reduction in long distance rates, the president of 
Bell Canada was quoted in the December 21, 1995 edition of <I>Le 
Devoir</I> as saying that the government's decision would result in a 1 
per cent increase in the rate of return of stockholders' equity for the 
year 1996.
<P>
	For its part, the Fédération nationale des associations de 
consommateurs du Québec or FNACQ stated in the same article 
that, in the next three years, Canadian households would have to 
pay over $1 billion more for local service so that telephone 
companies can make as much profit as they want.
<P>
	An FNACQ analyst, Marie Vallée, added that the CRTC's 
original decision would have translated into a first substantial 
reduction for residential low and medium volume users of long 
distance and for small businesses. Unfortunately, this did not 
materialize.
<P>
	There was some hope that consumers would now have some 
breathing room. Unfortunately, on September 6, Bell Canada 
submitted a new application regarding residential service to the 
CRTC. This application has two components. The first component 
is the modernization of the telephone network for some 490,000 
customers in Quebec and Ontario by the end of 1997. That is good 
news. But there is a hitch. The second component is the proposed 
compaction of the rate scale from 19 to 11 levels, which would lead 
to an average increase of $1.11 for 850,000 Quebec households. 
How will the CRTC rule on this new application for a rate hike? I 
am afraid to guess.
<P>
	But that is not all. Let us talk about business customers. Last 
spring, Bell Canada tabled with the CRTC a proposal to harmonize 
the rates paid by business customers in small, rural communities. 
As you may have figured out, we are moving toward a new rate 
increase. In fact, according to Bell, business customers in small, 
rural communities will have to pay between $44 and $54 for their 
lines, compared to between $39 and $44 in major centres. Should 
this increase be approved by the CRTC, it would take effect in July 
1997.
<P>
	Let us think about this for a minute. When a business wants to 
modernize its equipment or develop new services, it usually has 
three ways to raise capital: reinvesting operating profits in its 
modernization, issuing additional shares or borrowing the money 
from the banks.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Telephone companies have a better system. Because they operate 
a monopoly, they can increase their rates as they please, with the 
government's blessing, thereby increasing their profits.
<P>
	This means that, at present, those paying for the information 
highway structure, infrastructure and superstructure are mainly the 
people taken hostage by the telephone companies. Yet this 
infrastructure will be the property of private companies. I find that 
indecent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5786"> 5786 </A></B>
<P>
	The effects are both negative and unacceptable to any modern 
society. First, basic service will no longer be affordable for 
low-income individuals and families. In a world where 
communications and information are becoming the cornerstone of 
societal relations, those who are excluded will be dramatically 
marginalized. Is that the kind of society the Minister of Industry 
has in mind? I hope not.
<P>
	Another negative effect: higher commercial rates will affect 
rural businesses than others. As we know, access to 
communications services has become essential to any business. If 
these services are reduced in any way, or cost more outside urban 
centres, the message the Minister of Industry will be sending our 
local businesses is that they should move to larger urban centres. 
Of course, this would make no sense.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry must realize that deregulating left and 
right as he is currently doing produces ill effects. It is true that it 
costs Bell Canada more to provide services in rural regions than in 
urban regions. That is true.
<P>
	It is therefore only normal that the more lucrative urban market 
is more attractive to new competitors. The resulting loss of income 
from urban sources forces Bell Canada to charge amounts closer to 
its actual costs, which, in turn, penalizes the regions. Give the rules 
put in place by the Minister of Industry, the telephone companies' 
reaction is both normal and predictable. But it is also unacceptable, 
totally unacceptable.
<P>
	The minister certainly cannot believe nor say that consumers and 
our businesses will benefit from this competition. The facts prove 
just the opposite. Instead of using their own money to invest in 
modernization, communication companies pass most of the cost on 
to the consumers. Worse yet, the poorest consumers and those 
living outside large urban centres are the hardest hit. The Minister 
of Industry can no longer afford not to be involved.
<P>
	Are there solutions? Let me draw the attention of this House to 
the solutions proposed by the Fédération nationale des associations 
de consommateurs du Québec, or FNACQ, the National 
Anti-Poverty Organization, and the Canadian Seniors Network. 
These groups propose, based on measures successfully 
implemented in California, to first set a monthly rate ceiling of $15 
for the basic service provided to households that have confirmed, 
through a self-certification process, that their income is below the 
poverty line.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The shortfall suffered by telephone companies affected would be 
compensated with moneys from a universal telecommunications 
access fund. These moneys would come from a supplement 
charged to the ultimate user of telecommunications services. The 
providers of telecommunications services would be responsible for  
collecting these moneys and transferring them to the fund. In 
return, the fund would compensate the companies providing the 
service to the poor.
<P>
	In the case of businesses located in the regions, the purpose of 
the fund would be to ensure a sharing of access and maintenance 
costs, which are, of course, higher in the regions than in urban 
areas. The fund would be financed through a contribution paid by 
the companies providing the telecommunications services.
<P>
	The proposals of these organizations were made following 
CRTC's public notice 95-49, which sought to develop the means to 
ensure that telecommunications services continue to be universally 
accessible at affordable rates. CRTC's decision in this regard 
should be known in the next few days. Let us hope it is the right 
one.
<P>
	Public notice 95-49, tabled by the CRTC on November 22, 1995, 
that is before the government's rejection of rulings 94-19 and 
95-21, states, among other things, that the CRTC feels local rate 
increases, over and above the ones that would result from the rate 
rebalancing referred to in ruling 95-21, raise concerns about the 
maintaining and affordability of local services. This should 
convince the industry minister to rethink his all-around 
competition policy.
<P>
	The concerns of the Bloc Quebecois regarding consumers' 
interests are not limited to wire telecommunications. We are also 
worried about the consequences, for the public, of implementing 
new wireless infrastructures, such as personal telecommunications 
services, multimedia services via satellites, direct broadcast 
satellites, and broadcasters digitizing.
<P>
	In fact, beyond the financial consequences for the consumer, the 
Minister of Industry has not yet told us where he stands with 
respect to the protection of personal information, copyright and 
privacy, or with respect to offensive content, child pornography, 
production of francophone content, affordability, accessibility and 
universality of these services.
<P>
	We must look at this bill in the larger context of the information 
highway. The federal strategy with respect to the information 
highway is unfortunately being doled out bit by bit by the Minister 
of Industry, despite extensive, in-depth studies by various 
organizations. Thus, despite the CRTC report on competition and 
culture on Canada's information highway tabled a good year and a 
half ago, despite the final report by the information highway 
advisory council tabled over a year ago, despite the many 
departmental committees on which numerous public servants toil 
away and, finally, despite the Minister of Industry's constant 
reminders of the need for urgent action, the minister has still only 
intervened in the infrastructure sectors. By intervene, all we really 
mean is leaving the field wide open for private enterprise.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5787"> 5787 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I would also point out that the information highway is not really 
being looked at by any standing committee of the House, although 
it is an issue of paramount importance for the future of Canada and 
of Quebec.
<P>
	I will, if I may, give you an example of how pitifully little has 
been done. There is the document published by the Minister of 
Industry last May 23 entitled: <I>Moving Canada into the 21st 
Century</I>. Everyone was expecting the government to come up with 
an action plan for the information highway. But all we got was a 
progress report on implementation of the information highway. The 
Bloc Quebecois reacted vigorously when this so-called strategy 
was tabled.
<P>
	The minister's report made no mention at all of important factors 
linked to the development of the information highway. Although 
the minister wants to encourage virtual transactions with the 
public, he does not say how he will ensure that everyone, every 
single citizen in this country, will have affordable access to the 
information highway.
<P>
	Furthermore, although electronic marketing will create a new 
economy that under existing rules may be able to evade taxes and 
even threaten the rights of consumers, the minister makes no 
mention at all of this issue. Copyright, offensive content and 
foreign transactions are given very superficial treatment.
<P>
	In fact, the minister mentions only those problems we already 
know, without suggesting innovative solutions. Even worse, the 
minister's document as well ignored Quebec culture, lumping it 
together with Canadian multicultural culture. Furthermore, the 
document indicates a willingness to intrude on provincial 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	Finally, the Minister of Industry informs us in this report that the 
policy on convergence would be tabled later. It was released on 
August 6 by the ministers of industry and Canadian heritage. I may 
point out that once again, the announcement was made during the 
parliamentary recess, so that the government would not have to 
face the usual barrage of questions and criticism.
<P>
	In a press release, the Bloc Quebecois expressed its reservations 
about the government's policy statement. So the ministers of 
Canadian heritage and industry seem to have forgotten that the big 
players in the telecommunications and cable industries will look 
after their own interests first, and that the law of the jungle will 
prevail. The policy statement on convergence has created a climate 
of complete uncertainty as to the future of telecommunications and 
broadcasting services in this context.
<P>
	The bill now before the House comes as a result of this policy 
statement. Let us see what it says.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	First of all, by allowing telephone and cable companies to 
provide the full range of communications and broadcasting 
services, the policy statement on convergence makes vertical 
integration of services inevitable.
<P>
	Consequently, despite the ministers' guarantees to the contrary, 
it is obvious that all of the companies involved will see joint 
financing as an interesting way to ensure a competitive edge. With 
number crunching, they will find it easier than ever to ensure that 
no legal stone is left unturned. Major clients will be attracted by 
price reductions, which will be inaccessible to the general 
consumer, who will still unfortunately be a prisoner of his monthly 
bill. This is what the Bloc Quebecois predicted last August, and 
now we see it happening.
<P>
	In this battle between the giants of industry, they will no doubt 
be able to guarantee their risks and their profits, by joining forces 
through the creation of new structurally distinct companies in 
which they will be co-shareholders. Already several American 
companies have joined forces with Canadian ones and have a 
strong presence in both regular and cell phone service.
<P>
	Under the guise of healthy and durable competition, the 
government is moving convergence into the jungle of world 
competition, where there have already been many, far too many, 
victims.
<P>
	You will understand that I regret the federal Minister of 
Industry's decision to allow market forces to dictate the physical 
and technical implementation of the information highway. And yet, 
consumers finance most of it through significant hikes in their 
monthly bills. I also deplore the fact that the minister is neglecting 
one of the main stakes in the information highway, namely content 
development and distribution, whether in the areas of 
entertainment, professional services or teleshopping.
<P>
	And yet, it is a consumer market worth tens of billions of dollars. 
What positions will Canadians and Quebecers take in this market? 
The answer to this question lies to a large extent in the way issues 
regarding copyright, tax legislation enforcement, consumer 
protection, security, privacy, the respect of cultural, moral or civil 
values will be dealt with at the national and international levels. 
Unfortunately, these unavoidable issues are being ignored by the 
industry minister.
<P>
	And what about the accessibility issue, the danger of a two tier 
society, one made up of those who are connected and those who are 
not; those who know how to use it and those who are unable to. I 
believe that the minister should without delay allow the House to 
have an input in the analysis and resolution of the critical stakes in 
the information revolution.
<P>
	You will agree that this information revolution is going to 
completely reshape, for better or for worse, social, cultural and 
economic relationships within society for the next century. So far, 
the Bloc Quebecois is the only voice to raise this issue in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5788"> 5788 </A></B>
<P>
House. We urge the ministers of industry and heritage to do the 
same.
<P>
	In conclusion, I inform the House that the Bloc Quebecois will 
support Bill C-57. Our position reflects the fact that the Bloc 
Quebecois is in favour of healthy and ongoing competition within 
the telecommunications sector resulting in profitable and 
competent telecommunications companies.
<P>
	However, I must emphasize that the Bloc Quebecois will never 
let the federal government get away with neglecting its duty to 
prevent them from competing at consumers' expense.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to make a few remarks today with respect to 
Bill C-57, the amendment to the Bell Canada Act.
<P>
	Right off the top it is clear that this legislation is a housekeeping 
amendment and Reform supports its speedy passage. Bill C-57 
simply removes the restriction preventing Bell Canada from 
holding a broadcasting licence, thereby allowing it to get into the 
cable business at some point down the road.
<P>
	Bill C-57 flows from the government's convergence policy 
announced in August. Convergence has become one of those words 
that is bandied about a lot. People sometimes use it to sound 
impressive, but convergence simply means the coming together of 
different technologies and industries into a new competitive 
environment. In this case we are talking about cable companies 
getting into the business of providing telephone services and 
telephone companies becoming cable providers, both in direct 
competition with each other.
<P>
	As the process of convergence pertains to this bill, we are 
referring to Bell Canada being allowed to hold a broadcast licence. 
In the late 1960s the Bell Canada Act was amended to prevent Bell 
from getting into the cable business in order to protect the fledgling 
cable industry.
<P>
	Today with the likes of Rogers and Shaw, companies which have 
grown enormously since their beginning in the protected 
marketplace they have had, now the playing field is a bit more 
level. So this is really an administrative prelude to the more 
difficult and challenging task of actually getting convergence and 
the prospective competitors up and running.
<P>
	The CRTC, which Terence Corcoran of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> has 
called the Canadian roadblock to telecommunications competition, 
is currently holding hearings with stakeholders on how best to 
proceed with the nuts and bolts of the government's convergence  
policy. I certainly do not envy it that task. Much of it will be 
concerned with the arcane technical details that must be worked out 
in order to make sure that any new system functions smoothly for 
both the providers of the service and for consumers alike.
<P>
	What is certain however is that convergence will benefit the 
consumer. It is for that reason that Reform urges the government to 
push ahead as swiftly as possible in its implementation. Witness 
long distance competition as an example of consumer benefit.
<P>
	In 1992 the CRTC permitted resellers to enter the long distance 
phone market. Competition in other words. To begin with there 
were many players, some big, many small. Those consumers who 
switched early will recall dialling multiple access codes and 
passwords in order to be able to call long distance with their newly 
chosen provider.
<P>
	Slamming, or the practice of moving a consumer from one long 
distance provider to another without their consent, was rife. Many 
small companies fell by the wayside under the strength of the larger 
firms.
<P>
	Along came 1994 and the ease of access provisions. Then we 
could simply pick up the phone and our long distance call was 
billed to the chosen company.
<P>
	During all of this, intense marketing was taking place. Door to 
door campaigns and multimillion dollar TV blitzes with 
Hollywood stars were launched in order to woo our patronage. 
People switched because they saw that prices actually had dropped 
right across the board. Even the Stentor companies that own the 
networks were forced to become competitive, all without the due 
interference of the prodding CRTC. Wonder of wonders: private 
sector competition in an area of former monopoly control and the 
consumer benefits.
<P>
	Well, it will be the same with competition in local phone service 
as well as in cable. Pricing and service packages will become more 
attractive and competition will keep the choices interesting. New 
entrants into monopoly fields will shake up the old ways of 
thinking and marketing and operating. Stodginess and 
complacency will thankfully become things of the past.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The convergence of phone and cable, which we have come to be 
so familiar with, will open doors to new types of service simply due 
to the inherent properties of the technologies. But there are new 
technologies coming on line by the time convergence gets up and 
running that will further stimulate and spur competition. I refer to 
PCS, personal communications service, the next generation of 
cellular based telephones, and LMCS, local multipoint 
communications system, or wireless cable.
<P>
	Instead of having an 18-inch dish outside your house for direct to 
home satellite service, assuming it ever gets up and running that is, 
how about an 8-inch dish on top of your television delivering high 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5789"> 5789 </A></B>
<P>
quality digital TV and audio services and high speed Internet 
access as well? It is just a couple of years away.
<P>
	Industry Canada is going through the process of granting the first 
batch of licences right now and PCS is already hitting the market. 
New technologies make it a more secure and a far more flexible 
form of wireless telephone service than current analogue or even 
digital cellular. The types of things it can do make it more akin to 
land line phone service than anything yet available.
<P>
	I recently heard an interesting quote. It said that nowadays one 
should not invest in companies that still employ professional ditch 
diggers. The inference is that wireless is the way of the future. The 
once mighty cable and phone companies have more to worry about 
than just each other with these new technologies coming on the 
scene. The issue is not without politics either, as if anything in this 
place ever is without politics.
<P>
	British Columbia's telephone company, B.C. Tel, was to have 
been barred from entry into the cable business based upon a 
historical reality. That reality is the fact that 75 years or so ago, 
there was not enough interested Canadian capital available to build 
B.C. Tel's initial infrastructure so it went south of the border for the 
money to build the system. This was before the cultural engineers 
in Ottawa decided that foreign capital was a bad thing in a business 
like a phone company.
<P>
	As a result of being 51 per cent or so foreign owned by GTE Inc. 
of the U.S., B.C. Tel apparently violates all sorts of culturally 
sensitive rules made by the Ottawa bureaucrats. In its questionable 
wisdom, the CRTC recommended in its convergence report in 1995 
that B.C. Tel be denied entry into the cable business due to this 
foreign content. Let me say that much consternation ensued in B.C. 
and the Liberals felt some of the heat that might come if B.C. Tel's 
future in the cable industry was denied.
<P>
	In its wisdom and in an apparent victory for the industry minister 
over the heritage minister and her protectionist ways, the cabinet in 
approving the convergence policy has decided to let B.C. Tel into 
the cable business after all. Perhaps the thought of a hoard of angry 
British Columbians was not all that appealing.
<P>
	We have a bright future for Canada's telecommunications sector. 
We lag behind in some technologies like direct to home satellites 
and PCS but we are ahead in others like cable Internet access and 
LMCS.
<P>
	Large numbers of jobs will flow from convergence, high tech 
jobs, and that certainly is good news. In this first legislative round 
over convergence, I am glad the Liberals have finally come to their 
senses but I also wish to urge them to move toward turning policy 
into reality just as quickly as they can. The benefits are simply too 
great to permit much delay.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the bill we are debating today is one of the shortest 
allowed by the rules of debate of this House. It deals with one of 
Canada's oldest institutions, Bell Canada, which was incorporated 
as long ago as 1880.
<P>
	Neither the length nor the legal wording of the bill can do justice 
to the sweeping changes which have marked and will continue to 
mark this company's evolution. We really have to read between the 
few lines of this particular piece of legislation to see the numerous 
advantages it offers consumers. This is why I personally welcome 
the opportunity to speak today to discuss how these few lines of 
text will affect the lives of Canadians living in the region served by 
Bell Canada, that is, Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	Bell Canada has acquired a world class reputation in the field of 
telephone services and technology development. This bill will 
enable the company to put its reputation for excellence at stake in 
the field of broadcasting, including cable TV operations. It will 
allow Bell to offer a range of services based on new technologies 
that are coming into the market.
<P>
	It is extremely important for legislation that is presented in this 
House to reflect the changing nature of the world in which we live.
<P>
	Broadcasting and particularly telecommunications have always 
been really the two solitudes of Canada's communications system. 
From the beginning these two fields have been divided by laws, 
regulation and technology. Technology in particular was a barrier 
to convergence of the two industries. Now those technological 
barriers are indeed fading. We are essentially living in an era where 
time and space are being redefined.
<P>
	The technological revolution makes it possible for the two 
solitudes I was talking about earlier to unite and to complement 
each other. The truth is we now need to change our laws and our 
regulatory environment to facilitate our entry into this new era of 
technology.
<P>
	In 1968 this House prohibited Bell Canada and its subsidiaries 
from holding a broadcasting licence. At that time the purpose of 
this restriction was very noble indeed: to prevent Bell Canada from 
dominating the delivery of broadcasting services and to protect the 
fledgling cable industry. However since that time, as Canadians are 
well aware, these concerns have been overtaken by a number of 
technological and market developments that are leading to the 
convergence of the telephone and cable industries.
<P>
	In the future, broadcasting and telecommunications will stake 
their claim on the same territories. Cable distributors will be found 
in the area of telephone services, and telephone companies will be 
at work in the area of broadcasting. This new competition between 
the two great branches of Canada's communications system will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5790"> 5790 </A></B>
<P>
stimulate investment and innovation. Above all it will give 
consumers the benefit of an even wider variety of services.
<P>
	Mention of Bell Canada often conjures up images of a great 
untouchable monopoly. This is no longer the case as competition 
has opened up several areas of the telecommunications market, 
including long distance services. Now Bell Canada will have to 
face competition from cable distributors and new entrants in the 
local telephone service market.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	The new wireless technologies will provide alternatives to the 
traditional cable and wire services. For example, wireless 
broadband or local multi-point communication systems 
technologies will offer everything from TV programming to 
Internet access, from multi-media applications to telephone 
services. Satellite services are another competitive alternative to 
wire and cable based distribution systems in rural and remote areas. 
Consumers will be able to select the type of local telephone 
services they want on the basis of choice, quality and price.
<P>
	In this new environment, it is only fair that Bell Canada should 
be able to meet head to head with its competitors in their respective 
fields. Now that cable companies are well established and about to 
take on the telephone services market, Bell Canada will have the 
opportunity to take on the cable distribution market.
<P>
	Bell Canada's extensive telecommunications distribution 
network will be able to carry all the products and services which up 
until now were only offered by cable companies and all the new 
products that will be introduced as soon as cable companies are 
able to offer telephone services.
<P>
	The convergence policy statement and principles released on 
August 6 will give consumers more choices and will help ensure 
that Canadian content prevails. Even smaller specialty service 
providers will be able to access large distribution networks like 
Bell Canada's and carve out profitable niches for themselves.
<P>
	Regardless of whether they subscribe to Bell Canada's network, 
a cable network or new wireless networks, the emerging 
information highway will provide consumers with access to a range 
of new employment, health care, educational and entertainment 
opportunities.
<P>
	Canadians, regardless of where they live, will be able to open 
links from their homes to training institutions, educators and 
distance education. They will be able to access many government 
services 24 hours a day. Telecommuting will enable many 
Canadians to work at home through a network which allows them 
to be in contact with their employers, colleagues and clients. This 
new work scheme will also cut the costs traditionally associated 
with working.
<P>
	When this short bill becomes law it will have a far-reaching 
impact on the development of Canada's information highway. It 
sets the stage for true competition between what until now has been 
the two solitudes in Canada's communication industry. This 
competition will lead to new innovations in products and services 
that drive the growth of the information highway and open up an 
new era of opportunity for confident producers and consumers.
<P>
	For these reasons I urge all members of the House to support the 
bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the speech by my colleague from the Liberal 
Party. He announced all those great things the public will soon 
benefit from.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a question. Since the unemployment 
level is close to 23, 24 and even 25 per cent, since the unemployed 
have trouble making ends meet, since the monthly telephone bill 
increases by $2 each year and another $1.11 will soon be added to 
that, how does he think that these people, one in four in Canada 
now, will be able to afford the range of services he just described? 
As a government, is the Liberal Party not creating a two tier 
society, one for those who have money and one for those who will 
have to do without services whenever there is not enough money? I 
would like an answer to that question.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Madam Speaker, first I would like to thank the 
hon. member opposite who said that he was paying attention to 
what I was saying. Based on the question that he asked, it is 
obvious to me that he must have either just entered the House or 
was not paying attention to the TV screen in the back lobby.
<P>
	This bill actually opens up competition for cable and telephone 
companies. Competition usually results in better service and a 
wider array of services for Canadians at a lower cost.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament who has travelled the country 
extensively from coast to coast to coast, on the issue of 
unemployment and the related fields of social security and youth, I 
can say that there is a great call in Canada, including in the 
province of Quebec, to create the type of information network and 
infrastructure to help people with the issue, for example, of 
distance education.
<P>
	The 21st century is only a few years away. For anyone to attempt 
to block legislation such as that which the government has put 
before the House would clearly indicate to me that the hon. 
member is not looking to the 21st century with a great deal of 
enthusiasm, nor is he looking for ways to help the 1.4 million 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5791"> 5791 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians who are unemployed or others who are on social 
assistance.
<P>
	Let us remember that any industrial strategy that an 
industrialized country like Canada undertakes will include a very 
effective infrastructure, not simply bridges and roads, but also the 
type of infrastructure which is required in the field of 
telecommunications.
<P>
	It is high time that members understand that our country's future 
economic capacity will largely be increased by the type of 
investment it makes in telecommunications, in computer networks 
and in those sorts of things which speak to building a global 
economy.
<P>
	This bill will allow many things to occur. Above and beyond 
that, it will allow for the sort of competition that speaks to 
innovation and creativity in Canada's marketplace. That will 
generate jobs. It will give hope to those individuals who the hon. 
member professes he wants to help.
<P>
	One of the things of which I am aware is that people, the 
unemployed in particular, are moving away from the concept of 
income support just for the sake of income support. Unemployed 
Canadians want income support plus the tools required to re-enter 
the workforce. We cannot do that using old fashioned rules and old 
fashioned approaches.
<P>
	The hon. member is bringing in unemployment as it relates to 
this bill. If he was a bit of a futurist, if he understood how the world 
is changing, then he would know that these are the types of bills 
which he should be supporting.
<P>
	If he looks at the issue of distance education and the interaction 
between teachers or professors and an individual Canadian at 
home, I am sure he will understand that this bill is improving the 
chances of those unemployed people to which he referred.
<P>
	The government is on the right track. I am sure it will stay the 
course. At the macro level the deficit has been lowered and that has 
resulted in lower interest rates. We are also getting our fiscal house 
in order. On the other side, which is equally important, is the type 
of investment we are making in people and the type of investment 
we are making in the information network which exists and which 
needs to be improved. When we continue to invest in people we are 
speaking about prosperity, of giving the tools required for people to 
take on the challenges of the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Knowing that the hon. member understands all these things that 
are occurring in the world, I am quite surprised he would limit 
himself to what I would consider a pretty empty question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the 
speech of my colleague, both on the monitors and here in the 
House. I must say that affordability and accessibility of services are 
not empty questions.
<P>
	There is a real possibility we will end up with a two tier society if 
we do nothing to prevent it. There will be those who can afford the 
services and those who cannot. There will be those who will know 
how to use the tools and those who will not. If we are not careful 
about this, we could create information ghettos which would be 
hard to escape.
<P>
	I am surprised that my colleague across the way is singing the 
praises of technology. I have been working with information 
systems since 1968, for 28 years now, and I understand quite well, 
probably better than anybody in this House, what is at stake in this 
situation. As I have experienced how difficult it is for companies 
and individuals to adapt to technological changes, I must caution 
the Liberal government not to make such changes unless it is very 
sensitive to the needs of society as a whole and most of all to the 
needs of the neediest in our society.
<P>
	This is not an insignificant issue, it is the fundamental purpose of 
a society to go forward, but we must do so all together as we want 
to do in Quebec and as we want to do in Canada, I hope.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member is picking 
on the wrong member of Parliament. This is the same member, 
through his youth initiatives, who has been able to talk to and 
recommend to the minister that we should have technology youth 
initiatives for at risk youth. I understand that polarization of classes 
in this society is going to occur between those individuals of 
technological know-how and the have nots. It is a known fact.
<P>
	People have to understand that for governments it is not a 
question of either/or and we do understand that in this House. We 
always think that only one policy direction can be taken and it is 
exclusive.
<P>
	Policy directions and choices do not have to be mutually 
exclusive. Both can be done. If there are people in this society, who 
through no fault of their own cannot access certain technological 
instruments, does not mean that you deny everybody else. What 
you do is work hard at making sure those individuals also have 
access to those technological improvements that our society can 
offer.
<P>
	The point the hon. member made is well taken but he should only 
look at the Minister of Industry's program of computers in the 
schools to find out that the Liberal Party has already responded to 
his question.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the second reading of Bill 
C-57, an act to issue a broadcasting licence to Bell Canada to allow 
it to compete in the cable industry.
<P>
	What is at stake here with the bill is not the principle of 
deregulation as such, but the results obtained as opposed to the 
results expected by the minister responsible for the 
communications sector.
<P>
	You will recall that, when the Liberals formed the federal 
government in 1993, they promised to pursue the deregulation 
objective in the telephone industry and the communications sector. 
They promised especially that, with this deregulation, consumers 
in Quebec and Canada as a whole would end up benefiting from 
reduced rates. However, since this deregulation objective has been 
set into motion, the effects have been totally the opposite.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Far from arriving at a reduction of these rates, we were 
confronted with rate increases, even in the sector where they had 
promised the most reductions in communications rates, that is long 
distance rates.
<P>
	Data have been checked out. Since 1992, most residential 
subscribers, mainly those of Stentor, which is a partner of Bell 
Canada, have not seen one cent of reduction in the long distance 
rates. Not one cent of reduction since 1992, while they were 
promised, especially in the long distance market, a substantial 
reduction of these rates.
<P>
	The only ones whose long distance bills went down are the major 
consumers, most of which are large corporations concentrated in 
major urban centres such as Montreal and Toronto.
<P>
	Everywhere else, all regular customers in Quebec, all the people 
who voted for this government in Canada and for the Bloc 
Quebecois in Quebec did not see a penny in reduction in long 
distance rates. As for local rates, the situation is almost disastrous. 
Not only has there been no reduction in rates but, by deregulating 
left and right and promising just about anything, they compromised 
the basic principle of cross-subsidizing telephone services.
<P>
	Under the cross-subsidization principle, operating surpluses 
generated in major urban centres, especially for long distance, were 
used to subsidize local service, which, in some small communities 
throughout Canada, costs more than in major centres.
<P>
	The cross-subsidization principle was replaced by that of rate 
rebalancing. What was the result of this rate rebalancing? Since 
1994, basic telephone service rates have risen by $2 per month, per 
year, over three years. In other words, in three years, the monthly 
bills of consumers in Quebec and Canada will be $6 higher than  if 
the principle of cross-subsidization had been maintained.
<P>
	The most outrageous in all of this is that Bell Canada is taking 
advantage of these CRTC rulings, which Bell Canada itself 
contributes to since it provides documentation to the CRTC. Bell 
has a range of experts who do not carry as much weight as 
consumers or their representatives. But, instead of using these 
higher revenues taken from the pockets of consumers to remain 
competitive or modernize, Bell uses them to increase its 
stockholders' rate of return.
<P>
	Mr. McLennan, the president of Bell Canada, made no bones 
about it. He was quoted in the December 21, 1995 edition of <I>Le 
Devoir</I> as saying as that the rate increases approved by the CRTC 
would result in a 1 per cent increase in the rate of return of 
stockholders' equity for the year 1996.
<P>
	This is not modernization. Bell Canada is taking advantage of 
increases authorized by the CRTC to dig into the pockets of 
consumers and increase the return on investment of its 
shareholders. In fact, a spokesperson for the Fédération nationale 
des associations de consommateurs had this to say at the time: 
``Canadian households will have to pay more than $1 billion in 
increases over the next three years for the telephone companies to 
achieve the level of profits they are hoping for''.
<P>
	In other words, deregulation, CRTC decisions, what the minister 
says, his policies and directions, all that is not designed to serve 
consumers, as he claimed, nor to reduce long distance rates for the 
average consumer or local rates, but to increase all these rates and 
take out of the pockets of consumers the money Bell Canada needs 
to sweeten the package offered to its shareholders.
<P>
	I find that absolutely despicable. Especially given that Mr. 
McLennan was going around this year forecasting $700 million in 
net profits for Bell Canada, or a 40 per cent increase over last 
year's profits.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Now, they have the gall to ask for more rate increases to be 
approved, so that they can fill their pockets even more, with the 
blessing of the minister, who keeps talking about abstract and 
vague concepts and does not bother to monitor the impact of his 
decisions and directions.
<P>
	When you are looking to deregulate and ensure that 
communications systems meet the needs of the 1990s, into the next 
century, as my hon. colleague so aptly pointed out, you must ensure 
at the same time that a procedure is in place to follow up and 
monitor what is going on in terms of price increases. Soon, with 
such increases for basic telephone services, andother services too, 
communications will become a luxury item. Average families will 
no longer be able to afford these services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5793"> 5793 </A></B>
<P>
	Bell Canada and its competition offer an incredible range of 
services. But, as the hon. member for Portneuf said, who will be 
able to use these services?
<P>
	This issue raises a lot of questions. Here is another example of 
rate increase based on deregulation without monitoring, as applied 
by by the minister responsible for communications: Last spring, 
Bell Canada asked the CRTC to increase the rates of its business 
clients located in small rural communities.
<P>
	Some small businesses, referred to as VSBs or very small 
businesses, located in rural communities saw their basic rate jump 
from $44 to $54 per month, a $10 increase. This puts small 
businesses located in rural communities at a further competitive 
disadvantage, since the increase in densely populated areas, that is 
in major urban centres, was only $5. The increase imposed on 
small businesses located in rural communities is more than twice 
that of their competition in major urban centres.
<P>
	This is not normal, particularly from a government that claims to 
support small rural communities and regional development. The 
government is killing entrepreneurship by playing a part in such 
decisions.
<P>
	This is a serious matter. The Quebec vice-president of the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Mr. Cléroux, 
condemned this decision made last spring regarding small 
businesses in rural communities. He said the situation of a number 
of these businesses is precarious, adding that such an increase 
would adversely affect their performance and could even threaten 
their survival. Such are the effects of this government's 
deregulation, a process which does not involve any monitoring and 
which is irresponsible.
<P>
	When the industry asks the government to support deregulation, 
as we do, the government must monitor the situation and provide a 
framework. It must not let the situation turn into a free for all. It 
must not let anarchy set in. More importantly, it must not let the 
shareholders of Bell Canada, Stentor and all the others raid the 
pockets of consumers in Quebec and Canada. That is not the 
purpose of deregulation. The purpose is to have better service, 
service that is competitive and is more concerned with what 
consumers can afford than with making money for the richest 
shareholders in Bell Canada. It is not right.
<P>
	Finally, last September 6, and I tell you this because it is a matter 
of great importance to me, Bell Canada had good news for us. I said 
to myself that any good news in the matter of deregulation brings 
with it news that is not so good, and I was right. Last September 6, 
Bell Canada announced that it was modernizing all its telephone 
and communication facilities in small municipalities in Quebec 
and Ontario.
<P>
	I believe some 500 or 550 municipalities, including 300 in 
Quebec, were involved. This was good news, excellent news, 
because for years, municipalities and economic development 
corporations, as well as the federal government, have been pushing 
Bell Canada to modernize its exchanges. Why? You would be 
surprised.
<P>
	At a time when the focus is on telecommunications, the very 
latest in service, the information highway, all these ultramodern 
services, you would be surprised to learn that over 300 
municipalities in Quebec and over 200 in Ontario do not even have 
9-1-1 service.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The networks are so antiquated that they do not have 9-1-1, and 
conference calls are not possible. The vast array of services offered 
by Bell Canada is not to be found in these municipalities. But the 
advertising is.
<P>
	It is frustrating for people to receive advertising on a range of 
services with a 30 per cent discount on 10 ultramodern 
communications services offered by Bell Canada and to be told by 
head office that they are not entitled to these services, that they 
may not take advantage of the 30, 40, 50 and 70 per cent discounts 
because their system is completely behind the times, ready for the 
junk heap.
<P>
	We were happy last September 6 at the marvellous news that 
Bell Canada was going to modernize its networks. At last, no more 
lives will be at risk. It is a serious matter when you do not have 
access to 9-1-1 service in communities. Situations can arise where 
citizens' lives are in danger and Bell Canada is doing nothing.
<P>
	They are happy, except that there is a hitch, and it is this: Bell 
Canada will be passing on to these small communities the cost of 
modernizing the network in the form of a major hike in rates for 
local service. In other words, three municipalities elsewhere in 
Quebec, as in Ontario, located in urban or semi-urban areas, had 
their modernization paid for by all Bell customers, but those 
remaining, small rural communities, will have to cover the cost 
themselves. This is no small matter.
<P>
	If I look at my riding, where two municipalities and parishes 
have these outmoded communications systems, monthly rates will 
increase by approximately $4. In addition to this $4, there are the 
increases already planned by Bell. I would remind you that they are 
talking of a $2 hike in 1996, $2 in 1997, $2 in 1998, which makes 
$6 more on local rates. Now another $4. Do you realize what this 
means over 25 months for telephone service charges? A rise of 
close to 100 per cent.
<P>
	Is such a situation normal, when everywhere else with a high 
population density systems were modernized from the funding of 
the entire client base? Now they will be demanding a rate increase 
on a case by case basis to meet the costs of such modernization.
<P>
	Small rural communities are required to be cost-effective, to fit 
in with the movement toward market  globalization, to compete 
with major centres, as well as internationally, and so we end up 
with situations of discrimination such as this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5794"> 5794 </A></B>
<P>
	About a year and a half ago, a coalition for the modernization of 
Bell Canada service was formed in my riding. I would like to take 
this opportunity to acknowledge the hard work of that coalition, 
which may have prompted Bell Canada's decision to speed up 
modernization. No rate increases were called for, mind you.
<P>
	Today, I would like to single out the following for their excellent 
work: the mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe, Claude Bernier, who is also 
reeve of the regional county municipality and one the key players 
in the coalition; Jean Messier, Mayor of Saint-Damase; Mr. Guillet, 
Mayor of the Parish of Saint-Damase; Mr. Adam, Mayor of the 
Village of Saint-Pie; Rosaire Martin, Mayor of the Parish of 
Saint-Pie. I salute, as well, Mario de Telly, Director of the 
Saint-Hyacinthe economic development corporation. I am grateful 
for their support and the strong stands they have taken in this 
matter for the greater good of their fellow citizens.
<P>
	As I have said, this coalition had only one purpose: to obtain for 
a population marginalized by Bell Canada the broad range of 
modern services which technological advances have now made 
available.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Bell was not, however, ever asked to increase rates inordinately, 
as it did in the plan it submitted to the CRTC this past September.
<P>
	We are calling for the government to get a little more involved in 
this situation, not only for the sake of Saint-Pie and Saint-Damase, 
but also for the other 300 Quebec and 250 Ontario municipalities. 
In the name of its deregulation policy, in the name of its 
communications policy, the government must require the CRTC 
not to allow any anomalies such as there are in Saint-Pie and 
Saint-Damase in my region, and in more than 300 other 
municipalities in Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	The government has to act responsibly, because you cannot treat 
people in rural areas like second class citizens. They have the same 
rights as everybody else, and they are entitled to the basic service 
provided by Bell Canada and other telephone companies. And they 
also have the same right as anyone else to the services provided by 
Bell Canada.
<P>
	I was astonished to see Mr. McLennan announce at a press 
conference that Bell Canada would make a profit of $712 million 
this year and probably even more next year, which will mean more 
money for the shareholders. Meanwhile, after announcing this 
increase in profits and increased dividends for shareholders, he 
announced that in the course of the next 25 months, basic service 
rates in small rural municipalities would go up by 100 per cent.
<P>
	Here we do not find compassion nor any concern for dealing 
fairly with the various regions in this country.
<P>
	Sure, we want Bell Canada to modernize its equipment. Sure, we 
want deregulation which, if the minister does his job and if this 
government does its job, might improve rates for the consumer, but 
at the same time, we do not want small municipalities which are 
already at a disadvantage because of their location, compared with 
more centrally located areas, to be charged more by a big 
corporation that is federally regulated.
<P>
	We hope the CRTC will respond to appeals from the coalition in 
my riding, and I mentioned some prominent members of the 
coalition earlier, and that it will require Bell Canada to use part of 
its $700 million in profits to modernize its equipment without 
gouging the consumer. I also speak on behalf of Quebec's 300 rural 
municipalities which are in the same boat as the municipalities of 
Saint-Pie et Saint-Damase in my region, since the UMRCQ, at its 
last convention, voted almost unanimously to pass a resolution 
along the lines of the coalition founded in Saint-Hyacinthe against 
rate increases to pay for updating facilities.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to thank the hon. member for his intervention. It is 
interesting. There are some points that I would like to comment on 
and perhaps ask questions of.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has been at pains to point out the difficulties 
that change brings on people. There is an element of truth in what it 
says.
<P>
	However, it seems to me that unless we open the field that these 
big companies have dominated for so long and allow new 
technologies to have their place, to have new entries into the 
marketplace make their play, then we are simply going to be bound 
by the status quo.
<P>
	I have heard my hon. colleague mention the number of 
communities he has in his constituency. I share many of the same 
concerns that he has. I have rural communities that do not have 
telephone service or they have the old telephone service that they 
cannot use for fax communication and for Internet communication. 
These people are waiting for the lines to bring in the technology 
that is available to people on modern telecommunications systems 
and they do not have them. This is not a matter that I am unfamiliar 
with.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	It seems to me, however, that the means for dealing with this is 
not simply to maintain the status quo, that it must be opened up to 
the new technologies, that it is not going to be for a very long time 
that the most distant and most remote parts of our country have the 
benefit of a land line, a telephone company putting in polls, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5795"> 5795 </A></B>
<P>
stringing wires and doing all the things we have seen done for the  
last 50 years. That is not going to happen. What we have to do is 
open up the marketplace so that the new technologies can bring the 
modern services that will put these points in communication with 
the rest of the world.
<P>
	I also listened to the member speak about the difficulties with 
people not having 911 numbers. This too must be available for 
people in the same way with the communication means that are 
possible.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if he does not see the new 
technology and new avenues of competition as really being a 
blessing that will bring to people in the remote frontiers of our 
country the means of communication that they have not had in the 
past? If he does not see that, how does he intend to see these people 
who are without communication means get them under the present 
system?
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome my Reform 
colleague's comments and questions. We must set the record 
straight: we are not against deregulation, except when it has such 
perverse effects, when, instead of the promised rate reductions, we 
end up facing rate increases. Another perverse effect is that-to get 
back to my Reform colleague's remark-competition benefits 
major centres and big consumers.
<P>
	However, in rural and semi-rural regions, Bell and its 
competitors are not so eager to provide good services to their 
customers. That is why deregulation should be followed up to 
determine its impact on local communities. I can tell you that the 
deregulation of telephone services has not been good to rural 
communities so far.
<P>
	It is up to the minister responsible for communications to ensure 
that rural communities can benefit from the positive impact of 
competition in the area of telephone and communications 
services-and there is indeed a positive impact. Under the current 
policy, there are now two types of citizens: the people living in 
densely populated areas, who receive good communications 
services, and those who live farther away from major centres, who 
are poorly served by communications companies.
<P>
	There is no need to go very far. Saint-Pie and Saint-Damase are 
only about 50 kilometres away from Montreal and some 10 or 15 
kilometres from Saint-Hyacinthe. But just because of this short 
distance, telephone companies are not so eager to provide good 
services to the population, and that is not normal.
<P>
	I agree that deregulation can bear fruit, but the fruit has started to 
rot even before the tree has reached maturity. This is the minister's 
fault. We are asking the minister to remedy the perverse effects of 
deregulation and ensure that Bell Canada and its competitors 
provide the same high quality services to all citizens, whether  they 
live in cities or in rural communities. That is not the case today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to my hon. colleague's remarks on this important issue 
and I would like to get his view on the fact that, at present, 
technological advances-and we are all for technology and we 
believe in it-are not accessible and apparently cannot be made 
equally accessible to all consumers.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Precisely because large urban centres are profitable for 
telephone companies, that is where the competition is and, 
naturally, urban consumers will have access to excellent services at 
a presumably reasonable price. But in rural areas, Bell Canada 
remains the only provider. The competition does not reach there; it 
would cost them too much.
<P>
	Bell Canada, which used to be able to derive part of its revenue 
from urban centres to make up for the higher cost of providing 
service to rural areas, can no longer do that and, as a result, people 
living in rural areas will not enjoy the same grade of service or 
good prices as their urban counterparts.
<P>
	Does my hon. colleague not think that our friends from the 
Reform Party should take up the position of the Bloc Quebecois to 
ensure that technological advances and deregulation benefit all 
citizens and demand that the Minister of Industry take steps to 
ensure we achieve this desirable end.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague from Portneuf 
has taken the words right out of my mouth. I had written, to 
conclude my response to our colleague from the Reform Party, that 
the Reformers might consider joining us in our pursuit to ensure 
that all our fellow citizens may enjoy the benefits of the 
deregulation process as soon as possible and have their rates cut.
<P>
	I am reaching out to the Reform Party. If ever you experience in 
your rural communities the same unfair situation my fellow 
citizens of Saint-Pie and Saint-Damaze are facing following Bell 
Canada's recent decisions, I urge you to join forces with us, and I 
will be pleased to join with you on this issue.
<P>
	On other issues, it may be a different story, but on this one, I 
must say that we think alike and that is a good thing. The purpose 
of this coalition was to get the minister to yield, so that there will 
not be first-class and second-class citizens in Quebec and Canada, 
but only one class of citizens served by these large corporations and 
also by medium sized communications companies.
<P>
	Your analysis, which you shared with us earlier, hon. colleague 
from the Reform Party, is exactly along the same lines as our 
analyses and those of the Bloc member for Portneuf. If our parties 
can, for this once, join forces in the interest of our fellow citizens, 
we will do so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	In the meantime, let me tell you that, over the next few weeks, 
the CRTC will be hearing representations from various groups on 
the application for rate increase presented by Bell Canada on 
September 6. I urge you to do as some of us have done and write 
the CRTC, asking that the system be modernized without rates 
being raised.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to address Bill C-57, an act to amend the 
Bell Canada Act.
<P>
	This bill seeks to allow Bell Canada to hold a broadcasting 
licence or to operate a broadcasting undertaking which, until now, 
the company was prohibited from doing.
<P>
	This legislation is part of the regulatory changes undertaken by 
the government to allow competition among the various players in 
the communications sector. Telephone companies will now be 
allowed to operate in the broadcasting and cable broadcasting 
sectors, while cable companies will be able to use their networks to 
sell telephone services and to provide access to the information 
highway.
<P>
	We agree with the objective to promote competition and 
convergence, and we support the bill. However, this legislation 
only solves Bell Canada's case. The government must still grant 
the same privilege to other companies providing telephone 
services, including Quebec Telephone and BC Tel.
<P>
	Let us not forget that, with the support and the co-operation of 
the public, the Bloc Quebecois worked very hard to show to the 
government the major role played by Quebec Telephone in eastern 
Quebec's economy.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois asked that Quebec Telephone also be 
allowed to provide broadcasting services. The government 
recognized the soundness of the official opposition's arguments 
and, on August 6, when it launched its policy, it also announced 
that Quebec Telephone and BC Tel would be allowed to access the 
new convergence market, and that an order in council would be 
made to this effect.
<P>
	We are concerned that this bill was tabled without any order 
being made regarding Quebec Telephone and BC Tel. Madam 
Speaker, I ask you to remind the government that it would be 
greatly appreciated if the order was made before the final vote on 
this bill, so as to give equal treatment to all telephone companies.
<P>
	We cannot talk about a bill on Bell Canada without mentioning 
the recent telephone rate increases approved by the federal 
government. The new competitive environment was supposed to 
result in a lowering of the rates, including for long distance 
services. In fact, prices went down only for major users and 
companies.
<P>
	As for Bell Canada's clients, they will have to put up with two 
successive increases of two dollars, in 1996 and in 1997, and with 
an undetermined one in 1998. The government overturned CRTC 
decisions that would have give residence customers and small and 
medium size businesses a rebate on long distance calls.
<P>
	In the end, the government's attitude towards the industry means 
that it would be up to the consumers instead of investors and phone 
company shareholders to pay for the development of 
communications networks and for their adaptation to the 
information highway.
<P>
	For the industry, getting assistance from the government means 
that the companies do not have to take any risk or invest any 
money. They make the consumers pay for their investments, make 
huge profits which are, for the most part, tax deductible, not to 
mention the deduction they might get for their contribution to the 
party.
<P>
	Several companies are not at all interested in developing 
networks in rural areas, because it is less profitable than developing 
networks in urban areas. Ever since the government has introduced 
competition at the local service level, it has become obvious that 
regions will be adversely affected.
<P>
	Putting an end to cross subsidization between the rural areas and 
the cities will be devastating, since it will result in an increase in 
rates and reduced access to services.
<P>
	First, the rates will go up, as of July 1997, businesses in rural 
areas will pay $5 to $10 more than businesses in urban areas.
<P>
	Also, residence customers will face an 87 per cent increase over 
a period of a little more than two years, if you add to the rate 
increases the cost of modernizing telephone exchanges.
<P>
	These increases are occurring as the chairman of Bell Canada 
announces that his company expects its net income to grow by 40 
per cent and to generate $712 million in profits.
<P>
	Even if it talks about accessibility, the government has not 
promised to set up any kind of system to provide universal access 
to telecommunications, as was proposed by the Fédération 
nationale des associations de consommateurs du Québec, and has 
not found it necessary to ask the CRTC to examine this issue.
<P>
	Therefore, in the communications area, there is a huge risk to see 
the gap widen between the urban areas and the regions, between the 
people who have easy access to and those who are starved of 
information.
<P>
	This gap will only emphasize the cultural isolation of the 
regions, deny the local economies the tools they need to make up 
for their geographical isolation and to fully take part in the market 
globalization.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5797"> 5797 </A></B>
<P>
	The fact that the opposition supports the federal initiative set 
out in this bill in no way means that we agree with all the 
government policies concerning the communications industry, far 
from it.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	While the government has thoroughly addressed issues such as 
competition, deregulation and markets with regard to the 
information highway, it seems to have neglected to look at what 
will be offered to the public.
<P>
	These technological innovations open the door to promising 
changes. However, society must take the time to adapt to these 
changes and to find the best way to benefit from them.
<P>
	These new communication technologies have been dubbed 
``information highway'' because, just like highways, they allow 
people to communicate more rapidly. But even if one likes to drive, 
highways are only useful if they lead to interesting places.
<P>
	An information highway without any interesting content, 
whether educational, artistic, scientific or other, would be as 
useless and boring as a highway that would stretch over hundreds 
of kilometers without any exit, without beautiful scenery, and that 
would bring us right back to our starting point.
<P>
	Yet, this is exactly what the government is doing. It wants to give 
our country an information highway but has no plan to develop 
meaningful Canadian products in both official languages.
<P>
	I am talking about products developed here by our own creators, 
that would reflect the culture and the interests of our society and 
that would be accessible to the public. These products would also 
represent us in the global forum which the information highway is 
becoming more and more everyday.
<P>
	Of course, the minister is even less concerned with the 
importance of developing French language products that would 
allow Quebecers, Acadians and other French-speaking 
communities in Canada to benefit fully from the opportunities 
offered by these new communication technologies.
<P>
	The government is talking about recognizing Quebec as a 
distinct society, but its actions do not match its words. In this case, 
it should ensure a French content in all communications-related 
areas.
<P>
	The industry minister is so obsessed with the economic aspect, 
the competition issue and building infrastructures that he is even 
forgetting the price-quality ratio and seems to be stuck on the word 
price.
<P>
	Forgetting the word quality is forgetting the millions of 
taxpayers and consumers who pay high taxes and high telephone 
and cable bills and who want to have more for their money.
<P>
	Recently, the government has shown again its lack of 
commitment to protect Canada's and Quebec's cultures when it 
authorized two American audio programming service companies, 
Power DirecTv and DMX, to broadcast in Canada without having 
to comply with CTRC rules on minimum Canadian and French 
language content.
<P>
	Of course, the minister wanted to reassure Canadians and, in all 
the information she gave, she forgot to mention that DMX will 
broadcast 17 American channels that are not authorized by the 
CRTC.
<P>
	These American services will be competing with the services of 
Canadian companies, which do meet CRTC requirements and 
which invest here in the production of Canadian content, which 
employ our own technicians, artists and creators.
<P>
	Canada negotiated a ``cultural exemption'' clause in NAFTA so 
that it could protect Canadian cultural industries. The Liberal 
government has given up enforcing this clause, and, bit by bit, is 
opening the door ever wider to Americans. The Liberal Party's job 
creation promises will thus come true, but largely in the United 
States, as far as culture is concerned.
<P>
	Another case where the government has opened the door to 
American products is that of satellite television. The government 
was unable to help set up a Canadian direct to home satellite 
broadcasting service.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Some 400,000 Canadians, 80,000 of them in Quebec, living 
largely in rural areas without access to cable services, subscribed to 
satellite services originating in the United States. This represents 
millions of dollars lost to Canadian industry.
<P>
	There will be important changes in the near future in satellite 
television technology. Consumers who spent a lot of money on 
satellite dishes may well find themselves with equipment that is no 
longer compatible with the new technology.
<P>
	The government is refusing to conduct advertising campaigns to 
inform the public about these changes. It is refusing to protect the 
public by requiring that dishes be leased until equipment adapted to 
the new technologies is available, in order to save consumers the 
expense of these changes.
<P>
	By thus allowing retailers to continue to sell satellite dishes that 
will soon be useless because they are based on old technology, the 
federal government is completely neglecting its responsibility to 
protect consumers. Yet, section 5 of the Act to establish the 
Department of Industry, which requires the minister to promote 
science and technology in Canada, also stipulates, and I quote: 
``-the minister shall exercise the powers and perform the duties 
and functions-in a manner that will promote the interests and 
protection of Canadian consumers''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5798"> 5798 </A></B>
<P>
	There is still time for the minister to redeem himself. First of 
all, people who have purchased satellite dishes since January 1, 
1995 ought to be compensated when they are required to make 
changes to accommodate the new technology.
<P>
	This would affect close to 400,000 Canadians, 80,000 of them 
Quebecers, who have been the ones taken for a ride. It has been 
known since 1994 that dish technology is going to become 
obsolete, now that CBC and all stations have gone digital. That was 
known when the dishes were sold.
<P>
	They are still being sold in Canada, and purchasers are not even 
being warned by a government label or some other means stating 
``these antennas are purchased at your own risk. This is an 
outmoded technology, so you cannot come after us claiming 
compensation later on.'' The government has a responsibility 
concerning these companies, which are selling obsolete technology 
without any scruples.
<P>
	Second, the minister ought to warn consumers not to invest in 
outdated technology. The government ought to carry out a serious 
information campaign, even going so far as to ban sales of this 
satellite technology during the transition period, and to allow only 
short-term leasing, so as to protect the public against unscrupulous 
vendors.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois has demanded, still demands, 
and will continue to demand unrelentingly that the government 
take consumer interests and regional interests into greater 
consideration, where price and quality as well as content and 
services are concerned.
<P>
	We will be closely monitoring how much expression the 
government will allow francophones, how much funding it will 
give them to permit full, quality expression in French. We will 
continue to criticize the federal government's lack of vision with 
respect to culture and consumer goods.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Since the Bloc Quebecois was elected to the House of Commons, 
we have seen time and time again how the government has no 
compunction about selling off Canadian culture, bit by bit. Not a 
day goes by in this House without a government member rising to 
say we want to destroy Canada, but I accuse the Liberal 
government of wanting to destroy this country by selling Canadian 
culture off bit by bit, day after day, month after month. And that is 
the truth.
<P>
	When the day comes when a country has no more culture, when 
Canadian culture has become American, do not ask Quebec to save 
you again. You took from us the name of our country and our 
national anthem, but we will make ourselves a country where we 
have our own culture, where we can develop our potential. 
Meanwhile, we will support this bill, provided the case of Québec 
Téléphone and B.C. Tel is settled before we are asked to vote on 
third reading. Enough is enough.
<P>
	We are now backing down from promises made to B.C. Tel and 
Québec Téléphone. You can be sure we will vote against this bill if 
B.C. Tel and Québec Téléphone do not get a fair deal from this 
government.

	The House resumed from October 22, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-49, an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary 
measures in relation to members of certain administrative 
tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak on Bill 
C-49 which came out originally as a housekeeping bill.
<P>
	The bill deals with the administrative changes to boards, 
agencies and tribunals. For the most part it makes fairly minor 
changes, or what would appear to be minor changes. What it does 
not do in all of these boards is improve the accountability. It does 
not improve the competence of the people who are appointed or the 
quality of the appointees.
<P>
	It was the hope of the Reform Party that the government would 
follow through with some of its promises in the red book to bring 
greater accountability to these politically appointed boards and 
commissions. The red book promised:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will take a series of initiatives to restore confidence in the 
institutions of government-and make competence and diversity the criteria for 
federal appointments. Open government will be the watchword of the Liberal 
program.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Liberal government will review the appointment  process to ensure that necessary 
appointments are made on the basis of competence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to focus on a specific area of Bill C-49 that relates to 
the Immigration and Refugee Board. First of all, Bill C-49 has not 
been passed by Parliament and already the Immigration and 
Refugee Board has implemented the changes. It would appear that 
the IRB has little respect for the parliamentary process as it has not 
waited for legislative debate and passage before implementing this 
new process. This just reinforces the Liberals' arrogance and total 
disregard for the parliamentary process.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Prior to this amendment the refugee division was required to 
have a minimum of two members to hear every refugee claim. If 
both members hearing a claim differed on the final determination, 
the negative decision was always overruled. This bill now changes 
the minimum requirement to one member so that if the member 
rules that the claim is not valid, their decision will now stand.
<P>
	At first glance I could favour this amendment. It would appear 
that it would be quickly processing or allowing double the work to 
be done in half the time. However since this change is already in 
effect at the IRB, I have learned that the majority of cases are still 
being heard by panels of two members due to pressure and 
interference by refugee lawyers.
<P>
	These lawyers can choose whether they want one member or two 
members to hear their case, depending on who the member is. If the 
lawyer does not like the single member, then they request a panel of 
two members to increase their chances that their client's claim will 
be accepted. This certainly puts into question the arm's length 
approach that is intended.
<P>
	I have also learned that members are being pressured into 
increasing the number of positive decisions, something the IRB has 
assured me time and time again does not happen but I keep hearing 
about it from people within the system. How can someone make an 
unbiased and objective decision with pressure from the board like 
that placed on them?
<P>
	I ask: Where has this process become more efficient and cost 
effective? The IRB is costing taxpayers about $77 million a year. 
Members of the board have been and continue to be patronage 
appointments comprised of former refugee lawyers and advocates 
that depend on refugee claims for their livelihood. How objective 
would you be if your bread was buttered by the very people that are 
now appearing before you?
<P>
	The entire purpose of the IRB has to be questioned. Guidelines 
are issued to IRB members that really put the entire process into 
question. For example, a woman arrives, claims to be single with 
children, claims to have been abandoned by her husband and now 
fears  persecution in her country. The guidelines pertaining to 
gender related claims indicate that a member is in great difficulty 
to deny this woman refugee status even if her claim is questionable 
because the IRB is non-adversarial. The IRB member cannot 
investigate the woman's allegation because it may put the woman 
at risk. The woman is then given the benefit of the doubt.
<P>
	This guideline is very well known to immigration lawyers and is 
often used as a tactic to ensure that their client remains in Canada. 
After the woman is allowed to stay in Canada, she sponsors her 
husband who she originally claimed abandoned her. This is a case 
of blatant abuse of the refugee determination process. What is the 
purpose of hearing cases like this one when we know full well that 
the outcome is predetermined by the IRB guidelines?
<P>
	One of the purposes of the Immigration Act is to provide 
protection to genuine refugees fearing persecution. I fail to see 
where this is addressed in a guideline such as the one I just 
mentioned.
<P>
	What have the Liberals done to deter this type of abuse? 
Nothing. Something has to be done to ensure that genuine refugees 
are granted the protection they need and that bogus refugees do not 
use this avenue as a means of curtailing the normal immigration 
process.
<P>
	The abusers of the system are causing genuine refugees to be left 
fearing for their lives while these abusers jump the immigration 
queue and benefit from Canada's social and health programs. This 
is unfair to those who rely on this system as a genuine and 
legitimate way of finding protection and safety.
<P>
	The IRB thinks it is doing its job by providing statistics to the 
minister every year showing how many cases have been processed 
and how many refugees are now in Canada. However, what it fails 
to mention is the large volume of backlog cases that leave genuine 
refugees in limbo for an unacceptable length of time. This cannot 
continue. The IRB must now face the fact that it has failed the 
immigration system by allowing the backlog of refugee claims and 
by way of this bill it has made it worse.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	There are qualified public servants within the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration who could assume the responsibilities 
of the Immigration and Refugee Board and would process the 
refugee claims in a more objective and cost effective manner. I see 
no purpose in giving political appointees a place to sit for $86,000 a 
year when there are qualified people already in place to do the job.
<P>
	Another improvement in the immigration system would be for 
officials at the ports of entry to be granted more responsibility in 
the initial determination of refugee claims made upon arrival. They 
are the ones on the front line who see firsthand what documents are 
not present.  They are in a position to ask questions before the 
applicant can be coached by lawyers on what to say. Right now all a 
person has to do upon arrival in Canada is claim to be a refugee and 
they are allowed to stay and have their claim heard, even if the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5800"> 5800 </A></B>
<P>
immigration official knows that they used fraudulent means to get 
here and are not genuine refugees.
<P>
	There are few if any options open to the immigration officers at 
the ports of entry. Therefore, what is the purpose of having 
immigration officers at the ports of entry if we are not going to 
allow them to do their job and make decisions? What have the 
Liberals done to improve this? Nothing.
<P>
	The Reform Party is committed to and relies on a grassroots 
approach to its policies. This government needs to take lessons 
from the Reform Party. Rely on the front line people. They are the 
people who can make a difference and can provide real insight into 
what needs to be done to improve our immigration system.
<P>
	This government is not meeting Canada's humanitarian 
obligations by allowing illegal refugee claimants to stay in Canada.
<P>
	What have the Liberals done so far? Nothing. A positive move 
on the part of Liberals would be to amend the Immigration Act by 
eliminating the IRB altogether and returning this responsibility to 
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. Then again that 
would save Canadian taxpayers millions of dollars a year-

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
recently participated in the fast organized in my riding of Quebec 
by a coalition of organizations to express their rejection of poverty.
<P>
	This 13-day relay fast allowed hundreds of men and women to 
express their basic demands aimed at reducing poverty among 
women, children and the most disadvantaged in Canadian society.
<P>
	I therefore urge this government to stop reducing the deficit on 
the backs of the poor and give the UI money back to the people.
<P>
	In 1993, the Liberals condemned the fact that there were 4.2 
million poor people in Canada. There are now 4.9 million poor 
Canadians, an increase of 700,000, and yet no one on the other side 
of the House is raising the alarm. This silence is disturbing. If I 
were cynical, I would say to the government that the time has come 
for them to take concrete actions so they will look good to the

together on a joint project: the business innovation and

<P>
	The theme for this year's celebration is women and the arts. 
Women in Canada have left a cultural legacy in the arts and their

the arts, writing, sculpture, carving, painting, pottery, photography, 
theatre, television and film, to name a few.

<P>
	Recently, Allied veterans living in Canada had their pensions 
revoked. They came to depend on their pensions for survival, and 
rightly so. These were hard earned pensions awarded because they 
fought side by side with Canadian soldiers.
<P>
	It is unfair to revoke these pensions now that Allied veterans are 
in their most vulnerable years. These defenders of freedom deserve 
the security of the pensions they were promised. I ask all members

pensions for Allied veterans.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in keeping with the spirit of this week, I rise today to 
commend the minister of agriculture on his amazing Halloween 
performance. He has truly given new meaning to the term ``trick or 
treat''.
<P>
	The minister has tricked farmers by failing to deliver 
three-quarters of the actual agriculture promises in the red book, 
keeping only 7 of 28. Specifically, the minister has cut agriculture 
research, failed to defend agriculture aggressively in trade relations 
with the Americans, quickly abandoned his commitment to 
preserve and strengthen article XI of the GATT and has fallen short 
of creating a national whole farm safety net.
<P>
	When the minister attempts to treat farmers with the promise of 
reforms, he tricks them again by not following through, as most 
recently demonstrated by his unspectacular announcement of 
Canadian Wheat Board reforms. The minister is pushing costs into 
farmers' laps through his cost recovery schemes. Reform thinks it 
would be a real treat if the minister would make some of the cost 
disappear, starting with the oversized Pest Management Regulatory 
Agency.

the Liberal's elimination of the Crow benefit and rail abandonment

on our road system.
<P>
	The Trans-Canada Highway system is already overloaded with 
tourist traffic. Increased traffic compromises safety and efficiency 
on our national highway system. The Liberals have a responsibility 
to ensure that the Trans-Canada Highway meets these growing 
demands.
<P>
	The Trans-Canada No. 1 West Association, headed by Regina 
Mayor Doug Archer, presented a transport brief outlining the 
importance of twinning the Trans-Canada from Kenora, Ontario to 
Vancouver, B.C. The Trans-Canada West Association makes the 
point that investing in Canada's Main Street will pay for itself in 
job creation by bringing more trade and tourism dollars to the west.
<P>
	The Liberals have handed out an $87 million interest free loan to 
profitable Bombardier in Quebec. The New Democrats challenge 
this government to invest in twinning the Trans-Canada west to 
bring jobs and growth to the west. This can be done in the next 
budget by dedicating 2 cents a litre for one year of the 14 cents a

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FEDERALINVESTMENTS">FEDERAL INVESTMENTS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal 
government's investment policy discriminates against Quebec and 
has done so since 1981. The fact remains that the federal 
government does not invest enough in Quebec, considering its 
demographic numbers.
<P>
	The figures are there to prove it. Thousands of jobs have been 
lost in Quebec because the federal government does not distribute 
its investments equitably. Over a period of 15 years, , Quebec has 
obtained only 16 per cent of federal investment and 14 per cent of 
investments by Crown corporations.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister blithely insist that all is well, when 
his own government refuses to deal fairly with Quebec in the 
matter of structural spending that creates jobs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Canada has invested money in the 
whole country, in every province of Canada.
<P>
	Unfortunately, sometimes the Bloc Quebecois does not realize 
this. For instance, in the National Capital Region, the Bloc 
Quebecois tends to count all federal investment as being on the 
Ontario side, without considering the fact that one third of the 
Canadian government's operations are on the Quebec side. 
Besides, if we exclude the national capital, I still think the 
distribution is pretty fair.
<P>
	We have a system that establishes a certain balance in our 
society. We have equalization payments that go to the weakest 
sectors in the Canadian economy. We have a formula under which 
last year, we were able to send an additional $500 million to 
Quebec because Quebec's revenue fell far short of the forecast, and 
also because of interest rate levels.
<P>
	For instance, because the government took charge of the 
country's finances in a very systematic way, the Quebec 
government over the past 18 months was able to save $625 million 
in interest rates alone, which represents an enormous amount for 
the people of Quebec. However, the leader of the opposition is 
afraid to mention these positive aspects.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has just admitted quite frankly something we have 
reproached him with for a long time. The money is invested on the 
Ontario side, leaving Quebec with transfer payments, 
unemployment insurance and transfers for social assistance. That is 
the government's policy.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that by concentrating federal 
investment in Ontario and paying unemployment insurance and 
making social assistance transfers to Quebec, he is practising a 
policy of pauperization, which is the kind of policy we do not want 
any more in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we regularly announce investments made in Quebec, so 
much so that we are criticized by the Reform Party because for 
instance, we helped a company that is on its way to become one of 
the biggest aircraft manufacturers in the world. It ranks sixth today 
and will soon rank fourth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5805"> 5805 </A></B>
<P>
	However, we also helped the province of Alberta develop their 
tar sands because we know that it is very important in the interests 
of all Canadians to develop the technology and the potential of 
these reserves so they can be used later on.
<P>
	That is what Canada is about. It means being able to find what 
works in each part of the country so that everyone can benefit. If 
the oil companies make money in Alberta, they pay taxes to the 
central government, which redistributes the money to all Canadian 
provinces, which means Quebec as well as the other provinces. 
Unfortunately, because of Quebec's weak economy, we have to pay 
more equalization payments to Quebec, which we do not do in the 
case of Ontario, Alberta or British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, amazingly, 
the Prime Minister fails to understand that the federal government 
collects taxes from Quebec, year after year, but Quebec gets far less 
in return in the form of procurement of goods and services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> When the federal government buys elsewhere 
using the money of Quebec and the federal government invests 
elsewhere with Quebecers' money, does it not realize that Quebec 
now knows that federalism is making Quebec poor, and 
underinvestment-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> The ministers are shouting, because the truth 
always hurts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Yes, it hurts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, if it would make them shout more, I 
would tell them this: do any of them know that underinvestment by 
the federal government has cost Quebec an average of 8,000 jobs 
annually, the real jobs Quebec needs? And yes, I am a separatist 
because we are sick and tired of being exploited by the federal 
system.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to come from a province that in the 
thirties helped Alberta when it was in trouble. Today, Alberta is 
helping Quebec, so that year after year, Quebec gets about 24 to 25 
per cent of federal spending, while it contributes 21 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> That is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> The opposition keeps trying to find specific programs 
where Quebec gets less than its share. These always seems to be 
programs that require spending to be focused in the National 
Capital Region, for the benefit of all Canadians and Quebecers as 
well, since so many of them work in the National Capital Region.
<P>
	And we will fight separatism. In fact I want to thank the Leader 
of the Opposition for showing his true colours, and calling himself 
a separatist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs does not know 
what he is talking about and the Prime Minister is afraid to answer 
the questions put by the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs talks about political 
programs, when billions of dollars are being invested annually by 
the federal government, but not in Quebec.
<P>
	When opposition members, with figures to back them up, say 
that Quebec has not received its share of federal government and 
Crown corporation investments, the government can create all the 
diversions it wants, but one fact remains: according to the 
government's own figures, Quebec has missed out on over seven 
billion federal dollars over the last 15 years.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister, if he dares to answer it. 
Will the Prime Minister admit that the seven billion dollars not 
invested by the federal government in Quebec over the last 15 years 
that should have been invested there given the size of its population 
represents over 8,100 jobs a year lost to Quebec through his fault?

Speaker, I am not necessarily familiar with the statistics the

know Lucien Bouchard served as a minister in the previous 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> There are gaps in his memory.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> What I know is this: on October 21, 1996, we 
invested $87 million in Canadair. On October 21, 1996 we invested 
close to one million dollars in Matériaux Techniques Côté; on 
October 11, $4.25 million in Ericsson Communications; on 
October 9, almost one million in the École polytechnique. There 
are many examples.
<P>

	I fail to understand why the Bloc Quebecois always wants 
Quebec to have such a negative image, when it is a powerful 
province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is trying to lead the debate off track. We are 
talking about investments in federal government buildings, land, 
and rolling stock, and he is talking about specific projects. If he 
wants to play that game, 1,000 question periods would not be 
enough for him to get through all the investment projects in 
Ontario. That is the reality of the matter.

	The federal government does Quebec out of $1.3 billion in 
procurement annually. Now we learn that Quebec is receiving far 
less than its share of federal government and crown corporation 
investments.
<P>
	How was it that the Prime Minister was patting himself on the 
back over the weekend for his government's fine performance, 
when the federal government has had it in for Quebec for at least 
the last 15 years, depriving it of billions of dollars in investments 
and tens of thousands of jobs? I would like him to explain that to 
me.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ministers are ready to reply to these attacks, so there is 
no need for me to rise in my place.
<P>
	If the hon. members truly had Quebecers' best interests at heart, 
instead of creating political uncertainty, instead of calling 
themselves sovereignists for a year and a half, and then admitting 
today that they are separatists, if they were truly concerned with 
what is best for all the people of Quebec, they would be following 
our lead and pushing for political stability, so that the private sector 
would invest in Quebec, just as it does in the rest of Canada.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
Liberal convention last weekend the Prime Minister bragged at 
great length about the Liberal way and Liberal values. Today 
Canadians have seen exactly what that Liberal way means: a dirty, 
American style smear campaign full of distortions and 
misrepresentations.
<P>
	Canadians want to debate the real issues facing us. Reformers 
want to debate those same issues as well. Yet it seems the Prime 
Minister and his very Prime Minister's Office would rather wallow 
in the political mire.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister this. Who authorized this political 
smear campaign? Was the Prime Minister aware of this fax attack? 
If not, does he approve of his party's and staff's dirty tricks?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry, we just said that the Reform Party and their 
leader had a great reception in Washington with Newt Gingrich. If 
he regrets his visit and if he wants to say so we will withdraw that.
<P>
	We said that they oppose anything we do to build unity in this 
country. Whenever there is controversy about the two official 
languages in this House they are always opposed to having the 
reality confirmed: that we are very proud that English and French 
are the two official languages of this nation.
<P>
	If they want to say that they support bilingualism in Canada, in 
the next letter we send-the same type of  letter that they send 
themselves-of course we will say that they have converted to 
rationality and Canadianism and vote for things that will help to 
keep this country together.
<P>
	We travel the land. When anything divisive comes up in the 
House of Commons you have members who get up to try to score 
cheap political points against the government. They hope they will 
gain votes by division. We gain votes in promoting unity from sea 
to sea.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
type of arrogance you have just heard voiced by the Prime Minister 
right now is exactly an indication of what is wrong in this country, 
just because there are differences in political beliefs, just because 
we happen to have differences on policies about the Official 
Languages Act.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	This kind of behaviour from this Prime Minister is nothing more 
than a bold-faced lie. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, we are in the heat of debate. And 
from time to time in the heat of battle we use words that are 
unparliamentary. Would the hon. member please withdraw the last 
few words, ``a bold-faced lie'' before we proceed.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, out of respect for the House and 
for you I withdraw that comment.
<P>
	May I also say that when I sat back here as the only member of 
my party when we went through the Meech Lake debate and the 
Charlottetown accord debate I was labelled an enemy of Canada 
and someone who had no respect for Canadianism. I refute that. 
Just remember which side won on the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	We thought we had seen the end of this kind of stuff when the 
Tories were turfed out of office in 1993. These kinds of smear 
campaigns just go on and on. We are wondering if we see the ghost 
of Mulroney past in the Prime Minister's Office now.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister this. Is this kind of smear stuff the 
Liberal way? Does this malicious fax attack reflect Liberal values? 
Does this American style smear campaign represent the Liberal 
way? How is this integrity in action?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. member is willing to pretend that Reform 
members voted for gun control, fine. But I was in the House of 
Commons and I know they all voted against gun control. Do they 
want to change their stand on that? I do not think that it is a smear 
campaign when we relay the facts of their votes in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Who thought that the blacks and gays should go to the back of 
the shop? If they did not say that, fine, I would be happy. However, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5807"> 5807 </A></B>
<P>
it was said and the people of Canada have the right to know what 
was said. If Reformers want to withdraw that I will be happy to say 
that they regret what they said.
<P>
	If Reformers want to say that the investment in Bombardier is as 
good as the investment in the tar sands I will write it in the next 
letter. They never attack us when we do something for Alberta but 
if we do something for another part of Canada they complain. This 
is the road to division. We want to help everybody in every part of 
the country so they will all have the same opportunities.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister said we voted against gun control. I would like it on 
the record here today what the truth is. Two of our members, the 
members for Calgary Centre and North Vancouver, supported Bill 
C-68 according to their constituents' wishes.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of all of us as members of Parliament to 
represent those people who we came here to represent. I know there 
are many members of the public across Canada who are disgusted 
with what they have seen in this and what they are listening to on 
talk shows. They are tired of this kind of political smear campaign 
and all this dreaming and dressing up that the Prime Minister is 
doing right now.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians want to talk about tax relief. They want to talk about 
increased funding for health care because they have seen the 
system ravaged under these Liberals. They want to make sure that 
my party's leader, who offered a one on one debate with the Prime 
Minister, a one on one debate with no gimmicks, no frills, no 
gadgets, just the two of them, dancing toe to toe.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister debate with the leader of the Reform 
Party of Canada, one on one, on the issues, only on the issues and 
the facts of lower taxes and more jobs?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am here at least three days a week, more than any of my 
predecessors. I am in my seat in the House to debate with the leader 
of the Reform Party. He is the one who said that he is wasting his 
time debating in the House.
<P>
	He is travelling the country in a bus while as a member of 
Parliament he should not be afraid to be in the House of Commons 
to face off every day. But he would rather be sitting in the back of a 
bus preaching about his conversion.
<P>
	Not long ago he was giving us a tough time on medicare. Now he 
has been converted on the road to Damascus. Now he wants to 
spend money on medicare.
<P>
	I remember he said that we were not cutting enough and when he 
said that medicare should be transferred to the private sector. We

not, will always have medicare available to them in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
atmosphere is particularly highly charged today.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of International Trade. At the 
beginning of this month, the European Union announced its 
intention to lodge an official complaint with the World Trade 
Organization concerning the American Helms-Burton law with its 
extraterritorial measures. The following day, Canada announced its 
intention to take part in this process initiated by the Europeans.
<P>
	Since Canada justified its participation in the European 
complaint by saying it was its duty to protest against the American 
law, how can the minister explain that Canada has not yet called for 
the formation of a special group under NAFTA to settle this dispute 
once and for all?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I indicated previously, we continue with the 
protest under NAFTA, but we are also in a position to join many 
other countries in having this matter adjudicated before the WTO. 
We are readying to prepare a case in support of the European 
Union.
<P>
	One of the strengths of the position Canada has put forward is 
that we have been able to get the support of countries right around 
the world that know the action by the United States is wrong. We 
will continue to work with those countries in a unified way to 
continue in our action, and the WTO is a good forum for the next 
step.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, title 4 
of the American Helms-Burton law, which this government has not 
yet attempted to counteract, by the way, forbids the entry into the 
United States of Canadian businessmen and their families, under 
the pretext that their companies are supposedly trafficking in 
American properties in Cuba.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that the best way to counteract this 
definitively is to call for a special working group under NAFTA?
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

there is a  multilateral agreement on investment. This is very key to

<P>
	We will continue to work with other countries. We will continue 
to use a number of forums to protest Helms-Burton and to get the 
message across clearly to the United States and other countries that 
unilateral extraterritorial action attempting to impose their will,

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> For the record, Mr. Speaker, this government has 
closed more hospitals than any government in the country with $3 
billion in health care cuts. It is time that was on the record.
<P>
	During the last election campaign the Tories ran attack ads and 
the Liberals could not believe it. They went ballistic at some of the 
ads. The entire country went ballistic. We spoke out against it. Now 
they are doing exactly the same thing. How can the government 
justify that hypocrisy?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Again, my colleagues, there are certain words that 
trigger responses on both sides. I know the hon. member would not 
want to use the word ``hypocrisy'' again.
<P>
	I am going to permit the right hon. Prime Minister to answer the 
question as he was on his feet.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very surprised. It was just a political debate. Of 
course I said that they voted against the gun control bill. Two voted 
for it. Some of my members voted against it. It was part of the 
debate, but the policy was my party's, passed by a resolution of the 
party two years ago and we implemented the gun control 
legislation.
<P>
	The Reform Party is opposed to gun control, but two of their 
members voted for it. That is good. We accept that. All of that was 
in the article. There was all the normal debate.
<P>
	When we said that they were very comfortable a year and a half 
ago when Mr. Gingrich was the new political star in the United 
States, the member for Calgary Southwest took the first plane and 
was seen on TV holding hands with Newt and so on. It is amazing 
that I was not invited by Newt and I do not know why.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	It is part of the political debate in the United States when the 
Republicans talk about a tax cut before they balance their books. 
We do not subscribe to that. We know that and we think we have to 
stay the course. Suddenly Reform changes its position. If I am not 
mistaken Reform has had four different positions on the GST in the 
last three years so it must have another one for the election. Who 
knows?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has a lot of gall lecturing us on the GST.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister went to China, we did not accuse him 
of supporting summary executions in cavorting with the leadership 
of that regime and that is something they believe in. I want to point 
out the little inconsistency here.
<P>
	My question is a follow-up to the question of the caucus chair of 
the Reform Party. Will the Prime Minister commit to meeting the 
leader of the Reform Party in a one on one debate out of this place 
where we can have a full fledged debate on the issues, not on a 
bunch of smear campaign ideas from the Americans?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am here face to face with him every week, so he can ask 
me all the questions from the Reform Party in question period. He 
can ask his own members to shut up, and ask all the questions 
himself and I might reply to them. Sometimes I might feel that my 
ministers can plug them easily too. It is part of the political debate.

thick skin or they will not go very far.

Speaker, in spite of the offensiveness of the preamble to the 
question, the substance of the question is good.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	In deciding to make this investment we looked at the criteria that 
were described when we announced the technology partnership 
program and the fact that we were engaged in a risk sharing venture 
of research and development, in this case the development of an 
extended version of the Canadair regional jet. We looked at the 
ability of that product to be marketed internationally. We looked at 
the number of jobs that were involved: either being sustained or 
created by the investment. We looked at the likelihood of the 
government recouping its investment fully. As I said yesterday, 
when we pass 400 planes we will make a profit on it.
<P>
	The member lists some facts. It is a fact that despite our trade 
surplus the only high technology sector in which we have a trade 
surplus is aerospace. It is a fact that this company, Canadair, is one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5811"> 5811 </A></B>
<P>
of our finest companies and one of the best in the world. We will 
invest in our winners.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting that when we start to use a little innuendo like the 
government members do they find it offensive. What is good for 
the goose is good for the gander, so either you take it or you don't.
<P>
	On the issue of research and development the criteria that were 
used in this instance are still very suspect. The Minister of Industry 
picks the one company that is already number six, with $6.6 billion 
in assets, with cash in the bank of $200 million, with profits of 
$100 million. That company has enough money to do a lot of its 
own R and D. Were there matching funds by Bombardier for R and 
D and if so, how much? And is this just the first part of a three-part 
instalment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no, it was not matching money. In fact there was three 
times the money from the company in this investment. The ratio of 
the Canadian R and D is 25 per cent.
<P>
	The hon. member should know it is implicit in his question that 
if a company succeeds, then it should not be helped. If he were to 
understand a little bit about the structure of this industry which is a 
very important industry to Canada, he would know that every other 
country, and there are not that many, that have a fully developed 
aerospace industry, are supported either by state ownership or by 
indirect support through defence procurement or other measures.
<P>
	We have a study, and I will be happy to give him another copy, so 
that he can see what those support mechanisms are. In this case the 
kind of thinking that he brings to this file, as evidenced in his 
question, is the very thinking that 40 years ago led to the 
destruction of the Avro Arrow and set Canada's high tech sector 
back years.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMMENTSDURINGQUESTIONPERIOD">COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today on two 
points of order dealing with the decorum during question period 
from the party of the fresh start opposite. It is the first time in eight 
years in Parliament that I have risen on a point of order with respect 
to decorum.
<P>
	The member for Medicine Hat, in exchanges during question 
period, was heard to repeatedly refer to the right hon. Prime 
Minister as a sleazebag. This was clearly  heard by people on this 
side of the House. In addition, some members on this side heard an 
unfortunate four letter word that was uttered after we objected to 
the use of the word sleaze.
<P>
	The second point of order with respect to the decorum of the 
House has to do with the actions of the member for Beaver River 
who, in an exchange with the member for London West, made a 
gesture which we believe was inappropriate.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We all agree that today was a rather spirited day 
on both sides. I intervened on two occasions because the nature of 
the words raised hackles on both sides of the House.
<P>
	I did not hear the word to which the hon. member referred. I did 
not see any gestures. If the hon. member wishes me to look at the 
blues I will, and I will revisit the television tapes. As for the 
gesture, I do not say this facetiously but how can this be recorded?
<P>
	I would urge members on days such as this, and we have them 
from time time, that we try to discipline ourselves as much as we 
can and try not to use offensive words.
<P>
	Today, according to my count which is not official, we had 10 
questioners rise in question period. We average around 17 on any 
given day. Sometimes the questions are a little bit long and 
sometimes the answers are a little bit long. When the answers are 
protracted, words are exchanged in the House. Not that I condone 
it, but this has been going on for years. It is something that we learn 
to live with as parliamentarians. I would urge members, however, 
to conduct themselves as parliamentarians and, as much as 
possible, to stay away from those words that seem to incite both 
sides of the House.
<P>
	I would rule that the hon. member does not have a point of order 
but surely a point of debate.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
because I was named, I think I only have one recourse and that is to 
ask you for just a few seconds of your time. If blowing a kiss to the 
member for London West is offensive then all I can say is, forgive 
me.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> If I had my way, which I do not always have, it 
would be better to kiss each other to death than to fight each other 
to death. If that is the offensive gesture, I hope we would let these 
points of order just sit here for today. We will be back tomorrow, 
same time. I am waiting for you.

	The House resumed from October 28 consideration of the 
motion and the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe 
the member for Vancouver North was on questions and answers 
when the debate stopped yesterday. Are we continuing from that 
point?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> From the information I have, we were finished 
with the time allowed and therefore I am proceeding now with the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, my point 
of order is the same. My understanding was that the hon. member 
for North Vancouver still had some time remaining on questions 
and comments.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Now we are on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a little confusing sometimes. After the exciting 
question period we had today, we kind of wonder whether we are 
following proper procedure.
<P>
	What I am going to talk about this afternoon is what is a promise. 
What is it, really? A promise is sometimes defined as something 
that one person makes. But I have found during my lifetime that 
usually if I made a promise there was somebody else involved. The 
consequences sometimes bore more strongly on the person to 
whom the promise was made than on me when I made the promise.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	There are promises which are made verbally. In my experience I 
have also made a lot of promises that were signed. When I went to 
banks to borrow money, to dealerships to buy implements, I usually 
had to make a promise that if I took delivery of the implement I 
would also have to pay for it and also service it properly if I wanted 
a guarantee or warranty on it.
<P>
	One of the most important promises I made in my life was to a 
beautiful young girl whom I tried to convince  she had no better 
man to look for than me. That was not so easy. I spent quite a bit of 
time at that. In the end I did have to sign my name to really fulfil a 
promise and to convince her that I would do what I promised.
<P>
	After 35 years, sometimes I do not think I have totally kept my 
promises because there have been a few harsh words between us, 
although I promised there would never be because I was the perfect 
gentlemen and would be the perfect husband.
<P>
	We sometimes do not quite fulfil our promises. As we have 
heard over the last couple of days sometimes these promises go 
back to Scripture. I listened to an interview with Mrs. Billy Graham 
on the issue of divorce. She had made a promise to her husband, 
saying that she should stay with him through thick or thin, health 
and sickness, richness and poverty. She was asked if she ever 
intended to break that promise, that she would not say with her 
husband until death did they part. She said: ``No, I never thought of 
reneging on that promise, but a lot of times I have thought of 
speeding up the process that he would leave me sooner than later''.
<P>
	We do have to honour our promises even if sometimes we do not 
want to fulfil them in the context that we agreed to.
<P>
	What does a signed promise mean? A signed promise means that 
if we do not abide by the contract or the promise, somebody will 
probably bear some very severe consequences, not just the person 
who made the promise but the other party to the promise.
<P>
	I found out early in my life that if I wanted to have credibility it 
did not really matter whether it was a promise made verbally or a 
signed promise. In the end it had the same results if I reneged on it 
or partially fulfilled it. I think one of the most pleasant experiences 
I had in keeping a promise was to my two youngest grandsons. As 
it happened, we had been given by our daughter and son-in-law the 
privilege of looking after the boys for the weekend while they went 
on a short holiday. Since grandpa wants to impress his grandsons, I 
made a commitment to take them to McDonald's on Saturday 
night. This was in the middle of winter and I had forgotten that 
weather conditions could change drastically from Friday to 
Saturday.
<P>
	About 2.30 in the afternoon my wife said ``you know, grandpa, I 
think you will have to break your promise because that storm is just 
to bad and you cannot take your grandsons out on the road''. We 
had about 12 miles to travel.
<P>
	When I suggested to my grandsons that there might be a little 
problem with the weather they found all kinds of excuses to throw 
at me, saying that it was not that bad outside: ``We have been with 
dad through a lot worse storms than this. You have the old 4x4 and 
we have the cell phone. There are all kinds of way we can get back 
and forth''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5814"> 5814 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	Finally I realized that I probably could not wiggle out of this 
promise. At 35 degrees below zero we decided to take the old 4x4 
and head 10 miles down the road to McDonald's about six o'clock 
in the afternoon. There were not many people in that McDonald's. 
When I walked in with my wife and the two little grandchildren 
they kind of looked at me as if to say ``hey, is this man a little sick? 
Why is he taking those two little kids out on a night like this?'' 
When I explained to them that I had made a promise, my grandsons 
looked at me and said ``grandpa, he can do it. We'll get home. He 
can keep that promise''.
<P>
	I was the proudest grandpa that day because I was the only one 
with two little children there, stupid and foolish as it seemed, but I 
did keep my promise. I gained a lot of respect from my grandsons, 
even if I would have rather had it the other way.
<P>
	Sometimes a broken promise can be very hurtful. To me, it really 
worked the other way and I gained a lot of respect. It cost me a little 
extra caution, to drive more carefully and to be a bit more cautious 
on the road, but we did get home safely and I felt very good about 
keeping that promise.
<P>
	When I look at some of the tragedies that we see in the world 
today where promises were not kept, it is sad to see that we 
probably do not give enough attention to what a promise is.
<P>
	In the olden days I heard my dad and my grandfather say that the 
handshake was a promise and it was a deal and that was enough. 
Today that does not seem to be true any more. We have to have 
things legally drawn up and we have to abide by the guidelines.
<P>
	What has it cost this government to break a number of promises? 
One of them is the promise of the GST. We have seen that promise 
broken. We have seen that now it will cost other taxpayers about 
roughly $1 billion. I do not know how this government is going to 
face the electorate next time, especially in the west where this $1 
billion is going to come from.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to touch on is the Canadian Wheat 
Board. We know that this government promised during the election 
that it would hold a referendum especially on barley marketing. 
That promise has not been honoured. It may be honoured yet before 
this Parliament is over, but it has caused a lot of hard feelings. It 
has more or less developed a lot of tension between different 
farmers, different families even and different communities.
<P>
	Is it really worth breaking a promise which creates this tension 
and distress in the farming community? If I had been the 
agriculture minister that is one of the first things that I would have 
honoured, holding a plebiscite. That is what democracy is about. It 
is to let individuals decide what is best for them in their businesses, 
in their homes and in their governments.
<P>
	About a year ago I saw news stories where Mr. Beswick did 
resign over the friction inside the wheat board on which type of 
marketing was better. He stated that the bungling of the wheat 
board had cost barley producers $180 million that year. We can 
understand why there is friction between farmers and why they 
would like this to be resolved.
<P>
	That gives us a small idea not just that the $180 million was gone 
but that there was confusion and friction in the agriculture 
community. What did that do to that community? It pitted farmer 
against farmer. It also pitted business against farmers. When a 
farmer loses a dollar business loses just as much or more.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	I have recently been approached by a number of business people 
who were very upset that this has gone to the point where some 
farmers have been charged horrendous penalties through monetary 
forfeitures. One of the farmers is in jail and it looks like there may 
be another one in jail very shortly because he is going to refuse to 
pay some of his fines. I am wondering where it is going to end.
<P>
	We do not need this type of friction or tension in the community 
especially today when I see grain prices drifting lower and lower 
every day.
<P>
	Why are we debating this issue about promises when I ponder 
some of the statements that have been made and look at what the 
four members of Parliament did to establish a task force minority 
report on the independence of the Chair or the Speaker of the 
House? I wonder how these four members, at that time being in 
opposition, could now just ignore what they said.
<P>
	I would just like to read into the record exactly what was said. 
This is what they said about the independence of the Chair: ``In 
order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in an effort to 
reduce the level of partisanship, when the Speaker is from the 
government party two of the junior Chair officers should be from 
the opposition so that the four presiding officer positions are shared 
equally by government and opposition''. Further down in the 
statement they say: ``If the Speaker were from the government 
party, the deputy speaker would be from the opposition, the next 
officer from the government-'', and so forth.
<P>
	I would say that is a tremendous statement. That goes to show 
that these four members, while sitting in opposition, were really 
determined and honest in analysing the partisanship that was 
happening in Parliament at that time.
<P>
	I am wondering why it would be so hard to fulfil that little 
promise today. This promise is not going to cost them anything 
financially. It is not going to give them  any more or less power in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5815"> 5815 </A></B>
<P>
this House. It would only, I would think, supplement their stature in 
the public that they honoured this small promise that was intimated 
to be made if they were elected.
<P>
	I think it was probably important at that time to the government 
to add this to the appendix of the red book to show that this 
government wanted to democratize this Parliament the way it 
should be democratized, that it should be a House where there is 
equal opportunity, that it should be a House where the guidelines 
and partisanship were neutral or as neutral as they could hope it to 
be.
<P>
	When we look at the debate we have been entering into for the 
last day and a half, it is astounding that this little promise could 
create such a partisan debate when I see that there has not been a 
single member from the Bloc or from the government really 
supporting this statement that was made in the last Parliament to 
reinforce the idea that this should be a House, through the Speaker, 
as impartial as possible.
<P>
	We can see what it has done in the debate. It has kept us thinking, 
but the decision that we are going to make tonight will not be one 
that is going to be beneficial to the House unless something historic 
happens.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	I wonder how the government would feel if the member for 
Kingston and the Islands decided to honour his commitment 
through the statement he made when he was in opposition. I 
wonder what the Liberal government would say if this member for 
Kingston and the Islands said: ``I am going to stick by my 
statement of four years ago or so, walk the floor and join the Bloc 
or the Reform to honour the commitment that my nomination as 
deputy chairman could be held''.
<P>
	I would like to see what the Liberal government would say. That 
is the way he could honour his commitment. If he made that choice, 
I am sure not going to say that I would not honour his intentions. 
He could sit as an independent. He could join one of the other 
parties. That is the way this member could stay true to his 
commitment of four years ago.
<P>
	It would be a tremendous credit to the House if this member 
fulfilled that commitment. I would really appreciate it and I think 
everybody would respect him more for it. It would probably be a 
pretty strong pill to swallow but I think it would be well accepted. 
Whether it would be accepted by the government is another issue. I 
am sure the opposition or the independents in the House would 
welcome another member on this side.
<P>
	From what we have heard from the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands, he is an honourable member and a very fair 
member on the committees he has served on. I would love to see 
this member make that final decision. It would be precedent 
setting. It would be something this House would remember for 
perpetuity. I do not think we would run into the situation ever again 
where that would have to be debated.
<P>
	He made this commitment before an election and he knew the 
statement he made was correct; so much more power to the 
member to fulfil it.
<P>
	How is this government going to face the electorate in the next 
election when it cannot keep this one little promise which did not 
cost this government a single nickel? All it would have done is 
made this House more democratic. It would have fulfilled some of 
the promises the Liberals made to be honourable, fair and to treat 
people equally. It would only be a plus to them.
<P>
	If I had to go back and campaign on a little broken promise like 
this, I am sure my electorate would not believe any big promises I 
made during the campaign. If I was not true to the little promises, 
the teeny-weeny promises that were costly neither to government 
nor to opposition, then how would people ever believe me on the 
bigger promises like the GST, like the referendum on barley 
marketing, like a few others I should mention? I do not want to 
create too much hostility on the other side. At that point we could 
run into another lively debate like we had during the question and 
answer period.
<P>
	I enjoy listening to the comments from members on the other 
side because I know they will try to distort the issues somewhat and 
there will be some political rhetoric. I can deal with a little of it but 
when it gets too thick and too foggy then at times it becomes 
difficult to sit quietly and seal my lips.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	We know today that we cannot even dare blow a kiss to 
opposition members. They get too excited. It irritates them. I 
would not want to cause a riot in the House just because of a few 
comments I might make.
<P>
	I would really like to see how some of the members on the other 
side are going to deal with the issue of breaking the promise to 
make the Speaker impartial and to make the Speaker as effective as 
possible in the House when they have not even tried to accomplish 
that in the vice-chairmanship of all the standing committees. We 
have seen how democracy operates there. We see the whip walking 
into the room, counting the heads and identifying the people who 
might all of a sudden vote against the government.
<P>
	We have seen it happen a number of times that when someone 
voted against government policy they were demoted, taken off the 
committee and replaced by somebody else. I find it very hard to 
believe that is democracy. It is not keeping the promise to make the 
procedures of the House more democratic and to have more free 
votes.
<P>
	I wonder what the electorate will say in the next election, 
especially after some of the comments made in  question period 
today about the way the government is trying to divert attention 
from the real issues. We are being called extremists. The 
government is reneging on a little promise to make the Chair more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5816"> 5816 </A></B>
<P>
impartial. How can we be the extremists? The extremism comes 
from the other side. That little democracy which could help the 
House-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. member's time 
has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I fail to see a quorum in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will ask the clerk to count the members 
present.
<P>
	There is certainly not a quorum. Call in the members.
<P>
	And the bells having rung:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are now 20 members in the House, 
it would appear.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the member for Kingston and the Islands. I 
believe he will be the first person in the history of the House of 
Commons who will have come to the position of deputy speaker 
under closure. I think that is really something. He has been a very 
memorable member.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> May he rest in peace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> May he rest in peace.
<P>
	He has been a very memorable member. I think of him as 
constantly popping up with his Reform green book. While 
entertaining, nonetheless it has not been quite as entertaining as 
this whole process. He was one of the authors of the idea of the 
continuing effort to reform this archaic institution to create more 
independence in the Chair in an effort to reduce the level of 
partisanship.
<P>
	We all agree that we have no difficulty with the qualifications of 
this member but there is a complete lack of understanding of the 
principle involved. I realize it is really difficult for the Liberals to 
understand principle but we had people from the other side of this 
House saying this whole thing of creating impartiality, of getting 
people from the opposition to be officials in the House, it was not a 
promise.
<P>
	In reality it was contained in their pulp fiction, the appendix to 
their red book. To try to weasel out of this promise, which was a 
promise simply because they chose to include it in the appendix, I 
find is really very unfortunate and perhaps says something about 
their attitude toward the issue of integrity in government.
<P>
	Over the weekend 1.4 million documents were distributed in 
newspapers. The document was called ``Commitments are only as 
strong as our will to fulfil them''. I do not know if these documents 
were all from the 1.4 million Canadians who are unemployed, but 
on the front of this document it was noted that this was a statement 
by the Prime Minister. I would like to read from this Liberal 
document:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are no vague ``philosophies'' and empty promises in ``Creating 
Opportunity''. The Red Book is full of specific plans to improve our society, our 
economy and our collective strength. One of the reasons that Canadians so 
enthusiastically support the Red Book is because it was crafted after significant 
consultation with Canadians from every corner of our country. We asked what was 
important to you. We listened. And we're still listening. In turn, you have given [the 
Prime Minister] the most important mandate in the world: your trust. He and his 
government are fulfilling, and will continue to fulfil, the commitments you helped to 
create.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let us take a look at the last couple of weeks and let us be very 
blunt. We are talking now about facts. I know Liberals do not like 
to talk about facts. When the Prime Minister was addressing young 
people in a high school in Manitoba he told a story that he sat on a 
corner on a chair with a homeless gentlemen. It rather piqued the 
interest of the reporters and they asked ``who is this person, when 
did this happen and what is going on here?''
<P>
	It was found that this story, taken to be true by these young 
people in Manitoba, was without basis in fact. The story that the 
Prime Minister had told these young people of Canada was a 
falsehood. He did not sit on corners with homeless people. He did 
not consult with homeless people.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The closest he could come was in the interim period when he had 
previously been elected and then re-elected when he happened to 
run into somebody on the street. That was the Prime Minister and 
his imaginary friend.
<P>
	On the same trip this person we are supposed to trust was telling 
us that one of the great things he and his government had done was 
to move interest rates down from 14 per cent and 15 per cent. It 
depended on how much farther he went west how big the number 
got. He started at 13. Then it became 14 and then it became a 15 per 
cent interest rate that the Liberals were facing when they came into 
government. The difficulty is that the number was only 9.5 per 
cent, a minor discrepancy. This is the person Canada is supposed to 
trust.
<P>
	``As a result of the 14, 15 and 16 per cent interest rates'', he said, 
``we have saved the taxpayer $7,000 in interest payments''. Then it 
was $8,000 in interest payments and by the time he got out west it 
was $9,000 in interest payments. In fact the number is $2,700, a 
little less than $9,000.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5817"> 5817 </A></B>
<P>
	We are talking about integrity. We are talking about integrity 
of government and people who will stand to be counted and tell 
it like it is.
<P>
	I am repeating only facts, which is important. I will quote the 
Prime Minister from television in Winnipeg: ``It was a big gamble 
we took when we decided to have a detailed program like this. I 
didn't expect that everything will have been perfect, but we will 
have been well above 90 per cent by the time we will call an 
election, probably close to 100 per cent''.
<P>
	I guess what actually happened was-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> It sounds like his 
imaginary friend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> His imaginary friend got the better of him again.
<P>
	I guess the people over at the PMO who are so good at putting 
out distortions of truth decided that 90 per cent was a little too 
much. They said to the Prime Minister: ``Why don't you go to the 
people on the Liberal convention weekend and use 78 per cent? Do 
not use 79. That sounds like we are fudging it. We don't really want 
to get down around 75 because then people will be talking about 
three-quarters. Why don't we choose 78 per cent?''
<P>
	We did fundamentally the same thing. The Reform Party put out 
a score card and came in at 30 per cent. We said the Liberals had 
not addressed the issue or even come remotely close to solving the 
issue of interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	What did the Liberals say? This is their brand new pulp fiction, a 
record of achievement. Now there is a joke. Page 18 of the 
document states that a Liberal government will be committed to the 
elimination of interprovincial trade barriers within Canada and will 
address the issue urgently, and they have a check mark.
<P>
	We noted they had not even come remotely close to it but they 
put it in the red book. We are talking integrity. They clearly 
indicated that as far as they were concerned they had achieved the 
objective of doing away with interprovincial trade barriers.
<P>
	Why was it on Monday morning, when I was in their policy 
session, the following National Liberal Women's Commission 
resolution passed? It read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada encourage the Government of 
Canada to commit itself, in all matters of internal trade, to facilitating removal of the 
number and complexity of impediments to interprovincial trade.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If, when they put out this pulp fiction on Thursday they had 
already done it, why was the National Liberal Women's 
Commission passing a resolution saying they should do it the next 
day?
<P>
	I have another one by the Liberal Party of Canada, Ontario. It 
read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada request that the federal government 
pursue a comprehensive agreement to complete the Economic Union of Canada by 
introducing a constitutional provision stating that Canada is an Economic Union 
wherein goods, services, people, and capital can have full mobility within the entire 
nation''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What a great idea but they just did it the day before, did they not? 
They said so in their book. What is this? That was not good enough. 
The Liberal Party of Ontario passed another one. It read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada urges the federal government to 
negotiate with the provinces to ensure the portability of professional qualifications 
between provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister, this person with the imaginary friend, had 
just finished telling us they had done it. Why did they put out this 
book when in fact they had not done it, to the extent they even 
passed resolutions to say they should do it?
<P>
	Now the big whopper is ``an agenda for jobs and growth''. This 
government promised Canadians jobs, jobs, jobs. Is that not 
terrific? It was like the promise that we would have independence 
in the chair in this place by putting opposition members in the chair 
of this place. ``Oh, gee, we are not going to do that''. There is 
another broken promise.
<P>
	What about jobs, jobs, jobs? I would have been just totally 
mortified if my caucus had done what the National Liberal Caucus 
did at the convention. Believe it or not, this is really something. 
They actually put in:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the twin forces of economic globalization and rapid technological 
change have resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout all 
sectors of the labour market;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the rate of unemployment remains stubbornly high with too many 
people competing for too few jobs;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the young people, in particular-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I should parenthesize that they are 18 per cent unemployed.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the young people, in particular, are finding it increasingly difficult to 
obtain full time employment;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a resolution of the National Liberal Caucus. It is the most 
brilliant idea the Liberals have:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Be it resolved that the Liberal Party of Canada recommends that work sharing be 
promoted with employers and unions as part of the effort to redistribute working 
time-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the most brilliant idea the people on the other side of the 
House have come up with. Then they have the audacity to send out 
from the Prime Minister's office, at the expense of taxpayers, 
distortions about where the Reform Party is coming from and that 
somehow we do not have any new ideas.
<P>
	We do have some ideas. For example, one distortion of truth was 
that our program would rob the poor to pay the rich. Let us take a 
look at exactly what the Reform Party would do. We would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5818"> 5818 </A></B>
<P>
increase the basic personal income tax exemption from $6,456 to 
$7,900, giving tax relief to every taxpayer.
<P>
	We would increase the spousal amount from $5,380 also to 
$7,900 which would level the playing field for parents who choose 
to stay home to look after young children. It would help families 
meet their needs in a more demanding economy.
<P>
	We would eliminate the 3 per cent and 5 per cent federal surtaxes 
introduced by their brother in the federal Tories as part of our 
commitment to simplify and flatten taxes.
<P>
	We would cut the employers unemployment insurance premium 
by 28 per cent, thereby reducing the job killing payroll taxes.
<P>
	We would extend the $3,000 to $5,000 child care deduction to all 
parents including those who care for their children at home.
<P>
	It is a matter of coming up with new ideas. It is a matter of 
making sure the people at the bottom end of the scale are looked 
after first. That is what the Reform Party is about. In this instance a 
family of four with one income earner would see an immediate tax 
reduction of 89 per cent. There would be one million fewer 
taxpayers at the bottom end of the scale as a result of the initiatives 
of the Reform Party.
<P>
	At the top end of the scale for a family of four with one income 
earner earning $100,000 the reduction would only be 3 per cent as 
opposed to 89 per cent at the bottom end.
<P>
	And these people have the audacity to say we are robbing the 
poor to pay the rich. These people are robbing the poor to pay the 
rich. We will do a complete turnaround so that the people at the 
bottom end of the scale are the people who are the most 
advantaged. I just do not understand these people opposite at all.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	As my colleague from Lisgar-Marquette noted, if the Liberals 
cannot keep the small promises, how in the world can they keep the 
big ones? Here we have an issue of honesty, integrity and moving 
forward in the impartiality of the running of the House and they 
cannot even do that. When the National Liberal Caucus has to 
resort to their very best idea of job sharing, give me a break.
<P>
	We have some ideas. We would create jobs through smaller 
government. We would put an end to overspending and lower taxes. 
We would make government smaller by eliminating waste, 
duplication and red tape. In particular, if we take a look at the 
portfolio I am responsible for, we would take a look at why the 
heritage minister felt compelled to come up with a $20 million 
Canada Information Office. What an absolutely  brilliant idea when 
every department and every ministry of the government has its very 
own information office.
<P>
	In addition, there is also Inquiries Canada with a budget of $4 
million. Why did we need this? Maybe we have a bit of a clue in the 
way in which the Liberals went about hiring the people for the 
office. It does not come under any rules and regulations with 
respect to the normal hiring practice of government. I wonder why. 
I wonder if maybe they may be choosing to hire exactly the people 
they want. I will bet there is an election coming and they want to 
have some people they will be able to hand pick at taxpayers' 
expense to bring into this office.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> They wouldn't do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Let us take a look at this. What they have done in 
addition we will never know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Don't be so cynical.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> What am I supposed to say when the Liberals turn 
around and under a cabinet order provide no information or details 
to anyone about how the funds are spent? The cabinet has closed, 
slammed and locked Canadians out of this $20 million enterprise. 
No one will ever know anything about what is going on.
<P>
	We might have a clue about what is going on over there if we 
take a look at what the Prime Minister's office does with its 
research funds. It sends out Liberal propaganda to Liberal 
sympathizers that are absolute distortions of the truth about the 
Reform Party and has been caught at it.
<P>
	Although we have had a degree of tongue in cheek in the way we 
have addressed the issue, we must also take a look at how solemn it 
is. It is very solemn because we have a government and a Prime 
Minister who are so arrogant and power hungry that they will 
virtually do anything to maintain power and control over 
information from the office I just named. They will do virtually 
anything in terms of what they say about people they are concerned 
about who have different or new ideas.
<P>
	Why is it that we have a situation where we do not have a 
resolution to the so-called two founding nation problem or however 
they choose to describe it? We do not have resolution to the point 
where we almost lost the country a year ago.
<P>
	For 30 or 35 years the Liberals and Tories have stumbled around 
with that portfolio, not getting anywhere and making the situation 
worse. Reform, or any other Canadian, can come along with a fresh 
new idea and say: ``Why don't we try it a different way?'' If we are 
unsuccessful in a particular direction maybe we should change 
direction. The minute we do that with the Liberals they 
immediately choose to throw out the mindless invective. They 
immediately choose to go into overdrive and say all the mean, 
nasty, negative, distorted statements they can make about their 
adversaries.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5819"> 5819 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	What the Reform Party is out to do, and we will do it in spite of 
the Liberals, is we are out to create an honest, open, frank, candid 
debate in this country about real issues, about real solutions, about 
getting things turned around so that the people of this country once 
again can see the future as they want it to be. We are turning it 
around so that we have the opportunities for our people, for the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	What can I say? Again, the member who has been proposed for 
this function, fine, but the way in which he has been proposed and 
the way in which the Liberals once again have broken a solemn 
commitment is very sad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I think the 
Liberals must be down in the market talking to their imaginary 
friends. I do not see a quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There clearly is not a quorum.
<P>
	Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are now 20 members in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I heard the last 
speaker refer to the Prime Minister and accuse the Prime Minister 
of telling a falsehood to young people. Those were his precise 
words.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The traditions and the procedures of the House are quite clear. I 
am sure it is not necessary but I would refer the Speaker to citation 
489 of Beauchesne's. He will note the lengthy list of examples of 
how it is unacceptable in the House to question the veracity of a 
member.
<P>
	One cannot use the expressions: above the truth; attempted to 
misrepresent; deceive; falsehood; misleading; misled; dishonest 
insinuations; dishonest answers; fabricated; intentional deceit; 
misleading the public; not telling the truth; not the complete truth; 
wilfully misled; untrue statement. One certainly cannot use: false; 
fabrication; false representations; false statement; falsehood; 
falsify.
<P>
	I would therefore ask the Speaker to rule-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. The hon. 
member for Kootenay East has in fact left the Chamber. We will 
check the blues and if the situation is as the member indicated, the 
Chair will certainly make a ruling on it.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are certainly not ready for the question.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member opposite for making that intervention. I 
notice it is the first intervention that has been made for quite some 
time by hon. members opposite. Obviously they are having an 
exceedingly difficult time trying to justify this move by the 
government. Indeed, they do not wish to participate in the debate to 
try to defend the actions of their government.
<P>
	Perhaps it would be interesting to recap what has brought us to 
this point on this issue. Clearly, there has been another broken 
Liberal promise.
<P>
	We seem to have been subjected over the last day and a half to a 
number of allegations from across the way that the Reform Party of 
Canada is wasting taxpayers' money and wasting the time of the 
House of Commons. I see that the few hon. members who are left 
across the way are nodding their heads. They agree that we are 
wasting time.
<P>
	What this is all about is a matter of principle. Unfortunately, 
there does not seem to be a lot of that in evidence on the other side 
of the House these days. In fact, I would submit that principles are 
in exceedingly short supply in the Liberal Party. The opinion across 
the way is that the Reform Party has a problem with principles, but 
we feel it is the Liberal Party of Canada which is constantly lacking 
in that department. Liberal members will not even get up to defend 
the position which they have taken on this issue.
<P>
	Why are we in this situation in the House? Yesterday the 
government put a motion on the floor of the Chamber to appoint the 
hon. member for Kingston and the Islands to the vacant position of 
Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole. This was done 
despite the fact that the member himself was a co-author of a 
document some years ago when the Liberal Party of Canada was 
sitting on this side of the House. At that time four members of the 
Liberal Party drafted a document which became an appendix to the 
infamous red book. That book was the Liberal Party's platform 
which it took to the people of Canada during the 1993 election 
campaign.
<P>
	The appendix was called ``Reviving Parliamentary Democracy''. 
It is certainly a grand title, something I think all Canadians believe 
we are in dire need of in this country, ``Reviving Parliamentary 
Democracy: The Liberal Plan for House of Commons and Electoral 
Reform''. Number 10 dealt with the independence of the Chair, in 
other words the independence of the Speaker in the House of 
Commons. It stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in an effort to reduce the 
level of partisanship, when the Speaker is from the government party, two of the 
junior Chair officers should be from the opposition, so that the four presiding officer 
positions are shared equally by government and opposition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5820"> 5820 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	It went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the most significant results of the McGrath round of procedural reforms 
was the decision that the Speaker should be elected by secret ballot by all members. 
This has gone a long way toward assuring members of the independence of the 
presiding officer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The three deputy Speakers, however, remain in effect government appointees. As 
a consequence, when one of the junior officers is in the Chair, his or her 
independence and authority is less well established. Their authority would be greatly 
enhanced and the non-partisan nature of the Chair greatly augmented if the British 
practice of alternating the Chair positions between government and opposition were 
adopted. Thus, if the Speaker were from the government party, the Deputy Speaker 
would be from the opposition, the next officer from the government and so forth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is all quite admirable. Certainly all members of Parliament 
from all parties would agree that a procedure such as that should be 
instituted.
<P>
	I note that in one part it is stated very clearly that the authority 
would be greatly enhanced if this procedure were adopted because 
deputy Speakers are not elected. It was the feeling of that 
committee of the Liberal Party of Canada that this type of process 
should be put in place. That is why it was added as an appendix to 
the red book. The Liberals ran on this issue. It was a promise they 
made in the days and weeks leading up to the 1993 election.
<P>
	Earlier my colleague from Lisgar-Marquette spoke about what 
is a promise. He talked about the sanctity of marriage vows. He 
made a good case that it is one promise many Canadians believe is 
a promise that one simply does not break. The marriage vow of 
until death do us part means that couples stay together through 
thick and thin and through tough times. They work out their 
problems but they keep their promise. He quite eloquently made 
the case for that.
<P>
	What constitutes the keeping of a promise? The member went on 
to say that there are many kinds of promises. Some are simply 
implied, some are spelled out, some are verbal and some are signed 
contracts. In other words, they are legally binding in the sense that 
one has signed one's name to the promise.
<P>
	What constitutes the keeping of a promise? Simply put, in the 
case of government it has a very short time span in which to keep 
its promise. It is up to the government to display to the general 
public that when its members run for election either in a general 
election or a byelection that they will keep their word.
<P>
	There is an old saying that a man is only as good as his word. 
That is something I was raised with. It is common knowledge in 
Peace River country where I come from. I heard that many times 
from my father when I was a youngster. I would submit that is a 
generic term which also applies to the other gender. We all are only 
as good  and our credibility is only as good as our word. We have to 
keep that.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	It reminds me of a promise that was made by a number of 
Liberals during the election but certainly none more so or more 
strongly or strenuously than the Deputy Prime Minister. The 
promise I am speaking of is the GST.
<P>
	I get back to my point. What constitutes the keeping of a 
promise? Clearly the Deputy Prime Minister during the election 
campaign spoke many times that if they did not abolish, scrap or 
get rid of the GST she would resign. That is the promise that she 
made. Indeed finally through the pressure of the Reform Party of 
Canada and from the media and from the general public she was 
forced to honour that promise and resign.
<P>
	I get back to what I was saying earlier. What constitutes the 
keeping of a promise? To my way of thinking, simply resigning and 
then saying ``I'm going to run again'' is hardly the keeping of a 
promise. Clearly what she implied when she said ``I will resign if 
we do not scrap, kill, abolish the GST'' was that she would quit, 
give up her seat.
<P>
	I do not believe that the people of Canada believed that what she 
really meant was that she would just give it up until a byelection 
could be called at the cost of some $.5 million and then seek 
re-election to that same position. I do not believe that is keeping a 
promise.
<P>
	A number of my colleagues have spoken quite eloquently about 
this subject. What the viewing public needs to understand is what is 
happening today and what are we really discussing here. Is it 
simply that the Reform Party is upset that the government intends 
to appoint the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands to one of 
the positions of deputy speaker of the House of Commons? Of 
course that is not the case.
<P>
	I want to go on record as saying that I do not have any personal 
vendetta against the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. 
That is not the case. I am certain that is not the case for any of my 
colleagues who have been speaking out. Many have reiterated 
during their remarks that this is not a case of attacking an 
individual or casting aspersions against an individual. Nothing 
could be further from the truth.
<P>
	The reality is we believe a promise has been broken. Promises 
are very important, especially to this government. It has been said 
already today and indeed yesterday during the debate that this 
particular government and this particular Prime Minister have been 
going on and on at some length during the past, and certainly last 
weekend was an example of that during the love-in of the Liberal 
convention held here in Ottawa, about how many promises they 
have kept.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5821"> 5821 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly when a promise is as simple as this one is to keep, it 
is not a difficult promise to keep, the government could pick any 
opposition member. It does not have to be someone from the 
Reform Party. It could be anyone from the Bloc Quebecois or one 
of the independents to fill that position of deputy speaker. Then 
it would have lived up to its promise.
<P>
	This particular member who represents Kingston and the Islands 
clearly would have lived up to the commitment that he made I 
believe to the people of Canada and to the electorate when he 
co-signed the document which was attached as an appendix to the 
Liberal red book.
<P>
	Reformers believe that this debate is so very important. We are 
talking about integrity. We are talking about honesty. We are 
talking about credibility. We are talking about believeability.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	From the red book in a chapter called ``Governing with Integrity 
I quote directly the promise that was held out to Canadians before 
and during the 1993 election:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty and integrity 
in our political institutions must be restored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the citizens 
to whom it is accountable. There is evidence today of considerable dissatisfaction 
with government and a steady erosion of confidence in the people and institutions of 
the public sector.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This erosion of confidence seems to have many causes: some have to do with the 
behaviour of certain elected politicians, others with an arrogant style of political 
leadership. The people are irritated with governments that do not consult them, or 
that disregard their views, or that try to conduct key parts of the public business 
behind closed doors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submit that part of this page out of the Liberal red book of 
campaign promises, ``Creating Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for 
Canada'', could have been written this afternoon.
<P>
	It could be applied to the Liberal Party of Canada, to the existing 
government. We all know that it was written as a Liberal attack 
against the former Progressive Conservative government.
<P>
	Lord knows it deserved to be chastized for the way it behaved 
over nine years, the way it betrayed Canada, the way it betrayed the 
promises it made to the Canadian people during two successive 
elections, 1984 and 1988.
<P>
	It could have just as easily, I submit, have been written about the 
government we have in Canada today. I see that same arrogance 
that the Liberal Party was attacking in this document. I see that 
same arrogance very much in evidence around this place today.
<P>
	I would like to go on in the time that I have remaining and talk 
about a specific promise that was made leading up to the election, 
another promise by the Liberal Party of Canada, one that I was 
personally made aware of during the election campaign. It 
impacted directly in some of the support that the Liberal Party got 
and some of the heat that the Reform Party of Canada took for 
being honest with the electorate.
<P>
	This promise, like the promise of allowing for the appointment 
of alternating positions to the deputy speaker's position in the 
House of Commons, was contained in a side document to the red 
book. It is entitled ``Food Security for Canadians and a Fair Return 
for Canadian Farmers''. It is the Liberal agricultural policy 
proposals backgrounder dated May 1993.
<P>
	This document under the subtitle ``International Trade and 
Marketing: General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades'' states: ``The 
nature of agricultural production, trade and the global forces of 
change make it inevitable that farm and trade policies will have to 
be altered. Canada must make use of the GATT negotiations to 
aggressively defend and clarify article XI to maintain our supply 
managed programs, since the ongoing GATT negotiations provide 
an opportunity to make these changes in a multilateral framework 
of commitments and rules''.
<P>
	That sounded very good: ``aggressively defend and clarify 
article XI''.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	That is what the Liberal Party of Canada and its candidates ran 
on in the 1993 election. I am sure all my colleagues in the Reform 
Party remember that. Certainly any Reformers who had dairy farms 
in their riding remember it. Reform was honest with dairy farmers, 
the supply managed sectors of agriculture, in what they were 
facing, what was coming down the pipe and Reform took the heat 
for that. We took the heat in all-candidates forums, on radio open 
line shows, but Reform stuck by what we said because we felt we 
had to be honest with Canadians during and after an election.
<P>
	By the time the Liberals recognized what we were saying about 
this all along-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> You have one minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River): </B>One minute. Boy, 
times flies when you are trying to make real points.
<P>
	The promise to defend to the death article XI of the GATT, by the 
time the Liberal Party understood that the Reform was right, that 
this was going to be gone, it had lost it as a bargaining chip.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired. Is the 
House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
point of order. Under the present House rules, Standing Order 57, I 
have read carefully through the closure notice and I did not notice 
anything specifically in that rule that does not allow for a 10 minute 
questions and comments portion following 20 minutes speeches.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5822"> 5822 </A></B>
<P>
	Could the Chair clarify Standing Order 57 and why we are not 
having any questions and comments?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member was kind enough to 
indicate to the Chair his concern in this regard earlier and the 
answer is as follows. Standing Order 57 states there will be 20 
minute speeches only during the period of closure, the debate we 
are in now.
<P>
	Standing Order 43 states that unless provided otherwise there 
will be 20 minute speeches plus question and answer.
<P>
	I agree with the member that it would have been better if 
somebody had said under Standing Order 57 that there will not be 
questions and answers, but it is by implication. In a commentary 
under Standing Order 43 it is indicated there are not questions and 
answers under closure debate.
<P>
	There is of course the availability of unanimous consent. If the 
member wishes to ask for unanimous consent that there be 
questions and answers during this closure debate the Chair would 
be happy to entertain that motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
decline from so moving because I strongly suspect the Liberals will 
not allow it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in addressing this motion I would like to start with the Liberal red 
book and end with the Liberal red book.
<P>
	Let us start by assuming that there was some good will there that 
went into the creation of that document, that there were honest, 
noble members of the Liberal Party who said, sitting in opposition: 
``We need change. We have to respond to the people of Canada who 
are saying let us have change, let us revise the rules of the way we 
are doing things. Let us do things better''.
<P>
	I assume that even the member for Kingston and the Islands was 
one such person and the report he put forward which forms a 
contributing document to the red book was made in good faith. 
Having said that, what happens to it?
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition I think they were sincere 
and honest in saying that we really must have this. Now they flood 
the government benches and oh what a difference it makes.
<P>
	In the creation of the red book the Liberal Party brass, the 
creators of strategy asked what it is that the people of Canada want. 
They had a pretty clear message at that point of what the people of 
Canada wanted, which was integrity and honesty in government. 
Their red book was created by that stimulus. They said: ``Fine, let 
us  promise to the people of Canada what it is that they want, and 
we will put all that in the red book''. It has wound up as a book of 
promises and the government says it has kept 78 per cent of them. 
We give the government 30 per cent at the most.
<P>
	One of the contributing documents for the red book which has 
already been cited today is the document ``Governing with 
Integrity''. Having read it in my role as an opposition member I 
totally subscribe to it. It states: ``If government is to play a positive 
role in society, as it must, honesty and integrity in our political 
institutions must be restored''. The Liberals felt that was true at the 
time and I am sure it was, but it is still true and it has still not been 
achieved.
<P>
	Again from ``Governing with Integrity'': ``This erosion of 
confidence seems to have many causes. Some have to do with the 
behaviour of certain elected politicians, others with an arrogant 
style of political leadership''. Hold on. This is the Liberals talking 
about the Conservatives. ``The people are irritated with 
governments that do not consult them or that disregard their views 
or that try to conduct key parts of the public business behind closed 
doors''. That is the Liberals talking in the creation of their famous 
red book in 1993.
<P>
	Lest anyone say this is sour grapes or this is just a westerner 
talking, let me quote from an article written by Michel Venne in <I>Le 
Devoir</I> yesterday about the unhappiness of the Canadian electorate:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``For the past week, the Liberal Party of Canada has been 
congratulating itself in a way bordering on indecency, given that, 
since the Liberals took office in 1993, the country has come within 
a hair's breadth of disintegration, while poverty and voter cynicism 
keeps growing from coast to coast.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is the view from Quebec. The Quebecers say that the 
cynicism of the electorate is prevalent from coast to coast. Let us 
look at the reasons for that cynicism. Let us examine some of the 
specific promises made in the Liberal red book.
<P>
	Number one: ``We will restore Canadians' faith in themselves 
and their government''. Has that been done? The answer is a 
resounding no, and we will get that no from province to province 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
<P>
	They also promise: ``We will implement new programs only if 
they can be funded within existing expenditures''. That is a very 
nice promise. Certainly it was probably their intent at the time to 
keep the promise to implement new programs only if they could be 
funded within existing expenditures.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5823"> 5823 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	How about the latest foray by the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
into flags at $23 million, and the establishment of-let us call them 
what they are-government propaganda offices across the country 
at a cost of well over $100 million? These are new programs that 
were unfunded and magically, funding has been found for them but 
not for other things.
<P>
	There is an example close to us in Ottawa, in Chalk River, 
Ontario. A superconducting cyclotron needs $3 million of bridge 
financing to keep it going but the money is not to be found. The 
government cannot find $3 million or even half of that amount, 
presuming that the rest would come from private industry. No, the 
money is just not there.
<P>
	The same case can be made for Whiteshell Laboratories in 
Manitoba. The government simply cannot find the money or the 
means to make its promise of looking at the privatization of that 
laboratory. It has simply been left to wither on the vine.
<P>
	These were promises made and promises not kept. The 
government, when it wants to implement new programs, we have 
the example of the grant of a loan to Bombardier in Quebec. Was 
that necessary? Well it was only necessary from a political point of 
view. New money is found for anything that suits the purpose of the 
government.
<P>
	Promise No. 4: ``We will exercise unwavering discipline in 
controlling federal spending and we will re-order current spending 
priorities to make sure the maximum return is obtained on each 
investment''. It really sounds good: unwavering discipline in 
controlling federal expenditures. Look around and we find example 
after example of the flagrant disregard for that.
<P>
	Just to show that the Liberals did keep some of their promises let 
us look at a kept promise. Promise No. 7: ``A Liberal government 
will cancel the $5.8 billion purchase of EH-101 helicopters''. They 
kept that promise. The only problem is that it has cost us a few 
hundred million dollars just to keep the claimants away and we still 
do not have a replacement three years later. They kept the promise 
but to the detriment of the country.
<P>
	Let us go on to some of the other many unfulfilled promises 
made by the Liberals. Why did they make these promises? They 
made them purely to get elected. I will reiterate my opening 
statement that without a doubt some statements were made in 
honesty at the beginning and some of those were incorporated 
honestly into the red book. However, they went on from there to 
say: ``No, winning is the thing. We must win and we must win at 
any cost. Therefore, do not mind what promises are made, we will 
just see how we can cope with that''.
<P>
	Another promise: ``The Liberal government will replace the 
GST''. That one has been pounded into the ground so I think I will 
leave that for others to hit.
<P>
	Here is another promise: ``A Liberal government will work 
closely with provincial governments to achieve the maximum 
possible co-ordination of tax policies''. We have seen where that 
one has gone in recent months. It has made a hiatus in the Atlantic 
provinces and other provinces are totally unhappy about it.
<P>
	Another promise: ``A Liberal government will be committed to 
the elimination of interprovincial trade barriers within Canada and 
will address the issue urgently''. What has been done on that? I 
recall there was a little effort made in 1994 and perhaps there are a 
few minor items going on but the work that is desperately required 
is not happening.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Promise No. 17: ``The Liberals will manage this trading 
relationship with the United States in a way that best serves 
Canada's interests''. They are talking about the GATT, the NAFTA 
and such things. Let us look at examples from the last year or two 
with respect to our trading with the Unites States in fish, in 
softwood and in wheat. We do not have anything which is serving 
Canada's best interests. There are problems. That is not to say that 
they have not put some effort into it. Of course they have, but it is 
insufficient. Once again it amounts to a broken promise.
<P>
	Let us move on through the pages. The Liberals said they would 
prepare for the transition from school to the workplace and provide 
a constructive outlet for the skills and talents of younger Canadians 
who are the innocent victims of Canada's prolonged recession. 
They said they would enhance the opportunity for job training and 
improve the literacy and numeracy skills of Canadian workers, and 
improve access to employment for women and single parents by 
making quality child care more available.
<P>
	Those are wonderful words. It is an admirable aim for the 
government to have said: ``Look Canadians, this is what we are 
going to do for you. We are going to make 100 more promises like 
this, but unfortunately we are not going to be able to keep them''. 
As a promise it was wonderful. It was certainly a worthwhile aim. 
That is indeed what the government should be doing. It should be 
keeping the promises which were made in this book.
<P>
	Let us go on to other promises along the same line. The Liberals 
said that a Liberal government would gather information on these 
developments of job training, skills and disseminate it to all those 
responsible for the education of our children. That has not been 
done.
<P>
	In collaboration with provincial governments the Liberals would 
introduce a voluntary national achievement test in math, science 
and technology. Again, that is a very worthwhile aim. I laud the 
Liberals for  having thought of all these wonderful things, but I do 
not laud them for having put them in this book and then not having 
kept those promises.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5824"> 5824 </A></B>
<P>
	They were also going to work with business, labour and 
provincial governments to provide funding to establish 
apprenticeship programs for the new economy. Once again, what 
could be better than to establish worthwhile apprenticeship 
programs? This country needs more of them, but we are not getting 
them. The Liberals have simply not delivered on their promise.
<P>
	Let us turn the page. What do we have? ``A Liberal government 
will provide the necessary funds and administrative support to 
launch pilot projects in community projects across Canada within 
the first year of a Liberal mandate. We will invest $100 million a 
year in the Canadian Youth Service Corps''. I have to say that is not 
a totally ignored promised. There has been something done.
<P>
	I have in my own riding of Nanaimo-Cowichan a very 
worthwhile project concerning the Canadian Youth Service Corps. 
The trouble is, it only involves 16 or 17 young people. The promise 
was to invest $100 million a year. That is not being done. Again I 
will give credit for what is being done, but what is not being done is 
what we are calling the Liberals to task for.
<P>
	All of these are examples of broken promises. They are good 
intentions. If the Liberals want good parliamentary government 
and good government across the country, they should read their red 
book again. They should read again the contributory documents 
that were made probably in good faith to say what the red book is 
all about, that they are the basic documents. They should read them 
again and ask themselves if they have kept their promises to the 
Canadian people, starting and ending with the promise to have a 
deputy speaker who represents the opposition in the House. It was a 
good intention. They simply did not measure up to it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HOUSEOFCOMMONS">HOUSE OF COMMONS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House unequivocally reconfirms the undoubted rights and privileges of the 
House of Commons, won from the Crown and which became part of the law many 
centuries ago, and in particular the unfettered right of the House and its committees to at 
all times compel the attendance of persons and require them to answer questions and to 
compel the production of such papers and documents as the House or committee 
considers necessary for the due carrying out of its mandate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, if this motion were to be voted on today it 
would cause this House of Commons for the first time in its 
129-year existence to publicly articulate, declare and confirm its 
absolute right on behalf of all citizens to send for persons, papers 
and records.
<P>
	The authority to require the attendance of persons, to have the 
persons answer questions and produce documents, as well as the 
right to institute inquiries, are essential elements of our 
parliamentary process. They are part of the law of Canada. They 
are founded in the Constitution Act of 1867 and the Parliament of 
Canada Act. Each of Beauchesne, Bourinot, Erskine May, Maingot 
and the Supreme Court of Canada in 1993 has recognized this 
historic and longstanding body of parliamentary privilege.
<P>
	Unfortunately these powers are not commonly understood by or 
in some cases respected by parliamentarians, the executive branch 
and the public. That is why I have moved this motion on what I 
consider to be a very important matter for Parliament.
<P>
	Let me draw to the attention of the House some of the problems 
that have been encountered in this area, that have arisen in the past 
and that continue to recur today.
<P>
	In 1991 the then solicitor general and Correction Services 
Canada refused to provide to a committee of the House the 
complete, unexpurgated reports of inquiries into escapes from 
correctional institutions of an individual by the name of Leger and 
another individual by the name of Gingras. Each of those 
individuals had escaped and had killed innocent Canadians.
<P>
	Inquiries were held and the House of Commons committee on 
justice at that time was undertaking a review. As I said, the solicitor 
general and Correction Services Canada refused to turn over the 
unexpurgated versions of those two reports.
<P>
	In the end it took approximately 12 months to receive the 
reports. We had a number of lawyers, a number of parties, 
committee hearings, privilege moved in this House and ultimately 
the unexpurgated reports were provided under the basis of a House 
order which was consensually agreed to. That process which took 
12 months is not sufficient. Everyone in the House knows it. That is 
one example of why the House should adopt this motion at this 
time.
<P>
	I am also personally aware of confusion and sometimes 
ignorance at the Department of Justice where lawyers continue to 
advise their clients as lawyers to the clients, but we must forgive 
them in some cases. They are in fact advising their clients. They are 
not advising the House of Commons. They are not advising 
parliamentarians, they are simply telling their clients the limits of 
their legal rights. In some cases this manifests confusion and, I 
regret to say, ignorance of the law of Parliament.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5825"> 5825 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Clearly this is not acceptable to parliamentarians. I am sure there 
are many other examples being experienced by parliamentarians in 
committee from time to time. I know there are some instances 
extant right now.
<P>
	Why this motion now? The Canadian House of Commons has 
never formally articulated this element of parliamentary privilege. 
It is noteworthy, however, that other parliaments have done this, 
especially when confusion has arisen. For example, the House of 
Commons in the United Kingdom reconfirmed its power over 
witnesses in 1947 and the Senate of Australia did the same thing in 
1975.
<P>
	The way to reconfirm and re-assert the authority of the House of 
Commons and clear up the confusion is by the adoption of a 
resolution such as this. In my remarks I want to discuss a bit more 
of the background to this motion, the purpose of privilege and the 
enforcement remedies available to the House. Finally I will 
comment on some practical implications.
<P>
	Why do we have this particular authority or power to call for 
persons, papers and documents? The power to send for a person's 
papers and records is central to the ability of the House and its 
committees to discharge their responsibilities. This was confirmed 
in the first report of the standing committee on privileges and 
elections in February 1991 dealing with the Gingras and Leger 
matters to which I referred earlier.
<P>
	There is a phrase of which members may be aware where the 
House has been described as the grand inquest of the nation. 
Historically, the House of Commons has been considered to be a 
grand inquest in the United Kingdom and also in Canada.
<P>
	Lord Coke first described the House of Commons in this way in 
the 17th century, and courts have continued to use that phrase ever 
since. The House of Commons and the other place act as a kind of a 
check on the executive branch and I will talk a little more about 
that later.
<P>
	What is the legal basis of this particular privilege? First, section 
18 of the Constitution Act, 1867 which I will not read because it is 
there for reference. Second, it has been restated in sections 4 and 5 
of the Parliament of Canada Act. Of course, a recapitulation of all 
of that is in Standing Order 108(1)(a) of the House. It states, and I 
will paraphrase: ``Standing committees shall be severally 
empowered to examine and inquire into all such matters as may be 
referred to them by the House and to send for persons, papers and 
records''. In effect, that is a comprehensive delegation by the 
House to its committees of that power to call for persons, papers 
and records.
<P>
	The courts have commented on this and I just want to note that 
for the record. The Supreme Court has stated its opinion on several 
occasions. It has described these privileges as fundamental. It has 
stated: ``It is clear that  the privileges inherent in legislative bodies 
are fundamental to our system of government''. This was in the 
case of New Brunswick Broadcasting Company <I>v.</I> Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Second, the court has commented that these privileges are 
necessary. It has said that parliamentary privilege and the breadth 
of individual privileges encompassed by that term are accorded to 
members of the Houses of Parliament and the legislative 
assemblies because they are judged necessary to the discharge of 
their legislative function.
<P>
	Third, these privileges are a part of our Constitution. They are 
part of the fundamental law of our land.
<P>
	By this brief review of the statutory basis of parliamentary 
privilege, it will be noted that it is within the scope of the House or 
its committees to inquire into any matter within Parliament's 
authority to enact legislation.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	What are the documents that must be produced? What are the 
questions that must be answered?
<P>
	For the reasons I have just discussed, Parliament and its 
committees have a very broad range of powers. No person may 
ignore the order to appear, nor decline to answer a question, nor 
refuse to produce a document. To do so is a contempt of the House 
for which the House may exercise its lawful power to enforce 
sanctions which include the power of detention.
<P>
	Here are some of the authorities I want to cite for the record: ``A 
committee is not restricted in the scope of questions it can pose and 
a witness must answer all questions put to him''. That is from 
Maingot, page 163.
<P>
	``Committees may send for any papers that are relevant to their 
orders of reference. Within this restriction, it appears that the 
power of the committee to send for papers is unlimited. Witnesses 
must answer all questions directed to them even over their 
objection that an answer would incriminate them''. That is from 
Beauchesne, page 239, citation 862.
<P>
	Canadians may be asking what protection is afforded to a 
witness who provides such evidence or documents. Even if a claim 
were made that a witness violated a statute's provisions by 
providing information or documents to the House or a committee, 
that witness would automatically be clothed with the protection or 
immunity of the House and cannot be prosecuted.
<P>
	This immunity is described in Beauchesne as follows: ``Every 
witness attending before the House or any committee thereof may 
claim the protection of the House in respect of the evidence to be 
given''. That is page 237, citation 853.
<P>
	``Nothing said before a committee, or at the Bar of the House, 
may be used in a court of law. Thus a witness may not refuse to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5826"> 5826 </A></B>
<P>
answer on the grounds of  self-incrimination''. That is Beauchesne, 
pages 27-28, citation 109.
<P>
	Finally, article 9 of the Bill of Rights, 1688, which the Supreme 
Court of Canada noted in the 1991 Patriation Reference and which 
is part of the public and general law of Canada, states: ``That the 
freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought 
not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of 
Parliament''. Forgive me for going back 400 years to find that one.
<P>
	The enforcement mechanisms that are available to the House are 
available to the House and not to committees. These are the 
procedure to be used where a witness refuses to appear as set out in 
Beauchesne, among other volumes: ``If a witness should refuse to 
appear on receiving the order of the Chairman, or if a witness 
refuses to answer questions, this conduct may be reported to the 
House and an order immediately made for the attendance of the 
person at the Bar or before the committee.
<P>
	``On further refusing to obey, the witness may be ordered to be 
sent for and brought to the Bar in the custody of the 
Sergeant-at-Arms, or may be declared guilty of a contempt and 
ordered to be taken into the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms''. 
That citation is from Beauchesne, page 238-239.
<P>
	In my research, I went back another couple of hundred years to 
the year 1704 and found the case of an unfortunate Mr. Lee of 
Clement Inn who I am sure was not an ancestor of mine. He might 
have been. In any event, Mr. Lee had failed to respond to an order 
of a committee of Parliament. The resolution of the House of 
Commons in the United Kingdom which was adopted found him 
guilty of contempt and required that he be taken into the custody of 
the Sergeant-at-Arms.
<P>
	Even a former Canadian Prime Minister has been held in the 
custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms. That was in 1873. Sir John A. 
Macdonald failed to attend a committee meeting of which he was a 
member and was ordered into the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms. 
The former Prime Minister was not discharged until after the 
reading of his doctor's affidavit indicating his ill health that existed 
at the time.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In 1913, not that long ago, Mr. R. C. Miller refused to answer 
questions before the public accounts committee. The matter was 
reported to the House. He was summoned to the bar but he 
persisted in his refusal to answer. The House committed him to the 
Carleton County jail until prorogation or until the House otherwise 
decided. That citation is at page 30 of Beauchesne's.
<P>
	Occasionally the matter of crown privilege arises. It is not truly a 
privilege but a claim that is put to the House of Commons and 
Parliament on behalf of the crown that  usually involves a matter of 
state. Rather than being an absolute exception to the rule, the 
matter is taken under advisement by the committee or the House 
and is disposed of on a common sense basis. I put it that way so as 
not to derogate unnecessarily at this time from the main principle 
found in my motion.
<P>
	I would like to recap for a moment. I have discussed the legal 
basis for the privilege. I have talked about why the privilege 
applies, the remedies and the enforcement. Why is this motion 
important to us? I have thought this through carefully and I think 
there are three or four reasons.
<P>
	First, it deals with the public perception of the role and the 
authority of the House of Parliament and the other place. In my 
experience the production of documents is the single greatest 
obstacle I have ever encountered as an MP during my work at 
committee. The existence of this circumstance is eroding the 
public's confidence in Parliament. Parliamentarians are more than 
just a debating club and a cheering section for the government. If 
parliamentarians cannot get the information our committees are out 
of business; we cannot do our job.
<P>
	My second point is fairly simple. If we do not establish the 
principle all other questions regarding exceptions, privileges and 
privacy are all moot. We will never be able to deal with the 
exceptions until we have the principle.
<P>
	Third, I reiterate how other houses in the Commonwealth have 
dealt with the matter. Perhaps I will avoid too much detail 
recognizing that the clock is running faster than I am flipping pages 
of my speech.
<P>
	On August 13, 1947 the House of Commons in the United 
Kingdom reconfirmed its authority to require the attendance of 
witnesses by resolving:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the refusal of a witness before a select committee to answer any question 
which may be put to him is a contempt of this House, and an infraction of the 
undoubted right of this House to conduct any inquiry which may be necessary in the 
public interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The attorney general of the United Kingdom at that time said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are now putting the matter beyond all possibility of doubt by this motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The mover of the motion, Mr. Morrison, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The point is not one on which any doubt can be allowed to continue. It should be 
cleared up and the motion is to make the position entirely clear for the future as 
regards any committee of the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Senate of Australia passed a similar resolution in 1984.
<P>
	My final point is that we can clear up doubt on this matter once 
and for all by confirming this privilege with a motion. We must act 
in such a way as to fortify and buttress the powers of Parliament, 
the rights of  Parliament and the privileges of Parliament as they 
exist now and as they have always existed. This resolution does not 
create new law. It simply confirms what is there. The House has not 
passed a resolution of this type in its entire 129-year existence. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5827"> 5827 </A></B>
<P>
There is some ignorance, denial and confusion out there with which 
we must deal.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	It is an embarrassment to me as a parliamentarian that for 129 
years we have muddled along without articulating it. We simply 
assumed that all the authorities and authors who have written for us 
would do the job. It is not their job; it is our job. It is our duty as 
parliamentarians to deal with the issue in this way and the time has 
come to deal with it.
<P>
	The House will confirm the principle. It will be there for all 
parliamentarians, all writers, all the Beauchesnes who write about 
Parliament and study our rules.
<P>
	I hope the debate will not fall on deaf ears. I would like to think 
this motion could be passed but of course it is in the hands of 
members. I thank members for giving the matter their 
consideration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my friend and colleague, the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River and I am pleased to speak 
to his Motion M-142. And in doing so, I am in good company, since 
I have the hon. member for Gaspé at my side to support me, should 
I become weak.
<P>
	Motion M-142 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House unequivocally reconfirms the undoubted rights and privileges of 
the House of Commons, won from the Crown and which became part of the law 
many centuries ago, and in particular the unfettered right of the House and its 
committees to at all times compel the attendance of persons and require them to 
answer questions and to compel the production of such papers and documents as the 
House or committee considers necessary for the due carrying out of its mandate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The English version of the motion translates the French word 
``indubitables'', in reference to privileges, as ``undoubted rights 
and privileges''. If rights are undoubted, unchallenged, there is no 
need really to reaffirm or reconfirm them.
<P>
	In fact, the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River 
provided a brilliant historical demonstration, and knowing his 
attachment to the parliamentary system, I am sure he feels this 
demonstration even in his frustrations as a parliamentarian. I will 
share some of my own with you in a moment.
<P>
	I do not think that it is necessary to pass the motion again. That 
said, should the question be put again, I will gladly vote in favour. 
But it is worth reaffirming from time to time rights so longstanding 
in the British parliamentary system, probably dating back to the 
Magna  Carta of 1215, the Oxford provisions of 1258, the Bill of 
rights of 1689 and all the legislation that, little by little, over the 
course of centuries, have affirmed the rights and privileges of the 
House of Commons and Parliament.
<P>
	I assume that the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River 
has put this motion before us today not to have a purely academic 
debate, but in response to actual situations. I will not speak for the 
hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River, but for myself. Since 
the very beginning of this Parliament or almost, I have been sitting 
on the sub-committee on national security, which was set up by the 
Standing Committee for Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	One of the matters we have worked on was the Heritage Front 
affair. On many occasions, at in camera sessions, with members of 
Parliament in attendance, we have had members of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, better known as SIRC, appear 
before our committee as witnesses.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	These people systematically refused to answer questions, to 
table uncensored versions of documents they had sent to the 
Solicitor General and to co-operate in any way with the committee.
<P>
	At the time I moved a motion before the committee to have the 
Chairman of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, Mr. 
Jacques Courtois, cited for contempt of Parliament. It was divine 
providence that prevented the motion from being debated because, 
meanwhile, Mr. Courtois had died.
<P>
	The other members of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee had never volunteered their co-operation either. Neither 
the chairman <I>pro tempore</I> nor the other members of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee. We had to sit for months and 
months to try and get clear answers to clear questions. All the 
members did was look at the clock to check when the committee's 
time was up, and they then rose without having answered the 
question.
<P>
	These same members of SIRC, although they had been informed 
of their obligations by the general legal counsel of the House, Ms. 
Diane Davidson, refused to answer our questions. They refused to 
answer, even when the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River, chairman of the sub-committee, ordered them to answer.
<P>
	In spite of all that, they left us in great good humour, but we 
never got an answer to matters of substance. Our report to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs was, to all intents 
and purposes bereft of substance. We could not include any 
pertinent elements because we had no evidence, which was the 
fault of those who were supposed to serve the Canadian people by 
providing accurate replies to the elected representatives of the 
people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5828"> 5828 </A></B>
<P>
	By hiding behind the oath of office they had taken to keep their 
information secret, members of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee refused to answer the questions asked by the elected 
representatives of the people. In a parliamentary democracy, this 
is a moral sin.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the text of the motion of the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River does not solve the problem. These 
rights are not discussed but are perhaps open to discussion in 
connection with the contemporary element which might be added. 
These rights are not really being questioned, it is the exercise of 
those rights which is being questioned. That is where politics enters 
into it.
<P>
	There was nothing to prevent the subcommittee on national 
security from promptly making a report to the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs, which would in turn have reported to 
this House so that the Security Intelligence Review Committee 
could have been brought before this House for contempt of 
Parliament and subjected to sanctions commensurate with the 
offence committed. But no political majority ever came together to 
have these people charged with contempt of Parliament.
<P>
	For months and months the question hung fire, and I understand 
the political constraints under which the chairman and member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River found himself. Despite all of his 
attempts at negotiation, he could not compel the members of SIRC 
to provide answers.
<P>
	When a parliamentary committee is totally paralyzed, rendered 
incapable of action by people who refuse to bow to the laws of the 
country, we are-you will pardon the expression, which may seem 
to be going almost too far-almost in a state of insurrection. People 
mandated to do something, who are categorically refusing to do it.
<P>
	If the question were to be raised again, as it will be-we have 
already had to adjourn a meeting of the subcommittee on national 
security-the next time the people of the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee come before the subcommittee on national 
security and again refuse to respond, as they have for months, for 
years now, to the legitimate questions asked of them, I shall be the 
first in line to table a motion that they be accused of contempt of 
Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
issue I address today relates to the investigative and probative 
powers of committees. I certainly applaud the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River for his very informative review of the 
rights of the House and its committees. Too often it is forgotten that 
Parliament is the highest court of the land and that the committees 
as creatures of this House are component bodies of the high court.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	In the discharge of our duties as parliamentarians to carry out our 
mandate it is imperative that committees be given the unfettered 
right of the House to compel attendance and subpoena witnesses, 
and such powers must be afforded every committee and every full 
member of these bodies.
<P>
	I listened intently to the Bloc member relate the circumstance 
regarding the subcommittee on national security and the efforts 
that committee went through to get full evidence before the 
committee. It should not be the case.
<P>
	Unfortunately I must report that my personal experience with 
committees has not been consistent with the high goals advanced in 
this motion. Take the recent cased put before the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs on which I serve as a full 
member. It was advanced that the standing committee use its 
probative and investigative powers to study a certain matter of 
alleged employment insurance fraud and report its findings to 
Parliament.
<P>
	It was explained that Elizabeth Roux of Montreal went to the 
University of Southern California in September 1994 but kept 
collecting employment insurance benefits to the tune of $5,200 
until January 1995. It was further presented that the RCMP was 
called in to investigate the matter. It determined that Roux ``did by 
trickery, lies and other misleading methods defraud the Canadian 
government''. I explained to our committee that the RCMP 
recommended that charges be laid.
<P>
	I also presented evidence that the Montreal office of Human 
Resources Development Canada also recommended trying Roux. 
The department sees hundreds of cases a year of EI recipients 
studying or vacationing outside the country while continuing to 
collect benefits in violation of the law requiring claimants to be 
actively seeking and readily available for work.
<P>
	The Roux case would appear on the surface to be just like any 
other case but it is more involved. Many of these EI snowbirds and 
scholars cost Canadians at least $60 million annually. They are 
such a problem that human resources recently began 
cross-referencing EI records with customs declarations Canadians 
file when they return to the country to help them spot the cheats.
<P>
	I also explained to my committee colleagues that most fraud 
cases of this type have accomplices, someone back home, usually a 
close friend or relative who collects the EI cheques and forwards 
them to the absentee claimant. In Roux's case her partner in 
deception was her mother who mailed her daughter's false 
declarations of employability to the EI office from Montreal so 
they could be postmarked in Canada. She then collected Roux's 
cheques and deposited them in a joint mother-daughter bank 
account.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5829"> 5829 </A></B>
<P>
	I explained to the committee that charges are almost always laid 
against accomplices even if the unlawfully obtained benefits are 
paid back as was the case with Roux. There is in effect a zero 
tolerance policy. In the case of globetrotting claimants they are 
invariably fined and almost always charged with fraud.
<P>
	I imparted to the committee that most Canadians would expect 
that Roux and her mother would be charged. But they were not. 
Justice department lawyers refused to proceed. Coincidentally 
Roux's mother is a Canadian senator, Senator Therésè 
Lavoie-Roux. Senator Lavoie-Roux was a provincial Liberal 
cabinet minister for 12 years and it was apparent that her pedigree 
and political connections may have very well factored into the 
decision not to lay charges.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Herein is the issue. Two independent federal organizations, the 
RCMP and the human resources fraud investigators, recommended 
that charges be laid. Immediately thereafter the justice department, 
inexplicably, refused to lay charges. The subject of the 
investigation had real and substantive ties to the political process 
and the standing committee refused to allow an investigation.
<P>
	That the government in power would use its majority to suppress 
my motion for parliamentary investigation into a matter as 
important as the case illustrated today demonstrates the need to 
effect the goals advanced in the motion we debate today.
<P>
	No one can tell me that the Liberal government does not 
recognize the need to have a more open process in the committee. 
In fact, the subject for debate prior to Private Members' Business 
dealt with the promises of the red book. The Liberal red book 
promises point to several sore spots which need to be corrected.
<P>
	I noted yesterday that clearly in the preamble to the red book 
there is a concern on the part of the Liberal government that there 
have to be some changes. It reads: ``Mounting criticism of the 
House of Commons and its proceedings reflects the frustration of 
citizens and parliamentarians alike with the continuing failure of 
Parliament to address effectively the problems that face us''. It 
continues: ``Canadians, including those who are elected to serve 
Parliament, expect the House of Commons not merely to discuss 
openly the problems of the nation, but also to advance solutions''.
<P>
	Time and again the public has viewed parliamentarians and 
senators as being above the law. This has been questioned on 
numerous occasions and there have been regular press reports on 
these cases.
<P>
	I will continue to quote from the second paragraph of the 
preamble to the red book: ``They expect the Commons to explore 
Canada's problems rationally and to establish policies for resolving 
them. These expectations are not met''. That is the statement made 
by the Liberal  government in its red book. I do not believe it is 
being met adequately.
<P>
	Parliament must remain the highest court in the land. We the 
elected officials must possess the tools to carry out our duties and 
to ensure that justice and the law apply equally to all Canadians. By 
refusing the right of our committee to investigate the matter of 
fraud, for instance, involving Senator Lavoie-Roux, the members 
opposite who serve on the justice and legal affairs committee have 
contravened the spirit and substance on which the motion which we 
are debating is founded.
<P>
	An article in the Edmonton <I>Sun</I> reports that these occasions will 
hit the press time and time again. I will quote briefly from the 
Edmonton <I>Sun</I>, the press' view as outlined with the information at 
hand: ``The RCMP reportedly recommended laying charges, as did 
the Montreal office of Human Resources Development Canada. 
But the justice minister says his department has looked into the 
case and found insufficient evidence to warrant charges. Last week 
the Liberals used their majority in the Commons to defeat a Reform 
demand for a parliamentary investigation. Lavoie-Roux claims 
there was no attempt to defraud. She did not know there are EI rules 
against making claims while resident in another country''.
<P>
	``From a former social services minister this is impossible to 
swallow'', the press said. ``She didn't see a problem. Why not mail 
the claims then from California if there was no problem? We could 
demand to know why mother and daughter have not been charged. 
Unfortunately that is rather obvious''.
<P>
	Situations of this nature bring the whole parliamentary system 
into disrepute. If this motion is to have any meaning, Senator 
Lavoie-Roux, should be called before a committee, questioned by 
its members and the findings reported back to Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take peculiar pleasure in speaking to this motion. This is 
quite incredible because it pertains to one of my direct ancestors. I 
refer to one Thomas Percy who, on November 4, 1605, was chased 
by the soldiers of James I because he had been involved in the 
gunpowder plot.
<P>
	Thomas Percy joined up with Guy Fawkes and they rented a 
building next to the Houses of Parliament, spent six months 
burrowing through the wall into the cellar under the House of 
Lords. They filled it with 20 barrels of gun powder and intended to 
blow up the entire House of Lords, the privy council, James I, and 
hopefully get his successor as well.
<P>
	The plot failed, as members know, and my ancestor was pursued 
on the road to Dover and was captured at an inn where the king's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5830"> 5830 </A></B>
<P>
men rode up in the rain. Thomas Percy and other members of the 
conspiracy had laid their  gunpowder out to dry in front of the 
fireplace and a spark ignited it. There was an explosion and the 
king's men successfully captured my ancestor, Thomas Percy. He 
was hanged, drawn and quartered, all in the name of trying to 
obtain parliamentary privilege for members of Parliament.
<P>
	This issue of privilege goes back for centuries in parliamentary 
tradition. In fact, the English civil war was fought over this issue. It 
is not just a matter of summoning documents, it is also a 
fundamental issue of free speech and the ability of MPs to have 
freedom from arbitrary arrest or interference by the crown, by the 
state. James I, who was the target of the gunpowder plot, on several 
occasions arrested members of Parliament. This led directly to the 
English civil war which, I am happy to report, parliamentarians 
won against the royalists. This is one reason why we have 
privileges entrenched in the Canadian Parliament today.
<P>
	I should say that privilege, the right to speak freely in the House 
of Commons, the right to order documents, the right to have true 
witness from those we call before us, is something that has been 
fought long and hard for in the British tradition.
<P>
	However, we Canadians were fortunate because in 1867 we 
adopted these privileges in the Constitution Act without a war, 
without bloodshed and they became an essential part of our 
parliamentary tradition and an essential part of the way the House 
of Commons functions. If we cannot have immunity from arrest, if 
we cannot have freedom of speech and if we cannot summon the 
evidence that we must have in order to make our decisions clearly, 
then this Parliament cannot function adequately and serve the 
people who elected it.
<P>
	I come to Motion No. 42 from the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River. He raises the question of whether we 
have left behind the sense of privilege. Is there something the 
matter? Are we getting the return on the sense of privilege as it 
pertains to the summoning of documents and questioning of 
witnesses? I suggest we are not.
<P>
	Indeed, what was conferred on us by the Constitution Act of 
1867 we are losing through a process of neglect. As MPs we have 
over many decades failed to establish our need and our right to 
have the proper documents and the proper testimony from 
witnesses who come before us.
<P>
	Indeed, I regret to say that when I was elected as an MP for the 
first time in 1993, veteran MPs who had been in the House 
previously told me that there was not much point in taking part in 
standing committees because it was all by rote. It was all decided 
by the government in power. It was all decided by parliamentary 
secretaries who sat in the standing committees.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	There has been criticism in the House about the performance of 
standing committees. Nevertheless I have been very satisfied, for 
the most part, that MPs who are willing to speak out in standing 
committees, whether they are opposition MPs or government MPs, 
can be heard and can make a difference.
<P>
	It is true-and this is where the motion of the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River is so very important-that the one 
place where we hit a log jam is the repeated instances where 
officials called before the committee have refused to testify or have 
refused to give an answer.
<P>
	The motion is long overdue. It merely reminds Parliament of a 
privilege it has had for centuries, centuries of parliamentary 
tradition that should require proper testimony and evidence before 
the committee.
<P>
	I remind the House of something that we implement very rarely. 
Parliament has the option of compelling testimony under oath. This 
is one occasion on which we can bring people before us. If they fail 
to satisfy us, they are actually subject to a penalty equivalent to 
perjury.
<P>
	In conclusion, looking down the centuries I must say that we in 
Parliament should remember the origins of privilege in the British 
tradition which wars were fought over. We should remember that 
every one of us on all sides of the House have a fundamental 
obligation to defend the rights of every MP to obtain good 
information and adequate testimony both in committees and in any 
other location on Parliament Hill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague about the 
history of his forefather. If he were hanged and quartered I was 
wondering how my colleague evolved. I will speak a bit about 
history, democracy and the privileges we should have and should 
not have.
<P>
	Democracy comes from two Greek words, part of my ancestry, 
demos, which means people, and kratos, which means country. In 
the old ages in Athens people would gather at the bottom of the hill 
to have a say in what the state should be doing. At that time they 
did not have elected members of Parliament or an elected system 
but collectively they were there and made a decision.
<P>
	As we evolved we came to what we have today, the Westminster 
system and the parliamentary systems of different countries. 
People have different elections. Other people get elected at large. 
For example, in the parliamentary systems in Europe in the second 
district of Paris 20 or 30 members of Parliament are elected. In 
Canada we have a plus one system which means one 
parliamentarian gets elected for one seat.
<P>
	The constituents who have sent us here want us to voice their 
opinions in caucus. We all come here, as I did in 1988, with dreams 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5831"> 5831 </A></B>
<P>
and aspirations. We find out there is a larger game. We find out we 
have to listen to our  colleagues. We find out there are rules and 
procedures. It is not what we want it to be but by working in 
committees and here we can make changes.
<P>
	I always ask my constituents what one member of Parliament 
can do. I raise the example of when the Prime Minister put forward 
a private member's bill back in the sixties and changed the name of 
the Trans-Canada Airlines to Air Canada. Members of Parliament 
are effective.
<P>
	I commend my colleague from Scarborough-Rouge River, for 
bringing this important motion to the floor of the House. It gives us 
the right to access information. It gives us the right to ask. We do 
not have to be wary that if I ask this question somebody will crack 
my knuckles.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I support the motion my colleague has brought forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to Motion No. 142 in the name of the 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House unequivocally reconfirms the undoubted rights and privileges of 
the House of Commons, won from the crown and which became part of law many 
centuries ago, and in particular the unfettered right of the House and its committees 
to at all times compel the attendance of persons and require them to answer questions 
and to compel the production of such papers and documents as the House or 
committee considers necessary for the due carrying out of its mandate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I listened carefully to the mover of the motion, a second term 
member of Parliament who has worked very diligently in a 
particular area of the House in which many members do not get to 
participate. It has to do with security, intelligence and review, et 
cetera.
<P>
	The issue is important to the member because of the sensitivity 
and the importance of that area of responsibility in the House of 
Commons in terms of its mandate to create legislation and to 
ensure the laws of Canada are abided by.
<P>
	The principal issue I want to deal with, rather than referring to 
some of the history, is whether or not the House of Commons 
should be a body that is prepared in advance for a problem or 
whether or not it is presently exposing itself to a situation where 
should there be a problem there would be some confusion.
<P>
	The principal point raised by the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River is a very good point: the House has not 
in its history dealt with the confusion or uncertainty of the powers 
of the House.
<P>
	In my experience over the past three years as a member of 
Parliament dealing at the committee level, there have been times 
when I wondered whether or not there was an opportunity to bring 
to the committee forum additional information or expertise I knew 
was  available but had not accepted an invitation of the committee 
to be there.
<P>
	When I think of the important aspects that are dealt with by 
committees on behalf of the House, it raises a very important issue 
about whether or not committees have looked for opportunities to 
exercise this right which exists in law.
<P>
	The fact that it has not been affirmed within our place and the 
fact that it has not been tested or applied here are all the more 
reason for the motion to have been brought before the House.
<P>
	This is not a votable motion. At the end of the hour debate will 
cease. However it has raised the issue to a point where all hon. 
members will be looking for opportunities to test this right of 
Parliament.
<P>
	As the member for Scarborough-Rouge River pointed out in 
his presentation, the Canadian House of Commons has never 
reaffirmed this right of Parliament and of its committees to call for 
persons or papers.
<P>
	There has been a failure to articulate this right which leads to 
confusion. In the absence of a clear statement of authority, cabinet 
ministers and government officials may at some time be unaware. 
The powers of the committee must be more fully articulated.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Another issue raised was public confidence in Parliament. In 
terms of historical context, committee work in Parliament has not 
garnered public attention to any great extent.
<P>
	The role of a member of Parliament is very broad. It is most 
unfortunate that many Canadians feel the performance of members 
of Parliament and the credibility of this place are more reflected in 
the activities during question period, which is only 45 minutes of 
each day even though the House starts at 10 in the morning and 
continues to 6.30 at night.
<P>
	Committees operate in virtually every discipline. Members of all 
parties are represented on those committees. These facts are not 
well known to the Canadian public. It is unfortunate the Canadian 
public does not know what happens at committee. As a result or a 
consequence of Motion No. 142, possibly the role of committees 
can be reconsidered in light of the responsibilities seconded to 
them by the Chamber.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River 
for raising an important issue in terms of the fundamental aspects 
of the operation of the House of Commons of Canada, the 
important role committees play, and the potential for confusion or a 
problem down the road.
<P>
	Should a matter of importance to all Canadians and to the laws of 
Canada arise which would tend to put the House in some difficulty 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5832"> 5832 </A></B>
<P>
or jeopardy, it would reaffirm  the right of Parliament and the right 
of the committees to call for persons or papers.
<P>
	I thank the member for raising the motion. Possibly he would 
consider reintroducing it at an appropriate time to ensure that the 
House does not miss the opportunity to be prepared.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to take this opportunity to say a couple of words. Obviously 
there is no disagreement with the intention of the motion. There is a 
strong feeling about the importance of this principle and the 
entitlement of Parliament as the highest court in the land to have 
before it whatever information or witnesses it requires.
<P>
	I make one point which I hope we all bear in mind. We have 
exercised this right to be able to fulfil our responsibilities on behalf 
of the people who have sent us here to govern our country. It is not 
for our privilege as individuals but in our role as members of 
Parliament and representatives of the Canadian people. That 
element has been missing from the debate today.
<P>
	I compliment the hon. member for bringing forward the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for Private Members' 
Business has now expired.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on the motion which is not 
meant in anyway to be pejorative of the member in question, a 
person whom I respect greatly.
<P>
	The government motion basically asks that the member for 
Kingston and the Islands be made a deputy speaker of the House. 
As I said before, while I have a lot of respect for the individual we 
oppose it on the grounds that it is a breach of promise the 
government made to the House and Canadians.
<P>
	It is even more hypocritical because one member who put forth a 
document when in opposition recommended that two junior chair 
officers be from the opposition. That was a recommendation made 
by four prominent government members, one of whom is the hon. 
member nominated as the deputy chair.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	We feel that in order to honour the intentions of the promise 
made by the government when it was in opposition, it should fulfil 
its obligation and make an  opposition member a deputy chair. That 
would ensure that the Chair is non-partisan. It would increase the 
democracy which the government promised. That is one of the 
many promises which the government has failed to fulfil.
<P>
	We have put forward the name of the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam to fill the position. We strongly suggest that 
the government take that nomination into consideration and make 
this well qualified individual the deputy chair and thereby live up 
to its promise.
<P>
	That is only one of many promises on which the government has 
failed to deliver. I will address a number of those promises in my 
speech today.
<P>
	This weekend I was pleased to attend the Liberal convention in 
Ottawa as an observer for the Reform Party. The government made 
repeated claims to its members and to the Canadian public that it 
had lived up to 78 per cent of its red book promises. That is 
completely untrue. The government has kept 62 of 198 of its 
promises. It has failed to keep 136 of its promises. I would like to 
cite a few of the promises as examples because I do not believe the 
people know that the wool has been pulled over their eyes on a 
wide range of issues which deeply affect them.
<P>
	The first promise I would like to speak about is the GST. The 
government promised that it would abolish the GST. When we go 
to the stores what do we pay? GST. The government has had three 
years to do something about it, but it has done nothing.
<P>
	Second, it wanted to co-ordinate tax policies between the 
provinces and the federal government. That was a very worthwhile 
initiative. It is one from which all Canadians would benefit, 
whether in the private sector or in the public sector. Has there been 
any co-ordination? No.
<P>
	In three years there has not been any simplification of the tax 
system. The Reform Party has given to the government the 
elements of a flat tax proposal which would greatly simplify the 
system. Numerous suggestions have been made by Reform's 
finance people to simplify the tax system. Has the government 
adopted any of these measures? No.
<P>
	Then there was the promise to remove interprovincial trade 
barriers. I find it ironic that there are more trade barriers between 
Quebec and Ontario or any two provinces within Canada than 
between Canada and the United States. There is freer trade between 
Canada and the United States than between the provinces. That is 
deplorable. How can businesses become aggressive exporters, 
aggressive in their areas of endeavour, when the government has 
created trade barriers?
<P>
	Trade barriers dampen productivity, increase the costs of doing 
business within Canada, increase the unemployment rate and 
generally put a damper on the economy. What a great initiative it 
would have been if  the government had taken the bull by the horns 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5833"> 5833 </A></B>
<P>
and brought down interprovincial trade barriers. Unfortunately that 
has not happened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. I thought that this evening's debate was to deal with 
the qualifications, the worthiness and the appropriateness of an 
eight-year veteran of the House of Commons who is being 
considered for a deputy chair position.
<P>
	I have listened carefully in the last six or seven minutes. I 
believe that the litany of all the things which we have or have not 
done as a Liberal government is not relevant to the issue of this 
debate.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, could we call quorum, 
please?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Can we do one thing first. I think I will 
rule on the question of order before I do the quorum call. The 
House belongs to the members. The standing orders reflect, at least 
in theory, the views of the members. The Chair is not at liberty to 
say if the member is off the subject.
<P>
	Accordingly, when the issue is raised as it was by a member, the 
Chair is entitled to ask that the member speaking, whoever it might 
be, and I have great respect for the member who is speaking, might 
please bear in mind the subject matter that we are discussing.
<P>
	I am sure the member from Esquimalt will quickly be getting to 
the point that relates to the motion that is actually before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
attention of the-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> On a point of order. Quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry. Yes, in fact there are not 20 
members in the House. I would ask that the bells be rung.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We now have a quorum. There are more 
than 20 members in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
point I was getting to by raising this subject was to show that while 
the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands is a very competent 
individual and one for whom we have very great respect, this issue 
comes from a much larger issue. The issue here is a breach of 
promise. It has to do with credibility of the government. That is 
intimately associated with the issue.
<P>
	The government promised when in opposition that when it 
became the government, it would democratize the House. One 
initiative was to ensure that at least two junior members of the 
Chair would be members of the opposition. That is not what is 
being done here. Every member of the Chair right now is from the 
ruling party. There is a vacancy now. The proposal in the House 
today is to ensure that the vacancy does not go to a member of the 
opposition but to a member of the government. That is a breach of 
promise, a breach of a contract and it belies the much larger issue 
which is that this government is not living up to its promises. These 
are just a couple of examples.
<P>
	I want to get to the member's question by raising a couple of 
other issues which are very much related to the Chair and have to 
do with democratizing Parliament.
<P>
	When the government was in opposition it wanted to 
democratize the House. The Liberals wanted to make sure that 
committees would be empowered to truly bring the wishes of the 
public to the House and empower individual MPs and committees 
to bring forward solid solutions to the problems that affect us all. 
That does not happen because committees are an utter sham. I do 
not think the public recognize that. Committees are repeatedly 
asked to deal with subjects which have very little relevance to the 
problems that affect the country.
<P>
	When they deal with relevant matters and work very hard, long 
hours writing a document, using the expertise and time of members 
of the House, research staff, witnesses as well as thousands of 
taxpayers' dollars, what happens to the document? It gets about a 
day of play in the media then it is tossed on a shelf to be ignored. It 
has no relevance, no meaning, no input into legislation.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	What a waste of time, money and effort. What a waste of the 
potential and expertise of members in this House. I do not think 
that the public understands that the committee structures in this 
Parliament are very much a sham. It is in no way a reflection on the 
good, hard working members of Parliament, the research and 
ancillary staff that work very hard to try to make a difference. The 
structure prevents them from doing that. It is a real shame.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands with his 
colleagues had proposed initiatives to democratize the House and 
the structures under which we labour. However, absolutely nothing 
has happened.
<P>
	Today I introduced a private member's bill. Eight came to this 
House to determine votability. Out of those eight, only one private 
member's bill has a chance of being votable and therefore 
becoming law. Why do we have private members' bills that are not 
going to be made votable, and therefore can never become law? 
The whole issue becomes a sham and completely misrepresents to 
the public the fact that their individual MPs have the power to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5834"> 5834 </A></B>
<P>
introduce legislation that can become votable, can become law so 
that it can have an effect.
<P>
	It cannot happen because the structure does not allow it to 
happen. The government has had ample opportunity to make those 
changes. One of the changes is to make all private members' bills 
votable. That would empower the members to actually make an 
honest effort, make an impact on the welfare of Canadians.
<P>
	MPs also labour under a culture of fear. Because of the whip 
structure, if they do not do what the higher ups say in their 
respective parties, individual members of Parliament have their 
fists put down on them, as the government has repeatedly done. 
Their privileges to speak are removed. They cannot get on the 
committees that they want. They are removed from them. They 
become superfluous to the issues that affect them.
<P>
	Where are all the big decisions made in this House? The big 
decisions are made in the Prime Minister's Office by a few selected 
members of cabinet and by some of the captains of industry. These 
are the people who make the decisions. It is not this House that 
makes the major significant decisions that can truly have an impact 
on the country. It gives democracy in Canada a bad name to see this 
happening. We do not live in a democracy because this House and 
this Parliament are not a democracy.
<P>
	The government has had an opportunity to make changes that 
would empower individual MPs, would empower committees to 
actually make a change, to actually give people the power to speak 
through their MPs and affect the legislation that comes to this 
House. Unfortunately that does not happen.
<P>
	The public would be appalled if they truly knew what happens in 
this place and how powerless most of their MPs are to make 
changes within our fine country. What great opportunity do we 
have to do this?
<P>
	Perhaps the greatest disappointment I have had concerns health 
care. The government had a great opportunity. Its members said 
when they were running for office that health care was going to be a 
priority for them, that they were going to ensure that Canadians 
were going to get their health care when they medically needed it. 
They recognized that today Canadians from coast to coast are not 
receiving their health care when they need it. Instead, the 
government is adhering to the status quo. Why? Purely for political 
reasons.
<P>
	The Liberals want to look like the white knight that is going to 
defend the principles of the Canada Health Act, defend the status 
quo and defend the declining state of the health care system within 
Canada.
<P>
	The public does not realize that because most Canadians are 
healthy. However, some are not. It is sad that the sick people are the 
ones who truly understand the state of affairs of our health care 
system today.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	One of the wives of a member in the House is quite sick. She has 
been diagnosed with a serious illness. The member's wife will not 
receive treatment for over 30 days, which is not unusual.
<P>
	If someone is in British Columbia and requires treatment for 
breast cancer, the wait is over 40 days. If treatment is required for 
prostate cancer, the wait is over 40 days. If a new knee or hip is 
required by an elderly person who is in severe pain, the wait is over 
seven months. That is not access to timely health care. In fact, it is 
a transgression of one of the basic pillars of the Canadian health 
system: accessibility for all Canadians.
<P>
	We cannot defend the current system as it stands. We can and we 
must build a better system. Not an American system; that can stay 
south of the border. We do not want an American style health care 
system in Canada, period, end of story. What we can do is build a 
better, made in Canada health care system that will provide timely 
access for all people regardless of their income and ensure that 
their essential health care services are going to be met when it is 
medically needed, not when the bottom line allows it.
<P>
	Adhering to the current principles as they stand is fallacious. 
Right now portability does not exist. Quebec and the other nine 
provinces do not have an agreement. Therefore, somebody in 
Quebec would not necessarily get their services in other parts of the 
country.
<P>
	I have dealt with the accessibility issue. There is no universality. 
If somebody in British Columbia or any other province chooses not 
to pay their medical premiums, they do not have coverage. They do 
not have to be treated. There is a significant pool of individuals 
who do not have coverage because they choose not to. These people 
are not covered under the health plans as they exist and they put 
themselves forward as wards of the state. This is only because they 
choose not to be covered. Comprehensive coverage also does not 
exist because coverage varies from province to province.
<P>
	Perhaps the greatest tragedy I see in this issue is that there is a 
great opportunity. We have to put aside the rhetoric. The rhetoric 
the government is putting forth on health care is only going to do a 
huge disservice to Canadians.
<P>
	Giving people a choice, for example by allowing for private 
health care clinics where only private moneys are exchanged and 
no tax dollars are spent, enables people to come off existing 
waiting lists if they choose to go to the private sector. This would 
provide more money for and better access to the public system. The 
private system would be subsidizing the public system; the rich 
would be subsidizing the poor. It would provide better access for 
everybody.
<P>
	In closing, we disagree with this motion because it transgresses a 
basic promise the government made. We  hope the government 
does not break this promise as it has broken so many others in its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5835"> 5835 </A></B>
<P>
red book. We hope the government will listen to the ideas put forth 
by the member for Kingston and the Islands and three other 
distinguished members from the Liberal government to 
democratize this House and allow a member from the opposition to 
sit in the Chair as one of the deputy speakers. We suggest that the 
member be one from the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is truly an 
honour to speak to this motion. I have gone through the report, 
which I am sure all of us have puzzled over, which looks at reviving 
parliamentary democracy. The member for Kingston and the 
Islands was one of the people who put the report forward. It is 
rather shocking, after this report which says that two opposition 
members should also share in the role of Speaker, that the member 
now finds himself in conflict in this situation.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	I would like to demonstrate the true meanspirited nature of the 
Liberal government, the true spirit of the spin doctors and 
manipulators and the whole despicable performance that has been 
created within this Parliament and this country. We have had years 
of this sort of government and Canadians are sick and tired of it. 
Canadians are sick and tired of the old Canada which is withering 
and full of these problems.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is really yesterday's man and is leading us 
backward into the past. There was the situation today where an 
individual was telling us, totally incorrectly, that because 
Reformers would dare to visit Washington and talk to all the 
politicians there, including Mr. Newt Gingrich, that it somehow 
makes us part of the extremist right. The point to make clear is that 
the Reformers were probably as surprised as anyone else at just 
how different we really are, just how much difference there is 
between a Canadian and an American. Whether we are looking at 
our political system, social system, hospital system or other 
systems, the differences are obvious.
<P>
	Yes, we are annoyed. We are more than annoyed when we get 
this kind of treatment from that sort of an individual in our country. 
We Reformers are annoyed when we see posters of an evolutionary 
chart and we are at the bottom and the Liberals have the arrogance 
to put themselves at the top. It is that kind of arrogance that would 
cause a motion to appoint all speakers from the one party, even 
though there is a promise to democratize this place; a promise to 
open it up and to make it more transparent, to enter the 21st century 
with some kind of a vision rather than the meanspirited dictatorship 
which we are now subject to in this place.
<P>
	As we examine this motion we can see the deception that has 
gone on. We can go through the list and talk about some of the 
promises. There is the member of Parliament pension plan. The 
Liberals said they were  going to reform and fix it. Sure, just a little 
dust over and now it is fine. Canadians are not going to accept that 
sort of deception. Who opted out? The members across know who 
did and we Reformers are proud of it. Reform is showing a vision 
for the next century.
<P>
	The Liberals said: ``Yes we will get rid of the GST, we will scrap 
it, we will get rid of it. We promise we will. Elect us and we will do 
it''. Who are the ones who are making politicians the low lives of 
this country? Who is doing that? It is not Reformers who are doing 
it. It is the party opposite that is just adding more and more fuel to 
the fire by the sorts of things that we have seen it do this week.
<P>
	The GST harmonization: another billion dollar grab from the 
other provinces. It is not even acceptable in the provinces that have 
agreed to it but it is better than nothing.
<P>
	What about health care? Again we have heard the deception, that 
we are the ones who will burn and scrap this system, that there will 
be a two tier system. Our health care system is in disarray. Look at 
it in this province, or look at it in my home province. There are 
waiting lists. People are waiting 30 days, six months and seven 
months. My wife has a serious problem and she has to wait three 
months to see a specialist.
<P>
	That is the sort of quality we have in our health care system. That 
is what makes this government say: ``Those people across the way, 
they are destroying the system''. It is the $3 billion cut from the 
feds. It is not just the provinces. Canadians are going to see that and 
then they will understand what the government is like.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	Canadians will then understand why it is going against the 
recommendation of the member himself, that there should be a 
person from the opposition put in the Chair. That was a 
recommendation from the member for Kingston and the Islands 
and now the government is going against that. It is deception of the 
worst kind in this place.
<P>
	The list goes on and on. In 1969 the debt was zero; in 1972 it was 
$17 billion. Would it not be nice to be back there? Then we really 
got into it and by 1984, when we were all totally disgusted with the 
Liberal government, we were up to $180 billion in debt and we said 
that we could not let it go any further. But it did go further and the 
day we all got elected it was $489 billion.
<P>
	Now the Liberals are saying that they have it under control. 
Canadians are asking: ``Do they really have it under control? Do 
they really? What are they going to tell us in 1997?'' They are 
going to say $610 billion or $620 billion. Under control? Again the 
whole picture before us is one of total misrepresentation and it goes 
on and on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5836"> 5836 </A></B>
<P>
	We are told that the unemployment problem has been solved 
and infrastructure programs are taking place. Boy, that is fixing 
everything. Tell that to the 1.4 million people who are 
unemployed, the two million to three million who are 
underemployed, the one in four people who are worried they will 
lose their jobs. Tell them it is under control.
<P>
	Again this deception, this smoke and mirrors, saying one thing 
and doing something else, saying there will be a more open 
Parliament, a speaker which will represent all parties. No offence 
to the position, Mr. Speaker. It is one that all of us in this place 
honour, but here is a chance to reform this place. Here is a little 
way of doing it. However, we see closure, shutting down the 
debate. Again, we add to the nails in the coffin of the people who 
say what they think about this place.
<P>
	We can talk about the criminal justice system and how it is 
doing. Talk to the victims. Yesterday I spoke to a constituent of 
mine who was victimized by a 10-year old. We are not solving 
these social problems. We are going down the middle saying that if 
we close our eyes, we will not have to see them. People are 
watching and they are seeing what is happening here. When the 
government does have an opportunity to fix a situation, it does not. 
It just does not make any attempt to try to change the perceptions 
people have.
<P>
	What do Canadians think about the other place? Just ask anyone 
what they think about it. I do not care what political party they 
belong to. Ask them if they think the other place needs to be 
changed. On the kind of change we might have differences of 
opinion but just ask the people if it should be changed. They will 
say without a doubt, probably in the 90 per cent range, that the 
other place needs to changed.
<P>
	The government has a chance to make some changes here 
tonight, but it is not going to because it is status quo. The 
government believes in the old line of thinking. We can look at how 
things work in the House, how the committees work, free votes and 
private members' bills. All of those things present an opportunity 
to make a change.
<P>
	I cannot help but think back to a couple of years ago on an access 
to information bill. I was more naive three years ago. I said: ``What 
do you think of this?'' I got it from the access commissioner. He 
recommended this change. It came out of his report. The Liberals 
endorsed it back in 1990. They said it was a great idea. However, it 
did not pass the House. The reason it did not pass was two and a 
half years ago everybody got up and said: ``Yes, it is a very good 
motion, but there will be amendments made to the Access to 
Information Act. The justice minister will put them forward in the 
next year or two. Do not worry about it. That is why we voted 
against your motion''. We are still waiting for those changes.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	I have put forward another private member's bill which deals 
with peacekeeping. Should we vote in the House for peacekeeping? 
<P>
Should we have all the facts before we vote? Should there be atree vote?
<P>
	That seems very straightforward. Certainly that is what 
Canadians want. However, it will be defeated in the House because 
we have to keep the status quo and we have to let a few guys at the 
top make the decisions.
<P>
	We have a centralized, sluggish organization that wants to keep 
the status quo. It could be made much better.
<P>
	I feel very fortunate to be involved in the foreign affairs area. In 
that area, if in no other, we should be able to work together on 
things. We try to work together on issues which are good for 
Canadians.
<P>
	Parliament could be much more constructive if we could work 
together for the betterment of Canadians. Somehow we have to 
change the system to do that. As long as attendance is like this, and 
as long as there is so little chance to make a difference we will not 
make any changes. We will just carry on until finally the Canadian 
people will say ``enough''. It should not have to go that far. The 
country should not have to be hurt that much. Can the country 
survive if we do not act?
<P>
	We are now celebrating what happened a year ago. A year ago 
the vote was 50.5 per cent to 49.5 per cent. That well could have 
spelled the end of this country. That is how close we are to 
Canadians losing faith in their Parliament.
<P>
	What can we do to bring back the faith? Certainly one little tiny 
thing would be to elect an opposition member to be the junior 
speaker. I have heard some say that it cannot be a Reform member. 
Why does someone not amend it to make it a Bloc member? Make 
it one of those other guys. Make it whomever, but make it an 
opposition member. At least start the process of change, change 
that is so necessary for this House.
<P>
	We might say that it really will not make a difference anyway 
because of the Liberal majority and the way majorities work. If we 
started making changes we might be surprised at how they might 
catch on. We might be surprised at how that might lead to a better 
place. It would be a better place for the country, for the members 
and for all those associated with this place. We would all benefit 
from that.
<P>
	I am sure that all of us are asking ourselves if we are going to run 
in the next election. We are asking ourselves what else we could do. 
We are asking ourselves if we have made a difference. The thing 
which makes it most rewarding for all of us is when we go home 
and we have our town hall meetings and people say: ``Thank you 
for representing us. It must be a tough job''.
<P>
	If I did not hear that a lot I might say ``enough is enough''.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	Because they say that, we come back down here. I often tell them 
that it is sort of like getting thrown out of the ring, going back 
home, getting picked up, sorted out and thrown back into the ring. 
We get on a plane and come back down here and try again.
<P>
	When we go through something like this, we say: ``Is it worth it? 
Am I making a difference? Are they going to just slam stuff 
through whether it is good or bad? Is status quo the only thing we 
think of in this place?''
<P>
	I plead with the members across as we vote on something like 
this to think about it, make an amendment, make any kind of 
amendment to improve this. Show Canadians, show 
parliamentarians, show the people who are watching that we care 
about this country.
<P>
	Obviously the Prime Minister has said enough times in this 
House: ``The only reason there are people who want to leave this 
country is that they have given up on it''. The best way to defeat 
separatism in any part of Canada obviously is to make it better, 
make it some place that people can respect and feel part of.
<P>
	I am saying that this motion that is before us tonight is just one 
step that might help put us that one more step.
<P>
	When we hear parliamentarians, as we did this past weekend, 
rating themselves as A+, as the very best, Canadians are saying: 
``Boy, let's look at the list on taxation. Are we better off? No. It is 
$23 billion, We are paying more taxes than we were before''.
<P>
	On the whole social policy, are we better off? No, the line-ups 
are longer. There are more social programs today than ever before. 
On labour policies, are we better off? No, not at all. Look at The 
problems we have in that whole area.
<P>
	Cultural policies, the unity issue and the report card could go on 
and on. Canadians out there have that report card. They are keeping 
score. Again I say to this House that this is a chance to make one 
little change and show that at least this House is prepared to look at 
some kind of reform of this place to make it better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You might 
want to check the blues or the hon. member might want to confirm 
it, but I think I heard him a few minutes ago use the word 
meanspirited in referring to this side of the House.
<P>
	If he indeed used that word, I would ask that he withdraw it. I 
base that request on a ruling that you made in this House a couple 
of years ago.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I did hear the word meanspirited. It 
is the age old story of what is parliamentary today may be 
unparliamentary tomorrow and vice versa. Sometimes the word is 
not used in the same context as the other. In this case I found that in 
the context that it was used it was not unparliamentary. I thank you 
for bringing it to my attention. It shows that  we are all in this 
debate. I would say at least at this point from what I heard it would 
not be a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to begin by saying it is really sad on an 
evening like this when we will be voting to ask someone to be the 
deputy chair of the House that we have not had more time 
discussing the background and the qualities that the member for 
Kingston and the Islands has exhibited in this House over the last 
eight years.
<P>
	With respect to many of the members of the Reform Party, had 
they been here when we were in opposition when the Conservative 
government was operating this place they would have witnessed a 
man who showed a tremendous amount of love for this Chamber. 
He practically lived in here for his first term.
<P>
	He developed a keen sense of understanding about the technical 
aspects of the House. He committed himself to becoming a master 
of the House, understanding the rules and making sure that there 
was fair play and accountability on the government side of the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	I think the members of the Reform Party are at a bit of a 
disadvantage when it comes to assessing the member for Kingston 
and the Islands because they did not witness that experience. He 
has served a tremendous apprenticeship which suits him to take 
over this assignment.
<P>
	It is too bad that tonight, what should be a total acclamation of a 
great member of Parliament, is being stained and clouded by a 
diversionary tactic of the opposition to prevent this member who 
has such merit from being appointed.
<P>
	For the last little while I have listened to the members of the 
Reform Party. I want to go back to the very first time that the leader 
of the Reform Party stood in this House. He said the members of 
the Reform Party over this term would only stand and criticize the 
government if they had constructive alternatives to the government 
pathway and that they would do it in a way that was not like the 
traditional jousting and bickering that tends to go on during 
question period.
<P>
	We can see that after three or four months in this Chamber 
Reform Party members have fallen into the traditional partisan 
habits of opposition parties. I find that sad because there were 
many good thoughts put on the table tonight and many good 
observations about what really does happen in this House of 
Commons and in committees. Many of their observations are about 
the fact that effectiveness of the utilization of committee 
recommendations is not really high. There is a lot of good talent 
and good ideas which go on in those committees which really never 
see the light of day. I thought that some of the Reform members 
who brought that point up made a good observation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5838"> 5838 </A></B>
<P>
	However, we know that the real root of the problem for this 
Chamber is not what goes on in the committees and in debate here 
on bills as they come through the House. The real root evolves 
from question period. The members of the Reform Party over the 
last three years had a chance to do something different.
<P>
	I do not think many Canadians realize how question period 
operates in this country. I do not think many Canadians realize that 
most of it is sort of a rigged deal. In other words, every morning we 
all know that the tacticians from both sides of the House meet in 
their offices and the opposition members sit there and say ``okay, 
let us see what the media is saying about issues all across the 
country and let us see how we can sort of find one or two things to 
embarrass the government''. These are not ideas coming from the 
members from their own committee experiences. By and large they 
tend to design their questions from what they see in the media.
<P>
	Lo and behold, on the other side of the House we have tacticians 
sitting there for the government almost having a contest as to what 
questions opposition members are going to ask today. They wonder 
how many questions they can anticipate are going to be asked and 
how accurate are they going to be. What do we have here? We have 
a phony joust every day in question period. There is not a member 
of Parliament in this House who will say that this is anything other 
than an almost predictable exercise every day.
<P>
	This is what Canadians are fed up with. They are not fed up with 
what goes on in committee because they see very little of 
committee. The members are right, that is where a lot of good work 
goes on. However, what is the face that we put to Canadians in this 
Chamber? It is the face of that 30 second little joust clip that goes 
on in question period. In the last three and a half years Reform 
members had a chance to try to change that and make question 
period a more meaningful exercise. That is what the leader of the 
Reform Party said he would do the first time he spoke in the House.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	I want to be specific. I am not criticizing the Reform Party just to 
criticize. I am trying to convey the genuineness they are trying to 
show with regard to making the Chamber more meaningful. I say 
question period could be different. Reform members or the 
members of the opposition should not govern themselves or design 
their questions based on the media. They should base them on their 
own committee experience and what they personally believe is the 
issue of the day. They should control the agenda rather than letting 
the media control it.
<P>
	That is one of the sicknesses around here. By and large the media 
controls the agenda of most members of Parliament, and it should 
be the reverse. Members of Parliament should be controlling the 
agenda.
<P>
	I give a specific example. Members have stood in the past few 
hours to talk about the flawed health care system as it is evolving 
and about some of the shortcomings of government.
<P>
	I could make the case the Reform Party has caused most of the 
flaws. I should not say flaws. If the Liberal government has been a 
little less liberal than what it has been traditionally, it is primarily 
because of the Reform Party which has an obsession with deficit 
and debt. How can it be so obsessed with deficit and debt and 
expect the health care system to be anything other than what it is?
<P>
	We have a pathway of deficit and debt reduction around here that 
is crazy. We are cutting off our nose to spite our face. We are 
destroying national institutions because of the deep cuts that are 
going on.
<P>
	The Reform Party has taken some credit for the heavy duty focus 
on deficit and debt. We in the Chamber are supposed to be here not 
for the advantaged but to speak for the disadvantaged. Traditionally 
the opposition party is supposed to make sure government is 
accountable and there is some balance.
<P>
	I humbly say those members of Parliament have not been a 
factor in ensuring a balance as we go through reconstruction or 
modernization. They have been too extreme and that extremism 
does not help the quality of life. It exacerbates the breakdown of 
some institutions going through a very difficult period.
<P>
	I have a great respect for the Chamber. I continue to enjoy my 
experience in the House of Commons. I have a deep understanding 
and respect for where the Reform Party is coming from. However, 
if Reformers want to make this work, they have to carve out a new 
pathway or a different approach which should start at question 
period. Until we clean up the House at question period to make it 
real and not a gimmick, nothing will change. It will go on.
<P>
	There is not a kid or a serious person in Canada who will tell us 
to our face that they love what goes on in question period, that they 
think what goes on there is great, that they admire what happens 
there. I have never found the person, anyway. If the Reform Party 
were serious about making the House more meaningful it would 
focus on the root problem.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	I end by saying that I came to the House of Commons with the 
member for Kingston and the Islands who is a fabulous Chamber 
member. He loves the Chamber. He has worked his buns off to 
ensure that fair play is part of the rules and the different sorts of 
things that go on here. It is part of his being.
<P>
	If the members of the Reform Party believe in change, they 
should not stain an evening like tonight when such a fine member 
will be appointed in any event. We should all get behind him and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5839"> 5839 </A></B>
<P>
put trust that he and the Speaker  over the next few months can 
perhaps make a few changes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to rise tonight to participate in the debate.
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood has joined us. As 
usual he was very eloquent in making his point, but he missed the 
point of the debate that is taking place tonight and indeed earlier 
today. The debate is not about the qualifications of the member for 
Kingston and the Islands. Speaker after speaker on this side of the 
House has made that point and I will make it. I think he is very well 
qualified for the position. I have been a great admirer of his but that 
is not what it is about.
<P>
	The debate tonight is about his appointment being another 
Liberal broken promise. It is not about the member. It is about the 
fact that promises made to Canadians to get elected have not been 
kept. I will focus my remarks on the severity or the impact of those 
broken promises on Canadians. This is a small one by comparison 
to some that have been made.
<P>
	Last weekend there was a great deal of accounting: ``78 per cent 
of our promises kept''. Numbers were kicked around. I have done 
my own tabulation and I have rated the impact of the promises that 
were made. The Liberal government made two promises to get 
elected that I would put in the 90 per cent category: job creation 
and the GST. Those two promises rated with the Canadian people 
somewhere about 90 per cent. The others were nickel and dime 
stuff compared to those two promises. Very few Canadians went 
beyond the third or fourth promise, but those two broken promises 
had a great impact on Canadians and played a great role in getting 
the government elected.
<P>
	I focus on the jobs promised at election time and the GST. In 
1993 during that election campaign Canadians wanted to believe 
the government would be able to create the jobs they so desperately 
needed. Some 1.4 million Canadians were out of work. They 
wanted to believe the Liberal government and voted for the Liberal 
government on that promise.
<P>
	They wanted to get rid of the GST. They voted for that Liberal 
government because it was to abolish it. It was to scrap it. They 
hated it and I think the member for Broadview-Greenwood would 
agree. He knows the impact of the GST promise in his riding and 
many ridings across Canada.
<P>
	Those two major promises were not kept. They got the Liberals 
elected but once elected they were soon forgotten. I am not 
referring to the member for Broadview-Greenwood who did the 
honourable thing.
<P>
	Let us talk about the broken promise on jobs for a minute. Three 
years down the road we still have 1.4 million unemployed 
Canadians; 18 per cent of our youth and several million Canadians 
with jobs are worried sick  about how much longer they will have 
them. They just do not know if they will be employed a year from 
now. That is the reality of the broken promise. It has turned out to 
be a cruel hoax. Unemployed people were looking for that promise, 
looking for those jobs which in fact did not materialize.
<P>
	The Liberal government has yet to make the connection between 
the high tax burden and the lack of job creation. There is a 
relationship there and it still has not made it.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	That was evidenced a little over a week ago when the Prime 
Minister said: ``No, if we get a few extra bucks there won't be any 
tax relief; we will put those extra dollars into social programs''. 
There was arrogance in that statement. For hard working overtaxed 
Canadians there was no hope for tax relief. The indication is that if 
there are extra dollars they will go into social programs. That is not 
what Canadians wanted to hear. It is further proof there was 
misplaced trust in the government when it was elected in 1993.
<P>
	To find out about creating jobs why not go to the people who 
create jobs and find out how it is done? The Chamber of Commerce 
is the organization that represents the job creators.
<P>
	I quote from a letter sent to all members of Parliament and the 
Senate in December 1994 from the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce which represents 170,000 entrepreneurs, hard working 
small business people that create the jobs: ``The next federal 
budget will be crucial to the future of our country. Tough choices 
will be necessary. Despite the overwhelming consensus that the 
deficit must be cut we fear that the cuts will not be deep enough. 
The finance minister's promise to meet his target of a deficit that is 
3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 is simply not good enough. The 
deficit must be reduced to zero by 1997-98. The consequences of 
the government not following through on this is unthinkable''.
<P>
	Those are the people who create the jobs. That was the result of a 
survey of 6,000 of their members. Perhaps it was not what the 
government wanted to hear. The government ignored it because it 
still had not made the connection on how to create jobs by reducing 
the tax burden of Canadians.
<P>
	I think back to when we were first elected. We in Reform ran on 
the deficit and the debt. The member for Broadview-Greenwood 
thinks we are fixated on the deficit and the debt. It is not the deficit 
and the debt. It is what the government is doing to job creation, 
taxes and our social programs. That is what Reform is concerned 
about. That is the impact or the connection the government has not 
been made yet. That is what is killing jobs. That is why our taxes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5840"> 5840 </A></B>
<P>
are so high. That is why medicare is in trouble. It is the deficit and 
the debt. Until the government gets that message it just will not 
happen.
<P>
	Reform campaigned on it. When we were running on that 
platform in 1993 the Liberals were saying: ``It is not a problem. 
What are you worried about? You are fearmongering''. Because of 
that the first budget brought down by our finance minister did 
absolutely nothing to deal with the deficit and the debt. Actually it 
was worse than nothing because part of that first budget gave in to 
the smugglers and gave away $300 million to $400 million in 
tobacco taxes. It was unbelievable in the position we were in that 
they threw away tax dollars so desperately needed.
<P>
	The first budget from the finance minister ignores the most 
serious problem we have today. I have heard members say: ``We 
just got here. We didn't know anything about it. We didn't know it 
was that serious. We were just elected''. That might hold for some 
of the backbenchers but most in the front row, most of the cabinet 
ministers in government, had been in opposition. They were not 
rookies. They knew the state of the economy. They knew the state 
of the tax burden. In fact when they were in opposition they 
opposed most attempts by the Conservative government to do 
something about it.
<P>
	In the second budget the finance minister all of a sudden started 
to talk about the serious problem with the deficit and debt. It was 
killing jobs. It took two budgets. He found out in the second budget 
that we had a problem, but even in the second budget he failed to do 
anything about it.
<P>
	The finance minister did nothing about it even with a warning 
shot from Moody's, the bond rating people. They told the finance 
minister there was a serious problem: ``The people who buy your 
bonds come to us for advice. Unless you do a couple of things we 
will not be advising them to buy your bonds or if they are going to 
buy them we will advise them to look for an extra point''. Moody's 
said: ``Your 3 per cent target of GDP is too low. You could fall over 
that. That is not a target. We want a date for when you are going to 
get to zero. Don't give me rolling two-year targets somewhere 
down the road''. When I heard that from the finance minister I saw 
myself in business going to my bank manager with my overdraft 
which I had for many years and the bank manager says: ``When are 
you going to have it paid off?'' I would say to him: ``I'm not going 
to tell you-somewhere down the road''. I would be out the door, I 
would be gone and my note would be called.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	However, we play that game on the Canadian taxpayers. They 
are not buying it. That advice of Moody's was ignored and we were 
downgraded, unfortunately. However, by the third budget he was 
really starting to get the message. He realized that yes, we have to 
make some cuts. We did not get cuts. We got scrapes. We did not 
get the cuts that we needed; too little, too late.
<P>
	Here we are, three years from when the government took office. 
We were just under $500 billion in debt. It will have added over 
$100 billion to the debt. We are approaching $600 billion of debt.
<P>
	The finance minister stands up and brags about 3 per cent of 
GDP. He does not talk about the $400 billion, $500 billion, $600 
billion of debt that he has put this country in. Of course the real 
cruncher is $50 billion in interest payments to service that debt. 
The 68 cent government is what the Canadian people have now. 
One-third of tax dollars goes to pay the debt, just the interest on our 
debt. The interest on our debt now is equivalent to our social 
program spending. It is growing faster than any item in the budget.
<P>
	What do we get from the finance minister? Interest rates are the 
answer. We get reduced interest rates. It is not interest rates. It is 
taxes. Canadians want lower taxes, not lower interest rates. We 
need to leave more dollars in the pockets of the people who are 
going to buy the goods and get the economy moving.
<P>
	I have to quote the Prime Minister because I think this is at the 
mind block that is there on this deficit and debt. This is a statement 
the Prime Minister made during a town hall meeting and it was 
reported in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>: ``PM downplays massive serving cost. 
The debt load is no problem. Of course we have a debt but we can 
pay off our interest. We have no problem at all. Fifty billion of 
interest payments is not a problem''. We just tax the people and get 
more taxes from those compassionate, caring people.
<P>
	What about health care? We are not creating jobs, but not a 
problem, $50 billion is not a problem. This is the leader of the 
party. If that kind of thinking is what is coming down from cabinet 
we are never going to get tax relief because we do not have a 
problem. Tell that to the 1.5 million unemployed who say: ``What 
is the problem? Why can't I get a job?'' Those unemployed people 
are not interested in interest rates. They are interested in doing 
something about getting their taxes reduced and there is absolutely 
no hope.
<P>
	The other big broken promise of course was NAFTA. They were 
going to rewrite NAFTA, scrap NAFTA. Thank God it did not 
happen. The only jobs we have in this country are because of free 
trade and NAFTA. That is a broken promise.
<P>
	Right now it is not Canadians who are spending money. It is our 
exports that are keeping us going. Of course free trade was opposed 
by the Liberals when they were in opposition. It is interesting now 
to hear them stand up in the House and rant and rave about the 
600,000 jobs. Those jobs have been created by free trade and 
NAFTA and they opposed it. They do not know how to create jobs. 
That is the sad truth of the situation today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5841"> 5841 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us talk for a moment about the GST. I know that is very 
near and dear to the heart of the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. He did the right thing on that. He knew 
that he was elected by a large number of people in his riding on 
the basis of that being scrapped and when the government did not 
deal with it he did the right thing. I applaud him for it.
<P>
	That won a lot of votes. That was the most hated tax by 
Canadians and may still be because of the way it was put through. 
Not that it is a bad tax; I happen to think that the GST is a very fair 
tax. It replaced the old manufacturers' sales tax. I think it was 
brought in at a higher level than it needed to be but it was sure a lot 
fairer tax than the one it replaced.
<P>
	Nevertheless, Canadians hated it. It still comes up at meetings 
and I am asked, as I am sure the hon. member across the aisle is, 
``When are you going to get rid of it? Why isn't it paying off the 
debt?'' A lot of Canadians thought it was a brand new tax, the 
receipts from which were going to do something about the deficit 
and the debt. They did not understand the difference.
<P>
	Those were two major promises, scrap, abolish, get rid of. Never 
mind the fine print in the red book, those were the words that were 
used and of course the words that were used by the Deputy Prime 
Minister ended up costing her job. She had to resign because she 
did not honour the promise that was made to the people. It was 
unfortunate that it took as long as it did for that promise to be 
honoured. This was the government that was elected on another 
promise of restoring integrity in government and faith in the 
process, yet we had the Deputy Prime Minister not honouring her 
word.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	All members of this House, indeed all politicians, were being 
hurt by the fact that her word was not being kept. It was so typical 
of politicians who will say one thing to get elected and do whatever 
once elected. Then we get this excuse: ``I was only running for 
office. What are you getting so worked up about? It was just a little 
white lie. Not to worry''.
<P>
	I want to talk about Ontario because I am from Ontario. I am the 
only Reformer from Ontario. Ontario is not being looked after by 
this government. Ontario is suffering badly even though 98 of 99 in 
'93.
<P>
	I am going to talk about Pearson airport, the jewel of Canadian 
infrastructure. In my view, and I think the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood would agree, there is not a more 
important piece of infrastucture in Canada. The government was 
elected on an infrastructure program with $6 billion of borrowed 
money and it completely ignored this major piece of infrastructure 
right in Toronto. It was not just the jobs that were going to be 
created in overhauling terminals I and II. Four or five thousand 
jobs could have been created immediately. That airport impacts on 
jobs all across Canada. That is  where industries fly in and out of 
when they are looking to expand or locate their plants.
<P>
	The irony there is a government elected on an infrastructure 
program completely ignores Ontario's and Canada's most 
important piece of infrastructure. We are getting into Pearson and 
the hypocrisy of the Liberals. When they were campaigning they 
said they would examine that complex deal.
<P>
	They had Mr. Nixon do a 30 day review of that contract. That 
review raised a lot of questions and a lot of suspicion but contained 
no hard facts to suggest this was a bad deal, not one hard fact.
<P>
	The government introduced a bill on the basis of that report 
which had no concrete evidence that the deal should be cancelled, 
yet the government cancelled it. Again, it was the government's 
right to do, but it introduced a bill that would deny Canadian 
citizens their day in court. Those developers would not have the 
opportunity to defend their good names. There are some Canadians 
whose names have been dragged through the mud because of the 
Liberal government and this bill would deny them their day in 
court.
<P>
	The bill was defeated in other place and now it has been defeated 
in a court of law. The Liberals have failed to prove that was a bad 
deal. In a court of law it has been established that it was not a bad 
deal after all. When the government appealed the decision, it even 
lost the appeal.
<P>
	It has gone through the process and it has been proven that the 
original deal would have been a good deal for Canadians. Both 
those terminals would be functioning more efficiently now. We 
would have created those jobs and many more jobs right across the 
country.
<P>
	Now the only thing that is being debated in court is the 
compensation which the developers are entitled to because it was a 
good deal. Now what is the government arguing in court? It is now 
arguing that it did the developers a favour in cancelling it because 
they were going to lose their shirts. I cannot believe the hypocrisy 
of that position, that the government would have the nerve to do 
that. It will end up costing us $400 million or $500 million before 
that is through. It was unbelievable to see the Liberals denying 
citizens their day in court.
<P>
	The other issue is Toronto as an international banking centre. I 
would like to quote the former mayor of Toronto. When the 
decision was made to bypass Toronto and give it to Montreal and 
Vancouver, the former mayor called the decision crass politics at its 
worst: ``All this adds up to is bad news for Toronto because we 
have been openly discriminated against by the federal 
government''.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	It just so happens that former mayor of Toronto is now a member 
of the Liberal cabinet. He is a cabinet minister. He had 98 members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5842"> 5842 </A></B>
<P>
from Ontario to do  something about crass politics, to do something 
about the fact that Toronto was bypassed, the capital of Ontario.
<P>
	In three years with the former mayor now sitting as a cabinet 
minister nothing has happened. Toronto still has not been given the 
distinction that it so rightly deserves.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, there was a lawsuit. The lawsuit originated 
by this former mayor of Toronto. It is still coming forward. This 
government is going to be sued for bypassing Toronto and not 
giving it the status it should have received three or four years ago.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to bring out some of these broken 
promises. Really that is what we are focusing on tonight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this motion. It 
is interesting that it is the appointment of a replacement for one of 
your deputies that has sparked this very interesting debate in the 
House.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak regarding the appointment of my hon. 
colleague from Kingston and the Islands to the position of 
Assistant Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole.
<P>
	I have the honour of knowing the member. I worked with him on 
the procedure and House affairs committee when I was first elected 
and served as Reform's House leader. As a parliamentarian, of 
course, I have no objection whatsoever to the hon. member's 
holding the position of the Assistant Deputy Chairman of 
Committees of the Whole. I would hope that the hon. member is 
following the debate. I am sure he is watching this debate with 
great interest.
<P>
	In a report released in January 1993 regarding the independence 
of the Chair, the authors firmly stated that the assistant deputy 
speaker should be alternated between government and opposition 
parties, citing the Westminster model as an example. By using this 
model, they said that their authority would be greatly enhanced and 
the non-partisan nature of the Chair would be greatly augmented.
<P>
	Most ironically but not surprisingly, the report is titled: ``The 
Liberal Plan for the House of Commons''. The authors are the 
current Minister of Health, the labour minister, formerly the 
government whip and the opposition whip before the last election, 
the Minister of International Co-operation, the former government 
whip who was recently appointed to cabinet, and even the hon. 
member who is being considered for the appointment, the member 
for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood paid quite a tribute to 
the hon. member and suggested that somehow Reform was going 
beneath the dignity of the House to even have a debate on his 
appointment to the Chair.
<P>
	He talked about the wonderful qualities of the MP for Kingston 
and the Islands and what a great parliamentarian he is. I do not 
quibble with those observations.
<P>
	Then he went on to somehow suggest that we should not review 
the hon. member's statement here, his paper, about opposition 
members being appointed as deputy chair.
<P>
	He got into the whole issue of question period and my leader's 
statement that we wanted to make this House work better, that we 
want to be a constructive opposition. We are still a very 
constructive opposition.
<P>
	I want to talk about the early days, because I remember them 
very well. I remember coming into the House and at times even 
giving the minister opposite previous notice of what the question 
would be, in good faith, in an honourable way. We would ask a 
minister of the crown a question and the minister would get up in 
shock and dismay and ridicule the questioner. He would be very 
undignified about it.
<P>
	I suddenly realized it takes two to be honourable and to function 
in a very dignified manner in the House. We found it did not matter 
how we asked the questions, what our decorum was. The Liberal 
respondents, ministers of the crown, were lacking in respect and 
dignity when they answered our questions; very seldom did they 
answer our questions.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	Then he talked about the tacticians. He said question period is 
run by a bunch of tacticians. Opposition people sit in their little 
rooms planning their questions and then unfortunately the 
government has to respond with its tacticians. It just so happens 
that one of those tacticians was the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands when he was parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader. I knew he was because we would talk about it. He 
would tell me they were in their rooms cooking all this up.
<P>
	This is same hon. member who the hon. member from 
Broadview-Greenwood said is above all of this and here he had 
been involved. The picture that the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood painted was not an accurate picture 
whatsoever.
<P>
	I hope that the member for Kingston and the Islands is paying 
close attention to this debate. He has been very aggressive in 
debates in the House and we have had a good time debating many 
issues. Every once in a while he will take the opportunity to quote 
from the New Testament. He did it very recently.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member-because I am sure he is 
listening-about a story where a father had two sons and he asked 
the two sons to go out and work for him. One son said sure he 
would go do it. That son went out, forgot about obeying his father 
and did not do  the job he was told to do. The other son said he was 
not going to do it but then he thought carefully about his decision 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5843"> 5843 </A></B>
<P>
and he said, yes, he would obey his father and carry out the task he 
was given.
<P>
	I hope the member for Kingston and the Islands reads the report 
he authored some time ago that said opposition members should 
have two of the four chair positions. I hope he is the son who said 
he would go sit in the chair. I do not care about promises made in 
the past. I hope he will reconsider. I hope he will do the honourable 
thing tonight as he thinks about his commitment to democracy in 
this place and he will say that he will not accept that. It is not the 
right thing to do until the Liberals have kept their promise to make 
sure that two opposition members are appointed as deputy speakers 
sitting in the Chair. I trust he will do the right thing.
<P>
	If the hon. member does not he is open to criticism. I guess we 
cannot use the h word in the House but we can certainly talk about 
the <I>h</I> word outside the House. That is what the member for 
Kingston and the Islands will be if he accepts the position that has 
been offered to him by the government.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What is the <I>h</I> word?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the word is hypocrite.
<P>
	This demonstrates to Canadians that the Liberals say one thing 
during election campaigns in opposition and then they slap us in 
the face and do exactly the opposite. This is not only apparent with 
protocol and House affairs but in all sectors.
<P>
	I must speak about agriculture because I am the agriculture critic 
for the Reform caucus. I love agriculture and I am dismayed with 
the broken promises of this Liberal government with regard to 
agriculture.
<P>
	The Liberals have been patting themselves on the back over this 
past weekend saying they have been keeping promises. Reform 
looked at their promises with regard to their agriculture platform 
document prior to the last election and they made 28 promises.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They have kept them all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> The hon. member says they have kept them 
all. I will bet that the hon. member does not even know what one of 
those promises are.
<P>
	The Liberals made 28 promises with regard to agriculture but 
have kept only 7. That means they have failed with only a 25 per 
cent mark. No matter how you look at it, that is pretty dismal.
<P>
	I will mention a couple to put them on the record. Liberals 
promised that they would provide a greater commitment to 
research and development, both applied and basic. The opposite is 
true. They cut funding for research in agriculture by 16 per cent.
<P>
	The fresh start proposal that the Reform is taking to Canadians in 
the next election calls for an increase in spending for agriculture 
research. We would find the savings by streamlining the 
department in other areas.
<P>
	A Liberal red book promise says that they would use GATT 
negotiations to aggressively defend and clarify article XI to 
maintain supply management. The Liberals were barely in office 
when they scrapped article XI. Everybody knew that was a promise 
they could not keep but they made it anyway. That is disgraceful. 
They should not be allowed to get away with that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> The hon. member opposite is saying hear, 
hear. He thinks article XI is still there. He thinks a different 
government signed it away. It was his own government that signed 
article XI of GATT away after it promised Canadian farmers it 
would defend that article to the death. Not one of them died or even 
lost a night's sleep over the loss of article XI.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals broke their promise when it came to standing up for 
Canadians in their trade relations with the United States. I happen 
to be a durum grower and I know they put a cap on durum exports 
to the United States. They did not have to. We have a trade 
agreement that says that we do not have to put a quota or a cap on 
our exports of durum into the United States. It does not matter.
<P>
	The Americans put a little pressure on and said: ``You be good 
boys up there in Canada, you Liberals, you co-operate with us. We 
do not want any more of your durum for a while''. The agriculture 
minister said: ``Okay. We'll just close off the flow of our high 
quality durum that is bringing a good return to Canadian farmers. 
We'll oblige you. To heck with these trading arrangements we 
made. We'll punish our own farmers just to help you poor 
Americans out''. That was the response of the Liberal government.
<P>
	The Liberals made promises about agriculture stabilization that 
they did not keep. They promised a whole farm NISA for all of 
Canada. They failed to deliver. There were two provinces that were 
not interested and they forgot to ask the provinces whether they 
would go along with their proposals for agriculture stabilization.
<P>
	They promised a spring cash advance. They just reneged on that 
one the other day.
<P>
	They did keep seven promises. One of them was to establish an 
Agri-Food Development Council to improve Canada's competitive 
position in the agri-food industry. I expect they kept it because it is 
a council. They had some Liberals who needed a job and they want 
to create jobs. So they said: ``We'll create a council and we'll put 
some Liberals on this council. In that way we have kept our  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5844"> 5844 </A></B>
<P>
promise and have also dished out some patronage at the same 
time''. That is agriculture.
<P>
	The Liberal government made a whole lot of other promises. 
That is what this debate is about, keeping your word, keeping your 
promise. If you say you are going to appoint deputy speakers from 
both sides of the House, you had better do it, Mr. Speaker. 
Canadians are not going to take being lied to any longer.
<P>
	The red book is full of promises that have not been kept. The 
success rate is just about as dismal as it was with their agriculture 
promises. Let us go to promise number one: ``We will restore 
Canadians' faith in themselves and their government''. They failed 
dismally. In stark contrast Reform has offered in its fresh start 
proposals a guarantee that we will listen or we can be recalled.
<P>
	Promise No. 2: ``We will work with the provinces to redesign the 
current social assistance programs so sorely tested in recent years 
to help people on social assistance who are able to work to move 
from dependence to full participation in the economic and social 
life of this country''. Nothing has been a more dismal failure than 
this promise.
<P>
	They go on to say in promise No. 4: ``We will exercise 
unwavering discipline in controlling federal spending''. What a 
laugh. The recent contracts offered by the former and disgraced 
minister of defence are a testimony to the failure of promise 
number four. That is in stark contrast to the fresh start promise of 
things like balanced budget legislation that would prevent the 
foolish spending that we have seen from the Liberals.
<P>
	Promise No. 10: ``A Liberal government will replace the GST''. 
My colleagues have talked about that, so enough has been said.
<P>
	Promise No. 12: ``A Liberal government will work closely with 
provincial governments to achieve the maximum possible 
co-ordination of tax policies''. That one was a blow-out too. Only 
three provinces agreed to any kind of co-ordination of tax policies. 
For those three provinces to agree they took a $1 billion pay-off. 
That is a broken promise and again is in stark contrast to Reform's 
fresh start proposals that take seriously-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker. The member from 
Kindersley earlier said that the public is not going to take being lied 
to any more. I believe that is unparliamentary and should be 
withdrawn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, speaking to the point 
of order, the hon. member that has just raised this matter should 
understand when one is not imputing any kind of motives or not 
speaking of the motives of any one individual in this House that the 
word that was used as my hon. colleague has used it, is acceptable. 
There are no grounds at all for this point of order.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood)):</B> I 
have listened to both comments and the context. I understand the 
member for Lethbridge. I would ask the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster to continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, you should come and join the 
opposition benches. Maybe you could get appointed to the Chair.
<P>
	I was at promise No. 12 where there was a billion dollar pay-off 
to get three provinces to co-operate on a co-ordination of tax 
policies between the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	I could go on, there are a lot of promises here. There is promise 
No. 19 which deals with NAFTA. We do not need to talk about it 
because that has already happened.
<P>
	I want to talk about promise No. 26 which states: ``We will better 
prepare for the transition from school to the workplace, provide a 
constructive outlet for the skills and talents of younger Canadians, 
the innocent victims of Canada's prolonged recession, enhance the 
opportunity for job training and improve literacy and numeracy 
skills of Canadian workers and improve access to employment for 
women and single parents by making quality child care more 
available''. There are so many broken promises in that one promise 
alone that I do not know where to start.
<P>
	Let us talk about youth unemployment. Conservative estimates 
have the unemployment rate for young Canadians at 18 per cent. 
One of my colleagues mentioned that there are 1.4 million 
Canadians unemployed at the current time. The member for 
Broadview-Greenwood indicated that two million Canadians are 
currently unemployed.
<P>
	Then we could talk about all the day care spaces that were 
promised by the Liberal government. The Liberals had no hope of 
ever fulfilling that promise yet they made it to young single 
mothers and others who needed help with child care. What an 
irresponsible thing to do. How can Liberal MPs look their 
constituents in the face when they make promises they do not have 
a hope of keeping?
<P>
	That is in contrast to our fresh start proposal which recognizes 
child care whether it is in the form of day care or care in the home 
or care by other trusted caregivers. There is no discrimination 
based on the type of child care. That would create far more child 
care than the broken Liberal promises could ever have hoped to 
accomplish even if they had been able to keep their promises.
<P>
	There are pages of broken promises here. There is No. 41: ``A 
Liberal government, if it can obtain the agreement of the provinces, 
will be committed to expanding existing child care in Canada by 
50,000 new quality child care spaces each year that follows a year 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5845"> 5845 </A></B>
<P>
of 3 per cent economic growth up to a total of 150,000 new 
spaces''. A broken promise again.
<P>
	Here is a kept promise, No. 56. Every once in a while we come 
across a promise that the Liberals kept and it is quite notable when 
we do hit one: ``The Liberal government will enhance the role of 
the trade commissioner service by adding to its staff qualified 
technology and science attachés who can gather information for 
diffusion back in Canada and identify opportunities for Canadian 
exports abroad''. Here again the Liberals were able to add some 
positions and increase the spending of government. We are not sure 
how effective it has been but they were able to keep that promise.
<P>
	I must mention promise No. 71: ``A Liberal government will 
work with the provinces and the territories to provide Canada's 
natural resource industries with greater certainty by co-ordinating a 
specific system of land access, settling aboriginal land claims and 
resolving delays and uncertainties in current regulatory 
processes''.
<P>
	At the Liberal convention last weekend, aboriginal people were 
outside burning the red book because the Liberal government failed 
to keep its promises to aboriginal people. The aboriginals were 
pulling the red book apart page by page, using it to light a bonfire. 
That again is in stark contrast to Reform's fresh start proposals 
based on our aboriginal policy task force, which consulted with 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people alike to put forward some 
very solid proposals.
<P>
	There are a hundred and some promises here. I am trying to get 
to the last one. ``A Liberal government will also expand the rights 
of Parliament to debate major Canadian foreign policy initiatives 
such as the deployment of peacekeeping forces, the rights of 
Canadians to regular and serious consultation on foreign policy 
issues''.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	We all know that the take note debates happened after the 
decision was made. It was another slap in the face of Parliament 
just like we have been slapped around by not having the Liberals 
fulfil their promise of appointing two deputy speakers from the 
opposition benches. This has to change. The Liberals are not going 
to change it. The alternative is to start with a fresh start, a new 
opportunity for Canadians, one that is offered by Reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just a few words to say after listening to the hon. 
members opposite concerning promises.
<P>
	It is a funny thing that the Reform and the Tories in this House do 
not talk about the promises they have made. Perhaps it is because if 
they talked about the promises they made in the budget they 
presented and in their policy statements, nobody would vote for 
them.
<P>
	The hon. member a few moments ago was talking about 
infrastructure, about airports. They promised to pass all the airports 
in Canada to private enterprise. Imagine going into an airport 
anywhere in Canada and having a policy of the money bags, the 
multimillionaires in Canada owning all the airports. That is the 
policy of that opposition party.
<P>
	Not only that, but they make a very big point of it in their 
promises. It is all there in black and white. The hon. member 
obviously has not read it lately. If he wants to hear the exact words, 
I can read it for him.
<P>
	If someone picked up the policy papers of the Reform Party and 
the Tories, what would they see as far as infrastructure and 
highways are concerned? They would see that party is suggesting 
that the Trans-Labrador Highway be built by private individuals. 
Then in order to get their money back, toll gates would be placed 
on those highways. How else could they get their money back?
<P>
	Imagine people driving along a highway, the Alaska highway or 
the new highway going up to Labrador, and having to pay for the 
highway and the bridges and then a profit over and above that for 
all time due to multi-multi-multimillionaires and the big banks in 
this country. That is the promise being made by the Reform Party 
of Canada and the Tories.
<P>
	Even worse than that, let us get to the real promise they have 
made as far as ordinary Canadians are concerned. It involves 
medicare. Let us read the promise. They have been talking about 
promises of the government, this great administration. Now let us 
read from their budget.
<P>
	It should not take me very long to find it. It is on page 24: ``The 
public may in time agree that although access to a broad range of 
basic health care should be guaranteed to everyone, the original 
medicare model in which everyone received everything health care 
professionals wished to deliver is not only intolerably expensive, it 
is undesirable for other reasons''. Awful. Just imagine.
<P>
<B>(2005 )</B>
<P>
	What about that promise? It would mean one health care system 
for the rich in Canada and another health care system for the poor 
in Canada. They do not even hide it. They even put it in their policy 
book. The Tories have done the same thing.
<P>
	I know the Speaker would rule me out of order if I used a prop. I 
am not supposed to do that. Anyway, it is called the taxpayers 
budget. It is the Reform Party's plan to balance the federal budget.
<P>
	Let us understand this completely as far as the promises are 
concerned. Let us understand the Liberal promises versus the 
promises of the Tories and the Reform Party of Canada. It is no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5846"> 5846 </A></B>
<P>
wonder they are so low  in the polls. It is no wonder the government 
remains so high in the polls.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite keep referring to our great deficit 
problem. What country are they talking about? The recent analyses 
have not been done in Canada by the chambers of commerce or by 
any Canadian economists. Look at the great analyses on the 
economic performance of the Government of Canada in the past 
three years. What do they say?
<P>
	The OECD is made up of 28 nations. Its head office in Paris, 
France. Its job is to analyse the economies of the countries of the 
world. What does the OECD say about the great G-7? Which 
country is it that leads the G-7? Is it Japan?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Is it Italy?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Is it France?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Is it the United Kingdom?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Is it Germany?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Is it the United States?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> There is only one country left in the G-7 and that is 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Of course, we should not forget the head of that 
administration. I am allowed to say this because it is the 
administration. It is the Chrétien administration. I believe that is 
parliamentary, but I will not use it again, Mr. Speaker, if you object 
to that phrase. He is a great leader of the administration.
<P>
	Which country is it that the United Nations in two out of the past 
three years has said is the best nation in the world in which to live? 
It is not Japan. It is not the United Kingdom. It is not France. It is 
not Germany. It is not the United States. It is Canada.
<P>
	Members opposite would have the Canadian public believe that 
we have gone downhill from the days when we were not number 
one, when we were actually number six of the G-7. Those were the 
days of the Tory administration to which the Reform Party would 
love to return.
<P>
	In analysing all of these promises and all of the promises of the 
Government of Canada, we should never forget and the Canadian 
public should never forget that we are dealing in this House with a 
difference in philosophy. It is a great difference in philosophy.
<P>
	They would have the banks own our highways and our airports. 
They come out and say it in this document, which I will not show 
you, Mr. Speaker, because that is against the rules. On page 14 they 
say that given our current fiscal climate governments are ill 
equipped to spend money on infrastructure. And they say Canada 
should privatize airports and aviation. Privatize it, not pass it over 
to management boards. They say we should allow the private sector 
companies to build and maintain roads and bridges. Imagine. What 
a change of philosophy that is.
<P>
<B>(2010)</B>
<P>
	That carries through in practically every discussion we have had 
in this Chamber, including those on taxes. Which party was it in 
this Chamber that stood up and demanded greater tax cuts for 
American companies that were operating in Canada? It was the 
Reform Party of Canada. Somehow the Reform influenced the 
Tories and the Bloc because the Bloc did the same thing.
<P>
	Bloc members claimed their excuse was that they had many 
friends living in the United States. That is what they said. The Bloc 
members stood in this Chamber, the official opposition of this 
House of Commons which is supposed to represent the 
commoners, the ordinary people of Canada, stood in this House and 
agreed with the Reform Party.
<P>
	They demanded a 50 per cent cut on all taxes, on all the moneys 
that go back across the border into the United States, on all the 
interest made by foreign banks that goes back to the United States. 
They demanded that tax credits be given to people who have 
relatives in universities in the United States of America. Not only 
that, but they demanded that tax credits be given if per chance one 
happened to be subjected to the death tax in the United States, that 
we call the inheritance tax in Canada, and if a person owned over 
$600,000 of property in the United States.
<P>
	The Reform Party and the Bloc members stood in this Chamber 
and demanded more. Why? Because it is a matter of philosophy 
with the Reform Party. It is a matter of philosophy with the Tories. 
And it is a matter that the Bloc said they have friends who have lots 
of money in the United States.
<P>
	What we have here is this great difference in philosophy. On the 
one hand political figures are in favour of what? In favour of the 
very rich. That is why this party, the government leads the polls 
today because Canadians are asking: ``What other choice is there? 
Where do we go? Why would we vote for a party that would want 
the banks to own our highways, our airports, our bridges and which 
would want to throw our medicare system down the stream?'' Not 
only that, but they have the gall to put it in black and white in their 
policy statement for distribution to the people of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5847"> 5847 </A></B>
<P>
	We can understand why they are all frustrated. They are trying 
to change their policies. Their leader now has a new policy 
statement-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And a new haircut too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> He has not only flipped his hair, he has flipped his 
lid.
<P>
	We are judged to be the country that has dealt with its deficit 
better than any other industrialized nation in the world today. They 
are frustrated because of the progress this government has made.
<P>
	The Canadian people will never allow them to get into power, 
either the Reform or the Tories, to go ahead and ruin our medicare 
system as they promised and to pass our infrastructure over to the 
banks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a tough act to 
follow, at least in terms of theatrics.
<P>
	I came here as a new parliamentarian in 1993 to debate issues. I 
came here to talk about the different ways my party thinks things 
ought to be done, to talk about the way the finances of the country 
ought to be run, to talk about what we can do to maintain a good, 
healthy education program for our young people, and a health 
system that is satisfactory to Canadians, old and young alike. I 
came here to talk about true parliamentary democracy and true 
representation. What I have found is considerable frustration in 
that process.
<P>
<B>(2015)</B>
<P>
	I would like to begin by saying that it is a false assumption, as 
was made by the previous speaker, that unless the government does 
it, it is not done right. He has been talking about the privatization of 
airports. He says it is terrible and awful. I fly quite frequently in 
and out of airports which have been turned over to regional 
governing authorities in Edmonton. The improvements in that 
airport since that was done are immense. The cost to the taxpayers 
is little or nothing.
<P>
	Whereas, when the governments run these things we always find 
an infrastructure so large and so cumbersome that we get much less 
for our money. I also think of the Pearson airport. If we would not 
have had the interference of the Conservative government followed 
by this Liberal government, who knows what condition the Toronto 
airport would now be in. Instead it is now languishing. Nothing is 
happening there, while we are fighting and spending $600 in how 
to get out of doing anything at all and trying to cancel the contracts.
<P>
	The member opposite just asked what was wrong with it. It is 
adequate.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> When were you last in the airport?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> I was there about 48 hours ago. It needs to a lot of 
improvements made to it. That is generally accepted. It was 
established and it is time it proceeds.
<P>
	I would, however, like to say a little about the motion that is 
before us today which has to do with the election of the chairman of 
committee of the whole of this House. The standing orders state 
that this position is elected by the House. This of course brings me 
immediately to one of the first commitments that I made as a 
member of Parliament to the people who elected me. I made this 
commitment during the campaign and am doing my best to keep 
that commitment.
<P>
	However, it is interesting that the Liberal candidate in my riding 
made exactly the same commitment; at least the people thought 
there was no difference between us on that particular issue. The 
issue was on votes. When we actually come to the vote on this 
particular motion, and if I were a betting man I would put up to a 
nickel on this one, I would predict that every Liberal member will 
vote for the motion. This of course will elect the person nominated, 
the member for Kingston and the Islands, to the position, which is 
fine. I do not mind that.
<P>
	However, the problem I have with this is that each member who 
ran under the Liberal ticket with the red book in hand promised, as 
did the Liberal candidate in Elk Island, that if they were elected 
they would assure more free votes in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I really do not expect that the vote on this is going to have the 
appearance of being a free vote at all. I do not know whether it is 
going to be whipped, as they say-probably not, but it is going to 
certainly look that way. The incredible thing is that in so voting the 
Liberal members will actually be breaching another one of the 
commitments they made in that same campaign, which was in one 
of the ancillary documents to the red book, that opposition 
members would also have a role to play in the House of Commons 
and in parliamentary committees.
<P>
	I have to confess that my disappointment in the process and in 
the results of that process is very great. I am very disappointed in 
the fact that in this House we cannot have a free and open vote on 
an issue such as this. Some members, particularly those in my 
party, have said that they have nothing personally against the 
member for Kingston and the Islands gaining this position. That 
may be true for most of the members here. I would suspect, and this 
has come from both sides of the House, that most people here 
believe he has an adequate command of parliamentary procedure, 
that he would certainly be well qualified in that regard. He is a man 
of experience. I think that one of the qualifications of the person in 
the chair of this House at whatever stage of the debate we are in has 
to be a very high level of impartiality. I say as carefully as I can that 
we need to assure in this House that we have people who are 
guiding our deliberations who will be impartial, who will not 
display disdain or contempt for any member of this House regard-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5848"> 5848 </A></B>
<P>
less of which side of the House that  member is on. I believe that is 
a very important qualification.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about the particular member who has been nominated 
at this stage and who is the object of this motion. When I think of 
some of the antics that he has used during his parts of the debate, 
speaking about the Reform Party, he is going to have to have a real 
change of attitude.
<P>
	I would expect that to happen, but it will have to happen if he is 
elected. Very often he hauled out his infamous green book, full of 
short quotations taken out of context, distorting the message of 
Reform. He is going to have to, if he is elected to that position, put 
all that behind him and prove to us his impartiality.
<P>
	Beyond that I want to talk to the members on the government 
side who will drive this vote to its conclusion, and again I accept 
that process. I accept that in a democracy majority should rule. All 
295 members in this House will have the opportunity to stand in 
favour or in opposition of this motion. I challenge the members of 
the governing party to individually think, as the Deputy Prime 
Minister did, what the meaning of a promise is.
<P>
	You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that this had to do with the 
great goods and services tax which everybody in the country hated. 
The member running in the riding that I ran in said under the 
Liberal handbook: ``We will abolish the GST''. The Deputy Prime 
Minister, recognizing the depth of the commitment that she made 
on that, came to the point where she admitted she could no longer 
look people in the eye. She felt so bad about not keeping that 
promise, she actually resigned from this place and sought the 
reapproval of the people in her riding. It is significant to note that 
the support level for her because of that experience dropped by 
about one-third.
<P>
	It is very important for every member in this House to think 
about the commitment they made when they were running. They 
ran with the red book in hand. Included in that red book and in the 
attached documents, the appendices, was this article that said: ``We 
intend if we are elected to make Parliament work better, to give 
more responsibility and more freedom to our members of 
Parliament, to make committees work better''. Included in that was 
a commitment that the deputy chair be shared by members of the 
opposition.
<P>
	If those words during the campaign did not mean what they said, 
then they should not have been said. If they did mean what they 
said, then how should there now be this debate wondering as to 
whether we should elect a Liberal member to this position?
<P>
	This is now an opportunity to fulfil, to put into practice the 
words that were said during the campaign. I am challenging the 
Liberal members. I am challenging  them one on one to exercise 
here an act of conscience, to ask whether when this election is over, 
when this vote is over later on tonight, they will be able to stand 
beside their bank machine and look at the person beside them and 
say yes, to the best of their ability they kept the promises they 
made. That is a very critical point.
<P>
<B>(2025 )</B>
<P>
	Something else that is very closely related to this is the 
appointment of deputy chairs of committees. It is the same 
principle. I know there have been some heavy politics involved in 
this. I know the Liberals are languishing under the burden of 
ensuring they do not in any way offend the opposition. Of course 
the separatists who sit beside us got every deputy chair position in 
committees. It must be frustrating.
<P>
	I cannot accept intellectually or emotionally that every one of 
the Reformers who could have been eligible for one of those 
positions was inferior in ability, inferior in leadership qualities, 
inferior in the ability to conduct a meeting if called on. I cannot 
believe that Reformers were inferior to act in that role to every 
member of the Bloc. I just do not accept that.
<P>
	I know enough about statistics that by the law of averages, as we 
have about the same number of people, we would have expected 
about half and half. Half the time it would have been one of them, 
half the time it would have been one of us. Did that happen? No.
<P>
	Did MPs get more independence as promised in the red book? 
No, they did not. They were told, orchestrated from the Liberal 
hierarchy: ``When you get into those committees, you will elect a 
member of the Bloc''. For the life of me I cannot understand that 
quite aside from the fact that these are members whose primary 
goal is to take their wonderful province right out of our country.
<P>
	It totally escapes me why this arbitrary decision was made to 
take away the independence of members of Parliament who are 
serving in committees. It is a severe flaw in the system. I bring this 
up because it is the same principle. I am talking about the 
principles of parliamentary democracy, one of the issues I was 
elected on and which I believe in very strongly.
<P>
	I believe that the majority in a democracy should prevail. I 
believe that in this House of Commons that is the only way it can 
be, but I do not accept that every one of us in representing our 
constituencies has to be shackled and not permitted to represent our 
constituents because of some party hierarchy and party discipline. 
That is not acceptable in a democracy and that is one thing I am 
committed to change if my people in Elk Island will re-elect me 
next time and if we in the Reform Party can form the government 
of this wonderful country. It is one thing that we will change 
because it is one of the founding principles. It is one of the key 
things that attracted me to the Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5849"> 5849 </A></B>
<P>
	We need to have what was actually promised in the red book. 
We need to have a greater freedom of members of Parliament to 
represent their constituents. Some will say that has its dangers; 
now the government will not be able to fulfil its programs. I do 
not accept that either. That is not a fair assumption or a fair 
conclusion.
<P>
	Whether it is the Liberals or the Reformers or the Bloc or maybe 
some other party in the future that may come to sit in this place as a 
party, there may be a motion to introduce a bill or to amend a bill, a 
really good bill that would carry the support of the majority of 
Canadians under a free vote system. Members will be representing 
each of their constituents. If that carries the day, if that carries the 
judgment of the people across this country, then we will have good 
laws passed but we will also finally have a mechanism to defeat 
bills that are bad or at least to pass amendments to them if needed. 
That is a crying need in this country. It is a need in this Parliament. 
It is one of the deepest most frustrating flaws I have experienced.
<P>
<B>(2030)</B>
<P>
	Members in this House probably without exception have come 
here with high ideals. I know. I have spoken to members, not only 
those in my own party but also to others. Some in all of the 
different parties that I have spoken to have expressed similar 
frustrations.
<P>
	I remember talking to one person. I will not identify the party but 
it was a person from another party. I asked why he voted the way he 
did in committee. He looked at me and said: ``I really did not have 
a choice''. That is a sad commentary. The red book promised more 
freedom, more accountability. It promised more independence for 
individual MPs. I would like to see that exercised in the vote that is 
coming up later tonight.
<P>
	I would like to see every member of Parliament, particularly 
people like the member for Broadview-Greenwood who gave 
such an eloquent speech earlier, once again exercise their power of 
independent thinking, do what they believe is right. It is not going 
to cause a big failure in the system. It will enhance the system.
<P>
	I want to talk just a little bit in response to a previous speech here 
this evening. It was mentioned at some length. I have finished the 
comments I wanted to make here, so I am going to use my 
remaining few minutes to talk about question period.
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood talked at length about 
question period. I too am very frustrated with question period and 
the direction in which it has gone for a very simple reason. In 
debates in this House, whether on a bill or motion such as the one 
we are conducting now, or in question period, what we ought to be 
doing is dealing with issues that affect the public. We should be 
debating those issues.
<P>
	I do not appreciate the fact that a campaign has begun to 
discredit members of my party and myself with statements that are 
not true. The subject in question period today was a great distress to 
me. It was not particularly what happened in question period 
although that bothered me too, but more so it was what generated 
it.
<P>
	Can we, as parliamentarians, not say to our people: ``Here is 
what we believe, what we stand for''. Let the other parties say: 
``This is what we stand for, what we believe in''. Then the people 
would have their options. They could choose and cast their votes. If 
we cannot do it on that basis, then how will this country be 
governed correctly and efficiently?
<P>
	What is happening instead is that a campaign has already begun 
with statements which, if repeated often enough, come to be 
believed even though they are not accurate. That is a tremendous 
disservice. When we react in question period as we did today, it is 
as a direct response to the fact that we are not satisfied with that 
kind of campaign, that kind of tactic.
<P>
	One of my goals is to openly and honestly debate issues, to talk 
about what affects Canadians, to offer alternatives and options. 
Frankly, if the constituents of Elk Island believe that the model of 
democracy, the model of a health care system, the model of a tax 
system, the model of all these other aspects which affect us, are 
best represented by a Liberal rather than a Reformer, they have the 
right to choose. But let us give them the facts. Let us let them 
choose. Let us stop all the vindictiveness.
<P>
<B>(2035 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am really puzzled by the antics of the Reform Party members in 
this debate. I find it puzzling and absolutely amazing that they 
would object to the appointment of the member for Kingston and 
the Islands to the position of deputy chairman.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands is eminently qualified, 
immensely qualified to carry out the duties for which he has been 
nominated. I feel absolutely confident that the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands will do an outstanding job. For the 
Reform Party in a very straightforward way or obliquely to criticize 
this appointment is amazing to me. I must say again that I am 
puzzled.
<P>
	I will say one more thing about the appointment. The hon. 
member for Elk Island said that the member for Kingston and the 
Islands would have to, and these are my words but I think he was 
suggesting that the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
would have to suppress his partisan Liberal feelings. I can assure 
members that I know the member for Kingston and the Islands. I 
have been in the House with him for eight years  and if there is one 
man who can suppress his partisan feelings when sitting in that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5850"> 5850 </A></B>
<P>
Chair, it is the member for Kingston and the Islands. There is 
absolutely no question about it.
<P>
	Why are we puzzled by the antics and performance of the 
Reform Party members in this debate? The member for Elk Island 
said he was frustrated. I think he is frustrated, but it is not for the 
reasons he would like to have us believe. He is frustrated because 
he knows that his party is going absolutely nowhere in this country. 
The party across the way has been totally rejected by the Canadian 
people. That is why the member for Elk Island is frustrated. That is 
why all the Reform members are frustrated. It is because they know 
they are not going anywhere.
<P>
	They are not even halfway up the polls to where they were in the 
1993 election. That party elected over 50 members in the 1993 
election and they cannot even sustain themselves in the Canadian 
public opinion polls. What does that say about that party? It 
certainly says a lot about their frustrations.
<P>
	The Reform Party likes to go on about the red book. Reform 
members like to go on about the government and they love to talk 
about our promises. I will tell the House why they are frustrated. It 
is because they do not like the fact that we are doing as well as we 
are.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, the cabinet, the entire government came out 
with a record of achievement based on the commitments made in 
the red book. What does the record show? It shows that we have 
kept 78 per cent of our commitments. It is not 100 per cent, not 95 
per cent, it is not even 90 per cent. It is 78 per cent.
<P>
	By any standard put forward, it is a very good mark. Whether it 
is a public institution or a private institution, if it hits 78 per cent 
achievement, it is not doing a bad job. Remember, it is not only the 
keeping of 78 per cent of our commitments, but another 10 or 12 
per cent of those commitments are in progress. We have not 
finished the job yet. We still have a year or two to go in our 
mandate. We still have some time to make the mark even better 
than 78 per cent.
<P>
	That is why those members over there are frustrated. They do not 
like the job we are doing because we are doing it too well. They 
know that if we do our job as well as we have been that the 
Canadian people will support us strongly. Canadians want good 
government and that is exactly what they are getting under this 
Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(2040 )</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about promises specifically.
<P>
	In the red book we talked about deficit reduction. We talked 
about deficit reduction in a credible manner. We did not say: ``Elect 
us and we will eliminate the deficit in 12 months''. We knew the 
Canadian people would not buy that. We knew they realized it was 
a huge task. We  said to the Canadian people in the 1993 election 
campaign and in the red book that we would deal with the deficit in 
an incremental way. We would do it slowly and gradually, but we 
would do it with credibility.
<P>
	The first target that we set was to reach 3 per cent of GNP. We 
promised that we would clean up the fiscal mess and our first target 
was to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GNP. Did we do that? You 
betcha. Not only that, we have surpassed our goal. The finance 
minister has done the job so well that he has revised his target. It is 
no longer a 3 per cent target; it is a 2 per cent target and is well on 
the way to 1 per cent.
<P>
	Our finance minister has done the job so well that in a couple of 
years we will not have to borrow any more money. That is how well 
the job is being done. It will not be long after that before the deficit 
is zero. It will be gone. It will be eliminated. That is why those 
members are frustrated. They do not want that kind of success. 
They do not want the government to succeed. They would rather we 
fail. But we are not going to fail. We are keeping our promises.
<P>
	What does it mean when we clear up the fiscal mess? What does 
it mean when we bring down the deficit? It means lower interest 
rates. How low are our interest rates today? I wonder if the Reform 
Party is spreading the good news. I doubt it very much. I do not 
hear Reformers talking much about the deficit these days. They are 
mute on that issue. When it comes to the deficit, not only have we 
surpassed our targets, it has led to the lowest interest rates in 40 
years, in four decades. What does that mean for the average 
Canadian?
<P>
	Reformers talk about tax cuts. There are different ways to assist 
Canadian workers, borrowers and consumers. With the interest 
rates we have today, if a person holds a $100,000 mortgage, what 
does that mean in terms of cash in their pocket? It means an 
additional $3,000 in their pocket. That $3,000 is after taxes. If a 
person buys a car and they pay the modest sum of $15,000, what 
kind of saving is it? It is a saving of $500 a year.
<P>
	These savings as a result of low interest rates are not only 
realized by individuals and families; they are also realized by the 
provinces. I was looking at some statistics today. Ontario is the 
province with the largest population in the country. As a result of 
the low interest rates, the Government of Ontario is realizing a 
saving of over $300,000 a year. I do not think that is bad.
<P>
	That is why those members are frustrated. Because we are doing 
the job too well for them.
<P>
<B>(2045 )</B>
<P>
	However, we on this side are not satisfied. We think we can do 
even better. We have committed ourselves to doing better. We are 
not going to be smug. We are not going to be complacent. As the 
Prime Minister has said over and over again, there is still lots of 
work to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5851"> 5851 </A></B>
<P>
	What else? What about trade? The Reform Party I think has 
mentioned, in a rather oblique way, that we have done quite well 
on the trade front. Well, you betcha we have done very well. How 
well? The Team Canada effort; the Prime Minister led Team 
Canada three times overseas, a couple of times to Asia. He came 
back with contracts worth $20 billion. That is a lot of money, a 
lot of investment and lot of work for Canadians. How much is 
it for Canadians?
<P>
	I do not think a lot of Canadians realize, and why I want to 
mention it, that every billion dollars in trade-listen to this closely 
and especially the Reform Party members-translates into 11,000 
jobs for Canadians. Does anyone know how much our trade has 
gone up since we came to office in 1993? It is over 30 per cent. 
Thousands and thousands of Canadians have been employed 
because of our trade initiatives and the Team Canada effort.
<P>
	The Reform Party talks about the fact that we did not keep our 
promise on jobs. Oh no, we really slipped in that department. I and 
the government are not as happy as we would like to be. The 
unemployment rate has come down since the government came to 
office about 2 percentage points or a little more. I think it was about 
11.6 per cent when we came to power and now it is about 9.4 per 
cent.
<P>
	Let us look at the job numbers. Despite all the transitions in the 
economy, despite the transformation of the economy and despite all 
the difficulties in the economy as a result of globalization and so 
on, how many jobs have we created? We have created well over 
600,000 jobs at the very time when governments at all levels are 
downsizing.
<P>
	When we take a look at it from that point of view and take into 
account that the private sector has had to create jobs at a time when 
the public sector is getting its house in order, we still have well 
over 600,000 new jobs. I do not think that is bad. It is not the 
greatest and we are going to do better.
<P>
	I think it was the previous speaker from Newfoundland who 
referred to figures given out by the OECD. If everything goes 
according to Hoyle, if things pan out as well as they might or as 
they should, Canada is going to have the best record when it comes 
to GNP growth in 1997. That is the best record of all the G-7 
countries. I do not think that is bad. That is why Canadians support 
this government. Canadians realize that we have the right policies. 
Canadians realize that we are on the right track and that is why they 
support us. That is why the Reform Party is so frustrated.
<P>
	It talks about frustrations but it likes to give some other reasons. 
Reform members would like us to believe that their frustrations 
have to do with something else. It has nothing to do with something 
else. It has to do with our performance.
<P>
	Remember in the red book back in 1993 when we talked about 
how important our children and youth were in this country, 
especially when it comes to the economy? We talked about a youth 
internship program. What have we done? As of the last few weeks I 
have noticed a figure: 37,000 young Canadians are now involved in 
youth apprenticeship programs. I would like it to be 137,000 but it 
is a lot better than what it was. It is a lot better than what it was 
under the previous administration. I suspect, God forbid it, that it 
would be a lot better than if the Reform Party were ever in power. 
There are 37,000 young apprentices getting the necessary 
experience and exposure to the workplace. It is a start and it is 
going to get better, but I think 37,000 is not bad.
<P>
<B>(2050)</B>
<P>
	When we are talking about promises, the Reform Party never 
talks about these promises. In the campaign of 1993 the Prime 
Minister to be said: ``If I become Prime Minister, if I become the 
head of the government, the former prime minister's VIP airplane 
will be gone. There will be no more of that style of a king 
belonging to the Prime Minister''. He kept his promise.
<P>
	The Prime Minister to be said: ``No more of that bullet proof 
limousine''. What did he do? No more. No Cadillacs. None of that 
big long limousine stuff.
<P>
	He also talked about trimming the government at the very top. 
He was not talking about just trimming the bureaucracy, which we 
have done. If you are going to trim the bureaucracy then trim the 
ministerial offices. Has he done it? You had better believe he has, 
to the tune of saving about $10 million.
<P>
	While we are talking about promises, what did the Liberals say 
about the Canada Health Act? We said we would uphold the five 
basic principles of the Canada Health Act and we have done exactly 
that. We have not wavered not one bit.
<P>
	The premier of Alberta thought we will take them on. We will 
not stick to the principles of the Canada Health Act. We will allow 
some eye clinics to be established and we will levy so-called 
facility fees which is a disguise for a user fee. Do not worry, the 
Liberals back in Ottawa will not uphold the principles of the 
Canada Health Act. The government will cave in when the going 
gets tough. Did this government cave in?
<P>
	Who blinked when it came to a showdown over those facility 
fees at an eye clinic in Calgary? Was it the Prime Minister? Was it 
the federal Minister of Health or was it the premier of Alberta? I 
think every Canadian knows the answer to that question. It was the 
premier of Alberta. He realized we were going to stick to those 
principles and that if he did not cave in it was going to cost his 
taxpayers a lot of money. When the Prime Minister talked about 
upholding the principles of the Canada Health Act he did exactly 
that.
<P>

<P>
	I want to conclude by reiterating what I said at the beginning. 
The Liberals have kept most of our promises. Seventy-eight per 
cent is not bad compared to most standards if not all standards. 
We would like to do better and we are still working on our 
commitments and I think we can get that above 78 per cent before 
the next election. We are doing too well for the Reform Party 
members. They do not like us doing that well because they cannot 
find an issue. That is why the Reformers are frustrated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to be a part of this debate this evening.
<P>
	When I sought the nomination to run for the Reform Party in 
Cariboo-Chilcotin I was reminded by some people who had been 
a part of the political scene there that I would get used to 
Cariboo-Chilcotin's not being a high profile constituency.
<P>
<B>(2055)</B>
<P>
	Cariboo-Chilcotin has not been a terribly high profile part of 
the country. Most of them have gone to that part of the country 
because it is that way. It is a place where people can go. We are 
used to sending a lot of our money to the city. We are used to 
politicians coming and telling us how things should be.
<P>
	People have become very independent there. I can tell an 
interesting little story. There is a place there called Rudy's Bridge, 
put up by an entrepreneur. It crosses the Fraser River, just north of 
Williams Lake.
<P>
	There is a need for a bridge there but there has not always been a 
bridge there. The people of Cariboo-Chilcotin petitioned the 
government for a long time for a bridge there. What we were told it 
is impossible to do it. The ground is not right. The location is not 
right.
<P>
	One of our people, Rudy Johnson, went and looked it over. He 
needed a bridge there and therefore he scouted the country and 
found a bridge. He bought it, he hauled it there, built the 
approaches and he put the bridge across.
<P>
	He said: ``If you have a commercial vehicle, it will cost you $5 
to cross, but everybody else can use it for free''. Today, of course, it 
is possible to have a bridge there. Rudy was glad, finally, to turn 
that over to the government which maintains it. It is not improved it 
but it is maintained.
<P>
	I can tell another story about what is impossible. At the coast is a 
community called Bella Coola. For years the people in the Bella 
Coola valley were told they are so far away, so far below the high 
country of the Chilcotin that they cannot have a bridge there and 
will have to depend on boats and aircraft.
<P>
	Quite a few years ago two people said they thought they could 
put a road in there. One started at the bottom  of the hill with a 
bulldozer and another started at the top with a bulldozer. What the 
government could not do because it was impossible to build a road 
there this community did by itself.
<P>
	We are used to having to do things ourselves. We are used to the 
government telling us what is impossible and what we must do as 
well.
<P>
	We may be used to it but we do not very much like it. The biggest 
difficulty I had as a budding politician was dealing with the 
cynicism people hold in their hearts and their minds toward 
government. It is a cynicism out of years of excuses why things 
cannot be done, years of why it costs so much for the government 
to do what it does, years of government now more and more being 
in the face of people without really providing the services people 
need and years of government simply not performing as politicians 
have said it would when they come to seek people's votes.
<P>
	I got into politics because I perceive a great need for reform, for 
change of direction of politics in our political system, the way we 
do our business. We need to have a system of politics in which we 
talk about the issues, in which we do not hammer each other 
because of the colour we are, the way we talk. If we like their 
policies and we like the proposals that they have, we want to vote 
for them.
<P>
	In dealing with this cynicism, what I often had to do was look the 
person in the eye and say: ``Look, I have been as cynical as you 
have been. I know what governments have done to us but I see what 
they are doing to our children, to our young people. Unless we face 
them and look them in the eye and stare them down, we are not 
going to change the system''. Are you going to revel in your 
cynicism about the way politicians do their business or are you 
going to try to change the system? Will you help me to do that? 
Will you join me in trying to do that?'' That is what I am about in 
this Reform Party, trying to bring a political system into being that 
will serve people's needs.
<P>
	The cynicism is still there, alive and well. A couple of weeks ago 
I was at a meeting at 100 Mile House. The whole question period 
after the speech on government spending was to do with politicians 
and the way they do not keep their promises. Canadians are terribly 
frustrated and are sick and tired of politicians that make promises 
and then do not keep them. A great deal of their frustration is now 
directed toward the Liberal government. The Liberals have broken 
so many promises we can hardly count them. If there is one thing 
that is said to me with regularity as I leave the Cariboo-Chilcotin 
to come to Ottawa, it is: ``Phil, give them hell. They deserve it''.
<P>
<B>(2100)</B>
<P>
	The track record of broken Liberal promises is the topic of this 
entire debate today. As members of  Parliament we want Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5853"> 5853 </A></B>
<P>
to have faith in their leaders, to feel confident that politicians will 
do what they say they will do and will do it fairly and honestly.
<P>
	As legislators we have a role in establishing this positive 
reputation for ourselves. The Liberal government has an 
opportunity to begin to repair its tarnished record today by 
appointing an opposition member as deputy chair, which is no more 
than keeping a promise it made during the election campaign of 
1993. If that was done that action would begin to instil some small 
measure of confidence in its sagging reputation.
<P>
	The debate today is not about the member for Kingston and the 
Islands and his ability. I hope that the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood understands that. In fact, the member for 
Kingston and the Islands very likely would be a very good deputy 
chair. His abilities to do this are sound, so I am told. The member 
for Calgary Centre attested to this yesterday. We all agree he has 
the qualifications.
<P>
	However, that is not the issue. The issue is the integrity of the 
government and its willingness to not simply seek more and more 
power, but to do what it says and to have as its first priority serving 
the people of the nation, the welfare of the nation. The issue today 
is about politicians doing what they say they will do. It is about 
honesty and principle.
<P>
	As we all know, in 1993 the Liberals came out with their list of 
campaign promises, the Liberal red book, which might also be 
called Creative Opportunism, I suppose. Others refer to it as the 
Liberal dead book. In the book, listed in appendix B at the back 
entitled Platform Papers is a document; ``Reviving Parliamentary 
Democracy-The Liberal Plan for House of Commons and 
Electoral Reform''. On page 9 of the document can be found 
something very interesting which relates to the debate today.
<P>
	``In order to enhance the independence of the Chair and in an 
effort to reduce the level of partisanship, when the Speaker is from 
the government party, two of the junior Chair officers should be 
from the opposition so that the four presiding officer positions are 
shared equally by government and by opposition''.
<P>
	This document was co-authored by none other than the member 
for Kingston and the Islands. It is the member for Kingston and the 
Islands the Liberals want to appoint to the deputy chair position, 
not an opposition member as the document states would be the best 
idea.
<P>
	The Liberal decision to appoint the member for Kingston and the 
Islands violates the integrity of the government because the 
document I just quoted from is part of their red book, the list of 
promises. The Liberal decision also violates the integrity of the 
member for Kingston and the Islands. How can a person say one 
thing at one time and then turn around and do the opposite at 
another time and still keep his or her integrity? That is  exactly 
what the people of Canada object to. That is exactly what their 
cynicism is rooted in.
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	I say to the member for Kingston and the Islands that he has an 
important decision to make. He has the opportunity to do 
something that his colleagues are not used to doing. He could begin 
to clean up his party's tarnished image on integrity. Most 
importantly, he could preserve his own integrity. I know he is a 
person of integrity.
<P>
	I urge the member for Kingston and the Islands to do what he 
said he would do in 1993 and show real leadership. I urge him to 
help his party keep at least one of its promises which it made in the 
red book. I urge him to encourage his party to appoint a member 
from the opposition benches to the position of deputy chair.
<P>
	If he made this bold move he would take an important step for 
the people of Canada. He would show Canadians that the Liberals 
can be trusted to keep their word at least once.
<P>
	I know his colleagues want to discourage him from taking the 
high road. They do not think their record is tarnished. They boasted 
at the Liberal love-in last weekend that they kept 78 per cent of the 
red book's promises. We heard that repeated here a minute ago. The 
Prime Minister even boasted that any student would be happy with 
this score. I suppose any student would be happy to keep a score of 
his own test results, too, like the Liberals do.
<P>
	The reality is that the Liberal record is tarnished. Liberals made 
all kinds of promises during the last election campaign and, 
according to a very honest and accurate analysis, the Liberals only 
kept about 30 per cent of the pledges they made to the Canadian 
people. It is no wonder Canadians are cynical about their 
government.
<P>
	That is why the motion which we are debating today is so 
important. It is why we are not prepared to sit down and let the 
government roll over this matter. The Liberals and the member for 
Kingston and the Islands could take this opportunity to be different 
than their record of the past. They could show Canadians that they 
are a party of their word, that they can be trusted, that their 
promises mean something and are not imaginary. Such a step 
would go a long way in instilling public confidence and trust in our 
political institutions.
<P>
	Let me give the House a little more detail on the Liberal record 
of broken promises.
<P>
	The Liberals could add to this list today or they could start down 
a new road, a fresh path toward integrity and honesty by appointing 
a member from the opposition benches to the position of deputy 
chair.
<P>
	During the last election campaign the Prime Minister promised 
Canadians jobs, jobs, job. On October 15 the  Prime Minister said 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5854"> 5854 </A></B>
<P>
that Canadians did not have to read his lips, that they could read 
their record. Let us read that record today.
<P>
	First, 1.4 million Canadians are unemployed. Second, two 
million to three million Canadians are under employed. Third, four 
million workers are worried about losing their jobs. Fourth, this is 
the longest stretch of unemployment above 9 per cent since the 
great depression of the 1930s. That is the record. Where are the 
jobs, jobs, jobs? What we have, sir, is another Liberal broken 
promise.
<P>
	The Liberals would want us to believe that they are still working 
on fulfilling this promise, that they have a plan to create jobs. We 
have not seen it. The finance minister's message to Canadians is 
that low interest rates are the best medicine for the economy. 
Despite the lowest interest rates in many years, unemployment 
increased last month from 9.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent. That is half a 
percentage point.
<P>
	It is quite clear that the economy cannot be pushed uphill with 
interest rates. There has to be growth. There has to be job growth. 
To create jobs in the country the government must reduce taxes. 
Reduced taxes will mean more money in the pockets of consumers, 
small business people and investors. Consumers who spend more 
money will create permanent, well-paying jobs that the Liberals 
promised and that Canadians desperately need. What consumers 
need is a tax cut, not another interest rate cut.
<P>
	On top of going back on their word and giving Canadians high 
unemployment, the Liberals have dished out more pain for 
Canadians through social program cuts. The Liberal red book 
states: ``It is essential to provide financial certainty and 
predictability for our health care planning''. The Liberals have not 
done this at all.
<P>
<B>(2110)</B>
<P>
	What they have done is cut transfers to the provinces by 40 per 
cent. They have cut health care payments by $3 billion a year. They 
are dismantling social programs to pay the interest on the 
ballooning $600 billion federal debt.
<P>
	All Canadians have received from the Liberals is pain, pain, 
pain. In many communities if people knew the truth about Liberal 
slashing of health care transfers there would a sign in front of many 
closed hospitals saying: ``This hospital closed by the Liberal Party 
of Canada'' and I quote my leader on that.
<P>
	To repair this gaping hole in the social safety net a Reform 
government will commit $4 billion a year to increasing federal 
transfers to the provinces for health and education. These funds 
will come from the savings generated by our refocusing and 
downsizing of the federal government and not from increased 
taxes.
<P>
	I urge the Liberals to keep their commitment to sustain health 
care. I urge them today to begin to rebuild their tarnished 
reputation. They can begin by keeping their promise to appoint an 
opposition member as deputy chair.
<P>
	There are so many Liberal broken promises that I could mention. 
I could take all night listing them. What about the GST? The 
Liberals promised Canadians they would scrap, kill and abolish the 
GST but the tax is still here, blamed on acts of God and loose lips 
and a $1 billion bribe paid to the Atlantic provinces to shore up the 
government's image after harmonizing the GST and the PST, 
hiding the taxes in the sticker price. Where is the integrity? Where 
is the promise kept?
<P>
	No wonder Canadians feel cynical toward the government. The 
Liberals promised stable multi-year financing of the CBC, but 
when they became the government the Liberals slashed more than 
$400 million from the national broadcaster. The Liberals promised 
to renegotiate the American free trade agreement to obtain codes 
on subsidies and dumping and a more effective dispute resolution 
mechanism. But when they came to power the Liberal signed 
NAFTA without renegotiation. The list goes on and on and on.
<P>
	Just to give you an idea, Mr. Speaker, of how blatant the Liberals 
have been breaking their word, let me read a bit more of their 
patronage record: 18 partisan appointments to the Senate; Richard 
Campbell, former campaign manager for Lawrence MacAulay 
appointed director of Marine Atlantic; Richard Cashin, long 
standing member of the Liberal Party and MP from 1962-65 
appointed member of the Canadian Transport Harvesting Adjusting 
Board; Dorothy Davey, wife of former Liberal Keith Davey 
appointed to the Immigration and Refugee Board; Fred Drummie, 
executive assistant to minister Doug Young, appointed to the 
International Park Commission Board; Raymond Guay, Liberal 
member from 1963-68 appointed to the Canadian International 
Trade Tribunal.
<P>
	The list goes on and on and on.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Szabo):</B> I would remind hon. 
members not to refer to members of Parliament by their names 
during debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I could not help but speak after listening to the Reform 
Party attacking a colleague whom I have known for the past eight 
years since I came to this House, a colleague for whom I have a lot 
of respect, a colleague who probably knows the ins and outs of this 
House like the back of his hand.
<P>
	None of the people in the opposition have had time to talk to the 
individual or to come to know him as some of us on this side of the 
House have.
<P>
	Personal attacks by the Reform Party are constantly being made 
against the member for Kingston and the  Islands. I heard with 
great interest the speaker before me saying that one of their 
members attested to the knowledge of the member for Kingston 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5855"> 5855 </A></B>
<P>
and the Islands. This is not something they want for the opposition 
party. They did not say a member from the Bloc. They want their 
member.
<P>
	Reform members who were elected in 1993 and came here said 
they were going to make changes. There are no changes. They are 
politicians just like the rest of us. They just speak differently. We 
see the whip get up and say ``or anybody who wants to vote 
differently''. Nobody stands up and wants to vote differently. They 
all sing the same tune. They were going to do things different; 
anybody else who wishes otherwise. If they wish to do otherwise 
here comes the leader and they are out of here. They will be kicked 
right out.
<P>
<B>(2115)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They whip them and cane them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Karygiannis:</B> They cane them, as my colleague says.
<P>
	The Liberals presented their platform which was called the red 
book. We had enough guts after three years to come and say this is 
our accounting and what we have done, 78 per cent. By any 
accounting, we presented 78 per cent. I do not see what the Reform 
Party promised. I do not see the Reform Party accounting for what 
it promised and what it is doing.
<P>
	I challenge the Reform Party to bring its accounting. Not only 
can it not do its accounting, it forgot about the leader pointing 
graphs up and down. There is no accounting here.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They crossed the road.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Karygiannis:</B> They crossed the road, as my colleague says.
<P>
	I want to speak about my constituents who were unemployed 
three years ago and who now have jobs. I want to speak about the 
bank rates going down and stimulating growth and potential. I want 
to speak about the industries in my riding that do not have to go to 
the banks and borrow at 12 per cent to 15 per cent as they did in the 
previous administration. Now they can borrow at 5 per cent.
<P>
	I hear my colleagues across the way. They do not like the words 
5 per cent interest at the bank. Ladies and gentlemen, if you do not 
like it, tough. My constituents like the 5 per cent. My constitutes 
enjoy not having to carry 10 per cent and 15 per cent on rates that 
they have to borrow. That stimulates the economy.
<P>
	I as an individual have a mortgage. I wanted to renegotiate my 
mortgage. It dropped down.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Now we know why these rates came down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Karygiannis:</B> You have mortgages.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They do not have any mortgages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Karygiannis:</B> No, they do not have any mortgages.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I hate to bother the hon. member, but you must 
address your remarks to me in the Chair rather than to your 
colleagues across the floor. I hope you get back in full flight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Karygiannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess sometimes the blood 
flows very heavily and when you do not hear the truth and you hear 
things in remarks that sort of make the blood boil in your head you 
sort of forget the procedure. This is why colleagues like the 
member for Kingston and the Islands are people we need.
<P>
	In Toronto we were just named number one of all the cities. That 
is something that the Reform Party does not like because it does not 
have any members elected in the vicinity of Toronto. It has one, 
just north. In the next election I promise we will work hard to make 
sure it does not have any.
<P>
	We have kept 78 per cent of the promises. More than any other 
previous administrations or any other party we have had the guts to 
stand up and say: ``These were our promises, these are what we 
kept and this is what we are''. By all accounting we have the guts to 
account and put the numbers down.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues across the way do not like those numbers 
because they know what they are showing in the polls is the same 
as the interest rate, 5 per cent and it is going down.
<P>
	In closing, I hope the interest rate goes down and along with the 
interest rate going down so does the performance of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a well 
established fact that most governments are not defeated but in fact 
defeat themselves. Let us just think back to the Trudeau 
government. The Canadian people finally got tired of this arrogant, 
spend thrift government after 15 years and booted it out in 1984. 
When the people threw it out they turned to the Progressive 
Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. They said they 
would give that government a chance: ``We are tired of the amount 
of overspending this government does, the fact that it does not 
consider the best interests of the Canadian people, and we are going 
to give the Progressive Conservative Party an opportunity''.
<P>
<B>(2120)</B>
<P>
	The people gave the Conservatives a huge majority in 1984. 
They told the Mulroney government to clean up the mess. Mr. 
Mulroney and his government were only in power a short while 
before it became obvious that they were not going to do things 
much differently from the Liberal government before them. If 
anything, they were worse, if that is possible.
<P>
	The result of nine years of the Mulroney government was that in 
1993 the Canadian people were so absolutely fed up with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5856"> 5856 </A></B>
<P>
Conservatives that they decided to get rid of it. And this 
government across the way, the Liberal Party, did not win that 
election; rather, the Conservative Party lost it. These people are 
sitting in government now almost by default. In getting to 
government, the Liberals offered Canadians a booklet of promises 
they refer to as the red book.
<P>
	I knew a fellow in my riding who passed away some time ago. I 
knew him for a long time. I was in the construction business before 
I became a member of Parliament. I remember this fellow by the 
way he did business. He used to say: ``I really like to do business 
with people I can shake hands with, look in the eye and feel that the 
commitments we make to one another are going to be respected and 
honoured without going to a lawyer and getting a seven page legal 
document drawn up so I can go back to court and enforce it. I like 
to do things on a handshake. I like to do things on the strength of 
people's words. Their word is their bond''.
<P>
	I always had a great deal of respect for that gentleman because I 
knew that I could go to him on a construction project, on a business 
deal, we could sit down and negotiate a deal. We could shake hands 
on it, without ever going to a lawyer, without ever having to rely on 
the systems in place to enforce agreements. I could sleep at night 
knowing that he would respect the agreement we had between us.
<P>
	I wonder how my friend would view the Liberal Party on the 
strength of the book of promises it gave the Canadian people and 
on its performance.
<P>
	Let us examine some of the promises that have been made. My 
colleagues in their earlier interventions highlighted a number of 
them, but I will talk about some of the promises in depth. This 
government campaigned-it started before the campaign-that it 
would scrap and abolish the GST. It did not say that it would try to 
deal with it, that it would try to find a replacement tax, that it would 
try to find a way to soften the blow for Canadians. The Liberals 
were unequivocal in their statements and in their promises: ``We 
are going to scrap and abolish the GST. We are going to get rid of 
it''.
<P>
	That was a very ill advised promise to make, and I think many of 
them knew that at the time. Evidence that has come to light in the 
last few months reveals that there were advisers within the Liberal 
Party who said they should not make that promise, it was a dumb 
promise to make. I agree that it was a dumb promise to make but 
they went ahead and made it anyway and now they have to live with 
it.
<P>
	What did the Liberals do? They came back three years later and 
said: ``Sorry. First, we did not really mean we were going to scrap 
and abolish it. We just meant we were going to replace it. Maybe 
we did say that we were going to scrap and abolish it but we are 
sorry about that.  We can't meet that promise. Canadians 
understand''. Frankly, I do not think Canadians understand.
<P>
<B>(2125)</B>
<P>
	They understand that getting rid of the GST, put in place by 
Brian Mulroney and his government, is a very difficult thing to do. 
What they do not understand is why a political party made this a 
major plank in its election platform, in its bid to win Canadians' 
votes in the 1993 election then turned around and said ``shucks 
folks, we made a mistake''.
<P>
	The Liberal government in its red book campaigned on a 
promise to reform MP pensions. Canadians from one end of this 
country to the other were livid when they came to understand the 
terms of the MP pension plan. Canadians were absolutely beside 
themselves. How is it that the richest pension plan in the private 
sector pays benefits on a scale of 2:1 and yet parliamentarians, 
politicians, can go to Ottawa for six years and collect a benefit 
package on a ratio of 7:1?
<P>
	This government made a solemn promise to the Canadian people 
in its red book to reform the pension plan. It left no doubt in the 
voters' minds that the government did not mean it was going to 
tinker with it a little bit, that it was going to reduce it a little bit. It 
was made very plain that what it intended to do, what it was 
promising to do, was to get the MP pension in line with private 
sector pensions. Three years later we see that the government 
tinkered around a little and left it at that.
<P>
	My colleagues, 51 Reform MPs, looked at the pension plan and 
said when they had an opportunity they were going to opt out. As a 
result, Mr. Speaker, all the MPs you see here tonight are not going 
to get an MP pension regardless of how long they serve in this 
Parliament.
<P>
	With regard to the member for Beaver River, she had already 
qualified and was fully vested in the pension plan. If she had 
resigned and left office she would be collecting her pension the 
next day. Mr. Speaker, you and I both know that. Her pension was 
worth approximately $1.4 million.
<P>
	It would have been easy to say: ``We disagree with the MP 
pension plan but under the circumstances until we can form a 
government and actually change it ourselves we are all stuck going 
along with it. I do not agree with this but until we have an 
opportunity to change the system there is really not much we can 
do about it''. No, she took the high road.
<P>
	I ask every Canadian watching tonight to think about the 
integrity, the ethics, for somebody to turn around and walk away 
from $1.4 million simply because they know it is not right. This 
government could learn a lot from this lady from Beaver River. 
Obviously it has not.
<P>
	This government campaigned and attacked the Reform Party: 
``The Reform Party is going to kill medicare. The Reform Party is 
out to gut medicare. Do not vote for  Reform, they are bad people, 
they have no scruples when it comes to budget cutting, no scruples 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5857"> 5857 </A></B>
<P>
when it comes to spending cuts. Reform is going to cut you out of 
medicare''. Three years later the reality is the Liberal Party has 
done far more cutting in the area of medicare and education than 
the Reform Party ever proposed in its campaign in 1993.
<P>
	When it comes to ethics the Liberal Party in the red book said: 
``We are going to restore Canadians faith in their government and 
their politicians. We are going to make Canadians feel good about 
politicians, about Ottawa and the federal government. We are going 
to restore integrity''. Let us look at the record there.
<P>
	Without tender, Liberal cabinet ministers hired consultants at 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Is that ethical? It might be 
technically legal, but is it ethical?
<P>
<B>(2130)</B>
<P>
	Liberal junior cabinet ministers are flying around the world with 
a government credit card, on holidays purchasing clothes. Is that 
ethical? Then they say: ``Oh, I am sorry. I am going to pay it back. 
It is okay because I meant to pay it back''. It may be technically 
legal, although I question whether it is even technically legal. But it 
is a big stretch for anybody in this country to believe that it is 
ethical by anybody's standards. Yet this is the record of the 
government.
<P>
	Let us examine the $87 million no interest loan to Bombardier. I 
cannot suggest that the fact that Bombardier made a $170,000 
donation to the Liberal Party over the last three years was the 
reason it got the $87 million loan. What I will suggest is that there 
is a longstanding cosy relationship between Bombardier, 
SNC-Lavalin and the Liberal Party. It goes back many, many years. 
We know that. We also know that the Liberal Party defends this no 
interest loan by saying it is doing it in the interests of providing 
research and development.
<P>
	In the same week that the government went to Montreal and 
announced the $87 million loan to Bombardier, it announced a $7 
million slash in the coast guard budget in British Columbia and $30 
million across the country. It announced that it did not have enough 
money to fund fish hatcheries in British Columbia. It announced 
that it would have to destaff light stations in British Columbia. Let 
us examine the cost of those three items alone.
<P>
	Light stations in British Columbia cost $5 million a year. 
Destaffing them does not mean there is no cost. It means that the 
cost will be reduced by about $3 million. So it is saving about $3 
million by destaffing light stations, maybe.
<P>
	The cuts to the coast guard are about $7 million a year. I assure 
the House that the coast guard presence in British Columbia was 
razor thin prior to the cuts being made. The search and rescue 
capability of the coast guard on the north coast is virtually 
non-existent. I do not know how many fishermen I talked to who 
fish out of Masset, Prince Rupert and Port Simpson, who tell me 
that they are sure happy that the American coast guard is not far 
away because that is who they rely on to pick them out of the water 
if their boats ever go down. It is not the Canadian coast guard. 
There is no presence capable of doing that for Canadians. And what 
is the government doing? It is cutting more.
<P>
	The government has destaffed light stations and has cut money 
from the budget of the Canadian coast guard, $7 million, in the 
same week it announced the $87 million loan to Bombardier.
<P>
	The Liberals said they had to cut back on the funding of fish 
hatcheries in British Columbia. In the fall last year they announced 
they were going to cut $4 million out of the budget. Thankfully, 
there was a huge amount of pressure from elected representatives 
and from the people of British Columbia in the face of the fisheries 
minister saying they had to downsize the fleet in British Columbia 
because there were too many boats chasing too few fish, the Mifflin 
plan. Then in the same breath he said that by the way, at the same 
time they were going to cut back the funding to hatcheries.
<P>
	In the case of the community of Kitimat where I live, there is a 
world class fish hatchery which is extremely productive. It costs 
the Canadian taxpayers about $850,000 a year to own and run that 
hatchery. But no, the government had to cut that. Maybe not 
specifically that hatchery. We do not know which hatcheries 
because they were never announced. The Liberals did not go ahead 
with the cutback in 1996 but we are now told it is back on the books 
for 1997.
<P>
<B>(2135 )</B>
<P>
	The people of British Columbia are losing valuable and in some 
cases essential services as a result of government cutbacks. Let us 
not forget that British Columbia is a net contributor to this 
federation and it has been for a long time. It puts more money in 
than it takes out every year. Then the government turns around and 
punishes the people of British Columbia and at the same time gives 
an $87 million interest free loan to Bombardier. Bombardier is a 
company that has accepted $1.2 billion in corporate welfare over 
the last 15 years.
<P>
	That kind of announcement does not play too badly in Ottawa or 
in Montreal, but if we talk to the men and women on the street in 
British Columbia we will find that their blood is boiling. The 
people of British Columbia have suffered government cutbacks. 
They have seen the government make a loan to a company which 
has made hundreds of millions of dollars in profit in the last several 
years. It is one of the wealthiest corporations in Canada. It has 
billions of dollars in fixed assets. The people of British Columbia 
have lost their faith in the government's commitment to restore 
ethics and integrity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5858"> 5858 </A></B>
<P>
	The government also promised in the red book to appoint deputy 
speakers from the opposition benches. It is another promise that 
is going by the wayside.
<P>
	The premier of British Columbia set up a forest renewal fund 
two years ago. He promised the people of British Columbia that he 
would under no circumstances touch the fund. It was going to be 
there for silviculture, for the restoration of B.C. forests and for no 
other purpose. They are now dipping into that fund because there is 
a big budget shortfall.
<P>
	I was interviewed recently by an announcer in northern B.C. who 
said: ``I suppose this is probably good news for you''. He was 
thinking cynically that anything which tarnishes the NDP will help 
me in my bid to be re-elected. I said: ``On the surface it appears that 
way. Yes, it may as a result tarnish the NDP and make my 
re-election a little easier, but in the long run it hurts me''. It hurts 
anybody who runs for public office in Canada because it is yet 
again a politician who is not keeping his promise, who is not ethical 
and who is not prepared to act with integrity. That is what we have 
with this government.
<P>
	I started out by saying that governments usually are not defeated, 
that they defeat themselves. This government and this Prime 
Minister are so afraid right now that they have to put out memos to 
their supporters across the country trying to counsel their friends 
on how to slander and libel the Reform Party of Canada. That is 
how concerned they are about the position they are in. I know that 
their polling numbers do not look very bad right now, but I believe 
their support is a mile wide and an inch deep. If it is an inch deep, 
we are bailing out right now and it will not be an inch deep by the 
time the next election rolls around.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
we are debating a motion which deals with the Deputy Chairman 
position. From all of the debate which took place yesterday and 
today it is clear-
<P>
<B>(2140 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It was probably someone from the gallery. I heard 
some words coming from some place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the debate that has been taking place 
has been very helpful and useful to all members of Parliament in 
expressing some views on what has happened within the House 
over the past three years. The debate has actually changed to a 
debate on what is the record of achievement of the government and 
what is the reaction of the opposition parties to that.
<P>
	The national political party, the Liberal Party, presented its 
detailed election platform in a red book. I recall during the election 
campaign that the Prime Minister was grilled on that book, on each 
and every point, particularly on page 111, the page where the 
financial specifics were included regarding the cost of the  various 
programs and the commitments that the government was going to 
make.
<P>
	I will never forget that the Prime Minister said to all openly and 
publicly that during the mandate we would be able to go through 
the red book page by page by page, point by point, dollar by dollar 
to see where we were in terms of the commitments that we made 
and the record of achievement that we have made.
<P>
	At this point, the government has indeed put forward a report on 
its level of achievement on its campaign commitments. If members 
would look carefully, they would find within that book several 
sections that indicate areas where the government has gone beyond 
those platform undertakings, and other areas that were not 
specifically committed to but on which the government has made 
significant progress in the first three years of its mandate.
<P>
	The primary areas of the platform had to do with the creation or 
stimulation of an environment to promote job creation and 
economic growth. Our approach to restoring the health of that has 
been measured, deliberate and responsible. The approach has been 
balanced: carefully reducing spending, restructuring government 
and strengthening the economy. Using rolling two-year targets is 
the right way to reach our ultimate goal of eliminating the deficit. It 
keeps the government's feet to the fire.
<P>
	The deficit for 1995-96 was $28.6 billion, $4.1 billion below our 
target. This is the second year in a row that we have beaten our 
targets. We are on a clear path to fiscal health. We are also on a 
track to meet or better our deficit target of $24.3 billion in 1996-97 
and to meet our deficit target of $17 billion in 1997-98. Our deficit 
target for the following year, 1998-99, is $9 billion or 1 per cent of 
GDP.
<P>
	This is down from $42 billion or 6 per cent of GDP when we 
took office. We have reduced the deficit by $33 billion or nearly 80 
per cent in those five years. It will mean that in 1998-99 the federal 
government will no longer have to go to the financial markets for 
new borrowing requirements. That is the way most G-7 countries, 
including the U.S. and the U.K., measure their deficits.
<P>
	We have used spending cuts, not tax increases to reduce the 
deficit. Spending cuts in the last three budgets account for almost 
90 per cent of actions taken to bring down the deficit. By 1998-99, 
program spending will be 14 per cent lower than the peak level of 
the 1992-93 year. Program spending will then represent only 12 per 
cent of GDP, its lowest level since 1949-50. Between 1993-94 and 
1996-97, the percentage decrease in federal program spending will 
be three times larger than the percentage decrease in overall 
provincial program spending.
<P>
	Reducing the deficit is essential for job creation and growth. Our 
strategy is beginning to pay off. The  government's number one 
priority has been and continues to be job creation. Getting interest 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5859"> 5859 </A></B>
<P>
rates down is the most effective way for the government to help 
create jobs. There is no more effective way to get interest rates 
down than to get government finances under control. The strategy 
is already beginning to pay off. Short term rates are down by more 
than 4.5 percentage points since early 1995. They were 2.5 
percentage points above the U.S. rate in early 1995 and they are a 
full 1.5 percentage below.
<P>
<B>(2145)</B>
<P>
	Canadians interest rates are below the U.S. rates for maturities 
up to five years. Except for five weeks in early 1994 the bank rate 
has not been at its current level of some 4 per cent or a little lower 
now, down to 3, since October 1964.
<P>
	Lower interest rates produce real savings for Canadians. That is 
an important point. Earlier this day one of the members said: ``We 
don't need lower interest rates. We just need tax cuts''. Lower 
interest rates to Canadians are effectively a tax cut because they put 
real dollars after tax in the pockets of all Canadians. In fact, 
consumers are saving almost $500 annually on a $15,000 new car 
loan over a four year term. To someone renewing a $100,000 
mortgage this means saving over $3,000 annually.
<P>
	A new report by the Royal Bank says that owning a home is the 
most affordable it has been in 10 years. Payments on a five year 
$100,000 mortgage now costs $765 a month.
<P>
	In 1990 the same mortgage would have cost more than $12,000 
and according to the report that is equivalent to getting an $8,000 
raise. Clearly the economy is improving.
<P>
	Two hundred and twenty thousand jobs have been created in the 
private sector since last November, housing starts and resales are 
up sharply, business investment intentions are improved, GDP was 
up by .5 per cent in July, and for the first time in 12 years Canada 
has had a surplus in its current account.
<P>
	The private sector forecasters are expecting the economy to 
strengthen during the rest of 1996-97 and the International 
Monetary Fund in its latest world economic outlook predicts that 
the Canadian economy will grow faster than any other economy of 
the G-7 countries.
<P>
	I know there are many other members who would like to get up 
and share some of the great successes that this government has 
achieved in the first three years of its mandate. I would urge all 
members to stand up and let Canadians know, let their constituents 
know, let the Reform Party know, let the Bloc know, let the NDP 
and the Tories know that the Liberal government is doing a very 
good job for the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I rise this evening to speak to this bill, I listened to the 
rhetoric of the member across the way. I hear in that rhetoric a 
hollowness that does not reflect the loss of hope of many Canadians 
who are looking at no job. They are looking at the potential of no 
position that matches the training for which they have invested 
their time. They are looking at the possibility of losing the job they 
presently have.
<P>
	For all the numbers and all the rhetoric Canadians do not feel 
secure today. That is compliments of the activity of this Liberal 
government.
<P>
	Tonight as I rise I address the issue that is at the very heart of this 
discussion. That issue is at the heart of the disillusionment of 
Canadians. It is at the heart of the national distress, the national 
feeling of insecurity for the future. That is not helped by the 
rhetoric that we hear tonight.
<P>
	It is the history of politics of Canada, the history of promises, 
promises, promises that lead to taxes, taxes, taxes. We have seen 
that in the last three years. It is a history of governments bent on 
serving their own interests.
<P>
<B>(2150)</B>
<P>
	The members across the way try to say that taxes have not gone 
up. Twenty-six billion dollars more is coming into the federal 
coffers every year from the Canadian taxpayers than there were 
three years ago.
<P>
	Governments are bent on serving their own interests, not the 
interests of the Canadian public. Canadians now look to an insecure 
future. They look to the future of their children as being unknown, 
without jobs and possibly without the means for an education or a 
means to use that education.
<P>
	Tonight we are specifically talking about the appointment of the 
member for Kingston and the Islands. This member I believe is an 
honourable and concerned individual, as many members are, and 
he certainly qualifies for the position to which he is going to be 
appointed.
<P>
	It is interesting that this member was the driving force behind a 
report referenced in the red book during the last election. In that 
reference this member co-authored a report entitled ``Reviving 
Parliamentary Democracy'', something that perhaps many of us 
came to this House for. However, this was the Liberal plan for the 
House of Commons and electoral reform. That very member, when 
he co-authored this report, made a recommendation that two of the 
junior Chair positions in this House be occupied by members from 
the opposition members. That is two of the four positions. That was 
in the red book and part of the Liberal promises during the last 
election.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5860"> 5860 </A></B>
<P>
	In the last while the Liberals in this term have a record of 
patronage appointments in different areas. Recently they have had 
a resignation of a senior minister, a minister of the crown. I remind 
the public and this House that it was certainly under questionable 
circumstances. Now they have had to shuffle ministers and mix 
people from bench to bench without notice to this House. Our 
party made mention of that.
<P>
	This same individual, who was appointed without notice to 
answer the needs of shuffling patronage appointments and the 
resignation of a minister for a real cause that perhaps was not 
identified in his resignation, is the same person who, in his own 
words, said that he should not be the one to fill the position but 
someone from the opposition. He will be four of four Liberal 
members occupying the Chair of this House and he will be 
occupying it as Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole.
<P>
	Where is the integrity of those who would ask him or where is 
the integrity to accept that appoint? I challenge that member to own 
up to his own words and to deny that appointment. This, may I 
mention, is one day after a convention when these same Liberals, 
who are nattering at me at this moment, said that they have kept 
their promises or will keep them. We have a promise they made in 
their book and one day later they are blatantly against what is in 
that book. Where is the honesty and commitment to serve the 
people?
<P>
	We wonder why there is cynicism and disillusionment that grows 
in the public minds. Each person in this House pays the price for 
promises broken. I take exception to that because for many of us 
that is the reason why we came to this place. It was because of that 
very cynicism that we felt three years ago. Perhaps the choice three 
years ago of the majority of this House was not as wise as it could 
have been.
<P>
	This same party gave itself a rating of 78 per cent in keeping its 
promises at a recent convention. I wonder if any mention was made 
of this issue as part of that percentage and I wonder how many 
students in a classroom would grade their own papers and come up 
with such a poor mark.
<P>
<B>(2155)</B>
<P>
	If we listen to radio shows or if we take our own poll of those 
same promises we get results of 30 per cent, 20 per cent, 10 per 
cent. Seventy-eight per cent is a construction of the very party 
whose behaviour we are considering.
<P>
	We hear that the Liberals have reached their target of 3 per cent 
of GDP. They have a target the size of a barn door. In the last three 
years the debt of this country has gone up by $111 billion. We have 
a deficit of $27 billion. It does not make sense that a government 
could be proud of that.
<P>
	We have promises broken. I want to go on but I must discuss the 
promises of NAFTA to look at the subsidies, to look at the 
resolution mechanisms, to take a closer look at that legislation. 
That has not been done.
<P>
	There were promises for day care spaces which have not been 
answered. The GST fiasco has been blamed on everything, as my 
colleague mentioned, from acts of God to loose lips. Nothing has 
been done to make that real. There has certainly been a sellout of 
the Canadian people in a $1 billion plan for a partial program that 
will probably cost the taxpayers across Canada, including the very 
places concerned, more in the long run.
<P>
	The aboriginals have completely rejected government progress 
in terms of their priorities. Where are we with interprovincial trade 
barriers? Nowhere. Health care? We have line-ups growing. 
Seniors, people from coast to coast do not feel secure with our 
health care system. CBC funding, stable? Let us take another look 
at it.
<P>
	Youth unemployment is at 18 per cent. Overall unemployment is 
at almost 10 per cent. As I mentioned, 1.4 million Canadians are 
unemployed and 2 million to 3 million are underemployed. What is 
wrong? What is wrong with what the government seems to feel is 
just fine, thank you? I suggest it is the basic philosophy of this 
government, as with governments before. The questioning of that 
philosophy is what brought many of us as Reformers to this place.
<P>
	That philosophy is one of government knows best, government 
will solve all the problems of this country. Government will create 
jobs. Government will sustain Canadians. Government will sustain 
aboriginals. That is rejected by them. Government will sustain and 
protect children. I believe government cannot do all things and that 
individual Canadians should be trusted and empowered to do those 
very things that this government and pervious governments have 
felt they can do in a better way. With the basic philosophy that 
government knows best, we have bigger government, more 
intrusive government.
<P>
	Taxes have grown by $26 billion in the last three years. We have 
a less responsive, less accountable, more arrogant government as it 
takes the reins and control of the lives of Canadians. This is in stark 
contrast to the Reform approach.
<P>
	In our fresh start program we feel that government can be less. 
Government can be less expensive, less intrusive, $15 billion less, 
from $109 billion to $94 billion in government expenditures. With 
this philosophy we will balance the budget by March 31, 1999. 
With that we will provide Canadians with the ability to create the 
employment they need, to create the freedom from government that 
they need. By increasing the basic deduction for every taxpayer in 
Canada and matching the spousal deduction to the basic deduction 
to $7,900 we would level the playing field for one and two income 
families. That would give Canadians a choice and more  money in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5861"> 5861 </A></B>
<P>
their jeans, more money to use in the economy, more money to 
create the jobs that are needed.
<P>
<B>(2200)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals are afraid of the new and fresh approach they see 
from Reform. Maybe it boggles their minds to think perhaps things 
could be done differently. I saw in this morning's paper: ``Liberals 
turn sights on Manning''. They have labelled us with things which 
simply display their own arrogance and their discomfort with 
something which may be different and that might work.
<P>
	One thing the Liberals have said is that Reform does not 
understand the modern family. I find that very interesting. What is 
Liberal definition of a modern family? I would like to tell the 
House what I see their definition of a modern family to be. I would 
like to ask Canadians if it is their definition.
<P>
	The Liberal definition of the modern family is two wage earners 
by decree having to pay exorbitant taxes on what they earn. If they 
have a job they are afraid of losing that job. They are unsure of 
their children's future. They are unsure their pension plans. They 
are earning less and less after tax income each year as the 
government strips more and more money away to fund programs 
that it invents. That is the Liberal definition of a modern family. 
That is the way they would like every family to be. I question if that 
is what Canadians want.
<P>
	We have a government which gave $87 million to Bombardier 
and in the meantime families pay higher taxes. In my province the 
coast guard has been cut by $7 million, the fish hatcheries which 
create a livelihood for many people in my riding have been cut 
back. They have cut back the staffing of light stations which many 
people depend on for their security. This is a choice which certainly 
does not serve the families in my area.
<P>
	There is a $23 million flag program. We are not sure which 
budget it comes out of but it certainly comes out of the pockets of 
taxpayers. In the meantime health care has been reduced by $6 
billion in the last three years. People are worrying about what will 
happen if they need care in a short time.
<P>
	Our plan would give tax relief of $2,000 to the average family by 
the year 2000. We would create job opportunities through a capital 
gains tax cut of one-half of what is now being paid, down to 37.5 
per cent. We would reduce job killing payroll taxes by reducing the 
employer's contribution to UI by 28 per cent. We would remove the 
surtax and move toward a simplified flat tax.
<P>
	What do Canadian families care about? They care about the best 
possible care for their children. That, as opposed to the Liberal 
view is choice, not coercion in day care. Canadians would like to 
have the choice of how and who takes care of their children, 
including being able to take care of their own children.
<P>
	Presently the day care deduction is only for receiptable day care. 
Reform would change that to a deduction for every child below the 
age of 13 years. Families could choose to take care of their own 
children or they could have grandmother or Aunt Bessie or Uncle 
Jim. Right now that choice is not theirs. It has been stripped by the 
Liberal vision of the Canadian family, and a wonderful vision it is.
<P>
<B>(2205)</B>
<P>
	Reform values choice. Reform values parenting. Reform values 
the safety and security of Canadian families in their homes. Reform 
wants to address the issues of family violence, child prostitution 
and child pornography. Reform wants to look at the issue of 
victims' rights and address them. Reform wants to eliminate the 
parole of violent offenders. We want them to serve their full 
sentences. Reform wants to take a look at the Young Offenders Act, 
eliminate it and make young offenders more accountable in the 
process.
<P>
	In terms of the social safety net what do we want to do? We want 
to give priority in education and health. Those are the priorities of 
Canadian families.
<P>
	In the last four years the Liberals have worked hard to destroy 
the health care system. They talk about supporting it but in fact 
they have taken $6 billion away from health and education through 
their CHST changes. Reform would like to restore the UI program 
to something that works, something that is restored to its original 
purpose.
<P>
	Reformers would like Canadians to have security by having 
control over their own pensions. Certainly it would like the security 
for existing plans. Our fresh approach to national unity just boggles 
the mind of a Liberal. We want that plan to speak for all Canadians. 
We want it based on the equality of all Canadians in all provinces.
<P>
	Reform wants greater control given to provinces and to 
municipalities and we want the federal government to focus on 
what it does best.
<P>
	Much of tonight's discussion has been about promises. Reform 
will give money back promises in the form of our democratic 
reforms in recall where we can fire a liar if necessary. We will give 
those tools to Canadians and that will be a cure for a political trend 
that we have seen for too long and too often. We look for real 
democracy, legislation that can be brought through citizen's 
initiative, decisions by the people through national binding 
referendums and free votes in this place. MPs must represent their 
constituents' wishes if those are known.
<P>
	Not too long ago an MP on the other side asked about 
accountability. Reform does what it says. One promise the Liberals 
made that they did not keep was to reform pension plans. The 
pension plan held by most Liberals is still five times greater than 
any other Canadian can get.  Reform was presented with that same 
decision and Reform rejected the gold plated pension. One member 
probably lost $3 million when she signed her name on that line that 
said 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5862"> 5862 </A></B>
<P>
what she could accept. The integrity of the member for Beaver 
River made her say: ``This is not good enough. This is not what 
Canadians want. I lead by example''.
<P>
	Members on the far side of this House will not lead by example. 
In fact their leadership is something that Canadians must and will 
challenge in the next election.
<P>
	Integrity is on this side. Reformers do what they say they will do. 
We walk the walk. Fresh start is the option to old politics. Instead 
of promises and big government and old politics we believe 
Canadians deserve better. There is a choice for change. The cruel 
reality is that Canadians made the wrong choice last time. They 
will be able to change-

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MOTIONONTHEAPPOINTMENTOFADEPUTYCHAIRMAN">MOTION ON THE APPOINTMENT OF A DEPUTY CHAIRMAN</A></H4>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for giving me the floor on the motion on the 
appointment of a deputy chairman of the committees of the whole 
House.
<P>
	The position of deputy chairman is sufficiently important that we 
should appoint someone worthy of the honour, such as the 
individual the government recommended. The government has 
recommended the member for Kingston and the Islands. He is a 
well balanced individual, well educated, who weighs things 
carefully and has many merits, and who, above all, is familiar with 
procedure.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party are objecting to this 
appointment. They would like to see someone from the opposition 
appointed. What sort of people do we have in the opposition right 
now?
<P>
	There are the members of the Bloc Quebecois, who do not want 
to abide by the Constitution. This morning I proposed to a 
committee on procedure that a swearing in, in addition to an oath of 
allegiance to the Queen, should include an oath of allegiance to the 
country known as Canada and to the Constitution. The Constitution 
means a great deal. One of the things it means is respecting the 
rights and freedoms of individuals.
<P>
	Should we appoint a member of the Bloc Quebecois as deputy 
chairman? I think not, given that members of that party do not 
respect the Constitution, nor do they support my proposal that 
allegiance be sworn to the Queen, the country and the Constitution.
<P>
	As for the members of the Reform Party, how can we appoint we 
appoint someone from such a grumpy, ill tempered bunch, who 
have forgotten how to smile? And when they do, it is because they 
are about to pounce on someone they disagree with. They make fun 
of people, so when they are smiling, watch out.
<P>
	You know, the members of the Reform Party put me in mind of 
old westerns. They form a sort of posse. These fellows in the 
Reform Party-and a few women, a very few, because the Reform 
Party is mostly for macho types-would like to see anyone accused 
of a crime, any crime at all, immediately strung up.
<P>
	This describes our friends in the Reform Party, a sort of cowboy 
posse. They are a gang of cowboys. What they would like, if a child 
is accused of wrongdoing, is to see him beaten, whipped, kicked, 
taught a proper lesson.
<P>
	If someone is accused of a violent crime, well my goodness, why 
wait for the judge? Why waste a jury's time. Who has a rope? Let 
us lynch him.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> You see, now, what a show the Reform Party is 
putting on. They are losing it completely.
<P>
	Can you see one of those guys as Deputy Chairman? The Deputy 
Chairman must be someone who weighs things, who must be 
reserved and knowledgable. Not a gang of yahoos like this bunch of 
cowboys-and I say this with the greatest respect for real cowboys. 
I am comparing them to the Hollywood type cowboy. Those guys 
from the other side of the House, those Reformers, who subscribe 
to the principle that those who yell the loudest get the most. That is 
their attitude, their philosophy.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I would like to bring 
the member back to some relevance. I do not appreciate the huge 
disinformation he is giving about us. I want him to be relevant.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is my great wish that all members this evening 
will be relevant. I know we are going to get there. The hon. member 
for Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would dearly love to have the 
Reform Party's definition of the word ``relevant'' in English. I am 
sure that they could not give me one in French, indeed would not 
give me one in French since, in my opinion, they hate 
francophones, having brought out a resolution last year to abolish 
the commission on bilingualism. What is their definition of 
bilingualism?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> You hear the applause for abolition of the 
commission on bilingualism?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I respect when you rise on a point 
of order and I do hope we are not taking advantage of one another. I 
am going to listen to the hon. member's point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request that you check 
whether we have a quorum in this House. I do not believe we do.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> By all counts, my dear colleague, we do have a 
quorum. I am going to give the floor to the member for 
Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the floor 
again. I am glad to be able to tell my constituents that I upset the 
members of the Reform Party, those Hollywood cowboys who all 
want to gang up on people who are more sensitive than most. I 
think I know how sensitive they are.
<P>
	These are people who believe that all francophones should go to 
Quebec and all anglophones should live outside Quebec. They have 
great respect for Quebec's anglophones and they have great respect 
for francophones. They have great respect for the history of our 
country.
<P>
	I bet you that if we had a history test, if we had a high school 
history teacher, but no, that would be getting our sights too high. I 
was too demanding. If we had a grade school teacher, maybe a 
second grade teacher who would  ask them elementary questions 
about the history of Canada, how Canada was formed, I am sure 
they would score a big fat zero, because that is what they are on the 
other side, just a gang of zeros.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Listen to those Hollywood cowboys shout. They 
are talking about the Plains of Abraham again. They want me to go 
back to the Plains of Abraham. These people forget what 
francophones did for Canada. They forget that the reason we are 
not the fifty-first state of the United States is that the francophones 
joined up with the British, who conquered this country and entered 
into a relationship that was to form a new country.
<P>
	I know it is a very sore point and that these complainers like to 
play rough and tough. That is their whole attitude. You see, their 
friends are very rich, so one of their priorities here in the House is 
to cut taxes. In fact, what they would like to do is close the whole 
government down. They could not care less about immigration or 
citizenship or the poor. They could not care less about families or 
the poor worker.
<P>
<B>(2220)</B>
<P>
	I almost forgot to remind the House that when health care is on 
the agenda, they would like their friends to take advantage of our 
health care system and make our hospital and health care system 
more like the one in the United States. Down there, private 
companies take the money and prevent people from getting the 
medication and the kind of hospital care they need, but everything 
is based on systems à la Ross Perrot or Newt Gingrich. These 
people have no interest in the common good.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party, those Hollywood cowboys 
who, as they say, want to lynch anything that moves, believe only 
in the rich and protecting the rich. They do not believe in the 
middle class and especially not the poor, except when they feel like 
giving some money to help people who are in need, to make their 
consciences feel better.
<P>
	As you can hear, during my speech, the Reform Party members 
just keep shouting. Can you imagine one of this gang of tough guys 
sitting in your seat as Deputy Chairman? They would just spend 
their time shouting at us. They would not spend their time saying 
that we have to improve the circumstances of the average citizen. 
They will not recognize what the Liberal government has done 
since 1993. They do not believe in all this. They believe in the law 
of the jungle. They want to see the deficit completely eliminated 
within a very short time. They would like to take us back to the 
time of the depression and cut everywhere.
<P>
	This afternoon in committee, we were talking about government 
cuts in public service spending. I really felt uncomfortable, because 
a lot of public servants have lost their jobs. Reform Party members 
told me that if they  formed the government, public servants would 
really get the short end of the stick, because they want to close the 
whole government down. They want to cut everything. They would 
like to fire all public servants, then turn around and give all these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5864"> 5864 </A></B>
<P>
jobs to their friends so they can make a buck at the expense of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The worst scenario we could have during this session would be 
to have a member of the Bloc-but at least Bloc members are often 
reasonable-but Reform Party members are never reasonable. Can 
you imagine a member of the Reform Party as Deputy Chairman of 
the committees of the whole House? Do you want to work with 
someone from the Reform Party? Absolutely not, no one could 
work with them.
<P>
	They would sit over there with their whips-and we must not 
forget the rope too, since someone needs to be hanged from time to 
time. As for those accused of something, not someone found guilty, 
they deserve a royal thrashing.
<P>
	I would be greatly disappointed if the government were to decide 
to have a Reformer as Deputy Chairman. Theirs is an anti-people 
party, a party for the strongest, one which believes that he who 
yells the loudest get the most. For anyone who is sick or poor, 
theirs would be the last party in the world to vote for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B> What do you know about poverty?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to 
speak and for giving me far more attention than I got from those 
yahoos on the other side, with all their uncontrolled bellowing, and 
with absolutely no qualifications or qualities to be the Deputy 
Chairman of the whole House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to stand to speak to this motion.
<P>
<B>(2225 )</B>
<P>
	I first want to say that the remarks I am about to make should not 
be construed as being remarks that are negative toward the hon. 
member who is pursuing the position of deputy chairman. As 
everyone knows, the hon. member has done a good job in the 
House in terms of being able to understand the rules and certainly 
he is up on the rules. Nobody would quarrel with that.
<P>
	I think the quarrel that the people in the Reform Party have and 
anybody who has read the red book has is that this is completely 
contrary to what the government promised it would do. The great 
irony is that the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands who is 
pursuing the position is the one who wrote the policy for the red 
book. There is a great inconsistency here.
<P>
	We do not need to hammer too much on that broken promise. I 
think it has been done fairly sufficiently this evening. It is pretty 
obvious for anybody who wants to have a good look at it. The fact 
is the hon. member  himself wrote the red book promise and is 
breaking it himself. People can judge for themselves whether that 
is integrity. I would say it is not.
<P>
	I want to follow up on some of the comments I have heard 
tonight and perhaps talk a little bit about the two fundamental 
visions we are hearing about in the House. One of course is the 
Liberal-Tory vision and the other is our vision.
<P>
	Before I do that I feel compelled to follow up on the smear 
campaign that we are hearing. Certainly the member for 
Carleton-Gloucester was going on calling us all kinds of names. 
That is fine. I do not think that carries much weight with ordinary 
Canadians.
<P>
	I do want to make reference to his point where he said that he 
thought the Bloc Quebecois members were very rational thinkers. 
He seemed to agree with them a lot. He is certainly entitled to his 
opinion, but I am surprised at his comments. I would be surprised if 
the people in Carleton-Gloucester really agreed with him. We are 
talking about the people who are proposing to break up the country. 
The hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester seems to be supporting 
them. That is quite shocking. In a sense, when we consider how 
close the government came to losing the last referendum campaign, 
within 50,000 votes, perhaps it is not so surprising after all.
<P>
	I do want to talk for a moment about the two fundamental 
differences which really relate to this whole issue. This whole issue 
is a microcosm of the two fundamental differences in visions of the 
country between the Liberal-Tory regime and the Reform Party 
regime. The best way to explain the differences is to look at the 
history.
<P>
	An hon. member back here is continuing the smear campaign 
that was started earlier in the day. Hopefully they will find out that 
it is futile.
<P>
	Let us look at the record. With the Liberals and Tories in power, 
going back to the early seventies the debt has gone from about $13 
billion to about $600 billion. I will do for my Liberal friends across 
the way what I often do for high school students. I will point out to 
them how much money that is. If I had a stack of hundred dollar 
bills about two metres high, that would be a million dollars. If we 
stacked our debt in one hundred dollar bills, it would be 1,200 
kilometres high. That is an astounding amount of money.
<P>
	Only a few weeks ago the finance minister made a presentation 
to the finance committee. It was a sort of state of the nation address 
with respect to the economy. I was quite surprised when, knowing 
that we had this huge debt problem, the finance minister came in 
and announced that the deficit for last year was only $28.6 billion. 
Only $28.6 billion. And what happened? The Liberal members 
began to clap. They said: ``Is that not wonderful. It is only $28.6 
billion''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5865"> 5865 </A></B>
<P>
	As my leader pointed out, only in the never never land of 
Ottawa would $28.6 billion in the hole be applauded. There they 
were lined up like crows on a telephone wire applauding away as 
if this were some great accomplishment. However, I can assure 
the people across the way that back home in the real world there 
was no applauding because the people back home know the only 
place that money comes from to pay for these deficits is out of 
the pockets of ordinary Canadians.
<P>
<B>(2230 )</B>
<P>
	I think this is a fundamental difference between the Liberal-Tory 
vision and the Reform vision. The Liberals and the Tories have for 
years and years piled up the debt, ran up taxes. Hon. members 
across the way have probably heard over the last few days, because 
we have mentioned it once or twice, that in the three years they 
have been in power the average Canadian family has seen its 
purchasing power go down by $3,000 per family per year; a 
national pay cut courtesy of the Liberal government.
<P>
	The Liberal member across the way is laughing. But I can say 
that the people who do not have incomes of $64,300 plus all the 
expense money that MPs have are not laughing because they have 
to pay for that out of their savings.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, it is getting a little late. I am having a 
tough time hearing the hon. member. I know you want to hear him, 
so I wonder if we could just keep it down a bit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the courtesy. I am sure I 
can expect it from hon. members across the way as well.
<P>
	Taxes are not the only thing that separates the Liberal-Tory 
vision from the Reform vision. Their belief in big government, 
high taxes and bloated bureaucracies breeds something perhaps 
even more insidious. There is no question that it does. I am talking 
about the record high levels of unemployment in this country.
<P>
	There is no coincidence that as the debt started to grow in the 
early 1970s so did the unemployment rate in the country. When 
Pierre Trudeau took power in 1972 somewhere in the range of 
535,000 people were unemployed. By the time he left office in 
1984 it was up to 1.45 million people.
<P>
	The Tories continued that trend and again there was record high 
unemployment. What kind of unemployment do we have today? 
There are 1.4 million unemployed.
<P>
	It would be bad enough if it were only the 1.4 million 
unemployed, but that does not take into account the 500,000 to 1 
million people who have completely given up looking for work 
because the Liberal vision of bloated government has not worked 
for them. There are 2 million to 3 million people who are 
underemployed. By  that I mean people who have an education but 
who cannot find a job that suits their skills. One in four Canadians 
is very concerned about losing their job.
<P>
	Canadians have no confidence in the economy. Too many people 
have been laid off, too many tax cuts have come down the pike to 
ever be assured they will have a job for very long.
<P>
	This is also a key difference between the Liberal-Tory vision 
where they seem to tolerate high levels of unemployment and can 
offer up nothing creative, nothing new to give people some hope.
<P>
	A great concern I have and which I gather has been shared lately 
by the Prime Minister and the finance minister is their dependence 
on these make work programs like infrastructure. The Prime 
Minister and certainly the finance minister in the past have said 
that these programs simply do not create long term, permanent 
jobs. But what do they do? They keep coming back to the same old 
ideas because they cannot bring themselves to face the fact that big 
government and bloated bureaucracies cannot do it all. The 
government cannot have its fingers in everybody's business all the 
time because it kills jobs. Surely by now, after 25 years of social 
engineering, big government in everybody's face, we have to arrive 
at the conclusion that big government does not work. It does not 
create jobs, it kills jobs. The facts speak for themselves.
<P>
	It is not only about taxes and unemployment but also the 
tremendous strain this puts on families by both parents having to 
work, one to simply pay the taxes for the government.
<P>
<B>(2235)</B>
<P>
	The other issue that we run into when there is a government that 
spends $600 billion over 25 years, more than it takes in, a deficit 
last year of $28.6 billion, is that we have interest payments on that 
debt that this year will be about $49 billion.
<P>
	The hon. member across the way thinks that is funny. I should 
point out to the hon. member that the finance minister writes 
cheques to bankers in Japan, Germany and the United States for 
amounts that are much larger than he writes to the provinces for 
things like health care, old age security and unemployment 
insurance. That is $49 billion.
<P>
	I do not think that is a laughing matter. I would argue that it is 
deadly serious. It is deadly serious because of the impact it has on 
social programs.
<P>
	My friends across the way have cloaked themselves in the flag of 
medicare. They have run around telling Canadians how they are 
going to save it.
<P>
	The last election campaign I remember extremely well. I am sure 
my colleagues on this side do as well. I remember how members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5866"> 5866 </A></B>
<P>
over there were engaging in a  smear campaign at that time and said 
that Reformers were out to get health care.
<P>
	As it turned out, it looks like the Liberals were wolves in sheep's 
clothing. Not only were they not telling the absolute truth about the 
Reform Party, they went out and cut $3 billion plus out of health 
care themselves.
<P>
	They have closed more hospitals, have put more health workers 
out of work than any provincial government in this country. The 
provincial governments combined have not taken a whack out of 
health care like the federal government has. That is a fact.
<P>
	It is about time that the Liberals started to face some of the 
scrutiny falling on the provinces which are taking a lot of the heat 
for health care cuts.
<P>
	I would dearly love to see Canadians get on planes, get in their 
cars and get on trains to come to Ottawa to protest on the lawn of 
the Parliament Buildings over the cuts to health care. That is where 
the cutting started. The federal government cut $3 billion and left 
the provinces no choice.
<P>
	By the way, I am going to say how the Reform Party would 
remedy that. Forty-nine billion dollars a year in interest payments 
has also pinched the federal government with respect to payments 
to old age security.
<P>
	I remember in the last election campaign the Liberals went after 
us hammer and tong: ``You guys are going to cut benefits to 
seniors''. I remember it very well.
<P>
	I hope I run against the same guy I ran against last time. I can 
hardly wait to confront him with the fact that it was the Liberals 
who cut seniors' pensions more than any government in the history 
of the country.
<P>
	Who was it? It was the Liberals. That is the difference between 
the Reform vision and the Liberal-Tory vision. We have always 
been straight with Canadians. We have told people the truth.
<P>
	I do not know what the members opposite were saying in the last 
election campaign about social programs. I expect a lot of people 
are going to be examining those documents as we get closer to the 
next election campaign.
<P>
	There is another important way that we differ from the 
Liberal-Tory vision.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We are sane.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> We are sane, as my friend says.
<P>
	The Liberal-Tory vision is one that is full of broken promises. 
We talked a minute ago about the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands who has broken a promise himself, in effect, even 
though he is pursuing the position of deputy speaker.
<P>
	He has written, basically, the red book promise to allow deputy 
speakers to be chosen from the opposition benches but he, himself, 
is allowing his name to stand, rather unbelievably. That is just a 
microcosm of the overall bigger problem.
<P>
	We have broken promises on the GST. I hope my hon. friends 
across the way have not forgotten that the Deputy Prime Minister 
was finally hung by her own words last spring and had to run for 
re-election. It was a national embarrassment.
<P>
	I could not believe that the Deputy Prime Minister had to take a 
poll in her own riding to determine whether it was safe for her to 
finally hand in her resignation after she had been shamed into it by 
not only this party but Canadians from around the country. 
Absolutely shameful. That is only one of the broken promises. 
There are a lot of them.
<P>
<B>(2240)</B>
<P>
	I could not believe the spectacle, again involving the Deputy 
Prime Minister, on the weekend. She was running around telling 
people that it was not her fault the CBC was being cut. She said that 
it was the finance minister's fault. I believe she is the Deputy Prime 
Minister. I believe she sits around the cabinet table. I believe there 
was a red book promise to provide stable funding.
<P>
	Stable funding does not mean funding enough to run a stable. It 
means that the funding will be there in the same amounts as it was 
in the beginning.
<P>
	That is only another of many promises. I remember during the 
NAFTA debate how hon. members across the way railed against 
free trade: ``Free trade is going to kill Canada. It is going to be 
horrible. It is going to be something that steals our sovereignty''. 
We heard it from every single member across the way, and what did 
they do? As soon as they got in they signed the agreement. They 
broke both legs to sign the agreement. Again, we see that their 
actions cannot meet their words and they should be ashamed.
<P>
	On the issue of day care the Liberals said that when there was 
growth in the economy of over 3 per cent, or whatever it was, they 
would create 150,000 day care spaces. That has still not happened. 
What is going on here? That was a promise that undoubtedly got 
the Liberals a lot of votes. They told people they wanted to ensure 
working parents would have some support.
<P>
	I personally do not agree with their promise but they used it to 
lever themselves into power, which is absolutely ridiculous. They 
should be ashamed of that.
<P>
	I do not want to tie up the whole time talking about the Liberals' 
poor record. That is too depressing. People need some hope. Let me 
talk about Reform's fresh start. Let me talk about the new way to 
do things.
<P>
	Reformers want to give Canadians a government they can afford, 
a smaller government, a government with lower taxes, a 
government that will leave more money in the pockets of taxpayers 
and the job creators so they can  make these decisions, so they do 
not have big government in their faces at every step, so they do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5867"> 5867 </A></B>
<P>
have a government in their faces that tells them how they have to 
raise their children, what they have to do at every turn.
<P>
	For crying out loud, ordinary Canadians are asked to raised their 
families. They are expected to fill out their income tax forms. 
Surely they can decide what to do with their own money. We do not 
need big government in our faces at every step. No way.
<P>
	We are going to do more. We are going to provide lower taxes for 
the people who create the jobs. I cannot think of an economist in 
the country who has not spoken of the need to lower unemployment 
insurance premiums. Reform is offering a 28 per cent cut. That 
would be an immediate surge of energy to the job creators in the 
economy and we would see a tremendous amount of job creation.
<P>
	I ask members across the way to compare that to the government 
approach to job creation. Recently Atlantic Canadian provinces 
signed the GST harmonization deal with the help of $1 billion to 
make it a little easier for the premiers to go along with it. But now 
housing prices in Atlantic Canada are going to go up by $3,000 to 
$4,000.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> The hon. member across the way says that it is not 
true, but I ask him to check with the Canadian Real Estate 
Association. Those are not my numbers. They come from the 
Canadian Real Estate Association, which is very concerned. It will 
kill hundreds of jobs in Atlantic Canada. It will cost people 
thousands of dollars. That is the Liberal vision.
<P>
	Our vision is to give people lower taxes, not different taxes, not 
higher taxes, lower taxes. Reformers will give more incentives to 
job creators through lowering the inclusion rate on capital gains. 
That will bring all kinds of investment into the country. That way 
people like the finance minister will not have to send his assets 
outside of the country. We would like to have those assets inside 
the country. I am sure it would create a lot of jobs if we could have 
them all here. The Reform Party speaks for ordinary Canadians. It 
speaks for people who have been beaten up by Liberal and 
Conservative governments over the last 25 years. Canadians have 
had a $3,000 national pay cut since the Liberals came to power. 
People cannot take it any more.
<P>
<B>(2245)</B>
<P>
	I urge my friends not to be quite so partisan about it and please 
come on board and sign up with the Reform fresh start program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Nunatsiaq, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me this opportunity. I like 
what the member had to say in his last remark about representing 
ordinary Canadians. I have not seen any aboriginal people, 
blacks-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> You weren't at our conference in Vancouver or you 
would have seen them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, the truth must hurt. The truth seems 
to hurt the member for Kootenay East. He seems to have a bit of a 
sore spot about aboriginal people or blacks or ordinary Canadians 
that this party on this side of the House represents.
<P>
	All day the members across have voiced their great outrage at 
being singled out by the Prime Minister by being called extremists. 
They have a problem with that extremist label.
<P>
	This is the same party that had problems with the member for 
Calgary Centre. They ousted the member for Calgary Southwest. 
These are very ordinary members but they had a problem with 
them. I guess those two members are not extremist enough, along 
with the member for Calgary West who is not running again. That 
party is now advertising so that they can get somebody to run in 
that riding in Calgary, because I think that particular member is not 
extremist enough.
<P>
	This is the same party that has members like the member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan who if he had his way would have me in the 
back of the room because I might be losing business for him. This 
is the same party that has the member for Capilano-Howe Sound 
who thinks that we belong on some far off island wearing shades 
and shorts so that we can get a tan. He thinks that is all we do.
<P>
	This is the party that objects to being called extremist but has no 
tolerance for people other than the people who are around that 
particular area. This is the same party that when it was politically 
convenient thought that Newt Gingrich was the best thing since 
sliced bread. Now because New Gingrich is not so popular, all of a 
sudden they are sort of backing off from having any association 
with him.
<P>
<B>(2250 )</B>
<P>
	This is the same party in which the hon. member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia says: ``I am a red neck and I 
am proud to be one''. That is the same party that espouses the kind 
of attitudes and policies which are detrimental to other people.
<P>
	All of a sudden the Reform Party seems to be the champion of 
the needy. Reformers are the champions of the poor. It is now 
politically convenient to defend the poor. The government defends 
the poor whether it is politically convenient or not. Liberals have 
always defended the poor.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5868"> 5868 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me talk about the constituency which I represent as 
envisioned by the hon. member for Kootenay East. That member 
has a problem with Nunavut, a new territory which will be 
incorporated when the division of the Northwest Territories occurs 
on April 1, 1999. The member for Kootenay East calls it the illegal 
new province of Nunavut. What is illegal about it? It is a very 
big area. It has three time zones. It is larger than the area which 
he represents. He has a problem with it. The population is only 
about 20,000, but those 20,000 people-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know you will 
understand what I am saying. The time will soon run out and this 
member is so far away from the topic that I know you would want 
him to be relevant.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, and I know that all of the members this 
evening have been relevant and I know that member is relevant 
also. He is going to be relevant right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, this same member thinks that 
Nunavut is an illegal province. Admittedly, there are about 20,000 
people in Nunavut. However, those 20,000 people can record their 
history back thousands of years. They have occupied that land for 
at least 4,000 years. I would be careful if I was the hon. member for 
Kootenay East when calling it an illegal province.
<P>
	Eighty-five per cent of the population is Inuit. However, in 
negotiations with the Government of Canada we have managed to 
convince it that we should divide the Northwest Territories in 1999. 
We should be celebrating. I know the Prime Minister will be with 
us when we celebrate the new territory of Nunavut in 1999.
<P>
	The hon. member has a problem because so few people inhabit 
Nunavut. If the member had his way he would probably move them 
into apartment buildings in Toronto, Ottawa or Montreal. The 
difference between that member and me is that I love the north. I 
love the land. It is my home. There is no way that any member is 
going to force me to move down here or force the people of the 
north to move down here just because they do not agree that we 
have a right to our self-determination within the country of Canada.
<P>
<B>(2255 )</B>
<P>
	It seems that all of a sudden the Reform Party is now the 
champion of the poor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Where did you buy a house?
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Where do you live, Jack? Here in Ottawa? Where 
are your kids?.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> For the record I live in Rankin Inlet and my 
family is in Rankin Inlet. As a matter of fact I was talking to my 
children in Rankin Inlet earlier tonight before I came to the House. 
They are in school in Rankin Inlet.
<P>
	All of a sudden Reformers are champions of the poor because it 
happens to be politically convenient. With help like that we do not 
need any enemies. As far as that party is concerned aboriginal 
people should not have recognition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> A party? We are not 
even enjoying ourselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Some aboriginal people have been in Canada for 
36,000 years. The Inuit are relative newcomers. We have only been 
here for 4,000 years.
<P>
	I do not know if my other colleagues, the aboriginal leaders 
across the country, welcome the support of the Reform Party when 
it is convenient for the Reform Party to support the aboriginal 
people. I do not know how my other colleagues feel.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Turn around ask them. They are right behind you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> I will depend on the people who have always 
championed the rights of the poor, of the aboriginal people, of 
minorities such as our present Prime Minister of Canada. They talk 
about the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister ought to have kept 
her promise to resign. She had the courage to resign and run again 
and win. She won big by the way.
<P>
	To paraphrase what the Reform is doing there must be something 
that is bothering the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Yes, it is you. It is 
called Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> They seem to be protesting a little too much. I do 
not know how to say it but it is along the lines of ``thou doth protest 
too much''. English being my second language sometimes I am not 
quite sure of the proper pronunciation. Yes, it is Shakespeare: 
``Thou doth protest too much''.
<P>
	It is an honour for me to speak in this Chamber and be able to say 
the kind of things I say to the Reform Party. They are protesting 
what I am saying but that is politics or debate. At the same time, the 
Reform Party has problems with the rights that were gained 
rightfully through treaties and they start doing certain things.
<P>
	A Reform member from British Columbia was arrested for 
illegal fishing. What if it had been an aboriginal person doing the 
same thing? I did not see the Reform Party protesting the law. This 
is a party that considers itself a law and order party but it is 
condoning breaking the law. Are they protesting the fact that this 
member broke the law? I did not hear any of that, Mr. Speaker, but 
thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.
<P>
<B>(2300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5869"> 5869 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have run out of time. I will hear the 
member's point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, my point of order is 
very short.
<P>
	The hon. member has made an absolute statement saying that 
one of my colleagues is guilty of an offence under the law. Mr. 
Speaker, it is unacceptable to make that comment. The hon. 
member in question has not been before the courts of this country 
to determine that one way or the other. I think it is unfair that a 
member in this House makes an accusation that is absolutely untrue 
and unfounded.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not remember all of the words that the 
member said. I do not know that he said them. I will be happy to 
review the blues. The hon. member is here and he knows what he 
said. My colleague, did you say that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was just reading the news that a 
member was arrested by officers of the law. Usually one gets 
arrested when one breaks the law.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, if you will just leave me a little bit of 
time, I will review the blues. If it is necessary, I will come back to 
the House.
<P>
	It is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every 
question necessary to dispose of the motion now before the House. 
The question is on the amendment.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the amendment will please 
say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Call in the members.

economic mainspring of Quebec society and, therefore, condemn 
the federal government's lack of concrete initiatives in supporting 
the Montreal area economy, primarily: the federal government's 
under-investment in research and development; its inequitable 
allocation of federal purchases of goods and services; its lack of 
willingness to support Montreal as a major financial centre in 
North America and its termination of Montreal's role as a major
