This group includes: international rock superstars The Guess Who; prima ballerina Karen Kain; Joy Coghill, for her remarkable contributions to the world of theatre; Phil Nimmons, jazz musician, educator and composer; theatre director André Brassard, for bringing to life some of the best loved plays in the canon of Québécois, Canadian and international theatre; and  Jean-Pierre Perreault, an accomplished choreographer.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in 1994 Lola Chapman led in the formation of the Ridge Meadows Youth and Justice Advocacy Association.  It grew from her experience with the youth court monitoring program that made her think there must be a better way to deal with first time minor offenders.  Lola asked me to speak with young people who it was felt were in danger of moving on to more violent activity.  I have been involved ever since.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This volunteer based organization diverts young first time minor offenders away from the criminal courts.  The process includes meeting with their victims in order to understand and to accept the impact of their actions and make restitution where applicable.  Participation by parents is mandatory.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key to the program's success are the dedicated volunteer mentors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 28 Lola Chapman received the Meritorious Service Medal from the Governor General.  Ever modest, Lola will say that it is the community volunteers who make the program work.  That may be so, but without her vision and her dedication, it would never have happened at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, Lola.  She is  a very special lady.  We thank her.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Agriculture and I were honoured to attend the crowning of Daniel Lenko of Lincoln as the 2002 Niagara Grape King of the Niagara Grape and Wine Festival.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To become the grape king or queen, one must be nominated by one's peers and fellow growers for having an outstanding vineyard.  Mr. Lenko was chosen as grape king by a panel of distinguished judges for the exceptional quality of his vines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lenko is a third generation grape grower whose family farm was one of the first in the Niagara area to plant a block of Vinifera grapes in 1960 and now boasts its own cottage winery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lenko is also part of the second father and son team to have been named grape king, as his father Bill was honoured with the title in 1990.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate Daniel Lenko on being crowned the 2002 Niagara Grape King.  He is a young grower who is making a difference in the industry.  I have no doubt that he and other Niagara region growers will continue to honour the Niagara region with their hard work and exceptional grapes and wine.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the International Association of Prosecutors has awarded its Special Achievement Award to the joint federal and provincial prosecution team that successfully prosecuted 35 members of the Manitoba Warriors street gang. This was the first significant prosecution under the anti-gang legislation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, it was the first time in Canadian history that a joint team of prosecutors from both the federal and a provincial government conducted a major case together. This kind of intergovernmental teamwork and the prosecutors' success convinced the International Association of Prosecutors to offer this prestigious award to the prosecutors involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organized crime is indeed a global challenge, one that requires a global response.  Governments, both foreign and domestic, must cooperate closely in partnership to fight this threat.  The Manitoba Warriors prosecution is an eloquent example of this type of cooperative effort that will yield beneficial and fruitful results.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he taught at Napanee District Secondary School, Dick Hopkins won the Prime Minister's Teaching Excellence Award for technological education.  After moving to Sydenham High School in 1999, Mr. Hopkins was named Teacher of the Year by the Limestone District School Board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a $50,000 grant from the Canadian Rural Partnership, Dick Hopkins, along with his colleague Brian Rombough, successfully created the first rural online high school in Ontario.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hopkins was an exceptional teacher who was skilled at transforming theory into practice,  from online learning to robotics to video conferencing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am honoured to recognize the many personal and professional accomplishments of Dick Hopkins.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please join me in extending condolences to the family, friends, students and colleagues of Mr. Hopkins, and in celebrating the life of an exceptional teacher and innovator.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, we all know that we should not judge a book by its cover.  Unfortunately, many Canadians who suffer from cancer know all too well that people often judge them by their looks alone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Look Good, Feel Better program is now celebrating its 10th anniversary; 10 years of helping people improve their appearance and in turn, their confidence. It was an honour for me to volunteer in this program at Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon which  helps patients overcome these challenges.  It was rewarding to see the smiles and laughs return to the faces of these courageous people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a person living with cancer, I know all too well how uplifting this program can be.  It provides the positive focus we all need in the recovery process. Not only does it help the patients, but it also helps the families who desperately seek a sense of normalcy and reassurance during these tough times. These patients are proof that if they look good, they feel better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generous donations from the Canadian Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association makes this program possible. On behalf of all cancer patients who have participated in this program, I wish to say thanks very much.</p>

This honour is for her outstanding contribution to Canadian cultural life and her support and encouragement of aboriginal art in Canada.</p>

She has worked as a freelance journalist and broadcaster. In 1994 she became the first aboriginal person licensed by the CRTC to operate a private radio station. Suzanne purchased a local station which eventually became Spirit 91.7 FM.  Spirit FM has enjoyed excellent ratings since going on the air in 1999.  Its name honours its aboriginal heritage.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the month of October is devoted to breast cancer prevention and to increasing public awareness of this disease.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortality rate for this cancer has decreased 25% since 1985 among women aged 50 to 70. Every year, however, over 5,400 Canadian women still lose their lives to this disease and 20,500 are diagnosed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important to make women more aware that they need to take regular advantage of existing screening techniques, both personal and clinical, to protect themselves from breast cancer or ensure the best possible response to treatment.  We know that early detection can boost the survival rate to 80%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us spread the word so that increased awareness will mean an increased chance of a cure. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, there are about 7.5 million Canadians engaged in genealogy.  This is one of our most popular hobbies.  Thousands of genealogists, historians and medical researchers have asked the House to allow access to the post-1901 census records.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was delighted last week to hear the House leader say that the government plans to introduce legislation this fall to allow researchers access to these records after 92 years.  This move is very welcome. I note that 162 members of the House are now on record as supporting their release.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The census records up to and including 1901 have been a  very valuable source for researchers.  These are available on microfilm through archives and libraries across the country.  I urge the government to ensure that later census records be just as accessible to researchers.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, grain handlers at the port of Vancouver have been locked out since September 3, causing the shipment of grain to come to an almost complete halt.  Our grains and oilseeds producers are already facing financial hardships from years of rising foreign subsidies, continuous years of drought and poor grain prices.  Now our producers are about to be hit again with another labour dispute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen this situation over and over again.  It was not that long ago that grain handlers were on strike hurting the economy and innocent third parties, namely farmers.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government goes from one crisis to another with no vision as to what the future may hold. Where is the long range planning on the government side? The Alliance has given the government an effective strategy that has been totally ignored.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will farmers see a dispute resolution mechanism so  that their products can be shipped uninterrupted to overseas customers?  Will the government wait until more damage is done before it takes action?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House realizes that our national rail industry plays an integral role in Canada's economy and well-being.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as the House contends with such important issues as sustainable management of our environment and our competitiveness as a nation, few sectors within Canada have the ability to play such a positive role as the rail industry.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this regard I would invite all members of Parliament, who have an interest in the rail industry, to participate on October 30 and 31 in addressing these challenges and seizing these opportunities.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Israel-Palestine conflict has been going on for what seems like forever, and is dragging the entire region into a terrifying spiral of horror.  The toll in human lives since the start of the second Intafada in September 2000 has been 1,898 Palestinians and 615 Israelis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past October 7, this absurd escalation of violence led to another bloodbath, this time in the Khan Younis refugee camp in the south of the Gaza Strip.  This particularly bloody raid by the Israeli army left no fewer than 14 dead and some 110 injured.  In particular, the Israeli soldiers targeted the camp hospital, leaving one person dead and three injured, among these a teenager and a member of the nursing staff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international community did not hesitate to condemn this brutal agression against Palestinian civilians. The Prime Minister of Israel even issued an apology for this unfortunate error in judgment, while adding in the same breath that the State of Israel was entitled to defend itself...  This butchery must absolutely stop and the belligerants must comply with the UN resolutions.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, since last week, employees of the Quebec government are no longer able to purchase Canada savings bonds through payroll deductions because Quebec's minister of finance decided to put an end to the practice.  Canada Investment and Savings denounces the Government of Quebec's decision, and so do I.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada savings bonds enjoy a very good reputation. Given the state of the markets, they provide a good return. By its actions, the Government of Quebec is depriving thousands of Quebeckers of a safe, risk-free investment, that will never lose its value.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I denounce this action that has ended a 55-year partnership and prevented close to 5,000 employees of the Government of Quebec from purchasing Canada savings bonds easily.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General reported yesterday that the Liberal government has wasted $65 million as part of another untendered contract, this time with Bombardier for the training of helicopter and fighter pilots. The $65 million was to graduate 216 pilots, but actually graduated only 61.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add insult to injury, the Department of National Defence has tied us to the contract. DND must make 40 payments of $31.4 million per year for 20 years for a total of $2.8 billion, unconditional and irrevocable, regardless of whether it uses the training or not. The Auditor General has summed it up best:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“To date, this program has not been able to train enough pilots, and we're paying for services we're not receiving”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the bleeding of a few government sheep, every member of the Liberal flock is guilty of disrespect and hypocrisy toward the military.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the contract that was renewed was the contract with the department of the Solicitor General's office.  The terms of the contract, of which we are in receipt, clearly state that contractor agrees to provide advice to senior officials in the department and in the office of the Solicitor General on issues concerning the portfolio of the Solicitor General.  Therefore, one can only assume that the advice on Prince Edward Island was contracted for separately. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, a while back, the government introduced  transitional measures to help the people of the North Shore and Lac-Saint-Jean region swallow the bitter pill   of  boundary readjustment for economic regions used for the purposes of employment insurance. With these measures, the EI eligibility rules will soon be tightened at a time when the region is hard hit by the softwood lumber crisis.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also point out,  and this point is particularly emphasized in the petition,  that embryonic stem cells will always face problems of immune rejection. The only way to avoid the immune rejection response is to transplant stem cells from the patient's own body. Such transplantations will occur from research that takes place on adult stem cells but not from research that takes place on embryonic stem cells.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from October 8, consideration of the motion for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at the opening of the session.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-301913"></A><a HREF="#Int-301922"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-301910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the most recent throne speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech we heard is not only very disappointing, it is also a rehash and it is redundant. There is nothing new in it for the public. In fact, it does not even propose a  vision. After the previous throne speech, I was very disappointed. This time, I am not discouraged, but rather annoyed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous throne speech was remarkable because its obvious lack of vision, but this one does not fare any better. The government not only forgot but it categorically refused to take concrete and long term measures to help all Canadians. It is sad to see that, with this speech, the government has once again managed to overlook the imperative needs of Canadians and Quebeckers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was reference in the speech to the fact that we live in uncertain times. This government had a duty to reassure the public, but it did just the opposite. There is nothing new and, more importantly, nothing to reassure us. In fact, the main theme of this speech is that the timeframe is extended. Everything is being postponed. Why make a commitment? This is the true redundancy in this throne speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public is well aware of the reason why everything is being postponed. This government cannot even manage and govern the way it should, because of an internal leadership crisis. We now know that the Prime Minister will resign. Has the leadership race begun, yes or no? We see that the race is on right here in front of us, in this chamber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech indicates that the federal government will continue to  work with its allies to ensure the safety and security of Canadians and Quebeckers. For several months now, we have seen that the attempt to ensure our protection has been detrimental to our freedom and our democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am annoyed by the fact that, in this speech, the government is not proposing anything better than continuing on the same path of denying rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only talk about the priorities we can afford. But the Liberals were elected because of the commitments they made on those so-called priorities. What are we to conclude? That their commitments were nothing but empty words? How can a government that passes itself off as strong and successful back away from its promises? I think the government missed a unique opportunity to make good on its commitments and promises. We should not underestimate the public. We have to respect the people and meet their expectations and their needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only conclude that the government has no real governance program, no real vision in terms of public affairs management.  For instance, an internal investigation carried out at Public Works and Government Services showed some wrongdoing in most large contracts awarded to communications firms. However, the report that could shed, for us and for the population, some light on this situation has yet to be tabled.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to remind the House that 13 contracts were referred to the RCMP for criminal investigation. Also, indications of wrongdoing were found in at least 130 contracts awarded by the department, that is 20% of all contracts awarded under the sponsorship program. It is important, however, to point out that these 130 contracts accounted for 80% of the value of all the sponsorships during the three year period under investigation. Imagine that. There is a problem, there was some wrongdoing in 20% of the contracts. But that 20% accounted for 80% of all the money handed out under the program.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of this story, each new piece of information has given us one more reason to doubt the transparency of this government and has confirmed that the Bloc Quebecois is right about the need to hold an independent public inquiry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today again, during oral question period, it has come out, in connection with questions asked by myself, that a former Groupaction vice-president has finally opened Pandora's box.  This is all connected to the statement by Mr. Guité that there is a political connection between these communication companies and the government.  It is necessary for the government to immediately launch an independent public inquiry into this sponsorship program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Quebec are entitled to know what went on.  In the coming months, we will continue to call for an independent public inquiry in order to get to the bottom of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other truly shameful example.  As I have said, I cannot help but regret the total absence of any commitment on the part of the Liberal government to keeping its promises.  In the last campaign, the government made a great deal of its promise to build two bridges in connection with highway 30.  Unfortunately, that promise quickly turned into a mere commitment to do the work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still today, they are saying that it is a priority, that something will be done soon.  Last week, the MInister of Transport responded to our query  by saying that it is currently carrying out environmental studies. Signature of a memorandum of agreement with Quebec is far from a reality, although Quebec has been ready to sign since January 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will this government come up with the necessary funds to keep its promise to finish highway 30 and build those bridges?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no longer any doubt about it, the government has no intention of investing in Quebec, as promised two years ago.  It is, therefore, up to the Bloc Quebecois to keep after the government about following through on its promises. That is what we have done so far and what we will continue to do, for as long as it takes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois has questioned the government about this on numerous occasions, and every time we have been given evasive answers.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House on October 1 of this year, the Minister of Transport told us there would  soon be an agreement with the government of Quebec and the private sector.  He did not, however, specify the timeframe nor the intention of signing the agreement in question.  I can well understand how confused the public must be hearing such double-speak, and I  can understand as well that some people are getting bitter about this backing down. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, the government tells us that the extension of highway 30 and the building of two bridges are priorities, but the next day, it is a total void. Who can we trust? Certainly not this government. Certainly not those who have reduced this promise to a work commitment, and certainly not those who have so casually put aside the development of a region and the development of all of Quebec as a a priority. It is incredible that they make such promises and fail to keep them. We hear that environmental studies have just begun. In Quebec City, we are ready. I ask the federal government to put some money in.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember very well that, in the last throne speech, the strategic infrastructure fund was created. We know where the government got the money. The money was taken from the surplus. We know that, in March 2002, there was a surplus of almost $10 billion. Until the last minute, we asked that money be put into the strategic infrastructure fund to finalize highway 30, but none was.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques is also still waiting for money from the fund to finalize highway 185. This is a matter that should not be forgotten. However, to come back to highway 30, the promise that was made should not be forgotten either. </p>

	Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the remarks made by the member for Châteauguay. I see that solidarity is very important, and this kind of solidarity exists between our ridings. We were both victims of the same thing in our ridings. Promises were made in the 2000 election campaign with regard to federal contributions to the highway system. Both regions were promised massive investments. We are talking here about huge amounts of money that are necessary for highway improvement. However, two years later, that money has yet to be found.  It is a bit of an odd situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say a few words about the concern expressed by the member for Châteauguay with respect to inquiries. How will the issue of political responsibility in the sponsorship scandal be resolved? Today, we are being told that these inquiries can be conducted by the RCMP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the member for Châteauguay if he thinks that the government's position seems to be that the RCMP will now conduct political inquiries in Canada. Does the government want to turn the RCMP  into a political police because it has to conduct inquiries on the political implication of certain people in the system?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear what my colleague from Châteauguay has to say on that subject. Is there not another solution than that of an independent public inquiry to clarify these issues? Even though it conducts the best police investigations in the world, the RCMP is not mandated  to conduct inquiries into the political behaviour of the government. This must be done at another level that is totally independent from the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like my colleague from Châteauguay to share his views on that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we heard a ridiculous answer regarding this ridiculous situation. We are calling for a public inquiry that would be transparent and independent to look into all the problems associated with the sponsorship program. We heard the comments made by the former vice-president of Groupaction on a Montreal television station. Now we are being told that these matters are the subject of a police inquiry, which will become a judicial inquiry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a police and judicial inquiry is not a political inquiry. The RCMP's mandate will not be changed to transform this police inquiry into a political inquiry. If a conflict of interest does exist, then we are not talking about a political inquiry, but about a police and judicial inquiry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is this. When there start to be serious connections, the only way for the people of Quebec and the rest of Canada to realize how complex and strong the connections are between the politicians and these communications firms is to simply and immediately set up a public, independent and transparent  inquiry. Every time we raise this issue, we are told “A police investigation is under way”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget, as I mentioned earlier, that there were irregularities in 130 contracts. That is  the figure we have? Again, the internal report prepared by Public Works and Government Services was not made public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we are dealing with the same people who carried out the internal investigation in 2000, and nothing has happened. The opposition, especially the Bloc Quebecois, and even the media had to carry out their own investigations before the government decided to act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people watching us have seen several heads roll. I will not go over the list of ministers who were brought down. Another minister was linked to this issue and he cannot tell us that he is not aware of the situation. When we started to ask questions after his appointment, we gave him enough time to look into this. But all he is doing right now is referring the contracts to the RCMP and setting up internal investigations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the day before and last week, we heard from the vice-president of Groupaction and from Mr. Charles Guité that the Prime Minister's office was involved. This speaks for itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a public, independent and transparent inquiry. Only then will the people of Quebec and of Canada find out what really happened.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate.  This is a great opportunity to respond to the Speech from the Throne. There are a number of really good initiatives in the speech.  The Prime Minister in his wisdom has laid out some direction and encouragement, which I think Canadians need to take note of.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the few minutes available to me, if I may, I will talk about one aspect, which is the environment and the challenge of climate change. We have had quite a summer in Canada.  In Alberta and parts of Saskatchewan we have witnessed very severe drought conditions.  In southern Manitoba we have had flooding.  In southern Ontario we had an extended hot and dry summer.  Average Canadians, much like those of us in here, feel there is something wrong about the weather but they are not quite sure of the cause, because respected scientists dispute the cyclical patterns of weather.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There does, however, seem to be mounting evidence that there is an accelerated rate of change which will result in exponential impacts beyond straight line graphs.  Heretofore we thought that weather change would go up slightly or in a straight line fashion. In fact, the effects start to heap on the effects and the result is that it ceases to be a straight line graph and we end up having accelerated change in weather patterns, which gives respected scientists and ordinary Canadians alike cause to be concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Toronto, we had pretty well lousy air for most of the summer.  It was hot, sticky and polluted.  Hospital admissions were up and puffers sold briskly. That brings me to the subject of Kyoto.  A lot of people seem to think that if we sign Kyoto suddenly the air will be clean, the sun will shine and all will be right with the world.  Regrettably, however, that is not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyoto is a treaty that is designed to deal with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and, while polluting in and of themselves, they are by no means the only contributor to smog.  Smog is made up of a lot of things, not only CO<sub>2</sub>.  Even if today we were able to magically cleanse the air of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, we would still have a significant smog problem in Toronto.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treaty is designed to reduce emissions and therefore reduce the effect of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere.  That in turn would reduce the environment in which smog is created, but it would not eliminate smog in and of itself. Unfortunately, even if the treaty were implemented and had an impact, it would not have a huge impact on cities like Toronto.  Half of our emissions come from across the U.S. border. Canada's entire emissions constitute only 2% of the world's total. So it is important to remember that even if Kyoto were implemented today, Toronto's air would not be substantially different.  So why forge ahead?  Why put the treaty in front of Parliament for ratification?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple answer is that we are part of the world community.  Because we are part of the world community, we cannot carry on doing what we are doing.  We cannot continue to send these kinds of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions up into the atmosphere without some major, significant impact upon our environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one level Kyoto is about the environment, but at another it is really about an economic impact and a wealth redistribution.  Unfortunately, we have enough alarmists on both sides of the debate to scare us into apocalyptic paralysis.  It makes it very difficult to see the truth and to respond in any rational form.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the environmental impact of such a treaty may be modest, we also have to ask ourselves whether the economic impact will also be modest.  The answer seems to be that it depends. That is not a very satisfactory answer at this stage, but  it really does depend.  It gets very difficult for the government to lay out a plan because it really depends on a whole bunch of variables that are not easily quantifiable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some manner, it becomes almost an article of faith. Is one a Kyoto believer or a Kyoto atheist?  Personally I am more in the category of agnostic, which I think is probably an atheist without any courage. It appears to depend on the mixture of regulations, incentives and new technologies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the House a picture of what Canada is facing and then  talk about some of the representations that have been made to me over the course of the summer by very able people and which I hope may set us upon a path of enlightened self-interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyoto requires Canada to reduce its emissions to 6% below the 1990 levels.  That means 240 megatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.  About 50 megatonnes will be taken care of by current programs and another 24 megatonnes by carbon sinks.  That leaves a shortfall of about 165 megatonnes and this is where it gets controversial.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first controversy is the credit for clean fossil fuel exports such as natural gas.  In other words, the argument is that if we export clean fuels, why should we not get the credit for it?  I suppose the counter argument, though,  is that if we export dirty fuels such as coal then possibly we should be penalized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What our target will be will depend on the outcome of that debate and those negotiations.  The gap between 165 megatonnes and the argument about whether we get credits for these fuel exports is quite substantial.  It is the difference between 165 megatonnes and 96 megatonnes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second controversy is the pace of economic growth. If the economy leaps ahead, way beyond predictions, then the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will actually increase and all of our assumptions will be skewered.  Similarly, if the economy does not grow at predicted rates, the burden of Kyoto will become even more than it is presently predicted to be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third controversy is in the wild and whacky world of trading emissions.  The genius of Kyoto is that it forces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions into the bottom line.  Every country and every company, one way or another, is going to have to account for the cost of its emissions.  Some will be able to research their way out of the problem by actual emissions reductions, but some will have to trade their way out and purchase credits either domestically or internationally.  This will lead to some bizarre consequences.  Domestically, companies will have to purchase credits from companies that have credits even if that means feeding the competition's bottom line.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good, we might say.  Not always.  Without credits, some companies are simply not viable.  It actually may end up distorting another market by propping up a company that  is otherwise not viable and should have been out of business years ago but survives because it has credits to sell.  How much sense does that make?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, it is even crazier.  Our companies or Canada as a nation will have to go on the open market and buy credits from countries like Russia or Mexico, both of which will have credits to sell even though in the case of Russia it is arguably the most environmentally degraded country in the world.  We also know about Russia's somewhat casual regard for government integrity and the rule of law.  The likelihood is that we will be buying our credits from the Russian mafia to meet our Kyoto requirements.  How much of that money do we  think will actually go to environmental cleanup or the re-industrialization of Russia? Try to explain that to the ladies in the church basement.</p>


	<A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the General Motors representatives were in my office.  I thought they had a fairly enlightened approach, but they also had a very realistic approach. As we know GM is a very important company, both internationally and in the economies of Ontario and Canada. GM will be faced with Kyoto. Of course any company immediately asks what this will cost, what the targets will be and how we will achieve those targets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting of the targets will have to be fairly nuanced. If we set it too high, GM may ask itself why it does not build those trucks or cars in the United States and then ship them back to Canada. If the target is too low then it is business as usual and the goal of Kyoto will not be achieved. It becomes a bit of a bean-counter's delight. If the target is <i>x</i> million dollars, GM can do several things: research and application of the research, which is good; retrofit car factories, which sounds good; move to Michigan, which does not sound so good; get government credits and grants, which can be good or bad; buy credits from the Russian mafia, which is not so good; or buy credits from Mexico, which is not so good either. It is reasonable to expect that GM will act in its own self-interest. Unfortunately, that may or may not coincide with Canada's self-interest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give another example. Suncor is a large company involved in the tar sands. Members may or may not know that Suncor is a large retailer of gasoline in Ontario. It has 16% of the Ontario market. It is also the only retailer in Ontario that ethanolizes its gas. Every litre we buy at a Sunoco station has 10% ethanol in it. For the purposes of emissions that is the equivalent of removing 20,000 cars a day from Ontario's roads.  It is very significant and is something to be pursued because transportation is the second largest source of Ontario's emissions after the pollution from the United States is accounted for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethanolizing fuel is a very attractive idea. We should just ask the farmers, who would love to sell more product to Suncor. It is a win-win situation. It does something for the environment, we have happy farmers, and it is a good alternative technology. But here is where it gets tricky. At the present time Sunoco is able to add its voluntary 10% ethanol because of the forgiveness of excise tax. However, if  we mandate a level of 5% or 2% or whatever, the price of the product will immediately shoot up because refining capacity and resource capacity will have to be created.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result would be that Suncor would have to import more corn from places like Iowa and reduce its voluntary commitment down to the mandated level, i.e.  from 10% down to 5% or 2%, as the case may be. If the mandated level were to be 5% ethanol, for the purposes of emissions that would be the equivalent of Suncor putting 10,000 cars back on the road. So much for good corporate citizenship. Importing from the U.S. to meet our Kyoto requirements is, I am sure we all agree, quite ironic, and putting 10,000 cars back on the road for the purposes of emissions makes no sense at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have indicated that I am an agnostic because frankly I do not know how the concerns of General Motors and Suncor will be addressed. May I emphasize that in both instances they want to be Kyoto compliant? They are very concerned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is that of a chemical based industry in my riding. It does about $1 billion a year in business and accounts for about 500 to 700 employees, with 70% of its product exported. That is not insignificant. The company wants to know how the Kyoto guidelines will apply to it. It is heavily into research and development because, frankly, it costs money to shoot the emissions up through the smokestacks. However, it is getting to the point where cost effective research gains are getting to be more and more difficult to come by. The company is worried that it will have to buy emissions credits. </p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will the company get the money to buy emissions credits?  Presumably from all areas of the company, including the research budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How ironic that research into emissions reductions will be curtailed by the necessity of purchasing credits from the Russian mafia.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to another problem.  All  these companies in my riding are branch offices.  Canada will be the only country in the western hemisphere to be under Kyoto obligations.  It is very difficult to understand how, in the short term at least, that will help with our competitiveness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues think that we can be faster, smarter and cleaner.  I hope they are right.  Unfortunately, corporate Canada's productivity numbers do not support such an optimistic blind faith.  I am still an agnostic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another example.  Members  may or may not be aware that Ontario Hydro is on its way to privatization.  It does seem to be something of shall we say a jerky road, but one thing we know as consumers is that as of last month our bills are a great deal higher.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ontario Hydro basically generates its electricity from four or five sources: hydro, which of course is water and gravity; nuclear; natural gas; coal; and alternative sources.  The cheapest form of electricity obviously is hydro but hydro is limited in Ontario  so there will not be any more significant capacity brought on stream through hydro.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of Kyoto emissions, nuclear power is probably the best alternative because it has no emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>.  However, as we well know, there are other problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-third of OPG's   capacity is due to fossil fuels and that accounts for 7% of Ontario's emissions.    Ontario Hydro is in a very difficult situation because it does need to address the fossil fuels.  It cannot really turn to nuclear as a viable alternative.  Hydro does  not have a greater capacity available to it.  Alternative sources, which we all hope for, such as windmills and things of that nature, can address part of the problem but not nearly all of the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the economic modelling suggests that Canada's economy will be 0.6% smaller in 2012 if Kyoto is adopted. This does not sound like a great deal of money  but it translates into $7.2 billion over 10 years.  In Ontario's case, its economy will be reduced by 0.4%. Members  will have to   pardon  me but I am from Missouri when it comes to economic modelling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance department projections, for instance, going forward one year, are very suspect, let alone 10 year projections.  For instance, the economists that the minister of finance turned to last year to project as to the economic growth in Canada for the year 2002 predicted that Canada's economy would grow between 1.1% and 1.5%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers are almost in and in fact the economy grew at something in the order of 3.3% to 3.5%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Bravo.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John McKay:</b> My hon. colleague says  bravo and we all applaud the strength of the Canadian economy.  Put two economists in a room and we  will probably get three opinions.  It is sort of the same with politicians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the assumptions are necessarily unknowable, particularly with those new technologies that are coming on stream.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, climate change appears to be on us.  The problem is that   Kyoto may not do what Canadians expect it to do, namely, to reduce smog.  It may reduce conditions that create smog  but it will not necessarily reduce smog. This is an economic treaty as much as it is an environmental treaty.  There needs to be a mixture of incentives, credits and tax concerns. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter of the law of unintended consequences prevails in all matters.  It is very hard to produce a clear and precise plan because so many of the variables are unknown.  There is a tremendous upside to this treaty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Prime Minister has done us a great favour and has shown terrific political courage in putting this issue into the Speech from the Throne.   If he had not set this target, I do not think any of us would be here today debating the matter.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I listened   intently to the comments made by the member for Scarborough East and we need to deal with a few things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the U.S. is not going to be involved in this treaty, what effect will that have on our economy? What exactly does non-compliance mean? What is the penalty to a country that does not comply with this treaty?  Regarding the purchase of credits, would it not be better to take the money that is going to be sent outside of Canada to reduce emissions in foreign countries and spend it in Canada and thereby have a Canada made solution to this issue?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-301968"></A><a HREF="#Int-301970"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-301962"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John McKay: </b>

	Madam Speaker, I will answer my colleague's questions in the reverse order.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the purchase of credits is the absolute last thing we want to do.  The last thing we want to purchase is an international credit because the money is gone. Domestically that is not a terrific idea either  but at least the money is staying in the country.  I agree with my colleague on that point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to non-compliance and what it will actually mean, the treaty will mean nothing whatsoever for countries that do not sign. However for those countries that do sign the treaty the non-compliance provision presumably will have some financial penalty to it but I am not aware of what the exact penalty might be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other question  concerned the effect on our economy if the United States did not sign.  As I said in my speech, Canada at this point will be the only country in the western hemisphere that will have signed the treaty. That will create some difficulties for us, although,  interestingly, both Michigan and California are ahead of the federal government and ahead of the Bush administration in terms of expecting Kyoto compliance with respect to a lot of the things they are doing.  It may be Kyoto by the back door rather than Kyoto by the front door.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I note that my hon. colleague dealt with the Kyoto accord  but   I would like to ask him another question with regard to the Speech from the Throne.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference was made in the throne speech   to the possible decriminalization of marijuana.  This would be one of the biggest mistakes Canada could ever make  for our young people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked with  young people.  I took some of them out of the alleyways and brought them into the building in which   I was working.  I talked to 32 young students who told me they were being given marijuana to smoke during their lunch hour.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About  four Christmas Eve's ago a young man came to my door and thanked me for taking him out of the alleyway. He said that if I had not done that for him he would still be on cocaine.  He told me that his mom and dad asked him to thank me. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decriminalizing marijuana would be a very dangerous way to go with our young people.  What does my hon. colleague think about the possible decriminalization of marijuana in Canada?</p>

	Madam Speaker, I certainly expected  to cover a variety of topics   from Kyoto to marijuana.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not had the opportunity to read the report produced by the Senate, nor have I read the report that is being  produced by other colleagues.  Having said that, I am also from Missouri on the point of decriminalization and/or legalization of marijuana.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not overly persuaded that the gains of decriminalization will actually translate into a lesser criminal activity.  It may well be argued that what will actually happen is that low level marijuana will be decriminalized but those involved in organized crime will actually increase the   potency of marijuana  thereby creating a greater addictive effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decriminalization might or might not be part of the answer.  I would like to see the reports and the evidence before I come down firmly on that point.</p>

	Madam Speaker, the hon. member actually gave a sincere presentation in the House with regard to Kyoto and  at least thought it out in terms of the pros and cons.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get to my question, I did note that three times during his presentation he noted  that we would be trading with the Russian mafia.  With all due respect, I was wondering why the Russian mafia was brought up three times and whether   that was where we were moving in terms of trading partners.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to specifically address his   points on Kyoto. He noted that there would be negotiations with regard to green credits and exporting that to the U.S.  Who will  the Prime Minister  negotiate that with seeing that the agreement itself does not call for that?  He has told the international community and    has put his word on the line that he will sign the agreement.  How will he then be able to come back  to this country and say that there might be this clause for green credits?  How does he reconcile that? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the hon. member stand with regard to the agreement?  Will the Prime Minister  turn his back on the promise he made to the   international community or will he introduce new rules that we make up in Canada?  If that is the case, does every country get to make up new rules?  </p>

	Madam Speaker,  on the issue of the Russian mafia, the way the treaty works is that there was a freeze date, which I think is 1990.  The happy circumstance for Russia was that its economy and its industries had collapsed.  For the purposes of Kyoto, it has a huge number of credits to sell, which  will be a valuable market commodity.  We have seen what happens to  valuable market commodities  in Russia.  If people want oil, they  go see this person.  If they want diamonds, they go see that person, et cetera.  Hence my three references   to the Russian mafia.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to green credits, the  member raised an interesting point.  I believe he was referring to the issue of exporting clean fuels and trying to obtain credits for that.  As I said in my speech, there is an enormous gap between 96 and 165.  That is a lot of megatonnes to make up  if in fact the Prime Minister's argument does not work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some respects we should get behind the Prime Minister and try to get those credits, yet at the same time it does seem to be a bit of a disingenuous argument.  </p>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to ask a question of the hon. member who has a degree in law, who is a lawyer and who must give a lot of people a lot of advice, which I hope is good advice in most cases. If any group of people or any business  asked that  gentleman  what he thought about going into this venture, I am sure the first thing he would ask is  “Exactly how do you plan to do it?”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a wise idea to ratify something without a plan on how it will be implemented?  It sounds very strange to me that someone would want to do that.  </p>


	<A NAME="Int-301985"></A><a HREF="#Int-301988"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-301983"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John McKay: </b>

	Madam Speaker, as a practising lawyer I had one rule and one rule only:  Never give away free advice.    I will speak to the hon. member afterward.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raises a good point,  which is  where is the plan.  I say to the hon. member that even if the Prime Minister tabled the plan in Parliament today, it would be highly suspect and for the reasons that  I went into.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Necessarily the economic assumptions and variables are very suspect.  It is very difficult to predict what the economy will be doing next year, let alone alone 5, 10 or 15 years out.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a lot of sympathy with the government in its difficulties in arriving at a plan, arriving at an economic modelling and arriving at an environmental modelling.  Even the environmental sciences are changing as we speak. If we were debating this six months ago, we would be talking  about straight line graphs on environmental degradation.  We are now talking about exponential graphs on environmental degradation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a lot of sympathy with the government trying to wrestle, not only its own head around these issues but also other jurisdictions that have to be brought onside.  I am little more sympathetic to the position that the government finds itself in than possibly the   member on the other side.  </p>

	Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Surrey Central.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to reply to the Speech from the Throne and represent  all  the constituents of Saanich--Gulf Islands.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember why we have a Speech from the Throne. It is  because Canada is a constitutional monarchy, one with a  proud and democratic tradition of elected representation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remain a strong supporter of Her Majesty and her successors. In becoming a member of Parliament I swore an oath of allegiance to the crown.  I take that oath seriously.  I support the monarchy as a strong and positive part of our heritage binding us together as one people. Our constitutional monarchy has changed over the centuries.  It holds relevance and value to everyday Canadians to this day.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance's behaviour during Her Majesty's visit has been a complete disgrace.  Such blatant republicanism from a minister of the crown is reprehensible at the best of times and during a visit from our Queen, it is beyond reproach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apology for his insult came five days too late and was both evasive and insincere.  Canada loves Her Majesty but it is her office we stand for, not just her person.  The finance minister could not support the woman and could not support the throne.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an awful lot not to like  in the throne speech but I will keep my comments limited due to the constraints of time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with Kyoto. I  listened to the member for Scarborough East who  raised significant concerns all through his speech.  I  hope that those concerns will be enough that he cannot support it and he can  convince his colleagues not to as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the throne speech the government promised to ensure a clean water supply and to protect Canada's abundance of potable water but I question its commitment to the promise.  The United Nations estimates that by 2015, 40% of the world's population will have an inadequate supply of drinking water.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world's largest source of drinking water, Canada must be a careful steward.  It is estimated  it could cost anywhere from $27 billion to $30 billion over the next 10 years to ensure a safe and sustainable supply of drinking water in Canada.   Unfortunately the government is also committed to signing the ill-considered Kyoto accord.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike water quality issues, there is considerable scientific uncertainty about the Kyoto accord and whether it would have any effect on preventing global warming.  The costs of Kyoto are estimated anywhere from $40 billion and up and up to 450,000 jobs could be lost.  For a fraction of $40 billion, we could do a lot of environmental good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could ensure Canada's long term needs for drinkable water.  We could be investing in alternative fuel sources and cleaning up harmful particulates in our air and water.  Instead the government wants to score cheap political points through grandiose schemes like Kyoto, which might suit the Prime Minister's legacy but do nothing for Canadians and next to nothing for the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong environmental policy is only possible with a strong fiscal climate.  Kyoto will damage our industry but not rescue our environment.  It is the worst of both worlds.  Working Canadians simply cannot afford to lose $40 billion in such a pointless exercise.  Kyoto will spend money needed to solve real environmental problems with real environmental solutions like water quality and air pollutants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Scarborough East talked about the Russian mafia, buying tax credits and how there is no plan.  He raised a lot of concerns and I agree with those concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we asked  people whether  they wanted us to clean up the air, I am sure  every  member in the House and  virtually every  Canadian would raise their hand.  We must do that but the Kyoto accord is not the way.  I would argue there is a much better way. We should be looking at legislation, which is being completely ignored, to protect things like our potable  water.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue which is  very important is the  softwood lumber dispute and trade. The throne speech says the following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We are better positioned than at any time in the last three decades to seize the opportunities of the global economy and to weather a short term slowing of growth experienced by Canada's major trading partners.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really. Our biggest trading partner is the United States with 85% of our trade, something like $1.5 billion a day. Frankly, we have been anything but successful in competing with it. Throughout the 1990s the productivity gap between Canada and the United States has widened to 19%. In 2001 Canada was only 81% as productive as the United States, down 5% since the government took office. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This productivity gap has caused a decline in our dollar and an overall reduction in our standard of living compared to that of our friends south of us. In 1965 real per capita income was equal to our American friends; now we are 40% behind. We have a Canadian peso thanks to the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. lumber tariffs are costing Canada over $2 billion annually. My home province of British Columbia has been  hit hardest. The government's response has been to give up on our forestry workers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be helping our forestry workers get through these tough times. As we pursue our cases at NAFTA and the WTO, we should be providing forestry companies with loan guarantees. We should be standing behind them just as we stood behind Bombardier and the aerospace industry when it was facing unfair trade practices with Embraer in Brazil.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the major part of the problem is out on the other side of the country in British Columbia, where is our government? It is not there. Instead it has   come up with a plan but  I think it is the wrong plan. Yes, it will help some and there will be some retraining. It is like what we saw with the collapse of the fisheries on the east coast. The government spent $3 billion paying  fishermen to sit at home and wait for the fish to come back instead of looking at the real problem. Again, with the forestry workers the government is   trying to offer a retraining package and juggle some money that is already in some departments, put it back in  and  say people will be  taken out of the forestry industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada can compete. We have some of the best people in the world. We have the talent. We have the resources. We just need government to get off its backside and create an economic climate and provide the legislation. We need a government that will  go to the wall. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need  a Prime Minister that does not sour our relationships with the Americans at every turn  in the road so that we do not lose the favoured trading status with our American friends. Unfortunately, we have a Prime Minister who prefers to poke a stick in the eye of the President of the United States of America every chance he gets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to mention something very important about the military. The military  has served our country so proudly and  admirably, but guess what? It is missing from the throne speech. Regarding the state of our military, the Auditor General has been warning the government for years that our military infrastructure is close to collapse. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our forces fly around in 40-year-old helicopters simply because the government refuses to admit, not that it made a mistake but that for pure political reasons it cancelled the contract. The helicopters needed to be replaced. It was the right thing to do at the time.  Now the contract has been split,    the political masters are interfering on how this procurement should happen and it is turning out to be a disaster again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 443 Helicopter Squadron  is based in my riding in Sydney. These good men and women put their lives on the line for our country. They deserve our support. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance would  commit to an immediate increase of $15 billion  to $20 billion over the next 10 years to address the Canadian Forces structural and personel deficits. The leader of our party has made this point very clear. The Canadian Alliance cares about the lives of our troops and we care about the longevity of the Canadian Forces.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to offer Canadians a different vision than the one that was set out  in the throne speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are looking for practical solutions to the challenges we face, including: lowering our taxes,  not just talking about it or claiming that is the case when there is no real tax reduction on our paycheques; looking at the debt; government waste, which is a huge problem; promoting economic growth and jobs; reforming health care; protecting our sovereignty; and strengthening our families.  These are the values Canadians are looking for. Sadly, our government has failed them in the throne speech.</p>

	Madam Speaker, the hon. member throughout his dissertation mentioned the United States trading practices and what has been happening lately.  Other than softwood lumber, there is  the dumping of steel into the United States. There are ongoing   Wheat Board issues. There are border staff issues with regard to the supply of appropriate people to move the traffic through our communities and to trade expeditiously. As well there is the racial profiling of Canadians who actually have their citizenship in our country and  are practising  in different professions in the United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are  massive subsidies in the United States.  It is competing and taking  auto jobs from Canada by dumping millions of dollars and taking the factories out of our communities.  Softwood tariffs, as the hon. member has noted, are up to 27%, and a number of companies have moved causing a loss of jobs in our communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What specific actions would the hon. member  take to improve the U.S. trade relations with Canada so that these actions would not  happen?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-302011"></A><a HREF="#Int-302013"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-302009"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gary Lunn: </b>

	Madam Speaker, again I  emphasize that 86% of our trade, $1.5  billion  a day, causes our economy to be directly dependent on the United States.   I would start by  creating a good relationship with the U.S. administration, unlike what we see today.  Many people out there who are experts in this matter have said  that our Prime Minister is the absolute worst at Canada-U.S. relations.  It is something we have to work on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there are  unfair trade practices as was mentioned regarding some of the agricultural issues, softwood lumber and the steel file, and there are a lot of them, we need  people who will go down to Washington and fight for Canadians to make sure that we are successful.  Unfortunately it all stems back to the relationship  our Prime Minister has or has not developed with the U.S. administration.  It goes back to the election of the current U.S. administration when the Prime Minister's own nephew was cheering publicly for the Democrats.  It goes on and on from there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  the Prime Minister pokes a stick in the eye of the U.S. administration, one would ask why should it give us the time of day.  The United States  has other countries it can trade with.  It has an excellent relationship that  it is developing with Mexico.  Unless we work at the relationship, unless we fight hard for Canadians but also develop that relationship, there could be   a very serious, long term economic impact on the country and it will all  rest squarely on the shoulders of the  Prime Minister.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am sure the hon. member knows that  in my riding we have the most modern shipyard there is in Canada.  That shipyard built the frigates for our navy.  The shipyard has sat idle now for over two years.  The men that all worked there, and almost 4,000 people were working there, are now on welfare and their hearts are broken.  The government is stating that it wants to purchase or rent ships from another country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member think that we should be building our own ships  right here, not just frigates but all of the ships that we need, for the Coast Guard, for our navy and for our armed forces?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member will also know that we have some of the finest and the most talented shipbuilders anywhere in the world. We can compete.  It is an utter disgrace that the  government would go outside  our sovereign country to  purchase ships.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  government has not done its job not only in procurement for our own shipbuilders but in creating an economic climate where we can be the best in the world and shipping ships all over the world.  Again, it rests squarely on the shoulders of the Prime Minister and his administration.  It is an absolute utter disgrace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shipbuilding industry out on the west coast has also been hampered as it has been in Saint John and there is no need for it.  Again, we have the resources and the talent. We have some of the finest and the best shipwrights  in the world but unfortunately, we have a government that would rather send them a welfare cheque than have them shipping ships all over the world.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I have a question for my colleague on the issue of the Kyoto, to which he and other speakers have referred.   Two per cent  of all greenhouse gases are caused by Canada, but countries causing 65% of greenhouse gases are not even signing on to this accord, notably China, India, the U.S., Mexico and so on.  On the whole issue of buying credits from third world countries and so on, there are proponents of the agreement who have said that this is really more about transferring wealth to third world countries, whether intentional or inadvertent, that this is the whole outcome of the thing. I would appreciate  the member's comment on that.</p>

	Madam Speaker, the whole issue of trading credits is just a bad idea.  The whole agreement is bad.  We have to go 6% below 1990 levels. Big countries like Australia are going 8% above. Countries like Russia are good because of their economic state.  It is just a bad, bad mess. It was ill-considered.  We went there with the objective to just one-up the Americans. When Canadians know the facts about the Kyoto accord they will rise up, I believe very strongly, and tell our Prime Minister what a bad  deal this is. Time will be the test.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This throne speech shows so many empty promises. The Liberal government's so-called legacy seems to be the repackaging of past failures, but one thing I absolutely agree with is that the Prime Minister and the former finance minister seem to be policy soulmates. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government's vision appears to be absolutely unclear and blurred and its priorities are misplaced.  Therefore, the Liberals' ad hoc, unfocused, undisciplined approach to spending will not benefit Canadians. The highest quality of life and economic prosperity can be achieved if spending is applied to those initiatives and Canadians get value for their money. No wonder Canada's relative standard of living has fallen from the fourth highest of OECD countries in 1990 to eighth in the most recent OECD survey.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada taxes are already too high and affect our competitiveness, work effort, productivity, savings and investment.  Health care, defence, agriculture, the environment and many other issues will continue to suffer and be ignored.  Patronage, scandals, corruption, subsidies and pork barrelling will not stop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As official opposition critic on the scrutiny of regulations and in fact the past co-chair of the Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations, I will be dealing with a particular issue.  I believe that the vision of the government and getting its priorities right is related to listening to Canadians and their elected representatives. In other words, we need to implement democratic reforms.  The Canadian Alliance and its predecessor  party have been raising the issue of democratic reform for a very long time. There is too much concentration of power in the Prime Minister's Office and the Privy Council Office.  Our elected dictatorship rules, not governs,  the country. During the last election 68% of Canadians did not approve of the government's vision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to the other issue of parliamentary reform.  The influence, input and the role of Parliament and parliamentarians is diminishing. Free votes in Parliament are very rare.  Efficiency, effectiveness and the work of standing committees are in disarray.  An elected, effective and equal Senate is not in sight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, private members' business is counterproductive.  It continues to be like a pacifier given to quiet a baby.  The baby keeps sucking and nothing comes out of it. Similarly, members of Parliament keep working hard on their private members' business but no meaningful result comes out of it.  The most important job of the 301 members of Parliament in the House and the 105 senators in the Canadian Parliament is to formulate and update legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still Parliament's duty to hold the executive branch of the government accountable, but perhaps only 20% of Canadian law is made in Parliament. The remaining 80% is added through the back door by way of thousands of regulations made by the executive branch of the government. Regulations are neither debated nor subjected to public scrutiny. Many regulations contain matters of policy that are never even debated in parliament. Therefore, in democratic reform, parliamentary reform is an integral part, and in parliamentary reform, regulatory reform is the most important component, which has been ignored for far too long by everyone, including the media.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be many Canadians, including parliamentarians, my colleagues, and the members of the media, who  are not aware of the direct and indirect costs of the regulatory burden,  or what is commonly called red tape. According to  a report, Canadians have to spend $103 billion per year to comply with federal, provincial and municipal regulations. That is 12% of our GDP or $13,700 per household, an expense second only to shelter. This cost exceeds total personal and corporate income taxes collected by the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red tape is hidden taxes and is a costly impediment to productivity and growth. In addition to restricting people's freedom to make their own choices, rules and regulations dampen innovation, discourage investment, stifle entrepreneurship, weaken competitiveness, curtail jobs and lower the standard of living. According to a Canadian Federation of Independent Business survey, businesses believe that government regulations have had a negative impact on their ability to run a profitable and productive operation, with 66% of respondents saying they felt that it was the federal government's fault.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and Nova Scotia already have  recognized this limitation in our democracy and have been working hard on moving from red tape to smart tape, and from smart tape to smart government. They have eliminated duplicate, expired and counterproductive regulations. Countries like Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, New Zealand and France already are on the path to regulatory reform. It is the federal Liberal government that is lagging light years behind other jurisdictions. Scrutiny of regulations is thus an essential task in protecting democracy, restoring transparency and legitimacy, and controlling bureaucracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reintroduced my private member's bill, Bill C-202, an act to amend the Statutory Instruments Act, calling on the House to give the disallowance procedure for regulations a statutory footing. It is a votable bill, a non-partisan issue and a necessity, and many members from all parties enthusiastically support it. It was even seconded by a colleague from the Liberal side of the House. I have raised this issue of regulatory reform on many occasions both in the House and outside. The Speech from the Throne briefly mentioned it and I am waiting to see what action the government will take and how soon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me suggest or recommend the following to the Prime Minister for his to do list. Draft regulations and other statutory instruments should be tabled along with legislation and debated in the House. They should also be referred to the appropriate standing committee of the House. The realistic alternatives to regulations, such as negotiated compliance, should be explored. The focus of regulations should be results-based outcomes. Regulations should be written in transparent, simple, clear and easy to understand language.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost benefit analysis should be done and published. The regulatory process should be harmonized within various departments as well as with other jurisdictions, including with provincial and municipal governments, for example, environment, fisheries, agriculture, health, labour and transport. Regulatory proposals must include a sunset clause or performance review. Public awareness, consultation and input should be encouraged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my time is limited, I will go over a few more recommendations. No international regulatory commitments should be entered into without careful regulatory impact analysis to ensure that international proposals are in tune with Canada's interests, for example, the Kyoto protocol.  Many times penalties are too low, for example, in relation to the proceeds of crime. Sometimes that nullifies the effects of imposing those regulations in the first place. Canada should introduce a regulatory flexibility act, similar to that of the United States.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many recommendations, probably 20 more.  Since my time is over, I would like to conclude that I regret that the address to Her Excellency has recycled an empty vision, has restored to grandiose rhetoric and  intends to implement expensive programs at the cost of Canadians looking for practical solutions to challenges we face, including democratic, parliamentary and regulatory reforms among others.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Oak Ridges.  Since I am likely to get carried away, I am sure Madam Speaker will bring my attention to the limits so that I do not deny time to my colleague.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to acknowledge and commend the government on a number of things that have been identified in the throne speech,   I do not intend the list to be exhaustive,  and I would like to touch in particular on some that are very important to me.  I also will, at the end, want to bring the attention of the government to the limitations in the throne speech and some of the things that I would like the government to consider between now and next February, when I assume we will see a budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the area of R and D and learning and innovation, I welcome the increase in funding for the granting agencies, although I would bring attention to the fact that there is a need for more research in the social sciences.  The social scientists have lagged behind the NSERC  and the Medical Research Council, now the CIHR, in the past.  I would like to see that remedied as the government attends to reacting to that part of the throne speech before February.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the reference to literacy.  I support the proposal of the National Science Centres Association to establish a federal program for science centres so that we can encourage kids to be more interested academically at an early age.  We have a science centre in Fredericton that is a very useful tool in the community and is deserving of federal support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight an issue that is very important to me, and that is access to post-secondary education.  There is reference to learning, as I said, in the throne speech, but I would like to the money in scholarship program enhanced.  Right now it deals with approximately 10% of students.  It simply does not do enough to ensure  that young people who have the credentials to go to post-secondary education can do that on an equity level.   At the same time it will deny the nation of some of the best minds on the prosperity level.  The universities should have a share in the debate around the CHST, which I will speak to around health care in moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reference in the throne speech to the indirect cost program that was introduced in the last budget.  It is very important to small and medium sized universities across the country.  It deals with the fact that most of our programs require matching funds and not all institutions or regions are allowed to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care is mentioned, and I welcome that.  The increased long term funding to the provinces on health care, first ministers meetings and reforming the system are all important.  They have had a number of forums in my constituency on the subject.  However  I think the federal government has to command of the provinces in return for that certain things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see support at both levels of government for a third party audit of some kind so that we can get away from the finger pointing and the backing and forthing on the politics of this and allow the Canadian public to be represented by an impartial third party who can say that the feds are or are not doing enough or  the provinces are or  not doing enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the commitment on aboriginal issues.  We need to work up a new, more respectful relationship with the first nations and the aboriginal peoples of Canada. In the meantime, while we do that, we have to recognize there are serious social problems across the country for our first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the reference to the importance of environmental issues.  I will be supporting the ratification of Kyoto. I welcome the reference to cleaning up some of the heavily polluted sites in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see my colleague from Sydney paying particular attention to this item.  I congratulate him for everything he has done, in terms of the cleaning up the city tar ponds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the infrastructure program, I like the idea that the infrastructure program will be longer term and more predictable. I would urge the government to include both universities and heritage and cultural sites as part of that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Canada's place in the world, I welcome the doubling of development funds by 2010, half of which would go to Africa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the international and defence policy review, but this leads me to the weaknesses in the throne speech, as I see them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that we can afford to wait until that review is over before we increase the national defence budget. I have a large military base in my constituency. I deal with the men and women who represent this country well.</p>


	<A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all stand up here all the time to talk about that. It is time for us all to recognize it in terms of an increase in the budget. The largest impact is on the men and women who represent us. They are being deployed too often because the size of national defence is shrinking. The reality is that we are not giving back as much as they are giving us and it is time that changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support my colleague, the chair of the defence committee, for all the work he has done and all the interventions he has made. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see us do more for Canadians with disabilities.The disability tax credit is the subject  of considerable discussion around this place right now. The government has to rethink its position on that review and it has to do it immediately. Not only that, but the disability tax credit should be refundable. The idea that one has to have earned income to be eligible for a credit that is supposed to recognize the cost of dealing with a disability  means that the people who are at the lowest end socially and economically, those who do not earn an income or a taxable income, do not have access to a credit that is supposed to be for people who have to deal with a disability. That is quite unfortunate and it needs to be remedied. I suppose, given the debate  taking place around the disability tax credit, this is as good a time as any to remedy that problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to see more support for the CBC. Right now, as the globe is shrinking, we being pressured from around the world in the context of other influences in terms of how we see ourselves. I like that. It is important that we see ourselves as citizens of the planet and international people, but at the same time I want to hear about us. I want to see about us. I want to know about all parts of the country. As those pressures increase, I think we have to do more from within to ensure that we understand each other as Canadians. I would like to condition my support for an increase however in a more sensitive treatment of the regions by CBC television in particular. My position on that is well known.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to see more commitment to regional economic development. There is a lot of reference in the throne speech to the fact that one of its intentions in terms of the Canada we want is to deal with the gaps that exist in Canada between those who are prosperous and those who are not. Some of that has to do with aboriginal Canadians versus the rest of Canada. Some of that has to do with Canadians with disabilities. I mentioned that. A lot of it has to do with ensuring that everybody has access to the education that their capacities and capabilities warrant, and I speak to that. However it also has to do with where we live. I will give an example by going back to the indirect cost program at universities to illustrate this example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a good program in the Canadian Foundation for Innovation. It is very important to universities in Canada. It is very important to R and D in Canada. However it will only go as far as 40% of the research project. If one lives in Alberta, as does my friend from Wild Rose does, the reality is that  it is much easier for that province and the private sector to come up with the 60% that allows the University of Alberta, for example,  to access the Canadian Foundation for Innovation as compared to the province of New Brunswick in terms of the private sector and the capacity of the provincial government, to be fair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to see us get rid of matching funds programs. They are important for the country. However, if knowledge is the future of the economic development in this country and innovation, and I believe it is, we need to put programs in place to ensure people will have access to those programs and opportunities regardless of where they live, or where they choose to go to university or where they do their research. That will require more investment in regional economic development kinds of initiatives. It is not stuff that goes back 20 and 30 years. It is research. It is pure. It will mean that we will take our place in Canada. I would very much like to see the national government do more on that front.</p>

	Madam Speaker,  a lot of things the member said we are certainly thinking about, but I really wonder from where he is coming. What track is he at with making statements that apparently did not seem to make any difference in the past and why  we would want to continue that trail?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking particularly of his comments about how pleased we are that the help to Africa will be doubled, and I am sure that is in terms of dollars, yet we have done this year after year for many years.  The member knows, as well as I do, that the problem is no better now that it has been for a long time; the tragedies that are taking place in these countries and the starvation.  Yet we have one sector of people who are called the elite who fill their palaces with gold, their Swiss accounts with money, but these countries still have the starving.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask the member my first question and then a quick one after.  Does he not agree that there is not a poverty or rich and poor deficit in these countries?  There is a democracy deficit and until they get true democracy and rid themselves of tyrants and dictators, how is it ever going to change; with more dollars?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when we talk about the difference between some who prosper and some who do not in Canada,  right now we have a group of farmers in my region who are not prospering. In fact they are losing their farms.  There are bankruptcies as a result of the drought.  I did not see the government step forward to the plate with any significant help in terms of this disaster as it has in other disastrous situations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having  been part of the justice system as solicitor general in the past,  in the member's view is it right that farmers in  half of the country go to jail if they sell their grain across the border without a Wheat Board permit when farmers in the other half of the country can sell their grain without a permit?  Does that sound fair?</p>


	<A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	Mr.  Speaker, with respect to the member for Wild Rose, I could not disagree with him more on foreign aid and Canada's responsibilities. I recognize it is a difference of opinion but I believe that we are a prosperous country and I believe that much of our good fortune has been good fortune.  That compels us to be citizens of the world and recognize that we have obligations to people who are less fortunate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of  farm aid, I think my colleague had it whispered in my ear that we had not done enough.  He also mentioned also  $5 billion. Therefore the reference to nothing is somewhat lacking in credibility when we talk about those kinds of numbers.  It may not be enough but I do not think we can refer to it as zero.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for whether certain things having to do with the Wheat Board constitute criminality or not, notwithstanding the hon. member's reference to my former vocation, I do not think I ever had to deal with those issues and I do not feel particularly equipped to deal with this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I recognize the member's opinion, but I really believe as Canadians that we do not do near enough internationally in terms of our privileged position on this planet and I do not think I could have my mind changed on that.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-302032"></A><a HREF="#Int-302034"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-302030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank my colleague in the governing party, the member for Fredericton, for his comments and recognize that he was somewhat critical of the throne speech.  It was nice to see a member from that side of the House have the gumption to speak out on what he believes to be failures within that speech.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned the lack of support for the CBC.  I know in the past few days we heard of appointments to CBC by someone whom we felt would probably undermine CBC, if not set it up for further problems. It is good to hear that there is a member on the other side who is willing to push for greater support for the CBC, as well as regional support for CBC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is without question one of the greatest ties the country has had to bring us together.  From the time that we were young people on the Prairies, we grew up respecting the culture and heritage of eastern Canada from numerous programs that we watched throughout the year as well as programs from the west coast.   I think CBC was as much to Canada as was the railroad. It is crucially important that we continue to recognize that. As we grow as a country it is beneficial to have CBC there as part of that growth.  I just want to congratulate him on  his comments.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on  the Speech from the Throne, which outlines the objectives  the government has for the coming years.  We have to keep in mind that the real flesh, the real detail  is in the budget. I will be concentrating my remarks on two areas, on competitive cities and on children and families, which are very important to the  constituents of Oak Ridges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extremely important to remember that the government is committed to balanced budgets or better;  to disciplined spending;  to a declining debt to GDP ratio; and fair and competitive taxes.  We are not on the cusp of  spending money we do not have.  We are not in the process of doing the things that some  colleagues on the other side would suggest  we might do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal responsibility is critical in any government.  Having  come out of that deep $42.5 billion debt that we saw over the years, the government does not intend to go back into it, no matter how much some members on the other side might suggest that we are going to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need some strong fiscal anchors and we have them.  For example, in Canada the GDP growth averaged 5.3% in the first half of this year.  In the United States real GDP grew by 3.1%.  With respect to employment, over the first eight months the Canadian economy grew by 386,000 new jobs, while  U.S. employment remains down 40,000 jobs since December 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On net foreign indebtedness, we are the only G-7 country paying down the national debt. We paid over $40 billion on the national debt over the last four years.  This is something that is very important for members to keep in mind.  The fact that Canada is the only G-7 state to be paying down the national debt at over $40 billion is a real accomplishment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's net foreign debt as a share of GDP is down to its lowest level since the 1950s, from a peak of 44% of the GDP in 1993 to 19% last year.  In contrast, U.S. net foreign debt has been increasing since the early 1990s and recently surpassed the Canadian level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should not take only my word for it; they should take it from the OECD.  The OECD has come out with another report card.  It indicates very clearly that Canada is doing extremely well in many fronts economically in terms of our openness to trade and in terms of our macro policies. We are a leader in the OECD, which is extremely important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Myron Thompson:</b> Nonsense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</b>  A member opposite says it is nonsense.  Unfortunately, the member probably has not  read the OECD report and of course it is nonsense if it is something he has not read.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at other issues.  When we want to have strong fiscal anchors, private sector economists expect Canadian growth will average 3.5% this year compared to our friends south of the border where it looks like it will be about 2.3%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that we will lead the G-7 in economic growth this year and next.  This is an important legacy.  The opposition talks a lot about a legacy.  The most important legacy under the Prime Minister has been the economic record of getting the fiscal house in order.  I know my colleagues would agree that  is what is extremely important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding  the debt,   the fact is that by paying down the national debt, we save between $2.5 billion and $3 billion a year on interest, this year, next year and every other year.  Why is that important?  It gives us the opportunity to deal with some of the urban issues, rural issues, social issues, family issues in this country because the government has been fiscally responsible.  That is something Canadians appreciate.  That is something Canadians expect their government to do and we are doing it.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two areas I want to touch on briefly.  One is  with regard to urban areas, an area of particular concern to me. I   live in a very fast growing area of Ontario, an area where there is a lot of congestion and development.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years I have spoken out very strongly about the need for a solid partnership of all orders of government and the private sector with regard to urban issues.  When I was president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities I talked about the need for a 10-year program for urban infrastructure.  In fact my good friend from Saint John was there with me.  She also supported that and I know she is pleased to see that in the Speech from the Throne.  The fact is the government has delivered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that between 1993 when this government came in and 2000, the government funded over 21,000 projects with over $15 billion in urban infrastructure along with our provincial, municipal and private sector partners.  This is a major accomplishment. When there is a hole in the roof and it is not repaired, it gets bigger and the same is true with urban infrastructure.  If we do not deal with it today, it is going to get worse.  We have been responsible in working with our partners to deal with that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have announced $2 billion in major strategic infrastructure projects  dealing with sewer, water treatment and  local transportation. These are very important.  The Speech from the Throne recognizes that.  That is why there is a 10-year program for infrastructure,  to accommodate long term infrastructure needs.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping  our urban communities respond in a fiscally responsible manner is important. It is important that we have cities that are safe, efficient and environmentally friendly. That is what the government is doing in helping to reduce congestion in our cities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extending investments in affordable housing is extremely important.  It is another area where the government is stepping up to the plate and doing its part. It is an important signal in the Speech from the Throne.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extending the supporting communities partnership initiative is something that cities have said is extremely important to them.  The government has listened and responded accordingly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not recognize my good friend the Minister of Labour and her tremendous work on the homeless file. Our  government came up with the necessary dollars to assist communities across the country in dealing with the homeless issue, knowing that we alone could not solve it, but in partnership.   In the Speech from the Throne  we talk about partnership and helping Canadians help themselves. This is all in the context of the strong fiscal anchors that I have outlined.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian families are looking to the government.  Families  sometimes need the tools to care for family members.  We are an aging society.  There are  family members who are getting older and responding to that issue is important.  The government has recognized that in the Speech from the Throne.  The government will continue to increase its support for families.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important policy initiatives is the issue dealing with the child tax benefit.  This  is very important.  The family will benefit by more than $2,500 for the first child in 2004. We had an early childhood agreement with the provinces and territories. Again we are working in partnership. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not policies or programs that we are pushing on people.  We are working and  listening, and by listening we are able to develop these important programs.  There is the Canada prenatal nutrition program with $27 million to help pregnant women at risk.  Again, this is a very important program.  We want to make sure we have strong families.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should not leave out tax cuts. We brought in the largest tax cuts in Canadian history, over $100 billion.  This year alone we are seeing a $20 billion cut  by the government.  It shows that we are responding. We are bringing down corporate taxes. We are bringing down  income taxes.  At the same time we are responding to the social needs. A nation is not just a balance sheet of figures; it is about real people and real needs.  We can be proud as a government in responding in that way.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I just heard.  Somebody sitting behind the hon. member should give him a slap on the side of the head and wake him up to reality. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member had the audacity to say  it  is such a frugal government that it does not waste money. Boy oh boy, I guess he did not read the Auditor General's report about the billions of dollars of waste.  I could name a whole pile of things starting with the billion dollar boondoggle in whatever  department it was.  I am sure the hon. member would like this one. I do not know if he  is a senior yet, but a committee was struck and was paid $165,000 to study  seniors and sexuality.   My gosh it makes me feel good being an old boy that the government would pour money into something like that. And the member says the government has not wasted money.  What a bunch of utter nonsense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard today that shipyards have been closed and people have been thrown out of work.  Then the government  buys ships that will not float from some foreign country but that is not a waste of money.   People were thrown out of work.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on after a speech like that which  absolutely amazed me.  The government would not have balanced anything had it not cut the transfer payments to the provinces so severely that every province today is suffering while trying to deliver health care.  Those members do not have the guts--</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if I heard any questions, but I did hear a lot of ranting.  Let me see if I can respond at least in part to what I consider to be absolute nonsense from the member. He should know better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I never suggested anything about waste.  Obviously every government has to be accountable. One of the ways we are accountable is through the Auditor General.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our good friend across the way mentioned money being wasted.  When governments are held accountable, they respond. They say, “We had some shortcomings and we are responding”. The Auditor General said that in many cases.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate to hear about a billion dollar boondoggle.  It is utter nonsense.  There was not a billion dollar boondoggle and the member knows that.  Yes, there was a bad paper trail. Yes, there was bad accounting.  Yes, we had to do better.  The minister has responded in kind.  In fact, the Auditor General said so, but the member does not want to say that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the issue of health care is concerned, I have heard this argument from the member and other members before.  I want to set the record straight.  The provinces have the same taxing ability as we do.  The province of Ontario cut taxes, which is its right, but at the same time it  turned around and told this government it wanted more money for health care.  It is about priorities.  If the province's   priority is tax cuts, then more power to it; but if it is health care, then make it health care.  Do not make it both.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member  said that we are not spending money on health care.   In September 2000 the Prime Minister, who held no gun to anyone's head, received agreement from all the premiers. They said they wanted <i>x</i> number of dollars, and were handed $21 billion plus for health care.  They said that was what they needed.  The ink was not yet dry and suddenly early Alzheimer's set in.  The provinces claimed not to remember any of this and said  they needed more money.  Why?  Because they had money sitting in a bank in downtown Toronto. The Quebec government, the Ontario government, and the British Columbia government demanded more money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has said  it supports a strong health care system.  We will hear from Romanow and we will respond to Romanow.  The Prime Minister has said  there will be a first ministers conference early in the new year to put the system right in terms of the future.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national round table on health said a few years ago that health care is not just about money.   It is about how money is spent. What  we need in health care, and which the member did not mention, is  transparency and accountability.  When I give money to somebody, I would like to have it accounted for.  I would like to know where the money went.  Maybe that is what we should say to the province of Alberta.  Maybe that is what we should say to the province of British Columbia.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today, on behalf of my constituents in the riding of Jonquière, and to take part in the debate in reply to the Speech from the Throne. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is October 9, 2002. The Speech from the Throne was read nine days ago on September 30.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the commentators,  English or French speaking, said that this September 30 Speech from the Throne was a mixture of old ideas. It is a patchwork assortment of ideas taken from the throne speeches of 1993, 1997, 2000 and 2001. Once again, the government of the Prime Minister has promised to  take action on poverty and social housing. Unfortunately, the result is more and more negative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be said about child poverty? In 1999, we had almost 950,000 poor children in this country, while we had only 800,000 in 1989. Hence, this Liberal government did not take action. It is a failure across the board. Yet, in 1989, a unanimous resolution by all political parties was passed here in the House of Commons, saying that they were committed to eliminating child poverty by 1999, that is 10 years later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in the Speech from the Throne, another project has been proposed for Canadians. The Speech from the Throne said that we must “—ensure that no Canadian child suffers the debilitating effects of poverty. Canadians and their governments have already taken significant steps in this direction”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Speech from the Throne rehashes old ideas. The people of Jonquière I met with last weekend realize that this government is laughing at them. They listen to  the news, they read all the information and they say to themselves, “What they are saying makes no sense. We know there are more poor children. They have done nothing for poor children”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to social housing, there has been nothing but inaction since 1993: no investments in social housing since 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the environment, the government promised that we would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% from 1990 levels. That was supposed to be done by 2012. According to the Minister of Natural Resources, we have increased our greenhouse gas emissions by 35% since 1990. Inaction and failure across the board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to health care, I just listened to the Liberal member's remarks.  As far as I am concerned, he is totally out of touch or is blinded by rage and can only see part of what is going on in that sector. The federal government is now putting in only 14 cents on every dollar. In the throne speech, it promised to convene a health ministers summit early in 2003 to lay the foundation for a comprehensive plan for reform. As we know, these are the same Liberals who made massive cuts in transfers to the provinces for health upon taking office in 1993. They will have waited 10 years and suffocated the provinces before taking action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that, in return for the financial contribution it will make to the provinces in early 2003, Ottawa will give itself a free hand in deciding what the provinces should do in health care, when the whole area of health is a provincial jurisdiction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the throne speech, the government also promised to put money into infrastructure. In 2000, there was a Canada-Québec infrastructure program, and $1.6 billion was earmarked for the infrastructure program. It is well known how popular the program has been. </p>


	<A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three parts of this federal-provincial agreement concerning infrastructure, the Quebec government received applications totalling $4.3 billion. This means that there is a shortfall of $3 billion to carry out all the projects submitted, and the Quebec government    had to review all them, which it did very professionally, while determining which were the most important ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, instead of innovating, instead of creating new infrastructure projects in conjunction with the municipalities and perhaps looking after the provinces, this government says it will look after Canada's major cities. Why always major Canadian cities? The mayor of the major city in my region, Saguenay, says that it ranks sixth among Quebec's municipalities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why target only major cities like Vancouver, Montreal or Toronto? There are still applications totalling $3 billion on the table. If the government is serious about taking action, it should immediately put money on the table. Quebec said it was prepared to follow suit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, in the budget tabled by  Ms. Marois, Quebec injected $500 million to allow municipalities faced with water problems   to act quickly, should their projects not qualify under the Canada-Quebec infrastructure program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of reinventing the wheel, this government should put money on the table. We do not have to ask for projects. The projects are there, they have been examined and they are awaiting funding. Immediate action is required. With this program, I would see that they want to do something, that they are prepared to take immediate action. But after what we heard in the throne speech, I realize that this government is still saying “Perhaps;  perhaps we will take action; perhaps we will do this”. What the government should do is take concrete measures. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also talk about what they promised to do for public transit. During the last parliamentary session, I introduced a bill about which there was a consensus: the federation of urban carriers, the Canadian federation of urban carriers and the ACTU in the Outaouais region all supported this initiative. My bill went through second reading. It provided for a subsidy to public transit users.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was reviewed by the Standing Committee on Finance, Liberal members decided that my bill did not make sense. This is strange, because what is the Prime Minister of Canada doing six months later? He is going along the same lines as what is proposed in my bill and saying that everyone should contribute to improving public transit in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Liberals not take action when an opposition member made a similar proposal? Six months have gone by. During these six months, a lot could have been done to promote environmental issues, such as the plight of the increasing number of young Canadians who are suffering from asthma.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize that this government is making meaningless commitments, saying perhaps. It says, “Perhaps we will take action. Perhaps we will do something”. The Liberals are always right. They never take into consideration the proposals made by others. This is strange. We too were elected by voters who have common sense. They too have good ideas. In a democracy, one cannot always be on the side of power. It is very good for a democracy to have opposition parties. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition members are intelligent, maybe more than those who are in office. We, opposition members, propose concrete measures to help society move forward, but because these ideas come from the opposition, the government thinks they cannot work. This is sad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Prime Minister Chrétien, the Prime Minister of Canada, is proposing in the throne speech is to promote public transit.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I meant to say the Prime Minister of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of my constituents from the riding of Jonquière asked me how much this cost, referring to the ceremonies surrounding the Speech from the Throne, everything that goes on that day and the next day, when there is a great celebration at Rideau Hall.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not give them a precise answer, but I told them that it certainly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and that the breakfast club in Quebec would have been very happy to get this money to serve breakfast to children who go to school on an empty stomach because they do not have milk, bread, butter  and fruit at home. I think that this money would have helped meet the needs of our children and of the breakfast club for several months. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows how unreal what is going on right now in Ottawa is. The government is totally out of touch  with reality. More and more children are living in poverty, and the need for social housing is increasing. We also need more money for health care.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal who spoke just now said, “It's not true, there is no shortage of funding for health.  The provincial governments have even got money hidden away”.   But that is not true, as the Romanow report will tell us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All reports that have been tabled in recent months, along with the one that will be forthcoming once the Romanow commission report is finished, are going to say that health funding is lacking.  Who has forgotten to put in its share? Always the same ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us keep in mind that close to 40% of Quebec's budget is earmarked for health.  So who is the one who forgot to pay into it?  Again, the same government that is accusing the provinces of bad management.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have only to look at what is going on as far as fiscal imbalance is concerned. There was unanimity in the National Assembly, from provincial Liberals, ADQ and PQ alike, that there is fiscal imbalance in Canada.  Then there was the premiers' meeting , where it was also said that there was a fiscal imbalance in Canada.  In the past two days, the Government of Quebec has called together all those concerned directly or less directly by the potential effects of this fiscal imbalance, the civil community.  They too have agreed that such an imbalance does exist.  The only ones who deny this are the members of the Liberal Party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feds have the money, and the provinces have the needs. Even the Conference Board—which I cannot imagine to be in favour of Quebec sovereignty or of breaking Canada up, or to hold any grudge against the federal government—says the same, and yet no reference was made to it in the throne speech. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing to look after themselves, but they are saying that they want what is best for Canadians.  If we look at the Speech from the Throne, we see they do not want what is good for Canadians, but what is good for the Liberals, the great Liberal vision, and the vision for Canadians is unimportant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance said that Quebec has only to close its embassies abroad. I have taken part in international parliamentary meetings with people from Canada. There are nine English provinces and one French province in Canada and I did not hear many people praising the virtues of what is happening in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I think it is our right. We are a distinct society and we have the right, outside of Quebec, to promote Quebec and to say who we are. I think that what the Minister of Finance said is an insult to the intelligence of Quebeckers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Speech from the Throne is a dull, insipid, flavourless and colourless speech. Fortunately the Prime Minister had appointed a new Governor General, if the former Governor General were still there, he would have said, “It seems to me I have already read this Speech from the Throne”. He read it in 1993, 1997, 2000 and again in 2001.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Prime Minister of Canada did a cut and paste job on the computer, he cut and pasted it. That is what he did. He took parts of the speeches from 1993, 1997 and 2000 and only changed some of the wording.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these and many other reasons, this Speech from the Throne does nothing for Canadian society. I think that the Prime Minister will not come out of this as a winner. Journalists are saying it, and everyone is saying it: the legacy of this Prime Minister is not very edifying. </p>

There was a consensus in my region. We managed to get this government moving. For so long, it was promising to take action, it would make us false promises and it would say “perhaps” or “this is a provincial jurisdiction”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the region and the members of the opposition here in the House of Commons have done their job. They have demanded their due.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always say that the regions are the poor children of this system. The Liberals are always saying “We are helping the regions”. But they are not referring to regions such as ours. In Canada, there are five major regions. They are not sub-regions such as Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. The Liberals are currently involved in the race for the leadership of their party. The former Minister of Finance came to the Gaspé Peninsula to say that his priority was for regions such as the Gaspé Peninsula. Honestly. They should stop having us on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With highway 175, we have succeeded because everybody stood up. We confronted this government. We told it “You made promises; now it is time to deliver”. Everybody pulled together and there was unanimity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to have contributed to the achievement of this project and I am proud that my region is coming out a winner. Together, we believed in it and, together, we got it. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened to what my hon. colleague had to say and I had a bit of a chuckle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some speeches are kind of special. The expression “cut and paste” was used. Listening to the hon. member, I think that if anyone has cut and pasted something, it must be her. Every  time I listen to her speeches, I seem to hear the same old thing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we could easily predict what she is going to say several years down the road.  She does not do much besides complaining. If the people in her riding are getting fed up, imagine how the people from my riding who are watching us feel. They are fed up with all that complaining and are eager for us to start building something.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the most recent throne speech, the Liberal Party showed that we want to start building. I think Quebeckers rely on us to build this country, as evidenced by the fact that support for the Bloc Quebecois is starting to slip in the polls, instead of increasing. It is now down to only 34% of the vote. Quebeckers have affirmed their belief in the Liberal Party. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague talked about a contribution of 4%, or 4 cents for every dollar spent on health. The figures I have are completely different. So, I would like her to tell us how she came up with 4%. She should back up what she says instead of babbling on all the time. My figures tell a completely different story. Can she explain how she came up with that 4%?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-302069"></A><a HREF="#Int-302072"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-302066"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will gladly answer the question. That member has nothing to say. I say what the people in my riding say. I am the voice of my constituents. That is what they think of this government. I never said 4%. I said 14%, which means 14 cents on each dollar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the member mentioned polls. The last federal election was in 2000. I would ask him what new measure can be found in this Speech from the Throne with regard to employment insurance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People can say whatever they want, but we must tell the truth if we want to make any progress. Right now,  on the issue of employment insurance, it must be said that the government is putting the money in its pocket. It took $44 billion from the surplus in the EI fund to eliminate the deficit. These are the facts. This is not unfounded criticism. These are the facts. If the member does not want to hear the facts, why does he come to the House of Commons? Why does he not stay home?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to make any progress, we have to tell voters in Canada and in Quebec, “These are the facts. This is what they did with your money, and you are not getting it back”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same thing with health care. The Liberals grab our money and we only get 14% back. These are the facts. They made the commitment to finance 50% of the costs, and they are now at 14%. Does the member not see those figures? If he does not, I can send him all the figures that were mentioned in the newspapers in the last few years. These are the facts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This throne speech should have contained measures to improve the employment insurance plan, to help the unemployed and to give them access to employment insurance. It should also have contained concrete measures to help regions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there in this Speech from the Throne? Nothing. It is a rehash of what we heard in 1993, 1997, 2000 and 2001. That is what we have here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Liberals do something right, I do not hesitate to say so. However, do they ever tell PQ members and Bloc members that they have done something right? I have never heard them say that.  It is easy to see the mote in someone else's eye and not the beam in one own's eye. These are the facts. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I   thank my hon. colleague from Jonquière for giving me five minutes of her time.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Speech from the Throne was given I think   most Canadians were very disturbed and disappointed, mostly because the government left out our military.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had hoped and expected that the Prime Minister would have taken into account the pleas of our international allies, the Secretary-General of NATO, the Conference of Defence Associations, the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs, the Auditor General and the countless men and women in uniform who have made the case that our military is in need of financial assistance.  All of them have  come forth in the last four years saying that it is time for the government to put some money into the military.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just have to look at what happened a year ago in the U.S.A.  When the terrorists struck there  were we prepared?  No.  When we sent our men over to Afghanistan  they had to be airlifted by the Americans.  They had to eat their meals at the American mess.  If our men were out training and the mess was closed they had nothing to eat.  I was getting calls   from the parents of the  young men who were sent over there.  They did not even have their uniforms like the rest of them had.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at us today, Mr. Speaker.  Look at the Sea Kings.  They are 40 years old.  A pilot from just   outside my city lost his life.  His father called me because he had been a pilot.  He said “Elsie, I flew those Sea Kings.  Those Sea Kings should not be in the air”.  They should not be in the air.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that it is  strictly politics.  I can see politics being played by the government in the replacement of the Sea Kings.  It wants to wait until the Prime Minister retires and then he will  not have to worry whether  the EH-101s become the replacement.    However, while the government waits more lives will be lost.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at our submarines.  My God, we went out and bought used submarines.  What happened? Just in the past month in London, England   our Canadian people were ask to go over to England   and test  the submarine.    They were fixing it over there.  The men said that there was no way they would go out and test the submarine  because it was not safe.  It is still sitting over there because the men will  not go out in that submarine.  We have just wasted another $800 million on submarines that are now not useful and not  good for the navy.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at our air force and the numbers in the army.  At one time we had 85,000 people.     Where are we now?  We are at around 30,000 people.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b> It's shameful.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:  </b>It is shameful.     We have a lot to worry about in view of what happened   in the U.S.A.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at President Bush, what is our stand on Iraq?  I know we have had and will  have some debate here  but what is our stand on Iraq?  Where are we?  If Bush goes to war with Iraq  where is Canada?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Bulgaria with the NATO committee and  up on the big screen came the representative of the United Nations who said that Canada had to put some money into its military for it was down at the lowest end of the scale.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>It's embarrassing.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:  </b>Yes, it is embarrassing.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those men and women cannot come up here and protest.  They cannot say a word.  They have tried.  I have talked to them personally and privately and they are  truly worried.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Prime Minister wanted to leave in February 2004 and he wanted to leave a legacy, he could have left the best legacy for him and for the government than any other government by putting   the needed billions of dollars into the throne speech so that our   men and women would be looked after and so that they would have  the tools they needed to look after us, our  children, our grandchildren and everybody else in Canada. It is a serious situation and one  we must address.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I just want  to take a minute to thank the hon. member for stressing   the feelings of literally thousands and millions of Canadians for the disgrace we have put upon our military.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a son in the United States military.  He lives on base now and   pays $300 a month rent.  He had to live off base for a time and he had to pay $700 a month  but the government subsidized the difference and gave him a living allowance.  Today there was an announcement that our military's rent  on the bases was being raised to $840, or something like that, to match the rents  in the civilian community in order  to make them compatible.  That is what the minister said.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member agree with me that we have a government with only one mission in mind and that is to get its grubby hands on every single dollar it can from Canadians, including our military, and to heck with the results?  </p>


	<A NAME="Int-302080"></A><a HREF="#Int-302084"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-302077"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member for his question.  I had the distinct pleasure of going to British Columbia.  While I was there I went to the naval base. They took me there to show me the houses and the living conditions of those men and women.  It was pitiful.  Do members know that they were going to the food bank with their children?  And here is the government saying to them that it is going to raise their rent. The same thing has happened over in Nova Scotia.  I was over there as well, at the base, where people there said “We live in quarters here that are not fit for our families”. Then they turn around and the government wants to raise their rent.  Glory be, there is no way the government should be raising their rent and there is not a Canadian who is in favour of that for our men and women in our military.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nova Scotia at the base they wanted to have a counselling centre.  Fathers, such as those in Afghanistan, are gone for many months and children are without their daddies, or their mothers, whoever is in uniform.  So they wanted a counselling centre there.  They were going to bring in a Catholic priest and a Protestant minister to help counsel the families.  Do members know that the men and women had to go out and raise the money themselves? The government would not give them anything for their counselling centre.  That is a shame and a disgrace.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today as the member of Parliament for London West. I have had an opportunity over the summer months before prorogation to consult with my constituents. I am very pleased that in the Speech from the Throne there are many areas that I know will be very important to members of my community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, like just about everybody in the House, we are concerned with our health care, with financing our health care and making sure that in the future we will be taken care of like we have been used to from cradle to grave. There are responsible measures to be taken, with perhaps some changes in the way we go about it. The value system we share across this land means having good health care for all of us, not just because of a pocketbook that is fuller than that of our neighbour, but because we are entitled to good health and good health protection by way of prevention programs. These are some of the things that we heard in the Speech from the Throne.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not remind members of the House that London is a community that has health research. We are very fortunate to have many tens of thousands of our citizens working in the health care community and specifically in the health care research community. Not only do research dollars impact on the health of Canadians, but that knowledge is shared with literally the world. We were very fortunate to hear in the throne speech  that we will be advancing more dollars for health research and in fact for research in general, because we are in need of a more innovative economy in order to be a more productive economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is especially important for the students. In London we have Fanshawe College and the University of Western Ontario. Representatives from both of those institutions constantly come to talk to the members of Parliament in our area to emphasize the real need for the upping of these resources.  We have to go from where we were many years ago when we took over the government. We were down because we were not supplying sufficient research dollars. In fact, we were losing many talented young people in whom Canada had invested. We were losing their talents. Also, after their primary, secondary and usually first university education, we were  losing them as graduate students as they fled to other countries. We have reversed that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the president of the university visited me here in the House and reiterated how thankful they were that the climate for these young people has changed. I think we can even do better and improve it further.  But that does not mean they get to do  just the research and that is the end of it. There has to be a commercialization of the research, which I think is important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our colleges and universities and in fact our hospital systems are strapped financially. There is a method for us to help the system. What we heard in the Speech from the Throne is that we are now talking about working with the universities in particular on the indirect costs of research. This is a promising way to deliver more funds. That will then prevent the graduate and research students literally taking the dollars away from the undergraduate students and  their studies. It will help support the educational infrastructure throughout Canada. I am very pleased to see that this will be for all universities across every province. That formula is a necessary one and I am glad to see that we are headed in that direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about the physical environment of where I live. Unfortunately, there is something we are not proud of.  I live in the area of Canada that has the most pollutants in the air. Lack of clean air is a problem. We had in excess of 27 smog days this summer in London. Combined with that, we had high humidity days. Not all of those pollutants were made in our backyard. We happen to live in a geographical basin. We get some winds from across our lake shared by our neighbour to the south. I am very pleased to see that this was addressed, because clean air is not an issue that we can take on as one country or one city. It is something we have to work at in collaboration with the United States. We have specifically said that and I think it is important.</p>


	<A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the summer I talked with many people about Kyoto, climate change and reducing the necessity of getting those greenhouse gases down over time. I have heard the argument that Canada only produces 2% of the problem, but California only produces 2% of the problem. We have roughly equal populations.  If we all were to say that we are just a bit of the problem so we do not have to participate, the problem could never be solved over time. I think we have to face reality.  We are the potentially endangered species on this planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a situation where, even though it might be more difficult in the shorter term, we can turn this to our economic advantage. I think we should be going into cleaner energy.  We should be looking for those products, innovations and methodologies in our cities, on our farms and in our industries to support getting to our global solution, because we do share the planet and we are certainly affected as a northern country in a way that is not welcomed by many of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that doing this not only for ourselves but for our future generations is important.  I appreciate that there may be bottom line costs to this and I also appreciate that they may not be known to the penny at this time, but sometimes there are situations in which we have to start on the solution and head in the right direction because it is the right and correct thing to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk a little more about biotechnology, the clean energy and the health sciences, because these are opportunities for economic growth.  Again, this is fed by the research and the changing environment. We have passed through different ages over time. The industrial age has created some of the problems we are faced with now.  We now will be moving into an age of  future science and we are going to have to look at some of the ethics of those potential problems. We are going to have to look at the science.  We are going to have to marry the values of Canadians with the legislation. Around the table here we are going to have to take into consideration and listen to the concerns of people who perhaps do not represent my party but, I believe, represent Canadians, and those Canadians have shared values.  I think it is important that we listen and that we try to move ahead for the benefit of all of us in this wonderful democratic society we have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that I feel very strongly about is palliative care. I read one part of the throne speech that was about a commitment to helping people who may have to serve outside the workforce while taking care of their family members during an illness.  Palliative care is not just for aged people.  It is for ill children and all ill people.  I am glad to see that we are moving in this direction and  I would encourage my government to move faster and with more strength in this area because I think there is a real need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Carstairs from the other House came to my riding a couple of weeks ago when we put the health care professionals together in a room.  I do not think there is a family among us that will not be dealing with these situations.  Sometimes our health care system by itself will not be able to cope.  We will be asked to volunteer our time and our physical and monetary resources to assist a family member.  I think it is important that we take on this role, but I also think there is a place for government to assist us.  I am pleased to see that line in the Speech from the Throne.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London is in southwestern Ontario.  We are on one of the busiest trade corridors the country has.  U.S.-Canada trade is very important to the economy of the region. I am very glad to see the U.S.-Canada smart border accord coming to fruition. I am glad to see the money that we are adding and increasing in infrastructure over time.  I am glad to see the security measures that make our trade safe.  No one needs a bottleneck. We certainly need more dollars going into the facilitation of the trade that affects the jobs in our region and that tells our neighbours we are there to share in and increase each other's prosperity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things in the Speech from the Throne interest me.  One is affordable housing.  Another is helping Africans, because I have been there.  I was in Sierra Leone within the last year.  Perhaps I could encourage everyone to take the opportunity, when they can, to go and get the yardstick measurement, because I am proud of what we do with our foreign aid and I am glad to see that it will be increasing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start working on these programs.  I am pleased to do it with colleagues from the House.  I am pleased to be a member of the House, and I look forward to getting on with the business of implementing over time, in a fiscally responsible manner, the issues that have been raised in the Speech from the Throne.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. I know there was mention of the infrastructure program.  Back in Saint John, New Brunswick, which is my riding, we have the Point Lepreau nuclear power plant, which needs to be refurbished. I think it will take over $400 million to refurbish it. New Brunswick Power has said it does not have the money. AECL,  Atomic Energy of Canada, came to Fredericton, New Brunswick, for a dinner.  It needs some money. AECL said that nuclear power has to stay.  When we are looking at Kyoto and the environment, nuclear power and natural gas are of course priorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member agree that the government, through that infrastructure program or some other program, should be funding the refurbishing of the nuclear power plant to keep it going in Saint John, New Brunswick?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the hon. member across the way.   Renewable resources and ways to get cleaner energy are important to the country, and there are many ways.  There are wind tunnels, fuel cells and nuclear energy.  We can do demonstration projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through various programs we can help our environment and   keep the cost of energy relevant and reduced.  I look at some of the areas and the way some fuels have helped pollute our environment and I think  it is important that we go forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  congratulate some of the oil companies that have moved forward positively in steps that realistically look at where we are today and how they can do it better.  We  had examples in the House this week of corporations that have come forward with better and cleaner sources of energy and better bottom lines for their companies.  I congratulate all those companies and look forward to seeing the fruition in the priorities of the budget.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,   if everything in the throne speech played out as it should it would be wonderful but I think where the pessimism comes in is that we have heard it so often that we are starting not to believe it.  Actually, we do not believe it.  What can I say? After   someone cries wolf   so many times      nobody listens.  Certainly if the government followed through on some of the items in the throne speech it would be wonderful for Canada.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  regard to my colleague's comments, I do not think there is any question that my time on the industry committee has led me to fully support the fact that indirect costs for research needs to be there.  It is certainly important to go along that line.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What  I do want to comment on  is the commercialization of research which, quite frankly, I do not think is the route to go.  I think we have seen from a number of major companies in health care that the commercialization of research does not do a whole lot overall for the costs within the health care system. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, budgeting is the balancing of priorities.  I think it is a dream to say that we can do all  these things in one budget or even in one session of Parliament but I think our goals have to be enunciated and that there are incremental ways we can move forward together.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a fiscal conservative, believe it or not, but I consider myself a bit liberal on the social justice issues.  I think my friend is surprised over there.  With respect to commercialization, I do not want the member to believe that I am not in favour of basic scientific research. I believe there is a real need for basic scientific research but in my own city I have seen research that has been commercialized through our research park that had a connection to our universities and successful companies have resulted from that.  That is what I am talking about.  It is not that every piece of research has to have a direct result.  I certainly do not want to leave the hon. member with that impression.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find by accident wonderful things from sometimes the most obscure titles of research papers, things with which we would never have associated to product lines.  Yes, there  are accidental beneficial consequences from new products so there is a need for the basic research but  I also think we need  the commercialization.  Nobody wants to see research sit on a shelf.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a special pleasure and privilege to respond to the Speech from the Throne on behalf of the citizens of Mount Royal, one of the most multicultural and engagé ridings in the country, while giving expression to the cases and causes that underpin the involvement of my constituents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I am pleased that the priorities and purposes that are represented in the throne speech reflect those of my constituents and I trust that they will, because the question has been raised,  in fact be implemented.  These include:  first, a comprehensive reform and renewal of our health care system, anchored in the values of universality, accessibility, public administration and sustainability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, environmental protection, including an implementation plan to meet our climate change obligations under the Kyoto protocol; create 10 new national parks and 5 new national marine conservation areas; reintroduce legislation, and this is of particular to my constituents, to protect species at risk; strengthen the pesticides act to protect the health of Canadians, particularly children; accelerate the clean up of federal contaminated sites in Canada; and improve air quality and national water quality guidelines. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, redress the disparity between aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples while working with first nations communities to build their capacity for economic and social development, expand  community based justice approaches and maintain our focus on first nations health issues at the same time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, enlarge and enhance our commitment to make Canada a world leader in skills, learning and research, of which I have spoken elsewhere in the House, anchored in the principle that knowledge, innovation and creativity are the measure of achievement in today's global village.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth,  invest in our cities to help build and develop worldclass urban centres and healthy communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth,  extend our investments in affordable housing,   another commitment of particular concern to my riding, particularly in the Quartier of Snowdon and Côte-des-Neiges  where the needs are greatest, while extending the supporting communities partnership initiative to help reduce homelessness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, to double our foreign aid and development assistance approach, particularly for those countries that are in desperate need in that regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and most important, a sustaining and deepening commitment to our most important national resource, our children--a theme that runs through the speech from the throne which I was  pleased to see--through a significant increase to the national child benefit to poor families; increased access to early learning opportunities and to quality child care, particularly  for poor and lone parent families; targeted measures for low income families caring for severely disabled children so as to help meet the needs of the children and of the family; and early childhood development programs for first nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now, in the second part of my remarks, to address two issues in particular:  one of a domestic character and the other of a foreign policy character. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the domestic front  I will focus on health care because that continues to be the cross-cutting priority for my constituents and for the inhabitants of Quebec,  as it is for the country as a whole. As I have said before in the House, Canada's health care system is a litmus test of our society, defining who we are and what we aspire to be:  a caring, sharing, responsive and compassionate people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I go about in my constituency and my province, as I did during our summer break and since, I am able to identify eight major concerns with our health care system which, for reasons of time, I will abbreviate rather than elaborate upon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is an  acute shortage in human resources, in health care professionals, including a critical shortage in family practitioners, specialists and, perhaps most important and which we do not address enough,  our nurses, who are at the core of our health care system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed a recent report in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> demonstrated a strong correlation between the amount of professional nursing care that patients receive and health outcomes.  For example, these studies demonstrated that patients with more hours of nursing care had shorter hospital stays, fewer infections, less internal bleeding, lower rates of pneumonia, fewer cardiac arrests and lower mortality rates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not reiterate the importance, not only for health but for sustainability and economic returns, of addressing and redressing this critical shortage in human resources, particularly with regard to nurses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and not unrelated, is the critical situation in our emergency rooms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third is the  rise in  pharmaceutical costs with its disproportionate impact on seniors. For example, as I was advised in my own constituency, the annual pharmaceutical costs for seniors  is now about $885 a year, running the risks thereby of institutionalization, hospitalization and, tragically enough, even death because of  the inability to pay. </p>


	<A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth and most important is a holistic approach to health care involving interdisciplinary approaches to primary and home care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth concern is the lack of diagnostic instruments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth is the lack of accessibility to health care in one's own minority language.    I was interested in the proposal by the official languages commissioner to tie the question of transfer payments to the issue of accessibility to health care in one's minority language for francophones outside Quebec and  anglophones within Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh is governmental accountability under the Canada health and social transfer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighth is ensuring the integrity of the principles of the Canada Health Act and the values that underpin it, particularly the concerns with universality, accessibility, sharing the risk on the basis of human need, and the timeliness of health care.  One ought to make  reference here to the impact of NAFTA on the integrity of the Canada Health Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to focus on one foreign policy issue: the humanitarian urgency of the African dossier.  In this regard I want to heighten the fact that we are on the verge there of a humanitarian catastrophe, with a risk to the whole new partnership for African development, NEPAD, the blueprint for a sustainable Africa.  This will founder and fail unless we address the six following priorities of the African dossier and thereby avert a humanitarian catastrophe in the making.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the pandemic of AIDS in the African continent, resulting in 2 million deaths a year and some 40 million projected deaths by 2020.  In a word, a continent is dying.  Unless the pandemic of AIDS is addressed with the urgency it warrants, NEPAD also may not survive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second priority we need to address is the threatened starvation of some 13 million Africans, a horrific and unthinkable contemplation.  Canada must take the lead in averting this humanitarian catastrophe in the making as  I speak.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third is the convergence of the above two priorities in Zimbabwe, the crown jewel of Africa, where the pandemic of AIDS and the threatened starvation of 6 million Zimbabweans alone proceed amidst a Mugabe-led government of repression and corruption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth is the continuing “genocide by attrition” in the Sudan, where intimations of a peace process belie the continuing slaughter of the innocents, forcing the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to once again reissue its genocide warning with respect to what is happening in Sudan, which regrettably has gone unacknowledged and unaddressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth is the African world war in the Congo, which is a passing blip, perhaps, on our political radar screen, but where a culture of impunity only encourages the killing fields.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, and finally, is the recommendation by the  newly inaugurated African Union that Libya, whose litany of human rights violations has been documented by the UN itself, be the new chair of the UN Human Rights Commission.  The recommendation of a human rights violator country to chair the most important human rights body makes a mockery of NEPAD principles of peer review and accountability for human rights violations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, and in conclusion on this second part, Canadian leadership at this moment is crucial.  A sustainable Africa, at the heart of a sustainable planet, is on the line.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-302107"></A><a HREF="#Int-302109"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-302104"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise and speak on the reply to the throne speech on behalf of the constituents of Surrey North. It is incumbent on me to express the disappointment Canadians are feeling after hearing what the Liberal government has planned for our nation for the next few years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to address an issue, something that we learned that had not been contemplated in the throne speech.  The federal cabinet appears to have approved that the government change its rules for refugees.  Those claiming refugee status who arrived from a so-called safe third country, such as the U.S., will be denied refugee status. Why was this not in the throne speech?  This is a major initiative.  So maybe it is not going to happen.  We will have to wait and see.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the date of my private member's Motion No. 422 in the previous session, calling on all western democracies to be listed as safe third countries, it was made abundantly clear that the Liberals had no real intention of ever stemming the flow of illegal immigrants into Canada.  The government was giving Canadians its usual double talk of things like more study and international obligations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be sharing my time, Mr. Speaker, with my colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that really meant was that the government wanted to do little, if anything, to turn back refugee claims in order for these claims to be heard in the first safe country in which the claimant landed.  The issue of bogus refugees coming to Canada has been of significant public concern for decades.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If average Canadians are asked what they thought about Canada's refugee system, we would find out that they are proud of the fact that we have assisted thousands of people who are genuinely, and I emphasize that genuinely, persecuted in foreign lands. I also think that we would hear that people are tired of Canada's generosity being taken advantage of by fraudulent refugee claims.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Motion No. 422 would have done much to eliminate the practice of asylum shopping and the use of our refugee system as a back door immigration method.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government thinks that most western democracies are too tough on refugee claims and that Canada should continue to be the favoured destination of people smugglers, criminals and terrorists. The government knows all too well that all western democracies are signatories to the UN convention on refugees and torture.  The Liberals also know that no country is as accepting of refugee claims as is Canada, and until others relax their standards we will rarely ever consider turning back bogus claimants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Canadians agree that many people claiming to be refugees are not real refugees and some unfortunate attitudes have developed as a result.  I believe that if Canadians were able to see that only genuine refugees were being admitted those attitudes would change greatly.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is vital for Canada to continue its tradition of helping those less fortunate and I truly believe that.  It is equally vital that Canada not feel used. In my constituency some of the most vocal critics of our refugee and immigration policies are members of the immigrant communities themselves.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By identifying certain nations as safe third countries, the government would restore a lot of confidence in Canada's refugee system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the debate on my motion last February helped to contribute to whatever the cabinet seems to have decided concerning this matter. Again, I remain extremely cautious that the government is only talking now and doing nothing later.  We will see.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general on the throne speech, my colleagues have already laid out many of the shortcomings of the throne speech and put forward the official opposition's proposals to address the failings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has no plan.  He announced no details and no price tag on the initiatives announced at the beginning of this session of Parliament, and he has refused to bring in a budget this fall to address these issues.  Most of what was in the speech was simply recycled from past Liberal agendas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the government's new showpiece initiatives have been tried in one form or another and have failed miserably. Its agenda for children is an example of what I am talking about.  Ask advocates of policies focused on children and they will say that they have been waiting for years for the government to deliver the programs required for the promises they make.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children's agenda is set out as a set of throne speech promises from throne speeches in 1996, 1997 and 1999.  The government has resorted to repackaging past promises and announcing new attempts to address previous failures.  What of the feeble attempt to address the ethical issues?  Even the Prime Minister's own caucus is balking at his proposals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 145 throne speech promises since 1993, 79 have been broken, unfulfilled or forgotten.  That is a failure rate of 46%. In this throne speech we have 58 new promises, no less than 29 of them recycled from previous throne speeches or previous government announcements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the justice critics for the Canadian Alliance, I would like to take a few minutes to enter into the record a number of fronts where the federal government is disappointing Canadians through the mismanagement of our criminal justice system.</p>


	<A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1815)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to a sex offender registry, we understand that the government now plans to develop one. My constituents will believe that when we see it. So far, for months the Solicitor General has insisted that CPIC is adequate. We know full well that it is not; 30,000 members of the Canadian Police Association have said that CPIC is not adequate. Province have been in the business of developing their own. We have devoted supply days and numerous motions to this issue, so I am hesitant to believe the promise. It was not in the throne speech. It was announced after the fact. Again, we will see.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of child pornography, I welcomed the announcement in the Speech from the Throne that the government plans to move forward with legislation this fall that will tighten the defence of child pornography.  We will hold it to this promise as will some government members who I know are extremely concerned about this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the age of consent, for years the official opposition justice team has been calling on the Liberal government to increase the age of sexual consent in Canada from 14 years to 16. I myself have tabled numerous petitions containing thousands of names on this issue. I refer to a lady at home in Port Coquitlam, B.C., Diane Sowden, who is a mainstay in driving this issue and has been doing so for years. She is the mother who is a teen prostitute who knows all too well the problems around this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other western democracies, in Canada adults may legally have sex with children as young as the age of 14. The Canadian Alliance has consistently warned the federal government that this law is hampering the ability of law enforcement agencies to protect children from sexual predators. The current age of consent leaves children and teenagers open to becoming targets of pornographers, Internet sex scams, pedophiles and sexual abuse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received thousands of letters from Canadians from coast to coast asking for the necessary steps to protect the most vulnerable members of our community, however the Liberal government has failed to make the protection of children a priority. As I said, there was some lip service in the throne speech, and again, we will be watching.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue which has not been addressed and which is extremely important in my community is the issue of auto theft. There are real criminal justice issues that are affecting Canadians on a daily basis on our streets that have not been addressed in this speech. Unfortunately my community of Surrey is now the number one city for auto theft in North America. There were 6,100 vehicles stolen in Surrey in 2001. That is a rate of 1,743 cars stolen for every 100,000 people. This is hundreds more than the second place community in North America, which I believe is Phoenix, Arizona.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a horrendous problem. Much tragedy flows from car theft. Often personal injuries accompany car theft. I know of one incident myself when I was coming home a few years ago from playing in a recreational hockey game. I came across the intersection two blocks from my house where a known car thief with a long record had outrun the police, waved by them, thumbed his nose at them, went through a red light, t-boned a car and killed a 34 year old woman on her way home from a church meeting. I witnessed that myself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the results of car theft that are becoming all to clear and all too frequent: vast amounts of police fire, ambulance workers and resources become involved; the criminal courts; increased insurance costs; and police officers and innocent bystanders hurt and killed in crashes while in pursuit of stolen vehicles. It is my information that a significant portion of vehicle theft is for the commission of other crimes, for example robbery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an incredible phenomenon now with ignition interlocks being built into current modern vehicles. There is a new phenomenon taking place where the people who want to steal these vehicles are breaking into occupied homes, conducting home invasions just to get the keys to steal the cars. Another phenomenon we are seeing is that they are stealing SUVs because these vehicles are built like tanks and they can use them to ram police cars when they are in pursuit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last session I introduced a private member's bill to try to do something about the laws governing repeat auto theft. It was made non-votable and was shot down by the Liberal government. Maybe now the government will start to pay some attention to it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug addiction, alcohol abuse, family breakdown, and children at risk are all contributory factors  to auto theft which the government is ignoring.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another phenomenon that is related is street racing, another crime running rampant in the region I represent. The mayor of Surrey, Doug McCallum, is saying that juvenile joyriders, young offenders in particular, should have their driver's licences suspended for five years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harjit Kaur Atwal was killed when her car was rear-ended by another. The suspects charged failed to show up for trial. Two children lost their mother. Constable Jimmy Ng of Richmond, a Mountie, was killed recently by an allegedly speeding driver who was formally charged with alleged street racing. The government has said nothing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the throne speech, Canadians deserve much better.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member if he feels that the decriminalization of marijuana would make it more accessible for our young people?  In my opinion, it paints a picture for our young people that there is nothing wrong with it. However I did a research paper on that, and I did it  out of Berkeley university. The research shows that when people smoke their first marijuana cigarette, it enters the brain cells and stays for nine days. Of course, smoking it more often creates  a major problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member know whether smoking marijuana first can lead to heavier drugs? Does the member feel that we should decriminalize it or make it a little tougher for those who give young people  marijuana free until they get them hooked, then sell it to them after they are hooked? I think we have a major problem, if we go along with decriminalizing marijuana.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister had a great opportunity to build a legacy.  Unfortunately, the Speech from the Throne is a massive missed opportunity.  The Prime Minister failed in his ability to articulate a legacy that he could leave with pride.  He had a great opportunity.  He has nothing to lose. He is here for 12 months, maybe 18 months at the most.  He had an opportunity to do that and he failed to do it.   There is  a list of things  the Prime Minister could  still do that would enable him to leave an enormous positive impact on the lives of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the biggest problem is our lack of democracy.  The House is not a democracy; it is  an elected dictatorship. It is  not run by cabinet, it is not run by members of Parliament, and certainly it is not run by the public.  It is run by a small cabal of unelected people in the Prime Minister's Office.  That must change. If we fail to change that, the disengagement of the public that we see today will continue and the House will become a farce.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the Prime Minister do?  He should allow free votes on all non-money bills.  All bills should go to committee first before they come to the House.  In that way the public would have  positive, effective input into the construction of those bills.  All private members' bills must be made votable.  We also need to have an elected Senate.  There are lessons we can learn from Australia.  Significant reform was implemented in Australia and the same could make this House far more democratic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is with regard to health care.   Few people would agree that the Canada Health Act in its current form can sustain the impact of an aging population and more expensive technologies.  The  Canada Health Act  has been violated in every  province across the country.  Every single principle has been violated by every single province. The Canada Health Act is broken.  The way to fix it is to modernize it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A headstart program should be implemented.  That headstart program  should be the cornerstone of the government's children's agenda.  It would be the most effective measure for prevention. It  would ensure that the basic needs of children were met and would  strengthen the parent-child bond.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Montreal mentioned the manpower crisis. It could be alleviated by opening up more spaces for health care personnel  not only in  medical schools but in  nursing schools and technical schools as well.  A portion of those positions should be paid for in a cost sharing agreement between the feds and the provinces.  Some of those  individuals would have to spend an equal number of years in an underserviced area.  That would enable us to deal with the incredible problem of getting medical personnel into underserviced areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point deals with economics.  The government should  flatten the tax system, make it simpler and perhaps shave off a percentage point on the GST.  It could increase the minimum amount of money that somebody  makes before they have to pay tax.  No one making less than $18,000 should be required to pay tax in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the government has been neglecting defence and as a result there is  an absolute crisis. The government has been told about this repeatedly.  Its failure to give economic and moral support to our military is eroding not only our standard  here at home but our stature abroad.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we fix it?  We need to increase the  manpower to 75,000.  We need to put $1.5 billion to $2 billion  per year  for the next five years directly into manpower, training and equipment.   We also need to stop increasing our military personnel's rent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we need an integrated foreign policy and  defence policy.  How can we  have a congruent foreign policy and defence policy if they are constructed in two separate silos?  We need to take a leaf  from  Australia's book  and  ensure that we have an integrated defence policy and foreign policy so that our defence forces have the tools to do what our foreign policy dictates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that my time has run out, but I will finish  the rest of my speech at the next sitting of the House.</p>
