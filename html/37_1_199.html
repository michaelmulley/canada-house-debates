	Mr. Speaker, sustainable development should be more than a slogan or a convenient buzzword. It means managing natural resources as we manage personal savings. We draw from the interest but we try to keep intact the capital.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, according to scientists from the University of British Columbia we along with the Europeans and the Americans have heavily drawn from the capital of the north Atlantic fish stock. Scientists have found the biomass of cod has declined by two-thirds since 1950 because of large cod catches in the 1970s and 1980s. Another report released last month shows current catch limits for Newfoundland's cod fishery are not sustainable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around the globe the fishery is in decline. For the sake of future generations we must reverse this dangerous trend and limit the catch to the interest of the resource while leaving intact the capital.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the decision of December 1, 2001 by the Liberal government to allow Bell Canada to charge an additional cost to rural phone subscribers for a service which is provided free to people who live in cities is discriminatory and unfair, particularly to Canadians on fixed incomes. Bell Canada is telling irate callers that if they do not like the new charge they should call their federal member of parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensioners who are being forced to leave the city because of high rents are now finding the federal government waiting to gouge them when they arrive in small town rural Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there two-tier citizenship for rural Canadians? Why is the federal government discriminating against Canadians who live in rural Canada?</p>

<td><small>Thirty-three years ago, upstart McMaster University in Hamilton sparked a revolution in the training of doctors that eventually spread to all the big medical schools in North America.

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McMaster University in my riding of Hamilton West is once again leading the entire country in medical innovation. Its efforts to move doctors in training into remote areas will bring cutting edge research to those areas and will help retain qualified medical staff in parts of Canada that are traditionally underserved. I commend McMaster University and its health care researchers and staff for showing the foresight and courage to take the risks necessary to reap big benefits for the health care system in the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that the solutions needed to sustain public health care in the country lie with our teaching and research personnel. The recent research infrastructure payments to our universities were a strong start but we need to continue to show our commitment to these sources of innovation.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This co-op, which is doing a pilot transformation of an underused species, namely spider crab, will thus be able to diversify its market by offering a new product that is primarily intended for the Japanese market.

	Mr. Speaker, 13 years ago a man single-handedly stopped a line of tanks ordered to put down a rally for democracy in Tiananmen Square.  This showed that a man of courage could thwart the will of a despotic government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately our Prime Minister was unwilling to take that same stand.  The last time the PM was in China he stated “You know we are 30 million.  They are 1.2 billion”. If only the Prime Minister had a fraction of the courage of that one man.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world outside China has not forgotten the events which transpired there 13 years ago.  Countless people have disappeared, been brainwashed and been silenced by a government intent on repressing any form of dissent or free speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A government that turns upon its own people and cuts them down in the street does not deserve to be rewarded with favourable trade status. Nor does it deserve to host the Olympics.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in 1999 Canada adopted the Codex agreement and international standards for the use of dairy terms.  If a product is intended to substitute milk or milk products, dairy terms such as butter and cream must not be used. While soy beverages exist, soy milk does not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian dairy farmers invest over $75 million each and every year to promote their products. Yet many companies mislead consumers by co-opting these terms in their labelling where there is no dairy content in the first place. Foods like buttery flavour popcorn and strawberry and cream cereals, despite their labels, do not actually contain any dairy products and mislead consumers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having put on a good show at the international level, the government is now creaming Canadian dairy farmers by refusing to apply these standards at home. When will the government actually enforce these dairy term standards?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there must be something about Halifax.   While I was noting  the applause and seeing people standing   I recalled a former member of parliament for Halifax being in a similar position.  When he resigned as leader of his party  he went on to say, and there is some risk in my saying this, “there is nothing more popular than a former leader of a political party”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply want to thank the hon. member for Halifax for her courage,    her standards and  her dedication to principle.  I think it is a characteristic of  all us that we are here to serve but the hon. member for Halifax had other options.  She had the option of a much easier life but she  chose not to do that.  She chose public service.  She has been an ornament to this parliament and to the profession of public service, as she has made us all stand taller as practitioners of the profession of politics.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard, and I wish to echo the comments made by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, who mentioned that the member for Halifax has always respected  the other political parties and positions that she herself did not share. Once again, this is the sign of great strength of character.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased that the hon. member has decided to   stay as a member of the House of Commons.  We have need of her here in this parliament.  We have need of her strong and steady voice in defence of social justice, in defence of compassion and in defence of the most fundamental of Canadian qualities, respect for the equality of individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of myself personally and my party, I want to thank her for her service and wish her the very best in times to come.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a couple of moments to put on record the sentiments of my colleagues in response to the news we received today.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am lacking words to express the feelings of all of my colleagues who so love our leader, the hon. member for Halifax.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, you will appreciate how emotional this moment is for me and for  my colleagues  after hearing the news of the decision of our leader to step aside.  She has done so today magnanimously and selflessly, as has been her way in everything she has done politically.  As the member for Halifax said herself today, “The work of a great leader, among other things, is knowing when to pass the torch”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is great wisdom in those words, a wisdom that  I am sure many in the Prime Minister's party feel should be emulated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say three things on behalf of my colleagues. First, it is because of our leader, the member for Halifax, that our party is in a position of strength today.  Thanks to her good work, we broke through the doldrums  after the 1993 election and reclaimed official party status in 1997.  Thanks to the member for Halifax, we made an incredible breakthrough in Atlantic Canada, winning eight seats and  breaking through that barrier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may be down a few but we are on a roll.  We will be back up. I want to let  all members in the House know that we are coming back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also  because of our leader, the member for Halifax, we made a breakthrough with respect to women in the country.  As the first woman leader of an established, recognized federal and provincial party, we owe a debt of gratitude to her. Thanks to her good work we have almost achieved gender parity in our caucus.  Let that also be an example    for the Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Halifax personifies all that is good in political life.  She shows for all of us the example of a selfless, tireless individual who works steadfastly on behalf of Canadians.  Her passion for the country and her compassion for its people are her hallmark and a legacy she leaves all of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member for Dartmouth  has said in the past, the words that can only describe our leader today is that she is the iron angel of Canadian politics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of all of my colleagues, I thank the hon. member for being the standard-bearer for social justice and for being the iron angel of Canadian politics.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, before I utter a single word I would like to know from you whether every word that comes out of my mouth is taken off   question period?  I know   the eulogy for this supposedly departing socialist was heartfelt but I hope it was not a plot to take away from her getting down to business for question period.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the kind words.  I think the most important thing I want to say is that this socialist is not departing.  I have every intention of remaining here as leader from now until my party selects a new leader.  As I have indicated, it will be my privilege to continue serving the constituents of Halifax for as long as they will have me.  I look forward to many years to come in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an occasion where the Prime Minister has spoken so graciously and generously   I would like to be able to congratulate him as well but when he says to me that sometimes in one's party one really wants to be friends with people on the other side, I feel like I should express my condolences to him.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank all members for their kind words.  The newest leader in the House is not a newcomer here but when he says that I have always stood tall in the House it must be because he cannot see that I am stuck standing between two of my colleagues who tower about a foot over me on a day to day basis.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning a reporter asked me “Did you have any regrets during your years of service in parliament”?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered sincerely that I regretted not having started learning French when I was younger. I think that it is very important for everyone to try to improve and perfect both official languages in order to express our feelings and our aspirations in both official languages.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to say to the leader of the Conservative Party that I think the previous leader of his party, who once had the privilege of representing Halifax as well, was quite right when he said that it was only when socialists departed  this place that there was such enthusiasm.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry to break the spell.  I have no intentions of going anywhere except getting right down to business in question period, and I hope that is exactly what we are going to do because I have some tough questions I want to put to the Prime Minister.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, last night the public works minister said that the government would  continue to give tax dollars to Groupaction.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the RCMP investigation,   the auditor general's investigation and the government paying the firm twice for photocopying the same report,   now the government has given Groupaction almost a quarter of a million dollars in new work.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would note that in the auditor general's report she said “our conclusions cannot and do not pertain to any practices that Groupaction followed”.  She was referring to the public service not to Groupaction.</p>

It is hard to believe that Groupaction could not have had some role in that.  However  the government rewards Groupaction with four more contracts worth  over $200,000 when it already knew that the auditor general was investigating the previous shoddy work.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, what is going on when the Canadian Wheat Board has to pay $4,000 to get access to the Prime Minister and Liberal MPs? The government has created a virtual culture of cronyism so corrosive that the Canadian Wheat Board believes that it has to cough up, “an entry fee for the purpose of doing business”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Prime Minister intend to take any responsibility for breeding this culture of cronyism and what will he do to clean it up?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciated the kind words of the Prime Minister this afternoon, but something that would mean a lot more to Canadians would be for him to  pledge today to support my private member's bill, Bill C-299, which would establish a clear code of conduct for parliamentarians.

	Mr. Speaker, let me again lay out the process. The difficulties here were discovered by an internal audit conducted by Public Works and Government Services Canada.  The auditor general said that the work was excellent and of critical value.  It resulted in a whole series of changes within the sponsorship program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general reviewed three particular Groupaction files.  She took the appropriate action in referring certain files to the RCMP.  She is now conducting a government-wide examination with respect to advertising and sponsorships.  The President of the Treasury Board is reviewing the government's framework.  All appropriate actions have been launched.</p>

At the same time, Media Vision, another of Mr. Boulay's shell companies garnered 75% of Communication Canada contracts. The treasury board clearly states that any one contractor cannot control more than 25%.  </p>

I will report to the House as soon as it is complete.  </p>

If any contractor commands more than 25% of the business, and this is its rule, remedial action will be taken to eliminate market dominance.  It is concerned about this, but the Liberals are not.  The Liberals did nothing while Claude Boulay piled up 75% of  Liberal advertising and sponsorship moneys.</p>

They could well have been used for counterfeiting purposes by organized networks to get into Canada prior to September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the minister really buying the story that somehow these important documents that have to be personally signed for at every mission just got tucked into a convenient corner and there was no problem with the fact that they could not be found or located for six weeks?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, security is one of our priorities.  Of course sometimes we can have some problems.  What I will mention,  and I think it is important for the sake of the Canadian people, because there is another scapegoating here, is that when the documents were misplaced at the embassy we informed CIC headquarters that they were missing.  At that time the visa numbers were cancelled.  Later we found out that the documents were not tampered  with and were in the secure area of the embassy to which only Canadians have access.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, first of all the public works department does not have private auditors. It has an internal audit function.  That is why two years ago it found some problems and some corrective actions were taken at public works.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  have improved the system for the foundations.  We have changed the funding agreements with the foundations.

	Mr. Speaker, I move that the 17th report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, presented to the House on Wednesday, May 1, be concurred in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the prying eyes of the media sits Zimbabwe.  Earlier this year, after President Robert Mugabe stole the election which took place in Zimbabwe, the world has  turned its attention to other areas.   However the situation in Zimbabwe is spiraling out of control and more people are facing starvation, torture and murder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have thought when Robert Mugabe stole the presidential election in March of this year that all  would be well in that country.  That could not be further from the truth.  What is happening  there today would curl the hair on anyone's neck.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international community is ignoring a humanitarian tragedy of enormous proportions.  President Robert Mugabe is engaging in the systematic rape, murder and torture of innocent civilians as he takes out his anger and his displeasure on those who supported the opposition MDC party.  While this is happening the people of Zimbabwe are crying out for help.  What do they see?  They see nothing.  They see people turning their backs on them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnitude of the problem is massive.  The population of Zimbabwe is 12 million.  Half  the population is facing starvation at this present time.  Members should imagine what would be happening if six million people in Europe were facing starvation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell members what I saw when I was in Zimbabwe  last September with the former secretary of state for Africa and Latin America, who I might add did a superb job when we were there.  We went there as part of a small group of nations to find out what was happening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the government of Zimbabwe tried to do was to ensure that the individuals who were there from the international community would not find out the truth of what was going on.  It doctored the witnesses we were supposed to meet  to ensure that only those parroting the government line would be heard.  What the then secretary of state did was very brave.  He changed that process and ensured that we had a fair representation of people from  society in Zimbabwe. What we heard was absolutely chilling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mugabe said to the international community that he was following the rule of law, that he had an independent judiciary, that he would stop  the land reform process and that he would adhere to a set of criteria that was put together by Nigeria's President Obasanjo.  Instead, we heard that the opposite was occurring. Journalists were being imprisoned.  Opposition members were being beaten, tortured and murdered.  Individuals could not get together to even discuss things.  There was a systematic doctoring in preparation for an election that could not be fair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went out into the bush and met with a wide variety of farmers from about 30 different farms. Under an acacia tree, away from anyone else, I met with about 14 or 15 black farm workers.  They told me that President Robert Mugabe would hire and send  young, violent thugs   from Harare to go to the farms and ask the black workers, not the white workers, whether they supported the government or not?  If there was any indication that there would be no support for the governing party, they would be beaten and murdered,   their wives  tortured and raped, and their homes  fire-bombed.  Indeed I saw this and took photographs.  There were marks written on their homes for government workers who wanted to claim those homes for themselves.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One farm worker looked into my eyes and said, “Dr. Martin, you see the land right now.  If we do not plant in the next two weeks, we will face starvation and we will die.  If you don't help us, we will surely die.”  He begged us, as part of the international community, to help them save their lives.  He also said that what President Mugabe was doing had nothing to do with the truth.  He was violently abusing and cowering the rural black population to force them to vote for the ruling party.</p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke about being forced to go with his family and other black farm workers to government Zanu-PF meetings where they had to chant government slogans.  If there were any indication that they were not 100% behind the government they would be taken out back and beaten.  Some were murdered. We saw that repeatedly.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may feel that this has stopped but  it continues.  When we got back we presented the evidence.  The Commonwealth discredited itself by coming out with a piece of pablum that did nothing to stop Mr. Mugabe. As a result he saw that as a green light to continue his violent ways.  Indeed, that is what occurred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply disturbed by these events.  The response of the international community, including the Commonwealth, the United Nations and our country, was discredited.  We did not take a forceful, meaningful approach to this problem.  In the face of objective views and analysis by many non-governmental organizations where  hundreds of thousands of people's lives hung in the balance, we chose to do almost nothing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black leaders out there  should be ashamed because the black leaders in Africa sat on their hands and chose to side with a despotic leader who has over the last 20 years demonstrated a flagrant abuse of basic human rights.  They chose to stand with him instead of with innocent civilians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviour of Mr. Mugabe is nothing new.  In the early 1980s he and his ruling party brought in  his Korean trained Fifth Brigade.  It is his personal army made up of North Korean trained soldiers under the command of a person named Perence Shiri.  General Shiri, under the direction of Robert Mugabe, took this brigade into Matabeleland North where it murdered 16,000 people.  Those are the facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that, the black leaders, President Mbeki, President Dos Santos  of Angola as well as the leaders of other black African countries, fell over themselves to support Robert Mugabe knowing full well that the actions that he was engaging in were not only going to hurt the black population in Zimbabwe but indeed were going to hurt their own countries.  The reasons for this are many.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Robert Mugabe   has presented the issue in Zimbabwe as one of land reform, of taking land from the whites who own most of the arable land in the country and giving it to the blacks.  Does this stand up to objective scrutiny?  The answer is an emphatic no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government in Zimbabwe had  ample opportunity since the early 1980s to bring in land reforms so that  land could be taken from some of the whites and given to the rural blacks.   It happened   that  money  that was there from England was  pocketed by Mr. Mugabe and his cronies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a look at  land redistribution the only people who  got land were friends of the ruling party.  Suddenly two years ago  Mr. Mugabe brought in land reform as an important issue.  The government had an option by law to buy any land that came up for sale, and much land came up for sale.  I looked at the gazettes myself.  It did not choose to take that route.  Instead, it would walk in, peg the land, take it and dispense it to whomever.  It dispensed it to  friends, family, ministers, police officials and a cadre of cronies who received the land.  There was no land for the poor impoverished black population in Zimbabwe.  That is what has been taking place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of land reform was a smoke screen.  While it was important for the economic uplifting of the rural black population in Zimbabwe, the election that took place had absolutely nothing to do with land reform and everything to do with one man's desire to retain power at any cost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mugabe's desire to retain power not only stems from the issue of   land reform and  paying off his cronies, it also deals with the  dark issue of blood diamonds. We know there has been a conflict in the Congo for the last two years where two million people have been murdered,  innocent men, women and children.</p>


	<A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have been spending so much time on the tragic situation in the Middle East is understandable, but the fact that we have done so  at the expense of   two million people who have been brutally murdered is a shame on all of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mugabe wants to retain control because he is actively involved  in the blood diamond market. He sent his army into eastern Congo, not to develop peace but to secure diamond mines there. Through, in part, a man by the name of Ari Ben-Menashe , an ex-Israeli Mossad agent who now lives in Montreal and who has acted as an intermediary for him, he takes blood diamonds out of eastern Congo. The diamonds are shared with his military people who are in there now. Those diamonds are then trafficked to the illegal and corrupt diamond markets in Tel Aviv and  Antwerp and then    sold for money. Those moneys can  go into the purchase of illegal weapons from eastern Europe. Sometimes those diamonds are traded for weapons in eastern Europe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can be certain that Robert Mugabe and his cronies are actively involved in the blood diamond trade, the same diamonds that many young women wear on their hands when they have the happy moment of getting engaged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in that part of the world is very murky.   I am also ashamed of the appalling behaviour of the United Nations. We may be fascinated and shocked to know that Zimbabwe   was asked to sit on the  UN Human Rights Commission. What does that do to the credibility of the United Nations when it appoints a country such as Zimbabwe?  Just in the first few months of this year,   Zimbabwe  had  959 documented cases of torture, 145 cases of detention, more than 100 cases of systematic executions and dozens of disappearances and kidnappings. Those are only the ones we have heard about. I am also getting very disturbing reports of innocent people who have been decapitated with shovels and buried in the ground by the thugs of Robert Mugabe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an active process by the ruling party to teach young thugs from Zimbabwe the art of torture. These people are then being sent out to torture innocent civilians and wreak havoc. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of all this has been to make Zimbabwe a pariah and to  destroy a country, which  I visited in the early 1990s,   that has  immense agricultural wealth, physical beauty and resources in terms of its wild animals. It has destroyed Zimbabwe's economy, making it a country with massive unemployment in the order of 75%; a country where six million people are starving to death; and a country, which had an enormous resource  of animals of which more than 600,000 them , many some of the rarest in the world, such as the black rhino, have been destroyed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Zimbabwe and   met with the black farm workers, one interesting thing they said was that they go out and teach their children about their cultural heritage,  the game,   the spoor  and   the ecology that surrounds them, but that they could not  do that anymore because President Mugabe's thugs were out there shooting, massacring and poaching thousands and thousands of the animals that are their heritage. The black rhino, various forms of buck, and rare cats, including the lion and cheetah, are destroyed in this way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mugabe has been involved in the economic destruction, the rape and   murder of his people, and the pillaging of his economy all so he can stay in power. Yet the international community's response is nothing, silence. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact   is that we have a choice to make. Do we want to stand on the sidelines and give a green light to despotism, murder and the egregious violation of basic human rights or are we going to stand up for the basic rights and protection of innocent civilians? I want to ask that question and put it squarely on the shoulders of black leaders.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year in May the African community put together a plan called the New Partnership for Africa's Development, an ambitious plan that calls for,  among other things, adherence to the rule of law, the protection of innocent civilians, adherence to a fair and independent judiciary, adherence to good economic policies and an investment in health and education.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mugabe and his cronies have violated every tenet of NPAD;  every single principle of the document.  Why has the leadership of the black African community been silent in its response to this?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month eight leaders of the most powerful countries in the world will be  meeting in Kananaskis, Alberta.  There we will have a choice of either standing up and defending  the people in Zimbabwe and  the people in the surrounding areas or sitting on our hands and coming out with a document   full of diplomatic platitudes and short on substance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we implement a plan of action to not only address Zimbabwe but also address the tragedy in the Congo in which 2 million people died, or   the tragedy in Sierra Leone where child soldiers were forced at gunpoint to chop the hands and legs off babies, children, women and adults?  Will we just  stand by and watch 500,000 being displaced from their homes in West Africa into Guinea because one man, Foday Sankoh, who is  part of the RUF, wants to control diamond mines?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we    stand by and allow famine to claim the lives of up to 10 million people in Malawi, Zimbabwe, South Africa and the surrounding areas? The  numbers are hard to grasp because they are so large but those people are no different from any of us.  They feel, they hurt, they have families, they have children, they love, they die, they work  but they have been  abandoned.  They have been  abandoned because as yet the international community has not taken it upon itself  to stand up for the very basic norms of human rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have done that to some extent in the former Yugoslavia.  Yes, we are trying to do that in the tragic situation between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  However, while we have done that, we have neglected conflicts of orders of magnitude much larger than what is taking place in other parts of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have we done that?  At the end of this month the government has to decide whether it will   live up to the standing committee's report, a report that I am actually speaking about today, which  asks the four simple things.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the report  asks for the suspension of Zimbabwe, which took place at the Commonwealth, for one year.  I ask that we extend that suspension indefinitely until Mr. Mugabe adheres to the rule of law and does the right thing for his people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the report  asks that we  ban all foreign travel by Mr. Mugabe and his cronies.  Thirty identified people in his cabinet and his cronies have been allowed to travel.  They have to travel given that they have been appointed as part of the human rights commission in the United Nations. We must  prevent those people from travelling and   from going to Europe to buy the lavish gifts that they do off the backs of the people of Zimbabwe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the report asks that we establish an arms embargo on Zimbabwe.  The people are getting arms.  When I was down there  I saw widespread evidence of children carrying Chinese made automatic weapons.  They do not make automatic weapons in Zimbabwe.  They probably got the weapons through the trafficking of those illegal diamonds that they   pillaged out of the eastern Congo.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the report asks that we freeze the personal assets of Mr. Mugabe and those same cronies.  There is no use whatsoever in penalizing the people of Zimbabwe.  They have suffered enough.  The sanctions must be targeted against Mr. Mugabe and those same cronies.  If we hurt him personally then we force him to take notice.  If we hurt his ego and make him a pariah within his own party and within  his country, then we have a  chance of changing the situation.  Otherwise he is basically impervious to anything else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to get tougher on the situation.  If we do not the situation will continue to spiral out of control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of that country  are actually shared by many other nations on that continent.  The continent has been ravaged by ruthless kleptocrats who  have been interested in pillaging the resources of their countries for their own gain and not their people's gain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For too long we have bought into a notion that colonialism was the root cause of all evil on the continent.   I would submit that the argument does not hold any water any more.  I would also submit that the responsibility for action on the most egregious violations of human rights falls squarely on the shoulders of despotic African leaders who have hidden behind the excuse   of colonialism only to pillage and rape their own countries.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we want to stand up and accept that argument  or do we want to stand up and do the right thing?  The challenge will be ours in Kananaskis.  I know Canada can lead.  I know that the people who will be sent there will know what to do.  I know the Prime Minister's Sherpa is a very knowledgeable man on this issue.   He has  guided the Prime Minister and given him many good suggestions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to listen to the suggestions that have come from this House on many occasions, to do the right thing, to defend innocent people and to save lives.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  Motion No. 1 is an amendment pertaining to  the definition of  confidential business information and should read in part as follows: “...meets the requirements of subsection 43(4) or (5)” instead of “43(4) and (5)”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two subsections identify different types of confidential business information, so the definition would not be exact.  Information can meet  the requirements of  one subsection or the other, but  not both at the same time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Motion No. 7 is to provide for equal participation by the Senate and the House of Commons,  when the legislation is reviewed after seven years.  The amendment is  in accordance with the principles defining the Senate's role as established in the Constitution of Canada. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<A NAME="Int-270830"></A><a HREF="#Int-270869"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-270819"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, first I would like to address Motion No. 1.  My hon. colleague   mentioned that    it adds the information that would be allowed for confidential business information.  This is also specified in the bill. In the original framing of the wording in the bill, we understand that companies  which have developed many different products,  are rather nervous about  the information already available.  Also a  reading room will be made available for people to read through the information but no information can be written down.  Therefore this     amendment  makes them a little more nervous. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to understand that    the bill  is not only about pesticides  and what pesticides can or cannot come into the country or go out of it, it is also about health and safety There are two sides to the argument.  The extreme side says that no pesticides should be allowed into Canada.  The other side says it is difficult for us to be competitive with our neighbours to the south and other international countries because of our slowness in and restrictions  on  allowing pesticides into the country.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the new pesticides  which are being restricted are much safer and better than the ones we  presently use.  This kind of negative incentive to the  companies that would bring products into Canada  would be put in jeopardy many of our farmers and our agricultural community.  They are not looking for   a competitive edge.  They are looking for  a level playing field with many of our trading partners.  Therefore it is very important for us not to entrench this confidential business information any  more than that we already have. That  would be a difficult one for us to support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We discussed  Motion No. 7  in committee in a pretty significant way.  It is a very important amendment because it goes to the  root reason of why we are here.  That is to represent the people who put us in office, to express their will and to conduct business of the nation in a way that is respectful and representative of the people for whom we speak.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment says  that on a seven year review, the legislation could go directly to the Senate and a Senate committee for review. The Senate is unelected, unrepresentative and friendly to a prime minister of the government in power.  Therefore it is not a sober second thought.  It goes against the fundamentals  of democracy when a review of a piece of legislation as important as this does not come back to the committee of the Commons that dealt with it originally.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked about this at some length at the committee.  It was very important because as the debate went around, all parties in the committee agreed with the change to the bill.  They agreed that when the bill came up for review that it should not go to a Senate committee but rather to  a committee of the House of Commons. It is very important that we not jeopardize the democracy for which we fought so hard.   It is very important that committee work be dealt with in a respectful way.  That subamendment was  considered  with forethought and with  definite ideas   that it was important to the legislation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might think that  this might have been  originally an oversight in the  bill.  However  Bill C-56, which deals with the ethics of the nation, uses exactly the same language. That bill is subject to a three year review.   It too could go directly to the Senate for review, an unelected, unrepresentative group of individuals who are friendly and appointed by the prime minister, instead of parliament and the health committee.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-53 concerning pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At  second reading stage, I spoke in support of  the bill, but also suggested a number of  improvements that should be included, including a re-evaluation, by 2006,  of all pesticides registered before 1995. Unfortunately, Bill C-53, as it now stands, does not contain such a provision. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois also proposed an amendment to prohibit for three years the registration or any new registration of pesticides used for cosmetic purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the government rejected it. I also raised  concern about the lack of support for biological agriculture research. I always thought we should do everything in our power to end our dependency on pesticides and have a more biological and environmentally harmless agriculture.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these suggestions came from the environment committee  report entitled “Pesticides: Making the Right Choice for the Protection of Health and the Environment”, to which I had contributed. Unfortunately, Bill C-53 includes  none of these proposals, which is quite deplorable. Nevertheless, this bill is a step in the right direction, considering that the most recent legislation, the Pest Control Products Act, dated back to  1969.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least the bill contains positive elements, and I would like to mention a few.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill provides for better  health and environmental protection through  special protection for the newborn and children. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes into consideration the overall exposure to pesticides, including exposure through food and water and exposure to pesticides used in the  home and school.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also takes into consideration the cumulative effects of pesticides which have the same mode of action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It encourages the reduction of risks posed by pesticides. For example, only pesticides contributing significantly to pest control are registered, and the dose and frequency of use have to be the lowest possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also favours registration of low risk products through comparative risk assessment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would make the registration process more transparent by making it public and allowing access to detailed assessment reports on registered pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, or PMRA, will be allowed to share scientific data with provincial, territorial, and international regulatory agencies. It will make for a better international joint review process by giving Canadian producers equal access to new and more secure pesticides that will help them be more  competitive on the market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would provide more stringent controls on pesticides after their registration by requiring from the producers a statement of the negative impact of  pesticides on human health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would require a re-evaluation of older pesticides 15 years after their registration. The minister would have the power to ban pesticides if the required data was not provided. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also provide increased powers of inspection and higher maximum penalties of up to $1 million for the most serious offences, when pesticides are not marketed or used in accordance with the law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would allow public input in the regulation of pesticides through consultations held before important decisions are made concerning registration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public could also contribute to the regulation of pesticides through special reviews and re-evaluations. Under the 2002 PCPA, everybody can ask the minister for a special review of a pesticide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the public could have an input through the reconsideration of a registration decision.</p>


	<A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the 2002 PCPA, anyone may file a notice of objection to an important registration decision. In addition, the review will be open to the public, which will have numerous opportunities to participate and will have access to most of the information received by the review panel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A public registry will include information on registrations, re-evaluations and special reviews, including the PMRA's detailed evaluations of the risks and values of pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to test data, the public may inspect the results of scientific tests submitted to justify registration applications.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud all these measures, but we could go further still. We are at report stage and we  still have an opportunity to put forward amendments to improve the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal today is to have Bill C-53 reflect the recommendations in the report of the standing committee on the environment, which I cited earlier, or the measures which Quebec is getting ready to take. I would like to mention a few of these.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last March, Quebec created a focus group on the use of pesticides in urban areas, which has released a report proposing various measures. One of these measures is to increase research and development budgets for alternatives to pesticides in order to encourage all initiatives in this regard and to help make them accessible to the public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group also called on the government to implement a communication plan including—and I am still speaking about Quebec—a periodically repeated national campaign to inform the public about the risks of using pesticides and about managing the environment; and to develop information tools, brochures, and a website aimed at citizens who wish to buy pesticides or services requiring the use of pesticides, or who wish to use alternative methods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of Quebec has already approved several of these measures. Right now, the national broadcasting service is televising warnings about the use of pesticides in an urban setting. A number of municipalities in Quebec are getting ready to introduce motions prohibiting the use of pesticides  to improve the appearance of lawns within their jurisdiction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are tangible measures which this government should have taken in Bill C-53, but it did not go far enough. It stopped short. One might think it had made commitments to pesticide manufacturers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the government not join Quebec? Why does it not provide funding  to Quebec to lead an even more effective campaign so we can stop the use of pesticides in urban areas?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are positive measures that can be taken, and I find it unfortunate that the federal government does not go that far in Bill C-53. There are alternatives to pesticides, but the government has to promote them. From what we have heard from  the Minister of Health, she seems to think that the mere passing of this bill will be enough. People will keep spraying their lawns with  carcinogenic chemicals just for the sake of having a nice lawn, without being informed by the federal government of the potential, but nonetheless real,  danger   of using pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must go further, and the amendments before us today would take us there. If the government, particularly the Minister of Health, believes in the precautionary principle, if it wants to protect the health of children and pregnant women,  it will have to adopt these amendments as soon as possible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that right now, at report stage, the Minister of Health should make a necessary addition by including a date in this bill. It should be specified that the cosmetic use of pesticides in urban areas will be banned within three years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the minister will be proposing other amendments before this debate is over. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the debate at report stage of Bill C-53, an act dealing with pest control products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset let me say that I come to the debate with a great deal of disappointment and anger at the process. Once again the democratic process for this Chamber has been ignored and the hard work of elected members has been ignored.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have before us today two amendments sponsored by the Minister of Health from the Government of Canada. To do what? To negate, to nullify, the effects of two amendments proposed to the government in good faith at the committee stage in order to improve the act. We are not just talking about two amendments that have now been wiped out by the arbitrary, unilateral actions of the government. We are talking about an entire process that has been held to ransom by a government that refuses to take any criticism or any constructive suggestions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want you to know, Mr. Speaker, that in fact our committee, the health committee of parliament, worked long and hard to make Bill C-53 a better piece of legislation. We went into the process with good faith. We said at the outset that the bill represented a significant improvement from the old legislation, which dates back to 1969. We said that it was a good start and was clearly beginning to address the concerns of Canadians over the last number of years but that it fell short in a significant number of areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We committed ourselves to work hard at the committee to improve the bill, and so we did. The opposition members of parliament together sponsored over 150 amendments to the bill. The NDP alone initiated 56 substantive amendments dealing with serious flaws in the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did we get anywhere? Was any of it considered seriously? No. A few token gestures were made, a couple of tiny amendments  were made in response to our concerns, but by and large there was a complete wall of disapproval for anything  the opposition proposed. Yet here was an opportunity for the government to actually listen to the voices of Canadians and listen to the concerns shared by political parties right across the scene. Once again the arrogance, the absolute arbitrary nature, of the government has ruled the day and here we are today with no amendments from the committee, except for two from the government to negate and nullify the work of our committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at those  two amendments. Motion No. 1 is an amendment from the government to reverse a motion sponsored by the Progressive Conservatives at the committee stage which would in fact deal with the concern raised by many witnesses before our committee pertaining to confidential business information. We tried very hard in  our committee, and the amendment from the Conservatives did just this, to ensure that industry would not use these provisions of the act to deny necessary information to consumers and to prevent individuals from taking the necessary precautions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original amendment actually attempted to narrow the definition of confidential business information to ensure that the public good was preserved over the needs of industry. What do we have today? An amendment from the government to negate that work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, it is hard to know how this is even in order. I accept the judgment of the Chair, but what was the point of all the work of committee? If even the little steps we were able to take were negated and pushed aside, what is the point of us even being here? What did we spend all those hours of work doing if it was only to see the government decide it was worthless and our contributions were meaningless?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second motion before us today, if we can believe it, in fact  reverses an amendment at our committee that called  for a process to ensure that the  new pest controls act would be reviewed by the House of Commons as opposed to the original intent of the government to have it reviewed by either the House of Commons or the Senate or both.</p>


	<A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took the position, justifiably so, that this is a matter for the elected representatives of the country. The review of something as important as the pest control  act should be brought to the House and we should have a chance to verify its effectiveness and to make necessary changes depending on the results.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we have here?  An amendment that goes back  to the  original and says that the act will be reviewed  by a committee of the House, of the Senate or both Houses.  I cannot believe it.  These are simple little steps we are taking to bring some sense to this place and the government vetoes them each and every time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just on that point, the government originally called for the act to be reviewed every 10 years.  We expressed our concern about that provision to begin with because 10 years is an awful long period of time. We wondered why the government was not willing to have the legislation placed under the scrutiny of objective eyes in a timely way so that we could make the necessary changes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we think the government could accept the idea of a five year review period?  Not on your life, Mr. Speaker.  We got seven years.  We made a little progress, did we not? We got  a little compromise. In seven years from this day we will get a chance to review this legislation that impacts on the lives and health of Canadians.   We are talking about pesticides.  We are talking about products that are toxic.  We are talking about products that cause harm to human health and well-being.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the committee took this process so seriously.  That is why we worked so hard to get changes. That is why we tried to get even something as simple as the precautionary principle entrenched in law, which has  already been done.  It was done when the legislation pertaining to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act was dealt with.  At that time, parliament saw the wisdom of including within the law an actual provision to ensure that in terms of the whole framework of the law the precautionary principle or the do no harm principle should be the guiding way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the health committee could not get that for the bill.  It is gone.  The government basically said “no more precautionary principle”.  It is as if they are dirty words and we cannot say them any more. Every time we tried to make an amendment at committee to entrench the precautionary principle in the bill, we were shut down. The government said no, we cannot do it, it is not allowed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the  review of the reproductive technologies bill, which is another piece of legislation where one would expect to see precaution entrenched in the law. The committee actually recommended that the principle be in the law.  What did the government do?  It took it out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we try to find out why, there is no answer.  We asked if direction has gone out from on high to all departments that thou shalt not use the words precautionary principle.  It would seem so.  It would seem that the government has caved in to the demands of industry, to the absolute dictates of the corporate sector, which wants an unfettered marketplace, which does not want to have to deal with restrictions in terms of sale of products, which does not want to have to put labels on its products, which does not want to report to anybody, which does not want a transparent process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, rather than being the body, the institution, that safeguards public health, is in complicity with the industry in stopping every initiative that makes sense in terms of human health and safety. That is what we are talking about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we are so outraged with the process today.  We worked so hard to make the bill better, to respect the wishes of Canadians and to ensure that the government is doing its job, which is  to make sure that the health protection of Canadians is its first priority, not the profit margins of the industry, not the greed of the corporate sector, but the health and safety of Canadians, and to take every step to ensure that Canadians are protected at all costs and that nothing is allowed on to the market unless it is proven to be safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the precautionary principle is so important.  It says that thou shalt ensure that all products on the market are safe. It should not be up to the consumer to prove harm.  That is the difference, that is why it is so important and that is why the actions of the government are so wrong.  That is why we oppose these motions and why we will keep fighting to the last moment for an improved bill dealing with pest control products. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will  start slowly.  But  my speech may become more passionate later on.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our amendments were rejected because they were  out of order and could not   be debated.  Motions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 pertain to the precautionary principle, which is a good thing when one has to  make an important decision.  The precautionary principle gives a direction when  officials and an agency, which does not exist by the way,   make decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawmakers, and we are part of them, were providing guidance for  future decisions.   Previously, the legislation was reviewed every ten years. From now on,   it will   be reviewed every seven years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get to that, I will speak about the last motion, the amendment proposed by our friends from the government party.  Members of the committee  were taken in.  I personally voted against that motion, against the proposed amendment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our Liberal friends said “We agree with that.  Let us remove the Senate and the joint committee”.  They sought to please but  knew full well that their motion would be defeated  in this House.  It goes against  parliamentary tradition.  So they made a correction.  They were proud at committee.  They boasted and said “Very well, we will give power back to the House of Commons”. However, they knew full well that the government would not allow it.  It makes no sense.  So they changed that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between you and me, we did not agree with having  the House of Commons  act alone.  It is a prerogative and a tradition in the House of Commons.  That motion  will certainly gather support.  But this proves that members of the Liberal committee, or I should say the Liberal  members of the committee—</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An  hon. member:</b> Same thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. André Bachand:</b> It is the same thing. My colleagues from the Bloc are correcting me, and I thank them for that. I was saying that the Liberal members of the committee get on any bandwagon, knowing that their work and their decisions will amount to nothing anyway. It is not only the opposition that was taken in; so were our friends across the way. They accepted an amendment, and  were slapped on the wrist for it. The government told them “Do not do that. You have no right. We do not agree with that”. They apologized and promised to  correct their mistake in  the House. They will all vote in favour of Motion No. 7, despite the fact that all committee members approved the amendment. This is not serious.   It is terrible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People complain about the rigour of the committees. The Liberals, especially those in the back, close to the curtains, are saying that the members must have a role to play in committee. When they play their role, they get slapped on the wrist. Then, they say “We made a mistake. We did not think that this would make such an  impact”. Perhaps  they  should read more about history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, let us talk about the second motion that was approved. It changes an amendment which we proposed. It is scandalous. Is it the lobby of big business that put their backs to  the wall in only a matter of days?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was said is very simple.  There were two elements, clauses 43(4) and 43(5), which were to apply together as far as protection of confidential information is concerned.  Clause 43(5)   refers to components and then adds “of health or environmental concern”, and we are not doing anything to that.  What is this bill about?  Is it for businesses or individuals?  All we did was add an and.  The government's reply was “No, we are going to put back the or”.  This gives an out to companies that do not want to make public confidential information that might have an impact on the environment and on health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall certain Liberals on the committee talking about the necessity of “looking after pregnant women and unborn babies.  We must think about future generations”.  I think that thought was given instead to “present and future businesses”.  It was simple and we are very much disappointed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were taken in as far as the Senate and the joint committee were concerned.  This proves their inability to connect with reality.  Now they are changing and heading off to spend the summer at home, saying “We were wrong, we would have liked to give the House of Commons more power but we are not entitled to do so”.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawyers came before the committee, people who are experts on parliamentary procedure.  We could have asked them the question but were told “No, it is fine. They are right and we agree.” This  is very disappointing.  It has taken  30 years to review this legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing is clear.  There are advertisements on the radio and on TV, or in the newspapers, there are campaigns.  They say “What do you have against bugs?” A person goes into a store and ask the clerk “What do you have against bugs?” meaning “to use  against bugs” and the answer is “Nothing”.  “What do you have against dandelions?” “Nothing”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has two meanings, since it can also mean “What objection do you have to bugs?” It shows that people are already starting to be more careful about the use of chemicals.  Some will say that there are advantages to use, that is true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of cosmetic use and the issue of the precautionary principle were both rejected.  All they wanted to do was bring the law up to date, but we are still ten years behind what the public wants to see, and what it already knows, ten years behind what the municipalities and provinces are doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said it often before and I will repeat it: the Liberals only have one single vision, one single strategy,  it is for the Liberal party. They have no vision, no strategy for the country. Look at the legislative program, it is paltry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee, people work like dogs to try to get some good work done. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens. All they want is to save this government and this political party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due respect,  Liberal members are simply machines; machines that say yes or no. Why did the committee members  not stand up to the minister, who wanted to undo what they had voted on in committee? Why would they not stand up to her?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the time has come to reform the committee system, the House and  parliament. However, more importantly, it is time to change governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many people, Bill C-53 may not be a big deal, but again, this is ample proof  of all the work that can be done in committee and  all  the trust that can be built in committee. There is another  bill, Bill C-56 on reproductive technologies,  being considered in the health committee. We will try to begin the debate before the House recesses for the summer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the work that I did on behalf of my party, there were arguments for and against. We have been trying to build trust between the different opposition parties, and also between all of the parties, including the government party. Amendments have already been passed, and we have principles that we would like to discuss and adopt, if possible, in order to speed up the process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that  clause by clause consideration is slow. It is very slow. We go about this in good faith. We wanted the labelling to be more complete, but we were defeated on this point. We forgive them. They have no vision, but they are forgiven for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when we are able to agree on an amendment, which is passed, we expect all of the committee members to defend this amendment, every one of them, from both sides of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, once again, the relationship of trust that was established in committee disintegrated, and this does not bode well for the trust between the people of this country and the government for the next few years.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take the floor today in this debate on Bill C-53, an act to protect human health and safety and theenvironment by regulating products used for thecontrol of pests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was high time, to say the least, that the House debated such a bill. We should not forget that this bill will amend an existing statute that was enacted in 1969, some 33 years ago, to regulate pest control in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, many scientists have stated their views, a standing committee of the House has examined the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment, and many reports have demonstrated a direct impact on the health of children, infants and pregnant women, but the government has waited 33 years before introducing a bill to regulate the whole sector of pest control and pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all the more surprising since the environment commissioner has stated clearly enough her assessment of pesticides management in Canada. She said that more than 6,000 pesticides are available on the market, with 500 different active ingredients, and that the great majority of them have not been re-evaluated in Canada for many years. Some said they have not been re-evaluated since 1988.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pesticides were still on the market for the public to buy, without any re-evaluation, and having been registered on the basis of 30 year old data, old analysis schemes, and old public health protection benchmarks. They are available on the market, but we do not necessarily know the impact they can have on the health of Quebecers and Canadians, and on the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said from the outset that we felt  Bill C-53 was a step in the right direction to make this necessary reassessment of  pesticides that are currently available on the market. At the time, we also indicated that this review of the existing legislation, through Bill C-53, should allow us to set up a process in keeping with  the clearly stated criteria that were the object of a consensus a few years ago within the Standing Committee on the Environment. These criteria were based on the development of alternatives in the fight against pest in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This review of the bill was going to allow us to ensure that new means and tools would be put in place to control pest while protecting the environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was under these circumstances that we proposed amendments in committee. Earlier, my colleagues from the NDP and the Conservative Party spoke eloquently about the strength of the Liberal majority, which fundamentally rejected the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> It was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health.</p>


	<A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</b> —indeed, among others, the parliamentary secretary, who was acting as the government's puppet. He listened to his officials, but he was very far from listening to what the public really wanted. What people want is a process and tools to  reduce the use of pesticides in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must point out that this bill and the current initiative must not lead to a ban of pesticides. Let me explain. It is not that I do not think that pesticides must eventually be banned, in three or five years, but this must be done in the respect of the various jurisdictions.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House believe that the federal  government's responsibility regarding pesticide  management is limited to the registration and marketing of the products. We also believe that the provinces are responsible for managing the sale and use of pesticides, and that the municipalities have a responsibility regarding the implementation of certain rules or provisions adopted by various levels of government. In the case of municipalities, it is toward the provincial government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stress this point because a number of rulings have been issued. I am thinking for instance of a judgment concerning the town of Hudson. The supreme court supported the town of Hudson regarding the implementation of a bylaw banning the use of pesticides. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard:</b> For cosmetic purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</b> Of course, for cosmetic purposes, as my colleague from Hochelaga--Maisonneuve just reminded me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us keep in mind that those supreme court decisions are based on the fact that municipalities are  under the Cities and Towns Act of Quebec and the Municipal Code of Quebec. It is therefore under Quebec legislation that the court supported the decisions of municipalities to prohibit the use of pesticides for cosmetic purposes.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the present situation require us to do? It requires what the government has decided to do, that is set up in Quebec a committee, a working group on this issue and develop a policy, which, hopefully, will be tabled soon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did this working group, the Cousineau working group, say? Many things. It came to the conclusion that the Government of Quebec wanted to eliminate the use of pesticides within five years in the case of lawns and within three years for trees and shrubs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More basically, the working group recommended the implementation of a pest management code under which a national standard would be established in Quebec for the use of pesticides. This national standard, which would be the result of a consensus, would be implemented by the municipalities in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come back to what I was saying earlier, which is that the federal government most certainly has an important role to play. We are disappointed because the government refused to support the Bloc amendments designed, among other things, to develop organic agriculture in Quebec and provide financial incentives, as is currently being done in Europe. The government opposed the establishment of a program proposed in committee by the Bloc Quebecois.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois had proposed to speed up the implementation of biopesticides registration. As we know, there are at present only 30 biopesticides sold on the Canadian market, compared to 150 in the United States. On this side of the House, we would have wished to speed up the implementation and registration process of those biopesticides, in order to have real pest control  providing for the use of alternative solutions.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-271333"></A><a HREF="#Int-271414"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-271324"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence as well as that of everyone here today. It is a  privilege and an honour to speak today to report stage of Bill C-53 and the amendments to this important bill. Many parliamentarians have worked to update the bill but my fear is that without the input and amendments that were defeated at committee all the work will be for nought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have had the opportunity to ask questions in the House this is my first opportunity to recognize the results of the May byelection. As New Democrats we were successful in obtaining the seat of Windsor West, and I feel compelled to recognize the support and confidence that was placed in me.  I would appreciate the indulgence of the House in this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, Bill C-53 is the Pest Control Products Act. The amendments related to the campaign in which we said  the environment and health care played a significant role in  our community. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want  to acknowledge the hard work of all my supporters during the campaign. My heartfelt thanks go out to them for the work they did on a day to day basis. My family, my wife Terry Chow, as well as my father, mother, sister and brother have helped on all my campaigns in the past. I appreciate their ongoing support during this transition period.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others who have assisted me are my extended family, relatives, and friends in general. I was fortunate enough to have the support of volunteers from Windsor West and abroad, which is important for our community. I got a chance to learn about other communities and they got a chance to learn about Windsor West and the issues we face.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also acknowledge the labour movement of the city of Windsor. Its leadership, members and retirees all played an important role in the election. They have also had an influence on  environmental policies which relate to Bill C-53.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a difficult time even considering running in the byelection. Prior to seeking elected office in the House of Commons I represented ward two in the west part of the city of Windsor where I was elected in 1997 and returned in 2000. I was also a youth co-ordinator at the multicultural council where I helped youth at risk who had lost their way find employment and return to school. I appreciated those experiences but the Liberal government's lack of action and political will and its inability to enact legislation that would mean real and substantive change compelled me to seek the seat of Windsor West. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this point which brings me to Bill C-53, the Pest Control Products Act. It is an example of the government's lack of political will because  it is vacant of real substantive change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Windsor West and Essex County we are faced with some of the most deplorable rates of cancer, respiratory diseases and birth defects in the province and the country. A  recent health study by James Brophy and Michael Gilbertson compared Windsor's rates of cancer and other diseases with those of 17 other areas in the great lakes region. The study found evidence of a connection between the environment and health. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad reality is that much of the degradation comes from pollution from the United States where we have limited control. This has been compounded by Canada's abysmal record on the environment. We have been seeing a funding freeze that makes Brian Mulroney an environmentalist compared to the current Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Herron:</b> He was. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse:</b> Yes, absolutely. It is proven by fact. However we have no credibility to tell the United States to clean up its environment and stop the pollution that is killing Canadians when we have a far worse record. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the problem, Windsor city council with the support of citizens has taken action and shown leadership that relates to Bill C-53 and pesticide use. Whereas Bill C-53 is vague and provides limited direction, the city of Windsor has shown responsible government through comprehensive community input and the ability to take action. That is the real failing of Bill C-53.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at our reliance on pesticides and their negative impacts on health and the environment one must wonder why it took so long for the government to update the Pest Control Products Act. It was passed in 1969. Ironically, I was born in 1968 so I have lived all my life under this bill, a bill with a real connection to our health and welfare. It has taken this long to update it. I am concerned it may take 20 or 30 years to do another update even though we are talking about potentially 7 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons I have reservations about the bill is that approximately 140 amendments were put forward at committee stage to address its problems. With two minor exceptions they were all defeated. Ironically, this defeats some of the committee work we have heard about from my hon. colleague today. It undermines the parliamentary system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defeated amendments were tabled in response to  the input of witnesses regarding: the precautionary principle; pollution prevention, which is important because preventive measures can save money, health, and more importantly, lives; use and risk reduction; cosmetic ban; labelling; and independent science based research. These have all been abandoned. It is a sad commentary on a government which is bowing to industry as opposed to its citizens.</p>


	<A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that those issues cannot be entrenched in the bill really bugs me. The city of Windsor's plan and government which take  action demonstrate that political will and public consultation is meaningful and can have results. The city of Windsor introduced a best  management practices committee    for pesticide reduction. The action plan is  an aggressive reduction of pesticide use for cosmetic and non-essential purposes with the  goal of eventual elimination. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been the   immediate elimination of  the use of pesticides. A committee has been struck to report on an annual basis. This   is really interesting because the report  from the  federal government will go back seven years, yet  a municipality can  report back in one year. We know what the federal government has done to municipalities over the last several years,  having put  them under the thumb of downloading and cutting resources and giving them no guidance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also important is the ongoing involvement of the private sector, public sector, labour, landscapers, gardeners, horticulturists, and commercial care specialists. That demonstrates there is an important role that all these partners can play. It is made easier by having books and educational material available so the public can make educated decisions.  The failure of the bill is it  does not provide an opportunity to make sure that the public is well informed to make conscious decisions and more important, move toward the solutions that they seek.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main concerns  with regard to pesticides are simple. Pesticides are designed to kill and are deliberately introduced to our environment and then into our food. That  in itself should be  reason enough to have at least the five years that was requested, not the seven years for  examining the bill. Only about one per cent of pesticides actually reach their intended targets. The rest is released into the environment which  affects humans and wildlife. We know the connection with our environment and our health care. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Windsor West in particular with our high rates, it is very important that this is addressed because if these things are not tied together we will  see continual degradation. With the seven year lapse in  reviewing it, if  harmful things are found, we will be bogged down in very comprehensive ways in trying to  make improvements or to ban substances that are very important to act on. In the past  it has taken far too long to address the use of DDT and other like substances   in public areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many pesticides do not break down. They accumulate in living organisms and affect the reproductive  and immune systems of humans and animals. Once again  Windsor and Essex county has the highest rates of birth defects in that area according to the Gilbertson and Brophy report. If we do not address the pesticide use in our community, we will  see that continually entrenched in our  environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we cannot support the bill as it is.   The amendments that were talked about, especially the 52 that were proposed by the New Democratic Party, were very important to address.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my compliments to the member for Windsor West on  his remarks on this legislation.  Although he was not a member of the Standing Committee on Health, it is obvious that he has a fair amount of institutional knowledge on the file. He  raised a lot of the salient points that should be considered in  the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the privilege but also the arduous task of  sitting on the environment committee in 1999 when we undertook a one year review of the pesticide management regime.  An all party report was tabled. The committee  heard from numerous stakeholders, not just environmentalists but health care professionals as well as the participants of the Pest Management Advisory Council itself.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were aspects  we agreed to in that  review of the  legislation. To summarize,  clearly when we are evaluating toxicity for pesticides or any particular toxin, there has to be a margin  of safety under consideration that would take into account the health of the most vulnerable of our population, they being pregnant women, the elderly and children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker,  you  were a very active participant in the election campaign  in November 2000.  It is always good and healthy for us to see what was in the platforms of our competitors.  There were  three particular planks in the Progressive Conservative platform in November 2000.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially the platform outlined that  a  Progressive Conservative government would table new pesticide legislation that would modernize the existing 30 year old legislation. We give kudos to the Government of Canada for adopting another Progressive Conservative initiative, very similar to what was done  with respect to  free trade, deregulation, tax reform, privatization and winning the war on inflation. We know the Liberals are  not   capable of coming up with their own ideas so the taking of our ideas is more than welcome.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the Minister of Health for tabling new legislation  in the early weeks of her taking over that  file. We said at that time that exposure levels and toxicity of pesticides would be evaluated with consideration to the effects on our most vulnerable populations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also  want to highlight the second aspect, which is a cornerstone of what the all party committee flagged in its report of June 1999. There has to be public disclosure of what the  formulants are, those ingredients other than the active ingredients of pesticides. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous individuals who are concerned about  pesticides in the environment recognize that quite often the formulants are actually more hazardous to human health than perhaps the active ingredient itself.  That is why there has to be  full and public disclosure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also  advocate trying to have a public awareness campaign, almost to the degree there is  now in educating Canadians about the health implications of cigarette smoking.  We need to show that there is a cumulative effect of adding more pesticides into our environment.  We need to  foster a culture of reduced reliance on pesticides and have a more   integrated pest management approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking directly to the motions, I am quite concerned about Motion No. 1 moved by the governing party, the Liberal Party of Canada.  It has essentially gutted a Progressive Conservative amendment that was supported almost unanimously by both sides of the House at the  committee stage.</p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the democratically elected individuals of our country who have said in good faith that this makes sense.  They are educated parliamentarians who have listened to witnesses and understood that there has to be disclosure of substances that are in the pesticides themselves.  This  reflects on the issue of formulants.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tory amendment would have specified that confidential business information should be  the only information legitimately withheld from the public.  All other information regarding health effects, environmental impacts and  efficacy are defined as in the public interest. Essentially  we are saying  that the amendment specified exactly what information is to be kept confidential.  The public has the right  to be informed of the rest. All members of the committee supported that amendment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I compliment the member for Winnipeg North Centre  who serves as the health critic for the NDP, the Canadian Alliance which stepped  up to the plate on this amendment and the learned Liberal members, but here we are  now   pulling it back.  We are pulling back an amendment that Liberal members supported, including the government representative for the ministry.  We find that to be quite sad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before us are three motions that essentially speak to the precautionary principle.  The precautionary principle is an international concept which  says that the preponderance of evidence, the weight of evidence shows that there could be a detrimental effect to the environment or to  human health. When factoring in the application of a particular substance, a very strong precautionary approach should be taken into account.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we had in 1987 when we adopted a protocol on ozone depleting gasses done by the Progressive Conservative government led by the Right Hon.  Brian Mulroney.  It was also the same precautionary principle that was adopted by the United Nations where the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney played an immense role in the 1992 Rio earth summit in that regard.  It is a concept that by definition  is used in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.   We  see it referenced in section 20.2 of  the proposed act.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are calling on the Government of Canada to  utilize it when it  makes  decisions.  Whether it is the re-evaluation of an existing pesticide or the proposed registration or application of a new pesticide,  we need to ensure that we take a very strong precautionary approach. That is the minimum that we owe Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  provides a clear transparency about how the Pest Management Review Agency utilizes the precautionary principle.  It told us that the precautionary principle is utilized across the board in its decision making process. The witnesses had said that they asked for it. If  it actually uses the precautionary approach, why not enshrine it in the act?  Why not make it a duty?  Why not make the Government of Canada accountable by  having a clear standard?  It makes a whole lot of sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to speak in support of Motion No. 5 moved by  the New Democrats.  They point out that we need  a national pesticide use and sales database and  a national pesticide use survey. Canada is the only OECD country without a national pesticide sales database.  The only other major industrialized country that does not have a database on the use of pesticides is the Czech Republic, which was mentioned by the auditor general just a few years ago. Motion No. 6 moved  by the New Democrats speaks to the same  issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final motion we would want to support but we would have preferred at least a five year review as opposed to a seven year review is that  moved  by the Liberal government to ensure that we do not have a 30 year old act again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kudos to the government for revising an act that is 30 years old. It is sad that it is not pioneering.  We are  discussing  a mediocre bill which deserves mediocre support.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-271503"></A><a HREF="#Int-271636"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-271414"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as members know the bill updates legislation that was approved over 30 years ago.  Since 1990 actually, there have been several recommendations on how to update it.  For instance, there were the so-called blue book, the purple book as well, and the 1999 report of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development.  They all formulated ideas and recommendations to improve the Pest Control Products Act, which we are now amending with the bill. All these efforts have been useful over time in producing   the bill that is before us for discussion and in strengthening the old legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like at this point in the debate to commend the chair of the health committee for not rushing through the bill, but for having listened to a wide range of witnesses and for adopting, with the help of committee members, a good number of amendments which definitely will strengthen the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great pleasure for the members of the environment committee who worked on the committee's report entitled “Pesticides.   Making the Right Choice for Human Health and the Environment”, which as we know was published about two years ago, to see the following amendments being passed by the health committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is the fact that the words “acceptable risk” are clearly defined. Second is  the inclusion, even if in a narrow scope and manner, of the very important precautionary principle,  in clause 20, I believe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third is the fact that formulants are now included in the definition of a pesticide.  It is a very important step and a breakthrough in committee. Fourth,  the aggregate exposure and cumulative effect now have to be considered in the assessment of risk and in the re-evaluation and special reviews.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth,  there is a parliamentary review every seven years from now on.  We also suggested a shorter period, nevertheless it is still good stuff. Sixth,  the annual status report will also include registrations and lower risk products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, the protection of children by way of a definition in committee is extended also to future generations, a general principle of capital importance. Eighth,  the review of lower risk products will be expedited. Ninth,  there is now stronger language favouring alternative products and also favouring strategies as defined in the preamble.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are definitely positive improvements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still some shortcomings. First, for instance, there is no statutory mandate given to the pest management review agency, which we very warmly recommended.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is no inclusion of the substitution principle,  therefore there will be no requirement to deregister older products as  newer and safer ones come on the market. Third, there is a broad definition of what constitutes confidential business information.  It remains as it is in the old legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, there is no requirement for a sales database, but I hope this will be resolved by additional funding for the chief statistician. Fifth,  there is no requirement to label toxic formulants, contaminants or microcontaminants.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is no phasing out of cosmetic pesticides, a measure that was proposed by our colleague from Montreal West, I believe, in her private member's bill, which actually was unanimously accepted   by the House some months ago. It is another shortcoming of Bill C-53 that the cosmetic use of pesticides is not included,  but one draws comfort from the fact that the supreme court last June set a precedent by saying that yes, the municipalities do have the power to ban the cosmetic use of pesticides, and   yes, the public interest can and should be served by municipalities. Therefore the legislation somehow opens up or definitely makes room  for the municipalities to take the initiatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very heartening to see that municipal elected representatives have not been bamboozled by the pesticide industry's public relations campaign every spring and that today over 30 municipalities across Canada have banned the cosmetic use of pesticides on private property and in some cases also on public property. It is also heartening to know that here on Parliament Hill  pesticides are not used on the lawns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection also one has to say that the pesticide industry, in an attempt to introduce its  products to the market, uses abbreviations and names which remove entirely the notion that what is being offered  is actually a pesticide. We have fancy names like 2,4-D, which is a fancy abbreviation to convince the potential consumer that it is not a chemical that has danger for children and pets on the lawn and that it can be used safely. The fact is that every form of pesticide, whether it is described as mild or not, is a killer. If it kills insects, it contains substances that in certain accumulations and with a certain intensity can be very dangerous to human health, particularly to infants, to living beings of a smaller size and  to adults in certain instances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore one can ask  the question: What is wrong in having on the front lawn some beautiful, nice, yellow dandelions beautifying the landscape? There is evidently a cultural fixation here, particularly in suburban Canada, that the lawn has to be perfect and that it cannot contain anything but the blade. I hope there  now will be a changing culture over time whereby we will see yellow flowers on  front or backyard lawns and  people will not consider them to be bad, considering that they are also part of the natural habitat and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, the bill tells the manufacturers of pesticides that the government does recognize the fact that pesticides, which are euphemistically called pest control products, are actually dangerous substances and they should be used rarely and with extreme care. Particular care ought to be given to the training of the people using them, particularly in agriculture through the WHMIS program. It is good to know that in the bill there is a clause containing a measure that was firmly and in a very eloquent manner proposed by the member for Ottawa West when we had the hearings in committee when writing the report on pesticides  a couple of years ago.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that the industry will not spend money on promoting through advertising ideas that  attempt to convince the public of the innocuousness of their products.  I think that Canadians are now better informed than ever before.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me say that the bill does have great potential.  It is most definitely badly needed as an improvement over the 1969 legislation.</p>

	Madam Speaker, on this side of the House, we do not have a problem of co-operation and we are very happy to work together.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie for his work in committee. I have often had the opportunity to say that it is in parliamentary committee that members show their real potential. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have the opportunity to get back to this, but we were disappointed by the fact that, although more than 150 amendments were moved by the opposition parties and by the government, all the amendments moved by the opposition, except for a few, were rejected. I think that a public policy bill, I would even say a public health and environment bill, such as the bill on pesticides, should not result in the kind of rather petty and mean spirited party politics the government  has resorted to, through its parliamentary secretary and this unfortunately too silent Liberal majority. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being said, the Bloc Quebecois has chosen to quickly support passage of the bill. All members of this House know well that this legislation was long overdue, since 1969, in fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Windsor West says he was born in 1968.  It  would be a lie if I were to claim the same, but we know that the act has not been reviewed since 1969.  There are 6,000 pesticides on the market, with over 500 active ingredients.  It is understandable that all those who are interested in the environment have indicated some concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the issue at stake? In Quebec for instance, we learned that one person in two uses pesticides for cosmetic purposes, for no other reason than to have a greener or more luxuriant lawn.  The use of pesticides  is bad for the environment. It has repercussions all along the food chain.  The government's slowness to act is unacceptable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other significant figure.  I read that pesticide sales for horticultural use between 1992 and 1996 rose significantly, by 60%.  When the statement is made that municipalities and local communities are closer to the people, it is interesting to note that the movement to ban pesticide use for cosmetic purposes came initially from the municipal and local community level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went right up to the supreme court.  Pesticides fall under several jurisdictions.  Retail sales are a prerogative of the provincial government, but everything to do with registration, access by  consumers and retailers, pesticide classification and labelling, is a federal responsibility. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie will agree with me that a number of witnesses who came before the parliamentary committee wanted us to know how dysfunctional the PMRA is, how inefficient it was, how much time it took to register products, and how dubious the judgment used in making decisions was.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one positive measure.  One of the reasons we support the bill is that I understand that, without a true joint registration process with the United States, when a manufacturer files a compliance notice and application for registration, it will be possible to avoid starting from scratch and to instead take inspiration from what has already been done, from studies and monographs which may come from the U.S. or other countries, instead of having to start from square one.  We like to think of this as one element of many that will help speed up the registration process.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want very much to see the registration process speeded up, because  there is the whole issue of biopesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that there are pests in the environment, that a certain number of them must be eliminated, and that products must be used. But we are saying that there must be ecological concerns, and the whole area of biopesticides could  make it possible for environmental concerns to be better addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak about a number of amendments put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. Once again, it is rather sad to see the partisan antics of this government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I draw attention to the Minister of the Environment. There is one good thing about him; he trains at the gym with me. He is in fairly good physical condition, and he will need a lot of energy to convince cabinet to sign the Kyoto protocol.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing he could do for the member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, who celebrated his birthday yesterday, the best present he could give him, would be to convince cabinet to sign the Kyoto protocol without further ado. Let us make the connection between the Kyoto protocol and everything going on with pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a number of witnesses told the committee that there are products which have been around for 20 or 30 years and which have not been re-evaluated. We are therefore asking that these products be re-evaluated within five years. I believe that the amendment put forward by the Bloc Quebecois mentioned 2006 at the latest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were surprised to see this amendment defeated. This could put Canada and Quebec in an extremely unfortunate situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois   put forward several amendments, which would make it mandatory to re-evaluate by 2006  all pesticides registered before 1995, without exception. We understand the whole logic behind re-evaluating pesticides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are perhaps alternatives now on the market which would be less harmful to the environment. We understand that this may not have been the case in 1979, in 1983 and in 1988. But in 2002, with the help of technology and research, these are perhaps alternatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that one of the Scandinavian countries automatically requires that old pesticides be eliminated. The member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie could tell me whether it is Sweden or Norway. Nonetheless, there is one country which automatically requires that old pesticides be replaced by new ones, which are less damaging to the environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment moved by the Bloc Quebecois regarding this mandatory re-evaluation was inspired by what is being done in Scandinavian countries. Again, it is unfortunate that the government chose to adopt a totally partisan attitude,  because the bill would have been greatly improved had the government voted in favour of the amendment by the Bloc Quebecois. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding another amendment brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois, we think that the act should be subject to a review. In fact, most acts that are voted on here are subject to a mandatory review, whether it is the Employment Equity Act or the Assisted Human Reproduction Act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assisted human reproduction bill contains a provision that requires a three year review of the  act. It would have been interesting to see the government follow the same logic with this bill. It is important to review legislation in areas where technological advances occur at a rapid pace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, the government wanted a  ten year review. However, a lot of things can happen in ten years. I think the parliamentary secretary will agree with me on that. Ten years is a long period. It is two mandates, or three mandates with this Prime Minister, since he calls an election every three and a half years. In any case, no one knows what the future holds. It will be interesting to see what happens in February. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, we brought forward an amendment calling for a five year review. It was a good compromise between a ten year review and the yearly review proposed by the New Democratic Party. We were sad to see that the amendment was rejected. However, we will continue to work hard to improve this bill, which is very important for public health and for the environment.</p>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today in support of this legislation.  I thank all hon. members who sat on the health committee with me for their work in making changes to this bill.  I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Minister of Health for recognizing that members in the House saw that the bill needed some changes. The minister was very good to work with us in  putting forward recommendations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind all hon. members that five  amendments came from opposition members and were accepted by the government. They include the preamble, which encourages alternative approaches, and  the mandate of informing the public, which we wanted to ensure  was increased.  We also accepted reviews from other OECD countries and the cancellation of the consultation on the policy codes of practice; and for greater certainty the protection for children that it extended to future generations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government members put forward amendments dealing with the definition of acceptable risk; the definition of formulas; expediting the evaluation of reduced risk pesticides; and the recognition of the importance of dealing with minor use pesticides and dealing with them expeditiously.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This committee work has showed that members of parliament working together can put forward amendments and put forward a bill  representing the interests of all Canadians across this country, whether members of an environmental group or farmers.  That is what this bill does.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would aggressively modernize the Canadian pest management legislation.  It would safeguard Canadians and the environment while ensuring that our nation's farmers would have access to safe pesticides which would ensure an abundant food supply and allow them to compete with other farmers around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-53 furthers three important goals designed to benefit all Canadians and it respects what Canadians have been telling the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Pest Control Products Act would strengthen  protection for Canadians and their environment.  This act would specifically protect segments of the population who are most vulnerable to health risks created by pesticides such as infants,  seniors and pregnant women. It would also require  the Minister of Health to consider a margin of safety, an increase of tenfold, when evaluating products designed to be used in and around homes and schools.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would also place an extra premium on human health by requiring the Minister of Health to account for the cumulative effects of pesticide use and its exposure.  This measure would ensure the protection of  Canadians from all possible negative consequences of pesticide exposure and use.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the act would strengthen the post-registration control of pesticides.  Under Bill C-53, pesticide producers would be required to report any adverse health or environmental impact created by their products.  The act would also require that older pesticides be re-evaluated 15 years after they were first registered.  This re-evaluation process would ensure that we would continue to use the latest scientific information and data when determining which pesticide products remain on the market.  It would also give the Minister of Health  authority to remove products from the market when the producer or the pest management product fails to supply re-evaluation data.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also dramatically increases  maximum fines for the most serious violations.   Violations may be punished by up to $1 million in fines and I believe these penalties should deter people from using unregistered pest management products or registered products used in an unlawful manner.</p>


	<A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the bill would make the registration process of pesticides more transparent.  It would also encourages public verification of the work of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency. This is something for which all groups have been asking. The bill  would ensure that we could watch over the work being done at the PMRA.  It would also establish public registries that would contain detailed evaluation reports of registered pesticides and reading rooms where people could go in and look specifically at the data the PMRA uses to make its decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increased transparency will build public confidence and will provide Canadians with the knowledge that we have some of the safest food in the world and that we have agencies to ensure that that continues to be the case.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the health committee recognized that the pest control products had potentially adverse human health effects, it also recognized that pesticides contributed greatly to the quality of life and the strength of the Canadian economy.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-53 and the regulations would provide Canadian farmers with better access to safe pest management products being registered in other developing and developed countries such as the United States, Great Britain and the OECD countries.   Canadian farmers can compete head to head with the Americans but they need the same products to do so.  The act and the regulations following it  would  allow Canadian farmers access to these products and allow them to do it in a safe and timely manner. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directive 2002-02 of the PMRA extends the NAFTA joint review programs for reduced risk pesticides to submissions made solely to the PMRA.  By adopting this reduced risk criteria used by the USEPA,  the directive harmonizes and moves toward harmonization of the registration process between our  two countries and will encourage more pesticide use within Canada and   safer   at reduced risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to conclude by saying that  members of parliament were allowed to listen directly to their constituents and put forward their concerns.   On my part that would be the farmers in my community and across the country.   The government allowed us to make sure that those  concerns were put on the table and  to make the changes  needed to ensure that all Canadians, whether an environmentalist or a farmer, had a voice in this debate.</p>

	moved that Bill C-404, An Act to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act (mail contractors), be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker it is a pleasure to rise today to speak in the House before my colleague, the member for Champlain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his riding, there are many  letter people delivering mail in rural areas.  We can see them, on rural routes, stop at every mailbox and put the mail in.  This bill concerns these people specifically.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain my reasons for introducing Bill C-404 and the working  conditions of these people, most of whom are  women. In closing, I will describe how their working conditions are negotiated and their agreement with  the Canada Post Corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 6,000 rural route mail couriers and suburban service contractors  in Canada and, as I said, most are women.  Their swages is often below minimum wage.  They have no job security and are not entitled to employee benefits.  Because of subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act, they are not entitled to collective bargaining.  They cannot unite to face their employer.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, this is unhealthy and unusual. You will understand why, Madam Speaker, and I am convinced that, as a woman, you will understand the request that I am making  here on behalf of the vast majority of women who work as rural route mail carriers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act say? It says that for the purposes of the application of part 1 of the Canada Labour Code to the Canada Post Corporation and to officers and employees of the corporation, a mail contractor is deemed not to be a dependent contractor or an employee within the meaning of those terms in subsection 3(1) of the code. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that mean? It means that part 1 of the Canada Labour Code, which deals with the acquisition of  bargaining rights and regulates the collective bargaining process, applies only to employees of the federal public sector, under the definition in subsection 3(1) of the code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There  court decisions deal with the status of rural route mail carriers as employees under the Canada Labour Code. In 1987, the Canada Industrial Relations Board, or CIRB, ruled that rural route mail carriers were employees. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the federal court later supported the position of the government and of the Canada Post Corporation by ruling that subsection 13(5) had specifically been included in the Canada Post Corporation Act to prevent rural route mail couriers from being  considered as employees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see what use the Canada Post Corporation has made of this court decision. In some cases, rural route mail couriers are treated no better than  animals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does subsection 13(5) deny rural route mail carriers such a fundamental right as the right of association, since the freedom of association is already protected under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Why is it that in their case, because of this legislation which favours a crown corporation, those rights are  being denied?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, the then minister  responsible for    Canada Post,   André Ouellet, who, by some strange coincidence—there are many happy coincidences—is now the president of the Canada Post Corporation, said that subsection 13(5) was necessary to preserve the financial health of Canada Post. </p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, we all remember, Canada Post was racking up a deficit year after year of several hundreds of millions of dollars. However, we know that since 1995, Canada Post  has been making a profit and is paying handsome dividends to the government. Between 1995 and 2000, $260 million have been paid to the federal government. Mail is a money maker for the sole shareholder of the corporation, which is the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Canada Post and the government not saying that rural route letter carriers are contract workers, and not employees? Letter carriers on rural routes are not contractors. I will explain why.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their contract with Canada Post forbids them from working for other companies while they deliver the mail. Therefore, they are not able to deliver, in their car or truck, other products, other pamphlets, or ad-bags. They work exclusively for Canada Post. They cannot serve any other master than Canada Post.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Post determines the sorting and delivery deadlines, and the delivery order. They cannot start their route at one end and return, or the opposite. The route is determined by Canada Post, and they must adhere to it strictly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of returns to the post office and the way the mail must be handled and delivered are also regulated by the Canada Post Corporation. Letter carriers on rural routes must hire their own replacements, not because they are contractors who manage their own work, but because their contract requires that they find their own replacements when they are sick or on holiday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Post has complete  administrative control over the daily work of rural route letter carriers. Canada Post does not simply give them the mail and let them deliver it as they see fit. It imposes a series of rules on how the work must be carried out. Furthermore, it also supervises  them directly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some post offices—I am  referring to rural areas here—even if it is not in their contract, they are told they must clear the snow around rural post boxes. They are not paid for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, when a  Canada Post employee who is responsible for  sorting the mail is absent, sick or not at work for some reason,  the rural route mail courier has to sort the  mail himself and prepare his delivery, without being paid for doing so, when this is absolutely not part of his contract. Otherwise, he might  incur the wrath of the postmaster and often of the Canada Post Corporation immediately afterwards.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Organization of Rural Route Mail Couriers, the  president of the Canada Post Corporation,  André Ouellet, is hiding behind parliament—and I  believe they are right—by saying that he cannot do anything because the act that governs him prevents him from acting. We  will remember that he himself introduced this legislation and had it passed when he was the minister responsible for the Canada Post Office.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's position is reflected in the answer given by the minister responsible for crown corporations, the current Deputy Prime Minister, to a question asked  by one of my colleagues from the New Democratic Party on April 25, when he said   “the hon. member knows that Canada Post Corporation is an arm's length crown corporation. I do not direct it as to how it manages its day to day operations”. He was talking about the corporation. It is not so much at arm's length, since the legislation that governs it originated from here and was passed here. The arm's length or non-arm's length relationship is highly questionable in this case.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know very well that the federal government has always called the shots when it comes to the Canada Post Corporation. When the federal government got tough with the Canada Post Corporation in the past and told it to start making money, that it was tired of carrying it, the corporation had to knuckle under.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggesting that there is no connection between the Canada Post Corporation and the federal government is hardly an indication of goodwill and sincerity. We all know that Canada Post is the exclusive property of a single shareholder, the Government of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we asking for on behalf of these workers, most of them women, in   Bill C-404, which I have introduced? The Bloc Quebecois  is asking that rural and suburban route carriers be exempt from the provisions of paragraph 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would enable them to join forces, to take stock, which is perhaps what is scaring the Canada Post Corporation, that they are human beings, that they have a right to earn a decent living. In the world of today, in 2002, one cannot treat workers this badly, as though we were living in the 19th century. These people have obligations like everyone else: they must make a living, raise a family, feed their children, put a roof over their heads and clothes on their backs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem that, for the Canada Post Corporation, these concerns simply do not matter. The only thing that counts for the Canada Post Corporation and its current president, and I really hate to say this, but it is true, is making money. Making a profit justifies everything. We on this side of the House cannot accept this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two years ago, a similar bill with basically the same object was introduced in the House. I remember that   the bill was rejected by a vote of 114 against 110. Four government members had made the difference. As is often the case on their side, several government members had followed the example of their leaders, who had risen first. When a minister rises, the others follow suit without asking any questions, without even knowing what they are voting on. After the vote, everyone went home. On the way to  the West Block, at least four members asked me “What did we vote on? What were the implications?” </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told them, and they replied “Ah, if only I had known”. But not knowing, they harmed people who have a right to earn a decent living.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst in all this is the malice displayed by the Canada Post Corporation when the time comes to renew contracts. I hope that the term is not unparliamentary, but it is totally disgusting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rural mail contractor who buys a car or a small truck must make payments over a four year period, but his contract is only a three year contract. Canada Post is well aware that the contractor has to make payments for another year. Before his contract expires, when it is time to  renegotiate, the contractor is told “You know, there are seven, eight, nine or ten people who want your contract, who are eyeing it. If you do not take a pay cut, you will lose it”. Rather than lose everything and end up in dire straits, the contractor  agrees to a pay cut. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Canada Post, some people make it up the corporate ladder by stabbing in the back poor people who earn minimum wage. Allowing this  is unworthy of a government. It is even more unworthy of a corporation like Canada Post, which is an employer. Such an attitude is unspeakable.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, by using their majority, the  Liberal members of the government in office prevented this bill from being made a votable item and, unfortunately, it cannot be voted on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today's debate may at least develop an awareness among Liberals who may be too  cold-hearted these days, although not with their friends from Groupaction and Groupe Everest, where millions and hundreds of millions fly like there is no tomorrow.

	Madam Speaker, that is a long title and I am also the minister responsible for crown corporations which is one of the reasons why I am the guy in the barrel this evening to debate the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to respond to some of the comments made by my hon. colleague about this issue. On the surface one might agree with what the hon. member has said if  there was some validity to it in terms of the treatment of rural mail deliverers and  rural postal workers. If we were to suggest that somehow they were being underpaid, undervalued, badly treated, not provided with proper training or supervisory skills, not provided with a proper wage, or proper compensation for fuel, then there would be reason to support the bill. There are those that would suggest that somehow that was happening, that Canada Post  did not feel they were  worth worrying about. However, that belies the facts of the situation. It is not the truth when it comes to the relationship that Canada Post has with rural contractors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should first understand  the word contractors. These are people who use this to supplement the family income in rural Canada. They bid on a contract and they are awarded that contract. It is a part time job requiring about four hours a day.  Often it is a job that can be done within reasonable proximity of their home so that they can deliver the mail and return home to tend to either the chores of the family or whatever it is that needs looking after.  They need a little bit of flexibility. When we compare it to an urban mail service, it is not like they are walking down the street with hundreds of homes filling up mailboxes or in the case of newer communities, going to central mailbox delivery facilities within the community and  filling up the slots. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about rural Canada  where it is sometimes necessary  to drive great distances to deliver the mail or get a parcel delivered. It requires a  different approach. The real issue here is not the working conditions of the rural postal contractors. The bill should be renamed because it is a bill to increase the membership in the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.  In reality that is what we are talking about. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of rural contractors in Canada.  If they were all brought into the union and paid monthly union dues it would substantially increase the revenue for the union and increase the membership. In union politics, which I know a little bit about having been raised by a national director of the United Steelworkers of America and a vice president of the Canadian Labour Congress, I understand the importance of union dues and the importance of expanding the union base and membership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, that is what this is about.  I do not have a problem with  union officials trying to do this. I support the right of labour unions to be able to organize and to expand their particular area of membership whether it be in the same field or as in the case of the auto workers. Many of us had lunch today with Buzz Hargrove, he may be running for some obscure office, that announcement has yet to make the front pages, but one never knows. Only 25% of the people who are members of the Canadian Autoworkers union are in the automobile business. They have changed their approach recognizing the change in industrial and commercial Canada.  They have gone after other industries where organization was not heretofore a reality. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  believe that organized labour adds tremendous value to our country. I support the right of men and women to work, to organize and to get together to fight collectively through bargaining agreements or, if they need to, through the use of work action and things of that nature.</p>


	<A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an old adage: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I have yet to see anyone point out to me any rationale that would suggest that the system currently in use by Canada Post  is broken.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should take a look at the success of Canada Post since it was made a crown corporation in 1981.  It is quite a remarkable success story. Prior to 1981 the federal taxpayer had subsidized Canada Post by some $4 billion. That is quite an outstanding amount of taxpayers' money. Since that time Canada Post has returned to the government coffers in excess of over $300 million in revenue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were a union leader in CUPW I would say that a lot of that is due to the hard work of the men and women in the Canadian Union of Postal Workers. I acknowledge that. A lot of it is also due  to the change in style of management and  that as a crown corporation Canada Post is able to go out and compete and find new ways of doing business. Few people realize that Canada Post is a 51% shareholder in Purolator. Canada Post is into the business world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members opposite, particularly in the official opposition, would scream if we did it any other way. I would as well. This has been a lesson in how government can work better and more effectively. I must say that when I put an envelope in a red box with a 48¢ stamp on it, and send it either across the street, across town, across the province, or across the country, and it arrives within a  reasonable period of time in  good shape, that is tremendous value for the dollar. It is a real success story.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I had the privilege of travelling to Madrid to meet with the postal operations from Central and South America, Spain and Portugal, all these Spanish speaking countries who get together on a regular basis and share best practices and new ideas in postal delivery. The post office today is not the traditional way of delivering the mail. It is e-post. It has expanded into the electronic world. It is package and parcel delivery. It is just in time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If hon. members want a fabulous experience they should go to Canada Post's head office right here in Ottawa and take a look at the operation. If they want to see the impact in rural Canada, there is an electronic map of Canada that is extremely large. For example, it  shows when a truck breaks down on the Trans-Canada highway outside The Pas, Manitoba, or anywhere in the country.  A yellow truck flashes on the map and a front-end vehicle is sent out to pick up the truck within minutes. It is astounding to see this operation. It is very high tech and something of which all Canadians can be proud. It even has 28 airports  on the map. If there is a 10 minute delay it shows a yellow airplane flashing; if it is 30 minutes it is a green one. If the flight is cancelled it is red, so the mail can be shifted just like that and to ensure that it gets to where it is intended to go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians can be proud of Canada Post. The people who work for Canada Post, members of CUPW and management, can and should be proud of the success story. In Madrid, all of the postal operations from South and Central America, Spain and  Portugal wanted to hear how Canada had turned this previously heavily subsidized corporation around and made it into a modern success story that is delivering its product at an extremely reasonable price, turning a profit in favour of the taxpayer. What a fabulous story. It is not broken. The bill would try to fix something that is not broken and is totally unnecessary.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I do want to get into a discussion on the bill sponsored by the member for Chambly. I would like to give a little history lesson first  because people see the bill differently in different parts of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituency has 87 post offices.  Approximately 12 of them are located in houses, in small rooms with  separate entrances, providing   a service to a small community.  There is no question in my mind that if we were to make those  facilities compliant with the bill I am afraid that would cause Canada Post to close these small centres.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never talked to any individuals who operate these  small post offices   who had ever indicated in any way that they wanted to do  anything else but place a tender and operate out of a small room.  There is no demand out there, as the hon. member from the government side has just said, to make changes to that.  None whatsoever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have  contracts for those people who would carry the mail in these remote areas.  When these contracts go out people bid on them and the lowest bid is not always  accepted.  The  Bloc member said that  somehow they are told that they would have to  lower their bid in the bidding for Canada Post contracts.  That is absolutely false.  I know it as  I have helped many of these people prepare their bids.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions of the bid include the mileage, the route, the time and everything else.  They know how long the contract will be and  when the contract will come to an end.  They can either reapply and re-tender it.  The idea that was raised in this House that somehow the tenders are looked at first and then  negotiated to take the lowest tender after the tender process is absolutely not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member who just spoke from the government side  did raise an interesting point.  He said that  we get the mail in reasonable time.  I would like his definition of reasonable.  I used to get mail from Ottawa delivered to my home more quickly when the CPR carried it than at the present time, so let us not say it is reasonable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  have great fears that if we were to take all of Canada Post and put it so that all employees, even for  only a few hours a day, came under a contractual arrangement we would ruin service to the rural areas.  I am sure that would happen.  Instead of having a daily mail service, it would perhaps be cut down to two days a week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the idea of the bill may have some merit, speaking from rural area Saskatchewan and speaking on behalf of the smaller post offices, I am afraid we could not support the bill even though it was votable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who render the service in rural Saskatchewan do a tremendous job.  The poolrooms are no longer the social centres.  The post offices in rural Saskatchewan are the social centres of the community.  For that reason, to destroy  the operation of the post offices that now exist, at least in my area, under different contractual operations, would  be a blow to the communities.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason of course I cannot support a change in the present arrangements that Canada Post has with the smaller areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the larger areas, I am not disputing, in any way, CUPW's operation.  I am not disputing the arrangements that it has for mail contracting.  I am not disputing the arrangements that Canada Post has with airmail or having the trucks deliver to central points.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am disputing is the government, or Canada Post as a corporation, trying to put something in  these smaller areas   that simply will not work in rural Canada.  I know it will  not work because   I live in rural Canada and  smaller areas are not asking for it. I have lived in a rural area  for years.  We have  24 truck deliveries and   about  80   post offices. No one has ever asked for a change in what we now enjoy.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rural Saskatchewan,   those places outside   the city, and for smaller places from coast to coast to coast, all the bill would do, if it were a votable bill  and it came into effect, is cause  Canada Post  to bring poorer service to rural Canada, including Saskatchewan.  Therefore I cannot support the bill.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-271818"></A><a HREF="#Int-271820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-271816"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be here once again to debate this important issue of providing rights to rural route mail couriers.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was mentioned in previous speeches, I had a private member's bill that was virtually   the same.  It was debated in the last parliament.  I was very optimistic at that time  that the bill  had  support on  all sides of the House but  in the final vote, as some members may remember, the count was 114 against and 110 for; in other words, at that time we lost the vote by 4 votes.  Two people voted the other way.    We were very disappointed but we were committed not to let the issue drop.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of what the member from Mississauga would have us believe, the issue is about the   workers' rights,  not about any one union trying to expand its membership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rural route mail couriers are the only group of workers in the country who are specifically barred from free collective bargaining.  I should point out that free collective bargaining is a right and a freedom guaranteed to all Canadian workers under the Canada Labour Code, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and all  international conventions and covenants of all sizes, types and shapes.    Therein lies the rub.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Canada Post Corporation Act   was implemented in 1980, the corporation did not want these employees to be viewed as employees for the purposes of the Labour Relations Act so it put in a clause that would specifically bar  this group of workers.  It says that even though for all intents and purposes these people look, walk and act like employees, because in fact they are employees, from here on forward they will be considered independent contractors and therefore not subject to the Canada Labour Code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is simply not true.  I have been in labour relations for much of my working life and there are a series of tests in law that one must meet to be considered an independent contractor.  At best, these workers are dependent contractors, wholly dependent on one source for all of their earnings and income.  What makes it completely unfair is that the Canada Labour Board ruled in their favour and said that  they were  wholly dependent and therefore employees.  However  because of  that one clause, that one provision in the Canada Post Corporations Act, they could not  avail themselves of all   the rights that other workers enjoy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a complete red herring to say that it is CUPW trying to expand its membership on an organizing drive because nothing in what the rural route mail couriers have said even mentions any specific union.  They might form their own association but they do want the right to bargain collectively, and implicit with that right comes  protection under the Canada Labour Code regarding strikes, lockouts and the use of arbitration and mediation.  All  those rights stem from the definition of being defined as an employee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked very closely with the rural route mail couriers over the course of these many years.  I opened up my office to them so that they could come to Ottawa and lobby on the Hill.  They worked out of my office for two weeks while they came and visited members of parliament to try and explain to them the inherent unfairness of this.  They are the only group of workers in the country who, for purely economic reasons, are barred from the right to organize, the right to bargain collectively and all   the other rights that stem from that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no justification for that other than economic. André Ouellet, the president of the Canada Post Corporation, has admitted that it was the corporation's motivation in 1980.  At that time, the Canada Post Corporation was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.  I do not think its operating deficit  was that much but it did have an accumulated debt of that much.  It was simply trying to streamline its operations by not paying fair wages in rural Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair wages benefit the whole community, whether it is a rural community or an urban community. No one can deny that it is unions that have elevated the standard of wages and working conditions to create the middle class which makes Canada great today.</p>


	<A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1805)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the member from Mississauga  grudgingly admitted that the unions  had played a role in elevating the standards to the middle class, but yet we now have a disparity.    We have a group of employees delivering mail in the city  who are making, on average, $17 or $18 an hour, about $35,000 a year.  It is not a fortune but it is a fair and living wage.  However we have a group of employees in the country whose average take home pay, under the current contracting system,  is  less than the minimum wage paid to a McDonald's employee.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current contracting system has been abused.  The member from Saskatchewan, who spoke just prior to me, claimed that   he knew of no abuse.  Well many of the  almost 7,000 rural route mail couriers on contract     have come to me with graphic examples and illustrations showing  how the contracting system has been abused,   in that for the same contractors   to keep their contracts they get   a phone call  from Canada Post telling them them that there is an awful lot of interest in their contracts and that for  them to be guaranteed   their routes they had better lower their bids a couple of bucks, and so it is jacked down again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those contractors have to pay for their own fuel, gas, insurance, car and   all the other expenses that an independent business person would have to pay.  They do not receive any benefits.  They do not pay into a Canada pension plan,  UI or  worker's compensation and they receive   no sick days, and it is   all  because they are not deemed to be employees for the purposes of the act . However, instead of their salaries going up with the cost of living and cost of inflation, they are being negotiated down.  That is not a free tendering contract system.  That is interference, dominance and abuse of power for Canada Post to call the people and   tell them that if they want to keep their contracts they will have to take a little less.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Canada Post Corporation Act was first created over 20 years ago    some of the rural route mail couriers were keeping their heads above water.  However some of them are getting less now than they were then, for heaven's sake.  Clearly the system has failed them.   It is  like it has been  l throughout history. When a group of workers did  not get to share in the benefits of this great nation, they were motivated to come together,   to act collectively and to form  their own association.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rural route mail couriers  have never said that if they were granted the right to organize and to bargain collectively that they would join the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.  They may    join the Canadian Autoworkers Union or form their own inhouse association for collective bargaining purposes.  We do not know.   It is a complete red herring to assume that it is just the Canadian Union of Postal Workers that  is trying to expand its membership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the member for Chambly for raising this important issue on behalf of working people around Canada.  It is at their request that we are keeping the issue alive.   I am   disappointed that the reason the vote on my bill  lost was because of  deliberate misinformation being spread by  that side of the House. Everyone knew that we were only talking about rural route mail couriers being allowed to organize and bargain collectively.  They took it to mean that all mail contractors would be included, in other words airline and trucking companies  that had been  contracted to carry mail on behalf of Canada Post.    </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was never the purpose or the point and we had made that abundantly clear. However at the 11th hour, even though we had enough Liberal MPs willing to vote for us, especially those from rural Canada who knew the reality of rural route mail couriers, they were interfered with and misinformation was spread that it would have been a huge complicated thing that would involve trucking companies, shipping firms and airlines.  That was nonsense and tripe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we are talking about is an issue of basic fairness to correct an historic injustice perpetrated by André Ouellet himself.  We want the minister to intervene and to order and direct Canada Post Corporation to extend to rural route mail couriers the same rights and privileges that all Canadian workers enjoy  and the protection of the Canada Labour Code.  It is the very least we should be able to expect. It  frustrates me that year after year goes by and we have yet to make this important step.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for Chambly for bringing forward  the bill.  I also want to thank the member for Winnipeg Centre who just spoke and had the same bill in the previous parliament, which at that time was votable.  It is unfortunate that  this bill will not be votable tonight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if you listened carefully, Madam Speaker, the last time this bill came before the House as presented by the member for Winnipeg Centre it  lost by only about four or five votes. There is a big interest in this issue, rightly so.  I guess there is that interest simply because there is a great injustice out there in terms of how employees are treated within the same corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</b>  Not employees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr.  Greg Thompson:</b> The parliamentary secretary had his say.  I will go into a  bit of a rant on what he had to say a little later if he would be patient enough to listen to me for a minute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I will get into my rant now while he is on a roll.  As for the parliamentary secretary, imagine: this is the city mouse delivering a message on rural mail couriers.  This is a member who represents Mississauga West, one of the richest ridings in the country.  He would not recognize rural Canada or rural poverty if he stumbled over it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take exception to a few of the things  he said.  To begin with, the people who deliver mail in rural Canada are hard working and do a good job.  There is absolutely no difference between what they do and what the urban couriers do in that place called Mississauga West which the parliamentary secretary represents in the House of Commons. The only difference is how they are paid. The rural mail couriers are basically working for minimum wage. I have some facts, Madam Speaker,  which I will table in the House with your permission to  prove that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer to a ruling by the Canada Labour Relations Board. It was a decision in 1987.  The decision emphasized the point that while Canada Post has divided its operations into urban and rural services, the evidence brought before the board showed that there were no clear boundaries.  Not only are RRMCs,  the rural route mail couriers, “integrated into the overall post office mail delivery and collection plan”, but also nothing “greatly distinguishes the manner in which they perform their function from the manner in which the functions are performed by letter carriers”. That reference is from the CLRB decision, board file 530-1218, rural route mail couriers. On April 29, 1987, this decision was rendered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the rest is academic.  We only have to listen to members on this side of the House, who I think have really grasped this issue  and understand it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again to go back to the parliamentary secretary, and this is something that he will learn not to do, he is used to shooting from the hip.  We do give him credit.  He is a great performer, but when one  is representing a minister in the House and the Government of Canada that person should not be shooting from the hip. That individual should use a little bit of fact to emphasize the point if there is in fact  a point to make.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to this one.  I will  quote the member with regard to rural mail couriers. There are 5,000 of them out there and, by the way, two-thirds of them are women.  The parliamentary secretary stated  in the House that they are out there only to supplement their incomes, saying that they work perhaps, and that is the word he used,  perhaps, four hours a day and do reasonably well financially.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His interpretation of the world is based on that old movie <i>On Golden Pond</i>.  He is a cottager up in Muskoka where the steaks are thick and the beer is cold. If he accidentally runs into some of the rural poor driving down the highway, he would not--</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest.</p>

	Madam Speaker, the beer is cold and the steaks are thick on golden pond. That is exactly where his cottage is and he cannot deny that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said  that the workers work perhaps four hours a day. They are reasonably well paid, he said.  Then he said they can attend to their chores when they return home, because most of them are women and they go home to  do chores. That is an insult to rural mail couriers, because they are hardworking. In fact they are the working poor. The evidence is here that will prove that. He got  on to this tirade about how this is just another union movement. That is absolutely false. It has nothing to do with a union in a sense. It has everything to do with fairness for workers who basically do the same job as their city cousins.  That is it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous critic,  from the great riding of St. John's West, who is now sitting behind me, wrote to André Ouellet, the president  and chief executive officer of Canada Post. I will tell members what he  said,  because this is the basic honesty that I think can come only from the Conservative Party. I,  along with this member and others, am taking credit for this, for changing our position on this, because at one time we had a ridiculous position on it, which  the government now maintains. It is the position it inherited from us, among other things, which it kept and did not change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member basically made three points to the president of Canada Post. He wants the rural mail couriers to be entitled to “more fair and equitable wages and allow”--fairer, that would be a grammatical error that I did not commit; I am just quoting from the letter--“collective bargaining...to improve wages and working conditions”. Remember, this is authored by a man from Newfoundland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third point, and the most important, is the repeal of subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act. That would eliminate the disparity between the city mouse, as exemplified by the parliamentary secretary, and the country mouse that we on this side of the House are attempting to defend.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, I would suggest that you carefully read the blues tomorrow yourself to realize how far off base the parliamentary secretary is on this issue and reflect on what we are saying on this side of the House, because our parliamentary language was concise, was precise. Nothing unparliamentary was said. Government members simply do not want their own words thrown back at them in the House during debate. That is what the issue is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that we come to the House to defend citizens of this country when they are being treated unfairly. One might say that internationally we do that and we have a proud history of doing that. When we see an injustice or unfairness in Canadian society being exercised by Canada Post, it is incumbent upon us as elected representatives to do something about it, to bring it to the attention of the House and  to bring it to the attention of the government so that the Canadian public understands the level of unfairness that is being exercised by Canada Post.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Post has had some success stories. That is one thing  I do agree on with the parliamentary secretary. It has  had some success.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</b> Get your own material.  Quit using mine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</b> You shut up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Greg Thompson:</b> The fact is that in the 21st century the way it is treating rural mail couriers  is not right. It is not fair. There is a sense of fairness in Canada which I think has to be exercised by that crown corporation. It is something that can be done and it should be done. We support the rural mail couriers and we want the government to do the same.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I will be brief.  I think this legislation is very well intended. My fear is that however well intended it is liable to do damage to the very group it is trying to help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do come from rural Canada.  I live in a small village in rural Ontario and I am very familiar with the rural mail couriers.  I am very familiar with the fact that they are overburdened.  The proliferation of direct mail advertising, for instance, particularly after the changes in legislation in the last few years, has resulted in an enormous burden on the rural mail couriers that operate out of my village.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are two things I would like to point out to the member who is promoting this legislation.  One is that in my community not all the rural mail couriers are in favour of what is proposed in the bill and the effect that would occur.  The whole idea of this amendment, which would essentially allow rural mail couriers to organize, is in fact resisted by many of the people in my community who actually would prefer open competition.  Their complaint is basically that Canada Post has been applying a very hard-nosed attitude to rural mail couriers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think another way should be sought to  treat the rural mail couriers more fairly, primarily because the rural mail couriers are an important part of the character of this country.  In every province, Quebec, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, or wherever,   the rural mail couriers delivering the Queen's mail are an important part of our national identity and we need to support them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty I see, Madam Speaker, is simply this. If the bill were to go through it would make the delivery of rural mail more expensive.  I think what would happen is that Canada Post would get out of the business and it would go to independent couriers who would undercut and deliver the mail at a much lower price and the rural mail couriers would disappear altogether.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a lot of difficulty.  I express my support for the intention of the legislation but I am very worried that it would have a negative effect.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments made by the members for Winnipeg Centre and for New Brunswick Southwest and,  above all, I would like to thank them for their support. I thank them on behalf of the rural mail contractors, for the sympathy and the compassion they have shown toward their fellow Canadians.  It is to their credit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not speak of the member for Mississauga West. I will not say what I think of him. I will not quote his words. Because it would not be parliamentary language, I will not say that I think he is a boorish man. I will not say so. I will not say either that he is a mercenary who has always defended the indefensible. I will not say that he supports all causes, even the most objectionable. I will not say that. I will not say that is heartless. I will not say what he is.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to him, the member for New Brunswick Southwest referred to a city mouse and a country mouse. As far as I am concerned, we can forget about the city and the country, and  I would not have referred to a mouse, but to another rodent. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard  this man talk on and on and throw tantrums for the nine years I have been in the House, and considering that I am a member just as he is and that we sit in the same parliament just makes me sick.  It really makes me sick. He does not have any sympathy for other human beings. He only has one rule, which is to defend a party that is indefensible. He would never have said to his constituents during the election campaign what he has just said now. He would not have dared to say to postal carriers what he said a while ago.  </p>

	Madam Speaker, on May 2 the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice gave a most unsatisfactory answer to a direct question. The RCMP has provided reports documenting hundreds of thousands of errors in the gun registry. I again ask my question. How can a garbage collection system like the minister is running be of any benefit to the police?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the parliament secretary contradicted the documented evidence from his own department and the RCMP by claiming that 99% of all firearms were correctly registered and 99% of firearms licences correctly issued.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 22 the justice department, in response to one of my access to information requests on error rates in the gun registry, stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The error rate for applications received up to July 18, 2001, was 90% of a total of 362,375.  In addition to errors detailed in Appendix A, 42% of firearms registration applications contain errors in the firearms description, in comparison to the Firearms Reference Table...The sum of the errors exceeds the number of applications received because the application is only counted once even though it may contain multiple errors.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 9, 2002, in response to our access to information request, the RCMP provided the cold, hard statistics used to calculate the justice department's 90% plus 42% error rate in firearms applications. As of July 18, 2001, the RCMP's Canadian firearms registry had received 362,375 firearms registration applications. The RCMP provided a two page document listing 60 different types of errors. Amazingly this RCMP document records a total of 970,647 errors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some of the more common firearms application errors the RCMP documents: 226,024 applications required the firearms owner's licence numbers; 88,886 applications were awaiting payment while the funds for 23,211 applications were not acceptable; 48,282 applications did not have the firearms make, while for another 40,528, the make was invalid; 79,456  had an invalid model description; 71,539  required a client match; 59,640 had address errors; 56,374 required the calibre for the firearm; 34,830  did not have the number of shots; 18,434 did not have a serial number; 16,313  did not have the barrel length; and 20,978 had not been signed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister and the parliamentary secretary would have us believe that in the 11 months they have fixed almost a million errors in these 362,000 applications and have stopped clients from making similar errors on the other 3.4 million firearms applications they received since.  In another 11 months, through another access to information request, as has been happening continually over the last six or seven years, we will find that is not true. The minister's claims stretch--</p>

	Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on the firearm registration process and to reinforce the government's commitment to public safety. We have become accustomed to the hon. member's frequent allegations about this public safety initiative and I intend to respond to this one as we have with all others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member is alleging that the firearms registry is of limited use to the police. Let us first be clear that this public safety program is much more than a gun registry. It is a multi-facetted, practical approach that addresses the prevention of firearm death, injury and crime deterrence. That is why Canada's law enforcement community recognizes and supports the firearms program as an important public safety initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its  testimony on Bill C-15B we heard the law enforcement community reaffirm its support for this program and its essential crime fighting tools. The Canadian Police Association and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police outlined the significant public benefits available through this program, which combines the screening of the applicants, tracking of firearms and minimum mandatory sentencing to help deter, prevent and prosecute firearm crime in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the questions of the hon. member about errors in the system, I want to emphasize that errors reported to the Canadian Firearms Centre to date represent a tiny fraction of the firearm documents that have been issued.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as April 27 of this year, 99% of the firearms in the Canadian Firearms Registry system were correctly registered according to identification and classification as required under law. Also, 99% of the licences were correctly issued to the right person living at the address stated with the appropriate privilege and safety training. There may be a small number of entry errors for which we have no statistics but when these are reported, they are dealt with promptly in co-ordination with the client. Firearms owners should verify the information on their firearm documents and contact us immediately at 1-800-731-4000 to report any anomalies and have the situation rectified.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 2.1 million individuals in the firearms database and firearms owners have been sending in their registration applications in unprecedented numbers. As with any other high volume operation, it is only natural to expect a small degree of entry error. That is why we remain vigilant and have recently made some improvements to further minimize the potential for error.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few months, the Canadian firearms program has completely restructured the registration process and implemented rigorous measures to ensure the integrity of the information. When the personalized registration application is returned for processing, the form is scanned including the bar code that identifies the licence holder. Manual data entry is eliminated which minimizes the potential for error.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unquestionably, this program has been beneficial to the Canadian community at large. We believe it is an excellent program and it is working well.  We believe that the errors that the member refers to are errors of at least a year ago.</p>

	Madam Speaker, they are errors that have not been corrected. I will take one of the alleged facts that has been used here and that is the 99% success rate with regard to the addresses. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of February 21 of this year, the department reported it had mailed out 1,625,915 envelopes to licensed firearm owners as part of its free registration program. However we also found out that 38,629 of those envelopes had been returned to sender by Canada Post Corporation. So much for the claim that 99% of the licensed firearms owners are living at the right address. They have lost track of these owners despite the fact that there is a penalty of years in jail if within one month they do not--</p>

	Madam Speaker, I think it is clear that the member has stated before the House that the  data  he used in most of his intervention was really based on July 2001. The statistics that I referred to are statistics that are up to date and represent great improvements that we have made within the system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member represents a party that has done everything possible within the House to stop the streamlining of this process and the making of this process more efficient. This was by the stalling and filibustering on Bill C-15B which finally  forced the government to enter into time allocation  to effectively bring it to a conclusion and advance it to the other place.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very pleased that we have now done so. It is now in the other place and we will see more benefits accruing to the legitimate firearms owners in Canada through that streamlining process. We look forward to having  many registrations that will go through without error.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am sad to have to rise again today to speak about this issue, which I have raised on several occasions over the last few weeks and which has not yet been settled.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us review the facts. There is a ferry between Trois-Pistoles and les Escoumins that links the South Shore to the North Shore. The wharfs are the property of the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years, the federal government has been wanting to divest itself of these wharfs. It negotiated more or less positively and actively to transfer these wharfs to the region. It knows full well that it would cost $5 million to renovate each of the wharfs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we learned that there was a major problem with the wharfs and that they could be washed away if repairs were not made, which the minister recognized when he answered my question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, a few weeks ago, Transport Canada decided that the ferry could not dock in les Escoumins because the wharf was not safe and could be washed away by the current. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this situation totally unacceptable. In the end, the government is being a bad owner in this case. This is not a partisan issue; I am not trying to pester the government. It is a fact. The federal government  has defaulted on its responsibility to maintain these wharfs properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation does not penalize the federal government, particularly the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Justice who are responsible for Quebec. It penalizes those workers who have lost the seasonal jobs they were expecting to have this year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are waiting for an answer from the government to know whether or not the summer 2002 season will be saved, whether or not the government will decide to invest the $10 million required to renovate both wharves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know if the parliamentary secretary  is aware of the impact that this has on those who are losing their jobs,  on the tourism industry, on  bed and breakfast owners, for example. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many European tourists take the ferry  when they arrive in Trois-Pistoles or when they leave Trois-Pistoles to cross the river and go to the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. Now people have started to hear that the wharves need repair. They can no longer use the ferry there and have to go to Rivière-du-Loup or Matane to cross the river.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very important for our region and it has serious repercussions on tourism. A decision to save the 2002 summer season must be made in the next few days. Will the parliamentary secretary finally give us an answer? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For around ten days now, each day department officials and the minister's office have been telling us “The solution will be announced in two days, two more days”. We still have no solution. People are affected by this situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local elected officials, the reeve of the regional municipality of des Basques, the mayor of Trois-Pistoles and  labour representatives will be here on Friday, because they cannot bear the situation any longer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we need today is a decision  to the effect that the wharves will be renovated this year in order to allow us to benefit from the tourism season and that there will be a permanent decision, that the wharves will be divested to the region, which will obtain them under advantageous conditions. I think that it is very important that we receive this message as quickly as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, the whole tourism season in our region is in jeopardy, specifically in the MRC des Basques, which is unfortunately one of the poorest regions in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the parliamentary secretary assure me today that the work will in fact be done, that the tourism season will go ahead and that both of the wharves will be expected to last some thirty years?</p>

	Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague.  I know he is very much aware that there are several places where ferries can cross from the south shore to the north shore.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, the Rivière-du-Loup to Saint-Siméon ferry.  I know Saint-Siméon very well because my parents were born there, and just hearing the name brings back happy memories.  Then there is the Rimouski--Forestville ferry, and the problematic one, Trois-Pistoles--Les Escoumins.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, Transport Canada representatives discovered it had become extremely dangerous for the ferries to use this dock.  Tourists would be at risk if the ferries were allowed, if I might put it that way, to dock there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting took place in early May between the shipping company, Navigation des Basques, confirming the vital importance of suspending activities.  Obviously, it was not any great pleasure for our departmental employees to have to ask the minister to suspend commercial activities in a location where, as my colleague has just said, 80% of the traffic is tourism related,  and has a spinoff effect on our small  communities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no easy solutions. In the very short term—and I look forward to see the most recent reports which we will soon  have—there are various possible solutions. There are scenarios under which an investment of a few hundred thousand dollars could be made.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we could not resume operations in the very short time. It would not be possible before the month of August. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague pointed out, there are considerable costs involved in the almost complete renovation of the wharves. If I remember correctly, this would be a $10 million  to $12  million project. It requires some study and reflection. Under this scenario, according to the information I have, the wharves would have to be closed for at least two to three years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the motivation of the Department of Transport and especially of the minister, with whom I had the opportunity to talk about this issue yesterday, is strictly a matter of safety. We cannot risk allowing operations between those two municipalities, Les Escoumins and Trois-Pistoles, and exposing local and foreign tourists to  accidents. We would be accused of not having taken our responsibilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, there are of course short term alternative solutions. We could, for instance, use the ferries between Rivière-du-Loup and Saint-Siméon or between Rimouski and Forestville, or the Matane ferry.  I know it is not the ideal solution, but people are on site trying to find a solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very much attached to this area. It is located very close to the mouth of the Saguenay fjord, which is now a Canadian national marine park. There are more and more tourists going there. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is  that we are very aware of the importance of the matter raised by the hon. member, but there are safety considerations involved. There are very short term deadlines. It would be difficult for us to invest $600,000 or $700,000 knowing that operations could not resume tomorrow morning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another possible solution. We will allow our representatives from Transport Canada to pursue negotiations with local authorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank my colleague for having raised this matter tonight.</p>

	Madam Speaker, although I have only a minute, is the parliamentary secretary aware that the full and complete responsibility rests with the federal government, as  the owner, because they were poorly maintained? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government cannot say this happened only at the end of the winter. It had known for some years that the life cycle of the  wharfs was coming to an end. Indeed, if there are solutions that can be  achieved by this summer, they must be implemented. As for renovating  in the medium term, I believe it is appropriate for the federal government to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not possible in the short term, can it commit to compensate the company, the affected workers and the regional tourist industry? It is not with the other ferries that the government will compensate the salaries of those who lost their jobs for this summer and the income of those who are losing business in the tourist industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is totally unacceptable. When someone behaves as a bad owner, they must pay the price. Is the federal government willing to take  responsibility? If it cannot ensure a season for the coming year and particularly the renovation in the years to come, will it compensate the region adequately?</p>

	Madam Speaker, I can say that our department officials are  looking closely at this issue. We discussed it yesterday, and you can be assured that we are aware that, in our small communities, such an issue must be considered as a major issue that is essential to their development. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, the safety principle. We cannot always afford to say yes, when we know very well that we may put the  safety of tourists at risk. I hope that we will be able to find a solution that will be satisfactory to all the stakeholders in the area, whom I want to thank. All the stakeholders in the area are co-operating with our officials and representatives. I hope that a solution can be found that will allow us to authorize  commercial operations in the long term.   </p>

	Madam Speaker, I had difficulty with the answer of  the  minister responsible for Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister recently issued a proposal  to supply office supplies to all offices across the country.  In other words, she called for  a blanket proposal to supply regular office materials to every office Canada Customs and Revenue Agency operates. Only companies like Staples or Grand &amp; Toy would be able to handle such a huge tender, both of which are huge American based companies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years the department has called  local tenders at the provincial level for supplies  to  local offices.  This gave small businesses  across the country the opportunity to compete. Government always brags that small business is the engine that drives the country.  The Prime Minister stands and brags about all the new jobs that are being created. Besides the few being created by the government slush fund, most are created by small businesspeople investing their own money.  What breaks does government give small businesspeople?  All it does is give them  increased bureaucracy, high taxes and all kinds of red tape.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can government do to help?  Besides cutting bureaucracy and red tape,  lowering taxes and providing incentives to invest and create jobs, when the opportunity arises it can give small businesspeople opportunities to deal with government.  The dollars the government spends to purchase supplies are taxpayer dollars.  They come from the pockets of Canadians, many of whom are the same small businesspeople who are asking for help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister said doing it this way makes it more convenient for the office and the taxpayer.  The taxpayer might save money if the one big bid was a bit lower than the combined lower bids. However the dollars that are made go  elsewhere instead of being reinvested to create opportunities at the local level and increase the tax return.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are we supposed to serve,  the people in the minister's office or the business people across the country?  I think the voters will answer that one.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I thank   the hon. member for St. John's West for his concern.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is committed to providing the best possible service to Canadians.  In order to do this we must be efficient and fiscally responsible in the way we operate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to office supplies, the CCRA plans to simplify and streamline its ordering process through partnering with a single supplier.  As my colleagues are aware, the CCRA took full responsibility for its contracting activities after becoming an agency in 1999.  With this responsibility comes an accountability to make decisions that are in the best interests of all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a process of internal and external consultation and researching best practices, we have concluded that a single supplier is the best option for the agency.  It will allow the CCRA to leverage its buying power and in turn pass along overall savings to Canadian taxpayers. This initiative is part of the CCRA administrative reform and renewal that has been identified as a main objective in the CCRA's corporate business plan.  It is in line with the corporate goal to provide responsive and reliable services at an affordable cost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware of concerns about the impact  such a partnership could have on small businesses in communities across the country.  It is for this reason that the notice for proposed procurement allows smaller suppliers to form partnerships with larger suppliers.  As well, prior to posting the notice on the MERX government electronic tendering system, a draft of the document was posted to allow for industry feedback. Recommendations received from this draft posting as well as from internal and industry consultations were taken into account in the drafting of the final notice for proposed procurement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CCRA will be awarding a contract to the company that best meets CCRA needs in the best interests of Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CCRA recognizes that it must take full advantage of any and all opportunities to provide Canadian taxpayers with the best value for their tax dollars while still providing the excellent service they have come to expect.  That is the motivation behind becoming an agency.  The CCRA is taking full advantage of its flexibility to explore new, more cost effective and efficient ways of serving the Canadian public.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way a large company, an American company in particular, is going to return to this country the type of benefits  we could derive from having small businesses benefit from the tender calls.  The jobs that are involved are local and  the revenues that are made are put back into the system.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efficiency is only efficiency for the government.  It is no help at all to the working class and small business people of this country.  The government is going further and further away from its own people in relation to all its tenders.  </p>
