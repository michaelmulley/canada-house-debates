	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for Leader of the Government in 
the House of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-69, an act to provide for the 
establishment of electoral boundaries commissions and the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of second reading of this 
bill.
<P>
	Under the procedures the House adopted a little over a year 
ago, we changed the rules with respect to the drafting of bills. As 
I indicated in my speech on the concurrence in the report of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs on 
February 9, this bill has been drafted by the committee and has 
now been introduced by the government in response to the 
committee's recommendation which was adopted by the House.
<P>
	The order of the House constituted a direction to the 
government to bring in this bill. The bill is in substantially the 
same form as what the committee recommended. There have 
been some minor changes in technical aspects of the language 
and one earth shattering change that brings the bill into force on 
royal assent rather than on the date of proclamation. That I am 
sure has not upset anyone. It is a very minor technical change 
and one that the committee considered but opted for what it 
thought was the more convenient. It turns out that the 
government felt the other was more convenient and made the 
appropriate change in the bill.
<P>
	I am looking forward to the study of this bill in the committee 
on procedure and House affairs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At our meeting this week, the Leader of the Opposition 
indicated that the Bloc Quebecois would like an opportunity to 
speak during second reading of this bill. We accept their request 
and hope that today's speech will mean a saving in time later on 
during consideration of the bill.
<P>
	This is why we are allowing the debate today, although the 
Standing Orders do not provide for debate at the second reading 
of a bill, as a general rule.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am happy to have agreed to the debate today. I look forward 
to the speech of the hon. member from the Bloc who will be 
speaking on this matter. I recommend the bill to the House as I 
did on February 9. As I said everything that I think could be said 
about this good bill on that date I see no need to prolong my 
remarks today. I support the bill and invite the House to do the 
same.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to speak on behalf of the official 
opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, a sovereignist party in Ottawa, 
on a matter of such importance as Bill C-69 entitled an Act to 
provide for the establishment of electoral boundaries 
commissions and the readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
	Why is it an honour for me to speak at this stage? Because, 
once again, and I invite the government to listen carefully, I 
have the opportunity to defend the interests of Quebec, so long 
overlooked by the system.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, I have another opportunity to express one of 
Quebec's traditional demands in this House. I have another 
opportunity to criticize the big guns in the system and attack the 
positions held by those across the floor for whom Lord 
Durham's report would still appear to be bedtime reading. The 
strategy, of course, has changed. The federal government has 
become more sophisticated. Things are more subtle now. Gone 
are the days of the great exploits to assimilate Quebecers.
<P>
	The approach now is to chip away at Quebec's rights and 
political weight whenever possible in order to better mix 
Quebecers in with the masses in English Canada. Bill C-69 is a 
fine example of this. I must say, though, that this bill is not all 
bad, on the contrary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9988"> 9988 </A></B>
<P>
	I am delighted by the amendments proposed to improve the 
mechanism for readjusting electoral boundaries. The main 
amendments are as follows. Changes to the electoral map 
following a decennial census will be adjusted five years later 
in order to avoid too much upheaval in electoral districts. 
Electoral districts may vary by some 25 per cent from the 
provincial quota. This is fine.
<P>
	The provincial commissions will be required to get public 
input before starting their work. This is fine too. The provincial 
commissions will have to consider community of interest, the 
size of each district and foreseeable geographic changes in 
determining electoral boundaries. Finally, the provincial 
commissions will have to produce three draft maps and hold new 
hearings, as required.
<P>
	These proposals are acceptable, perhaps even necessary if we 
do not wish to be faced with aberrations again, as with the 
planned new districts. Without dwelling too much on details, I 
would like to cite the example of the riding of 
Berthier-Montcalm which I have the honour of representing. 
During the last thirty years, this riding has been called 
successively Berthier-Maskinongé, 
Berthier-Maskinongé-Lanaudière, and finally the present 
designation of Berthier-Montcalm. If the proposed electoral 
division or redistribution plan had gone ahead, I do not know 
what new designation the devisors of the system would have 
come up with. If things went as planned, the riding would hardly 
have been recognizable.
<P>
	Regional county municipalities would have been divided, 
natural business and service communities split up; one 
municipality would have been attached to a neighbouring riding 
with which it had no affinity, with absolutely no regard for the 
region's history, all in the interest of numerical consistency and 
uniform representation. In fact, it was the very epitome of 
Canadian federalism.
<P>
	Several members of this House opposed this readjustment of 
electoral boundaries and rightly so. We were not dealing with 
apples and oranges. On the contrary, the very essence of the 
riding and its historical baggage were at issue here. Thus, it was 
necessary to be realistic, practical while at the same time 
ensuring that the member of Parliament could be efficient in his 
work. Unfortunately, legal provisions applicable in this regard 
did not allow for this rational redistribution.
<P>
	The report prepared by the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs included a number of elements and proposals 
for improving the representativeness and boundaries of 
electoral ridings. This is why the Bloc Quebecois was in favour 
of the preparation of this report. Many ideas were put forward, 
specifically the official opposition's proposal to include in this 
legislation a mechanism allowing Quebec to keep 25 per cent of 
the seats in the House of Commons.  Clearly, we could not in 
good faith vote against a traditional demand made by Quebec. 
The Bloc Quebecois regarded this as a fundamental element of 
this report and that is why we supported it.
<P>
	However, the government is as usual systematically refusing 
to examine Canada's duality. It is postponing studying another 
traditional demand of the people of Quebec and is doing 
absolutely nothing to try to find a solution to the demand made. 
The bill resulting from this report includes only a tiny portion of 
its proposals. Indeed, Bill C-69 does not mandate a 
parliamentary committee with finding a solution to the problem 
of the erosion of Quebec's representation in the House of 
Commons. Worse still, Bill C-69 does not provide any 
guarantee whatsoever that the decline in the number of Quebec 
members in the House of Commons would be stopped. On the 
contrary, this bill maintains the formula set out in section 51 of 
the British North America Act, which weakens Quebec's 
influence within federal institutions.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Until Quebec decides on its future, and undoubtedly, it will 
vote in favour of sovereignty, you will understand that it is of the 
utmost importance that it maintain adequate representation 
within those institutions.
<P>
	History has proven that despite the senatorial clause and the 
grandfathering clause, for the 127 years since it was founded, 
Quebec has been and still is the only province to have a smaller 
number of members of Parliament than it should get under 
representation by population.
<P>
	Ontario, in contrast, was granted several extra seats at the 
beginning of the century. This eloquently demonstrates once 
again the double standard, and two occasions where the federal 
government has shown favouritism towards English Canada. 
Why should this surprise us; the tower of Pisa also always leans 
to the same side.
<P>
	In this bill, the House fails to acknowledge that there are two 
founding peoples. The central government has been trying to 
forget this fact for 127 years too. Must I remind the House that 
Quebec is home to one of Canada's two founding peoples; 
Quebec is the cornerstone of French culture in the Americas; 
Quebec has its own separate culture; Quebec is the only French 
society surrounded by a sea of English; Quebec deserves and has 
legitimate claim to 25 per cent of all of the seats in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>Is that what you think of francophones outside 
of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> In fact, this last request is not new. I know 
that I am probably frustrating members opposite by confronting 
them with the truth this morning-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9989"> 9989 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> You are right, francophones outside of Quebec 
are frustrated, because of what you are saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Nevertheless, I would ask the hon. 
member to listen to me a while longer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Once again, you are abandoning them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Just listen, Mr. Whip.
<P>
	In fact, this is not a new demand, it is one that we have always 
made. But, once again, I am only repeating to the members of 
the House of Commons what the Bloc Quebecois has pointed out 
time and time again within these walls and what politicians from 
Quebec, even some of the most timid Liberals in your ranks, 
have been clamouring for too long.
<P>
	The government would like the official opposition to vote for 
the bill, even though it all but ignores Quebec's demand.
<P>
	No, members of the Bloc Quebecois will not help the 
government disregard one of Quebec's legitimate demands. We 
are here to defend Quebec's interests, and in the interests of 
Quebec, we must vote against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> But you voted for it in committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> This is unbelievable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> I can already hear government members 
mention in this House that the only way to guarantee Quebec a 
minimum of 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons is 
to amend the Constitution. At best, this amendment would be 
subject to the rule of the seven provinces or 50 per cent of the 
population or, at worst, to the rule of unanimity.
<P>
	This is a smokescreen and a constitutional disinformation 
campaign.
<P>
	In 1985-and I would urge the people across the way to 
listen-the principle of proportionate representation in the 
House of Commons stated in section 42(1)(<I>a</I>) of the British 
North America Act was altered indirectly and very subtly 
through a simple act of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We did no such thing. This is nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Through a simple act of Parliament.
<P>
	By guaranteeing some provinces a minimum of seats on the 
grounds that a province cannot lose seats, they altered the 
principle of proportionate representation in 1985 by passing this 
simple act of Parliament. Was this act challenged? Yes, Mr. 
Speaker. Was it invalidated? No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In the case of Campbell v. Canada (1988) 49 DLR, 4th edition, 
page 321-they can write this down as good reading 
material-the British Columbia Court of Appeal pointed out 
that the protection of representation despite the decline in a 
province's population does not affect the principle of 
proportionate representation and therefore does not require 
amending section 41(1)(<I>a</I>) of the British North America Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is clear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> We have a double standard, Mr. Speaker. 
That, too, is clear. One law for English Canada's demands and 
another for Quebec. That, too, is clear. But you will not hear that 
from the people across the way.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	With that precedent, the government will tell me once again 
that it could not guarantee Quebec a maximum of 25 per cent of 
the seats in the House of Commons under Bill C-69? No, the 
Quebec people are not fooled and will soon render judgment.
<P>
	Therefore, Mr. Speaker, please note that the official 
opposition, proud defender of Quebec, cannot support a bill 
which does not provide any way to counter Quebec's loss of 
political weight in this House.
<P>
	Bloc Quebecois members refuse to accept the gradual erosion 
of the power held by those representing one of Confederation's 
two founding peoples.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do not ask us to go against our demands or vote 
against the interests of the Quebec nation. As you can 
understand, we will vote against this bill. I invite those who say 
that the bill is consistent with the report to read both the report 
and the bill. They will see that there is a difference.
<P>
	I understand their wanting to close their eyes, their 
unwillingness to give Quebec its fair share of seats in this 
Parliament. I understand that their only goal is the assimilation 
of Quebec, pure and simple. What better way than to start with 
the House of Commons, so that francophones and Quebec 
cannot defend their interests in this House. That is why we will 
vote against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a bit of a surprise to be debating Bill C-69 this 
morning, but it gives me another opportunity to outline some of 
the problems and dangers contained in the redistribution bill.
<P>
	The bill is the government's justification for wasting about $5 
million of taxpayers' money in the previous readjustment 
process that has to be repeated now because we are 
reimplementing it. The government feels that the changes 
introduced in the legislation are excuses for the more than $5 
million wasted by scrapping 11 months of work by the 
redistribution commissions.
<P>
	The government is keen to get the bill passed as soon as 
possible so that the new boundary rules will be in place in time 
for the next election. That is the way it should be. It realizes that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9990"> 9990 </A></B>
<P>
its unprecedented suspension of the democratic process might 
have caused the next election to be contested under the old 
boundaries based on the 1981 census. This would have put 
government members in a very tenuous constitutional position, 
not to mention having faces as red as their infamous book.
<P>
	The entire debacle that began with Bill C-28 and continues 
with Bill C-69 has put the Liberals on very shaky ground when it 
comes to a politically neutral election process. The government 
obviously feels that Bill C-69 excuses its tampering with the 
electoral process. Bill C-69 fails to live up to all these claims.
<P>
	Also very interestingly my friends in the Bloc have finally 
come to the realization that there are some problems with Bill 
C-69. I say finally because all through the meetings of the 
procedure and House affairs committee members of the Bloc 
seemed happy with the direction and contents of the draft bill 
proposed by the committee. The draft bill had been introduced 
by the government as Bill C-69. The Bloc presented no 
dissenting opinion to the Liberal report presented to the House.
<P>
	On November 22, when Reform members indicated that a 
minority report or a dissenting report would be included, the 
Bloc Quebecois declined the opportunity to dissent to what the 
government was pushing through and voted for every clause of 
the bill that now appears as Bill C-69. That party was 
instrumental in defending the need for a 25 per cent variance. I 
find it peculiar that the Bloc would all of a sudden push for an 
unusual debate at this stage of the process. I have to wonder why 
it favoured the report and everything in it at committee but is 
now rushing to oppose the bill at this point. It seems to be a 
rather odd position to be taking.
<P>
	It is clear the crux of the Bloc's concern over Bill C-69 is the 
matter of guaranteeing Quebec 25 per cent of the seats of the 
House of Commons regardless of population. This is obviously 
an undemocratic position. The make-up of the House has always 
been based on the principle that all Canadian citizens are equal. 
Equality of voting power is fundamental to Canadian 
democracy. I do not understand why any party would advocate 
giving some Canadians more political power than others. The 
words and actions of Bloc members on Bill C-69 betray their 
true motives and values.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	To demonstrate how unviable that kind of approach is, one 
need look no further than my province of Saskatchewan. In the 
early 1920s Saskatchewan was Canada's third most populous 
province. At that time Saskatchewan had 21 seats out of a total 
of 225 in the House. If we were demanding to have our historical 
proportion of seats today, Saskatchewan would need 28 seats in 
Parliament as a result of the upcoming redistribution rather than 
the 14 we now hold.
<P>
	In order for Saskatchewan to have more than its fair share of 
seats in the Commons, other provinces must get less than their 
fair share. I wonder which provinces would currently be willing 
to give up seats for Saskatchewan. Fourteen extra ridings have 
to be found, so more than one province would have to share the 
burden.
<P>
	Would the extra seats come from Ontario which already has 
many ridings with well over 100,000 population? How about 
B.C., the province with the fastest growing population and the 
one most in need of the greater share of seats in the House? What 
about Quebec? Would our friends in the Bloc be willing to give 
up some seats in Parliament so that Saskatchewan could reclaim 
its historical share of seats in the House? I think not.
<P>
	Is Quebec more special than Saskatchewan? I think not. Is 
Quebec superior to Saskatchewan? I think not. Is Quebec 
inferior to Saskatchewan? Does it need more seats to get 
representation in the House? I think not. Quebec is equal 
partners with all provinces in Confederation and the laws of the 
land must indicate that principle.
<P>
	The reason that Saskatchewan does not have 28 seats is that 
population patterns have changed. It is a fundamental part of 
Canadian reality that other parts of the country have grown more 
rapidly than Saskatchewan. As a result our share of seats in the 
House have gone down. People in Saskatchewan accept this 
because it is sensible and fair. If population patterns change 
again our share may go up.
<P>
	Why is the Bloc asking for the allotment of seats to the House 
of Commons on any other basis than population? To entrench 
such a principle in law would be dangerous. It would also create 
ill will, resentment and all kinds of representation problems we 
already see today. Provisions like the senatorial clause and 
creating provincial floors have led us to some of the dilemmas 
we face in the House and the problems created in the Senate.
<P>
	As we can see, the idea of claiming a certain proportion of 
seats regardless of population creates many inequities. It is 
unfair, discriminatory and lacks common sense. I do not buy the 
argument that more seats in Parliament are necessary to 
preserve Quebec's language and culture. Quebec has a rich 
history and has special cultural values and traditions. I am glad 
it is part of Canada. The people who can do the most to foster the 
French language and culture in Quebec are the people in the 
Government of Quebec.
<P>
	If the provincial Government of Quebec were given the 
authority and responsibility for language and culture with no 
interference from Ottawa, the threat or perceived threat to that 
culture would disappear. That would be a much more 
constructive way to solve the cultural issue. Taking 
representation and therefore political power away from other 
provinces would lead to resentment and ill will from the other 
provinces of Canada, not to mention that more MPs by 
themselves  would not have much of an impact on cultural 
considerations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9991"> 9991 </A></B>
<P>
	Guaranteeing Quebec or any other province a certain 
proportion of seats would only add to the problem of the size of 
the House. Not dealing with the growth in membership in the 
House is a major flaw in Bill C-69. My Reform colleagues and I 
have spoken often about the need to reduce or cap the size of the 
Commons. We have demonstrated how the number of MPs can 
be capped and reduced. It is clear that the Liberals have no 
interest in limiting the size and cost of this place.
<P>
	After only one short year the Liberals are showing their true 
colours. They like big government, big cabinets and big 
spending. I have no problem with the appointment of a new 
Minister of Labour. I am sure she is a very fine person and very 
capable, but there was no corresponding demotion from cabinet 
when she was appointed. The pretence of frugality is slipping 
away from the government. First the cabinet grew by the 
appointment of the Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs 
and now has increased even further with the new Minister of 
Labour.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals are increasing the size of cabinet while cutting 
the civil service. They are increasing the size of the House while 
not properly reducing the MP pension plan. They will increase 
taxes while cutting frontline services to Canadians.
<P>
	The old spectres of Liberal elitism and political self-interest 
are reigning supreme at the expense of rank and file Canadians. 
Liberal elitism and favouritism can manifest itself again with 
the inclusion of a schedule of special ridings as provided for in 
this bill.
<P>
	The bill makes reference to the schedule but offers no 
guidelines or rules as to how one is to be created. It simply states 
that ridings can be added to the schedule by an act of Parliament. 
This means the government alone can decide who gets on the list 
and who does not. It is possible for the Liberals to place virtually 
all their ridings on this schedule. Every sitting MP and every 
party organization would like to contest elections with 
boundaries they have already won with.
<P>
	Establishing a loosely defined schedule of ridings exempt 
from the rules of redistribution, rules that are designed to ensure 
fairness and neutrality, makes the possibility for 
gerrymandering endless. The way the provisions for the 
schedule are worded in this bill, the government would have 
complete control to play politics with boundary redistribution.
<P>
	Imagine what former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney could 
have done with this kind of provision. Constituencies would 
have been scheduled all over the map. Our constituency 
redistribution system would have been taken no more seriously 
than appointments to the Senate.
<P>
	The current Prime Minister can now do the same should this 
pass without the necessary amendments. He will have the power 
to create special Liberal safe seats all across the country. In no 
time we would see ridings like Labrador or perhaps Prince 
Albert-Churchill River in Saskatchewan being scheduled. The 
irony is that if the Prime Minister pushes his Liberal arrogance 
this far, there will be no such thing as a Liberal safe seat.
<P>
	Bill C-69 fails to place a limit on the number of scheduled 
ridings. When the Liberals get carried away with their new 
powers under this bill and schedule too many ridings in the same 
province, they will discover they have created all kinds of 
headaches for the boundary commissioners. In many cases the 
presence of scheduled ridings will make effective redistribution 
impossible, as more fixed lines will severely limit the options 
available to the cartographers.
<P>
	I suspect that Parliament would have the legal power to 
remove a riding from the schedule, but politically it would be 
extremely difficult to do so, especially for the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	What would happen if a northern riding that was on the 
schedule had a large increase in population? Populations in 
Canada move significantly over time. Who would have 
predicted the dramatic growth of the west at the time of 
Confederation? The political leaders at the time did not. This is 
obvious from the way they allocated seats to the Senate.
<P>
	Population shifts could happen today even to scheduled 
ridings. Take for example the riding of Skeena in B.C. It is a 
large northern riding and a likely candidate for scheduling, apart 
from the fact that it is not a Liberal riding and the Liberals have 
complete control over the process.
<P>
	Within the riding of Skeena is the Windy Craggy mineral 
reserve estimated to be worth between $10 billion and $40 
billion. If this mineral reserve is developed, tens of thousands of 
highly skilled, high paying jobs could be created. However, the 
provincial government decided that jobs are bad and decided 
instead to turn the whole thing into a park.
<P>
	If that unfortunate decision is reversed and those jobs are 
allowed to flourish, the riding of Skeena could have a population 
that tops 200,000. However if the riding has been scheduled, 
redistribution would not occur. The member for Skeena would 
be the busiest man on the Hill, having the largest population to 
serve and one of the biggest chunks of Canadian geography. This 
whole concept of the schedule has not been properly thought out 
and should be removed from the bill.
<P>
	With the overly generous 25 per cent variance there should be 
no need for a schedule anyway. I have heard some of the Liberal 
members say the same thing, but when it comes time to actually 
do what they believe, they wimp out. They do the politically 
convenient thing. They go along with inequities and a variance 
of plus or minus 25 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9992"> 9992 </A></B>
<P>
	This plus or minus 25 per cent allows ridings to be set up 
with a 50 per cent differential in population. This is at the 
beginning of the redistribution process. If there are population 
changes that occur during the period before the next 
redistribution, the discrepancy gets far more severe.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	Surely this 25 per cent variance gives enough flexibility to 
accommodate any so-called special cases. We should not need 
scheduling. Of course without the schedule, the government will 
not be able to do quite as much manipulating of the electoral 
map.
<P>
	The mention of special cases reveals another flaw in the bill. 
In creating this bill the procedure and House affairs committee 
heard from a list of rural members complaining that their ridings 
were too large. Even the member for Kingston and the Islands 
knows that several of his colleagues told him that they were 
afraid that the redistribution process was going to get out of 
hand and that their ridings would become larger than they could 
manage. They asked that the rural ridings be kept to a 
manageable geographic size, even if it meant staying below the 
provincial quotient.
<P>
	However, the member for Mississauga West pointed out that 
many urban ridings experience rapid growth and should 
therefore be kept closer below the quotient to allow for this 
growth. The inherent contradiction in this bill becomes clear. 
How can both the rural and the urban ridings of a province be 
kept below the average? It just does not work.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga West in this House during the 
concurrence debate said to me: ``I must thank the member for 
pointing out something I had hoped would sneak by rural 
members''. Those are the words in <I>Hansard</I>. ``Would sneak by 
rural members. He knows I was hoping it would sneak by''. That 
is found at page 9396.
<P>
	The Liberals are again talking out of both sides of their 
mouths. They cannot have it both ways, but they are trying to do 
that in Bill C-69.
<P>
	Does the government not realize that if all the rural ridings are 
kept at or below the quotient and all the urban ridings are kept at 
or below the quotient, that there is no one left to balance things 
out by being above the quotient? There is no one left. It is 
impossible.
<P>
	Given enough time every member in this House will be able to 
find a reason why some special consideration should be given to 
his or her particular constituency. Our committee heard from 
many of them. The only reasonable thing to do is to apply the 
same rules to everyone. Otherwise we will end up with a set of 
rules that are effectively meaningless and useless.
<P>
	The suspension of the redistribution process initiated by C-18 
was a very serious breach of political non-interference. The 
government tried to cover its tracks by shrouding that action in a 
review of the system.  Bill C-69 failed in its attempt to represent 
fundamental improvements to redistribution.
<P>
	I call on all members of this House, on all sides to reconsider 
their support for this bill. I know that for the wrong reasons the 
Bloc members have changed their position on the bill. I 
reiterate, it was for the wrong reasons, but there are a number of 
correct reasons why this bill should be opposed.
<P>
	I know that many members have an interest in fairness and 
equality in our electoral system. This bill creates and 
perpetuates some grave inequities. I would ask them to defeat 
this bill or at least help in providing some constructive 
amendments needed to save this legislation.
<P>
	In order to come up with a good bill we need to clarify the 
issue of schedules. We need to tighten up the allowance variance 
to protect the voting powers of Canadians. We desperately need 
to address the growth in this House.
<P>
	It was interesting yesterday when we had a visit by the 
President of the United States. We had a picture of what would 
happen in this House if we let unrestrained growth continue. 
These curtains would have to be removed, seats would have to 
be placed in the middle of the floor. That is where we will be in 
just a matter of a few decades.
<P>
	Certainly there is no need to have to knock out walls in the 
House of Commons because we cannot deal with the problem of 
growth in the House for a country of 30 million people. Surely 
we can respect the wishes of Canadians for less government, 
smaller government, rather than for unbridled expansion of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	Without these improvements, no member who has an interest 
in fairness or common sense should support Bill C-69.

	The House resumed from February 22 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act 
and the Criminal Code, be read the third time and passed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9993"> 9993 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my privilege to rise in the House today to speak 
on behalf of my constituents regarding the proposed changes 
to the Young Offenders Act, Bill C-37.
<P>
	In my riding of Port Moody-Coquitlam a rally of over 5,000 
Canadians took place on September 25, 1994 to publicly demand 
changes to this act. This rally reflects the national demand for 
change to a justice system that caters to the rights of the 
criminal, young or old, rather than the security of society. A few 
brief weeks ago over 2,000 more concerned Canadians near my 
area marched for changes to the justice system on behalf of 
Melanie Carpenter.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has stated that such public outcries are 
an emotional response to media headlines. How wrong he is. 
These are the responses of people who have had enough and now 
realize they are not alone in their hurt and anger.
<P>
	Yes, there is a shocking, tangible anger against the system. 
The rallying cry of the Jesse Cadmans, the Graham Nivens, the 
Melanie Carpenters, all tragic victims of this system, has served 
as the catalyst for a too long silent and threatened majority. 
Their concerns are real and widespread. And they, the people of 
Canada, must be heard.
<P>
	Today I wish to speak directly for my constituents. I cannot do 
less. In August last year with requests pouring in, my office 
sponsored a meeting to respond to demands to organize a public 
rally following the senseless and tragic death of Graham Niven. 
We arranged for a room to accommodate 20 and then 50 people. 
That night over 300 people came to volunteer to make 
something happen.
<P>
	Led by a core dedicated committee of about a dozen 
committed individuals, literally hundreds of community 
volunteers organized and successfully ran the rally one month 
later. Their message echoes the concerns of Canadians across 
this land.
<P>
	Young offenders should be held individually responsible for 
harm done by their acts. They should know that they face certain 
consequences for breaking the laws of this land. Police officers 
must be given back the mandate to enforce laws designed to 
protect our communities. Parents must be given the authority 
over and the responsibility for the actions of their children. It is 
only thus that the very real fears of youth, women, parents and 
seniors, all citizens, of this rising violent attitude in our streets 
and in our schools can be adequately addressed.
<P>
	The current Young Offenders Act has a statement of principle 
which recognizes that young people should have a special 
guarantee of their rights and freedoms. This has been interpreted 
by the courts to mean that any treatment of a young offender 
requires their consent. This same misled interpretation would 
still apply unless specifically addressed in this new legislation. 
Let me share with you some real life examples.
<P>
	A Richmond court worker, a frontline worker, wrote that Bill 
C-37 does not go far enough. He said: ``Young offenders are 
laughing at us and rubbing our noses in a system which leaves 
them unaccountable for their actions''. It is not uncommon to 
see young offenders laugh at their sentence and wink at their 
buddies in the public area of the courtroom. He said that it was 
time that we stop giving them something to be proud of and 
instead give them something to think about.
<P>
	The system is not tough enough and this only encourages 
recidivism. The statistics speak for themselves in that 
approximately 75 per cent of 12 and 13 year olds are first time 
offenders. This decreases to 58 per cent of 14 and 15 year olds 
and falls further to 50 per cent of 16 and 17 year olds. The study 
declared that those youths who did reoffend usually had far more 
than one prior conviction. These young offenders are obviously 
not deterred from continuing to violate the law. The present 
experience with the law and the court system obviously does not 
serve the offender or society. Canadian families pay the price for 
this failure.
<P>
	Share for a moment the grief of a Langley, B.C. couple whose 
17-year old son was shot and killed by a 16-year old who had 
just been released from custody. They wrote in their letter to me: 
``Ours is a lifetime loss of a young man with a brilliant future. 
We will never forget him or the atrocity''.
<P>
	Diane Sowden, a mother of a 14-year old young offender in 
my riding, shared her frustration with the judicial system at the 
rally. Her daughter at the age of 13 left home because she 
resented a 9.30 p.m. curfew. The police informed the parents 
they were powerless to do anything.
<P>
	The girl was assigned to two group homes and three foster 
homes but she refused to stay at them because they also had 
rules. Diane reported that there was no curfew, no order to go to 
school, and no order to reside with the caregivers, completely 
against their request as parents. The story goes on to include 
pimps, drugs, schoolyard solicitation for child prostitution, 
heroin addiction, ignored parole violations and nothing anyone 
could do about it.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	``We wanted stricter consequences for her actions, rather than 
no consequences'', said Diane. ``We as her parents want some 
say in what is happening to our daughter''. Presently this 
14-year old girl works the streets and the Young Offenders Act 
will respect her right to continue down this path of 
self-destruction.
<P>
	We have accomplished nothing giving young people so many 
rights that the consequences of their actions are no longer 
relevant. The interests of young offenders are not best served 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9994"> 9994 </A></B>
<P>
when they cannot be required to respect the authority of law or 
even the authority of their parents.
<P>
	Unless there is proven reason, parents should both know and 
have a say in their children's treatment and those children 
should have no choice but to face the consequence in treatment, 
reparation and penalty for their illegal actions.
<P>
	Let me share with the House the experience of Erma and 
Dennis Vietorisz. Erma addressed the rally in September as a 
teacher and a parent who has seen the consequence of rising 
violence in her school and the community. She wrote me again 
on December 29, 1994 about an attack on her son and a friend the 
month before, after the rally: ``There was no provocation, no 
argument, nor any reason for a brutal attack on these two young 
people. After being taken to the hospital, our son was told he had 
a broken jaw and had to undergo emergency surgery and spend 
six weeks with his jaw wired shut. His friend had six stitches to 
his eye. Meanwhile the attackers had gotten away without 
consequence. Why? Because the police said there was very little 
they could do to protect our son from retaliation if charges were 
laid. The police could not detain the attacker after they arrested 
him as the courts would release him back on to the street to await 
trial even though he was very violent in his behaviour. All the 
police could do to protect our son was to put a restraining order 
on the attacker which would only help our son if he was attacked 
again''.
<P>
	After much deliberation and consideration the parents 
decided not to lay charges because the judicial system could not 
protect him. They decided not to subject themselves to the very 
real possibility of more violence. The attacker had nothing to 
fear from a system that is powerless to restrain him from 
inflicting fear and violence on others.
<P>
	Erma recently received a letter from Premier Harcourt of B.C. 
who criticized her for not giving the judicial system a chance. 
What mockery. On the one hand we have a brazen offender who 
has, and will likely continue to accumulate a history of violence. 
On the other we have a judicial system with a mandate from the 
government that puts fear into the heart of the victim and not the 
offender.
<P>
	Bill C-37 further entrenches this deplorable pattern. 
According to the latest studies published in January 1995 by the 
forum of correctional research, youth crime is on the rise. In 
1986, 179,000 youths were arrested by police and 113,000 were 
charged. In 1992, 211,000 and some were arrested by the police 
and 140,000 were charged. Violent offences have increased 
from 9,275 in 1986 to 20,033 in 1991. That is over a 100 per cent 
increase in just five years.
<P>
	Take these statistics in light of the fears of victims and their 
families such as the Vietorisz. Take these statistics in light of the 
pat on the head that first, second and third offences get or the 
total lack of consequences or recorded incidence of crime for all 
those under 12 years of age in  the present system. There is an 
epidemic out there that our justice experts refuse to recognize.
<P>
	I have received over 13,000 letters and faxes and over 15,000 
signatures on petitions from concerned Canadians calling for 
real change to the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Like Mrs. Sandy Mahoney of Maple Ridge, B.C. whose 
14-year old daughter had to move to Ontario to live with her 
grandmother because she was constantly beat up at school, 
constantly harassed by what the authority and school officials 
called gang members. It is very clear that young criminals are 
not afraid of any authority, is what she said.
<P>
	Another woman, Marian Jutila from Coquitlam states: ``As a 
community we demand you immediately follow through and 
begin revamping our Young Offenders Act''.
<P>
	Many seniors have written to me, those who fear to leave their 
homes and also many who fear that violence will actually break 
through the walls of those homes. Perhaps the most compelling 
was the cry at the end of one letter that concluded with a 
handwritten note: ``You must help us''.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, let me read the words of 17-year old Jamie 
Lipp, a dear friend of Jessie Cadman who was killed by a young 
offender. Jamie spoke at the rally: ``What kind of society do we 
live in where young people are not held accountable for their 
crimes? What kind of society do we live in where we must fear 
for our lives within a few blocks of our homes? What kind of 
society do we live in when there is no respect for life?''
<P>
	Bill C-37 does nothing to reflect the concerns of those who 
have spoken up with such clarity and sincerity. I cannot in good 
conscience support such a bill. We need a legislative overhaul 
which demands accountability for the sake of society and the 
young offender, that teaches respect for authority and the rights 
and lives of others, and that reverses the trend of fear and 
intimidation experienced within our community.
<P>
	Today I implore the Minister of Justice to listen to these 
Canadians. They have something to say that he must hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened with some interest to the speech of my hon. 
colleague.
<P>
	She is from British Columbia. She would find from coast to 
coast and down on the Atlantic coast where I am from that there 
are similar sentiments with respect to safety in the community 
and a desire to ensure that the legislative tools we have at our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9995"> 9995 </A></B>
<P>
disposal such as the Young Offenders Act, are balanced. That 
balance periodically must be reviewed.
<P>
	At least the bill is a step in the right direction. What I hear 
from my community is that there is a legitimate concern. 
Individuals want to feel safe in their community. However, 
Canadians are also very tolerant individuals and they are not 
harsh in how they deal with individuals that somehow find 
themselves at the opposite end of the law.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I have seen over the last few years 
a marked change in the way Canadians view the criminal justice 
system, the fairness of the system and whether they believe that 
the rights of the accused have priority over the rights of the 
abused. Many times this is the case.
<P>
	Dealing specifically with the Young Offenders Act, some 
measures in this bill are supportable by most reasonable 
thinking people. Certainly the move to transfer 16 and 17 year 
olds who are accused of very serious crimes like first or second 
degree murder and other crimes like attempted murder, 
manslaughter, aggravated assault and aggravated sexual assault 
to adult court is very positive.
<P>
	The people I represent understand that wherever possible we 
have to have a system that takes young people who happen to 
find themselves on the wrong side of the law and wherever 
possible work to rehabilitate them. We do not want just 
incarceration for the sake of vengeance. What we truly seek is 
rehabilitation.
<P>
	There must be a recognition that there are some cases-I 
stress that it is the minority of cases with young 
offenders-where we have individuals who are 16 or 17, 
dangerous offenders, repeat offenders, who have carried out the 
most despicable and unspeakable crimes that are still protected 
by the act. They are protected as a young offender when their 
crimes are severe enough to be treated more seriously by the 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	The move to adult court as a requirement under this bill, with 
the provision that the offender or the prosecutor or the counsel 
for the accused can argue before the court that the offender 
should not be transferred, is a proper one.
<P>
	I also agree with the increased sentences for first and second 
degree murder. Canadians want to make sure that individuals 
who are convicted of these most serious crimes do not find 
themselves being convicted and sentenced and in a few years 
back out on the street, perhaps to commit such crimes again.
<P>
	I also support with some qualification the provisions in the 
bill that deal with access to youth records, particularly for repeat 
offenders, and particularly for young offenders who seem to 
have a goal in life of continuing to wreak havoc in their 
communities.
<P>
	It is essential in certain conditions, and these conditions are 
outlined quite well in the bill, that law enforcements officers 
and peace officers have access to those records during the course 
of investigations when dealing with serious crimes. It is also 
essential that the courts, in the case of young offenders who have 
a long criminal record under the Young Offenders Act and are 
once again before the courts as a result of further violations of 
criminal law, have access to these records. However, this section 
does not go far enough. I have to agree with my colleague 
opposite.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I live in a community of approximately 70,000 people. By and 
large it is a law-abiding community. People feel relatively safe 
travelling the streets. I have three children. The oldest will be 11 
in a few weeks. I have an eight-year old and I have an three-year 
old. I want to see my children grow up in a safe community. I get 
concerned when I hear on the street-and I can never figure out 
whether it is simply hearsay-that there are some violent young 
offenders who go through the system who actually abuse the 
system and who use the protection under the act to remain 
anonymous.
<P>
	At the school my daughter attends, if there is a 14, 15 or 16 
year old who has been convicted under the act of a crime with 
violence or aggravated sexual assault who has been known to 
carry a weapon, the rights of the people of the community to live 
safely far outweigh the right of that young offender to 
anonymity for the crimes he or she has committed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> I am worried, Mr. Speaker. Members of the 
Reform party are actually applauding me. I may have to rethink 
my position.
<P>
	Canadians as a caring and just people have to understand that 
the accused has rights but there must be a recognition in law of 
the right of individuals to have safe communities.
<P>
	I would like to see the government look at this provision. 
Maybe when this bill is studied further the government will 
assent to look at some exceptional circumstances where the 
rights of the community to safety override the right of the young 
offender convicted of a heinous crime, of a violent crime, to 
anonymity.
<P>
	There is one other thing that is not in this bill which I have to 
raise because it deals basically with young people. It deals with 
offences against young people. I have spoken in the House 
before on this. An epidemic is going through the country of 
criminals who are committing perhaps the worst crime possible 
in our society today: adults who lure young women and in some 
cases young men into prostitution.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9996"> 9996 </A></B>
<P>
	I say it is an epidemic. It is an epidemic which has not been 
spoken about loud enough or long enough in Parliament or in 
provincial legislatures. We are literally seeing some of our 
young children being lifted off the streets and forced into 
prostitution.
<P>
	When we deal with the crimes of young offenders, the 
government must give priority to dealing with crimes against 
young people as well. I urge the Minister of Justice to quickly 
bring in new laws and new regulations to deal with this most 
serious crime. We need strict punishment and maximum 
sentences for those convicted of living off the avails of juvenile 
prostitution.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the hon. member for Dartmouth 
wishes to continue, he will have another two minutes when we 
resume Government Orders.
<P>
	It being eleven o'clock we will now proceed to Statements by 
Members.

	Our civilization is at a crossroads where diseases once 
thought to be a menace of the past are once again becoming a 
health threat.
<P>
	The emergence of diseases such as tuberculosis is creating 
concern on the public health front. The federal government 
along with its provincial counterparts must remain sufficiently 
prepared to combat this threat.
<P>
	Although Canada is also at a debt and deficit crossroads, there 
is a great need to maintain the laboratory centre for disease 
control and encourage provinces to enhance public health 
surveillance.
<P>
	To adequately evaluate and monitor vaccine issues such as 
new vaccine submissions, safety and efficiency, we must ensure 
that there is sufficient knowledgeable staff and physician 
expertise at the health protection branch of Health Canada.

U.S. President and the Prime Minister will sign the Open Sky 
Treaty. That agreement will significantly change the rules 
governing air transportation between Canada and the United 
States. It will open an important market for our air carriers. 
However, they will have to face increased competition.
<P>
	Air Canada will face more competition in a market where it is 
currently the only Canadian carrier. The Open Sky Treaty will 
allow Canadian International to further consolidate its 
operations with American Airlines, and to provide stiff 
competition to Air Canada.
<P>
	For reasons of fairness, the Minister of Transport must 
reconsider his decision and allow Air Canada to get full access 
to Hong Kong, the main landing point in Asia. The Bloc 
Quebecois will not put up with questionable political decisions 
which adversely affect the only world class carrier based in 
Quebec.

outrageously high and punitive taxes levied by both the federal

<P>
	Hiram Walker is a producer and marketer of Canadian Club, 
the world's leading premium Canadian whiskey. Hiram Walker

second largest beverage alcohol company. When companies are 
forced to close facilities as a result of excessive levels of 
taxation there is definitely a problem.

our government will be tabling its second budget. It is an 
opportunity to restore fiscal soundness and integrity to the 
Canadian economy. However, it is equally important that this 
not to occur at the expense of the middle class who already pay a 
disproportionate share of taxes and on whose backs much of the 
Canadian debt rests.
<P>
	Our party's history is one of providing Canadians with hope 
and opportunity. Unless we begin to reign in our debt and 
deficit, hope and opportunity will be lost. This must be 
unacceptable to all members of Parliament.
<P>
	The ultimate goal is to eliminate the deficit entirely. Three per 
cent of GDP by 1996-97 is an interim target and a very 
important one. It is a red book commitment and it will be met. In 
restoring soundness to our economy we will be able to continue

	The second reason is to encourage the ministry to consider an

<P>
	The suggestion is simply that the commercialization of any

President of the Treasury Board acted with extreme arrogance in 
his dealings with the largest public service union, which 
represents more than 70 per cent of federal government 
employees, when he rejected out of hand a counterproposal for 
downsizing the number of federal employees on a mutually 
acceptable basis.
<P>
	How does the President of the Treasury Board justify 
rejecting union proposals only a few hours after they were

really intended to co-operate with the union to achieve his 
downsizing objectives?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

Speaker, we have been in discussion and negotiation with the 
unions for several months. Various propositions including the 
ones that the Public Service Alliance has now formalized in 
writing have been considered over that period of time.
<P>
	Quite simply they are not a way of achieving our goal. In 
terms of being able to get our deficit down to 3 per cent and the 
downsizing that is required from that, we need to target the 
different positions based on the programs and services we would 
be reducing.

	Their proposition would not work in that regard and that is 
why I was not able to accept it.

there is room for negotiating when one's approach is not

result, he will be directly responsible for the inevitable 
disruption of services to the public that will ensue as a result of 
his unspeakable strategy?

public. I believe we will provide good quality services. We have 
good professional public servants who will continue to provide 
those services.
<P>
	However we have to shrink the size of government. We have 
to downsize to live within our means. We cannot afford to have 
all these positions.
<P>
	When we were discussing with the unions there was a great 
deal of acceptance of what we put forward. Fifteen of the sixteen 
unions agreed to the proposition that we put on the table. It was 
one; it was the alliance that did not agree with it.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

government employees. The government has come down on the 
side of confrontation, by rejecting the union's proposal out of 
hand, without bothering to negotiate, which is particularly 
offensive. This will lead to a showdown between the 
government and its employees.
<P>
	I would ask the President of the Treasury Board whether he 
agrees that this showdown, a direct consequence of his refusal to 
negotiate, may well turn into a major confrontation in which all 
parties stand to lose: public servants will lose their jobs, the

<P>
	The minister will no doubt recall that her former provincial

federal government to ease the criteria of the program for older 
worker adjustment in order to reduce the number of older 
Montreal workers unfairly excluded from this program.

<P>
	Given that the government of Quebec has pushed for a number

Speaker, the government's weak-kneed attempt at MP pension 
reform is a slap in the face to every taxpayer in the country.
<P>
	Despite the government's rhetoric this is still a gold plated 
pension plan for senior politicians. For example, under the old 
plan the Deputy Prime Minister would receive a base pension of 
$48,300 a year and collect $3.3 million by age 75 if she retired in 
1997. Under the new plan the Deputy Prime Minister will

by age 75 if she retired in 1997.
<P>

<P>
	I have a question for the President of the Treasury Board. How 
can the government ask taxpayers to tighten their belts in the 
budget on Monday night when senior ministers continue to feast 
at the MP pension trough?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are reducing the cost of pensions to taxpayers by 
some 33 per cent. We are cutting over and above the 
commitments we made in the election campaign.
<P>
	We said that we would end double dipping, and we have ended 
that. We said that we would put in a minimum age, and we have 
put in a minimum age of 55. On top of that we have also reduced 
the benefit level to save taxpayers 33 per cent of the cost of that 
pension plan or some $3.3 million annually.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the public will hardly be impressed by a 33 per cent 
reduction in a plan that is four to five times richer than any other 
plan in the country.
<P>
	The fact is that the minister had to abandon real MP pension 
reform under pressure from senior colleagues who wanted to 
preserve most of the excessive features of the old plan. We now 
have a two-tier MP pension plan. One for the fat pack and one 
for the rest: trough regular and trough light.
<P>
	Will the minister eliminate this two-tier system in favour of a 
plan that applies equally to all members of the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the entire preamble to the question is wrong. In fact the 
question is wrong too because there is not a two-tier system. It is 
a single tier system; it is a single plan.
<P>
	Furthermore it is not four to five times richer. That is absolute 
nonsense. Second, there was no pressure with respect to senior 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10002"> 10002 </A></B>

colleagues. There were attempts to find a plan that would serve 
the needs of members of  Parliament but at the same time reduce 
the cost to the taxpayer and to take a leadership role with respect 
to the forthcoming budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the only commendable feature of the revamped scheme 
is that it will allow MPs who put principles ahead of pork to opt 
out. My colleagues and I are opting out of this obscene plan. I 
trust we will be joined by the Minister of Finance, by the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, by the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration, by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and by the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Who will be the first to follow the Reform Party's lead and 
renounce their gold plated MP pension plan? Will the minister 
answer the question now by rising to his or her feet?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, not too many members of the House end up getting a 
pension plan because the average years of service are less than 
the vesting years of six. I can tell the House that in the case of 
third party members none of them would make it to the six-year 
vesting period anyway.
<P>
	They like to talk about the private sector, but in the private 
sector individuals do not get an opportunity to opt in or opt out. 
They are told that this is the plan and because of the actuarial 
integrity of the plan people are required to be a part of it. The 
Prime Minister has indicated to members of the third party that 
they will have the opportunity to opt out, and indeed they can.

situation which has an impact on the Canada Labour Code. The 
situation at Ogilvie Mills affects workers, but such problems 
exist everywhere in Canada. We have to look at the impact on 
businesses and employers. It is indeed a complex situation and, 
as with any complex issue, we must take the necessary time to 
find a good solution to the problem.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	A few moments ago he disputed the fact that the MP pension 
plan is far more generous than a private sector plan. Will he 
confirm that his plan has the following elements: a 4 per cent 
benefit rate that is double the rate of a very good private sector 
plan; full inflation protection that is unheard of in the private 
sector; age of receipt at 55 with full benefit that is also unheard 
of in the private sector; and on top of that, by lowering the MPs' 
own contribution rate from 11 per cent to 9 per cent, he slipped 
in an increase in take home pay for MPs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, talking about take home pay, there is no increase in 
salary. However, the folks in the third party would be taking 
home an awful lot more because they plan to opt out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10003"> 10003 </A></B>
<P>
	We need to look at this matter in the context of a total 
compensation package. The consultant who was hired by the 
previous government and reported on the question of 
compensation said that in fact compensation for members of 
Parliament is lower than that in the private sector.
<P>
	If we take it in that context and on top of that take into 
consideration that we are lowering the pension, members of 
Parliament are taking a compensation cut. The member's leader 
was four to five times and now he has gone down to two times. In 
the private sector it is very common to have additional 
supplementary plans over and above what is provided for under 
the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	In terms of the inflation index, members of Parliament pay 1 
per cent of their salary per year for that inflation index which 
does not even kick in until age 60.
<P>
	The plan is not how that party is trying to characterize it. Let 
us again bear in mind that we are reducing the compensation 
package. We are reducing the size of the plan by 33 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reformers will be taking a cut in their disposable income 
because Reformers and those Liberals who follow our lead will 
be taking care of their own retirement instead of having it paid 
for by the Government of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>

the minister ask Canadians to make sacrifices when the Liberal

	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> The number that does work here and which is

question for the minister of immigration arising from an issue in 
his own department.
<P>
	Daljit Powar assaulted his wife for years. He defrauded the UI 
system. Since 1985 he has had two aggravated assaults, one 
while he was out on bail. He was ordered deported in 1986. He 
appealed and won. He broke the conditions. He has drug 
charges. There have been more beatings, once to his child. 
Finally, there was another deportation order in 1989. Out he 
went and that is good.
<P>
	Now that we have finally kicked this fellow out of the country, 
why has the refugee board made a decision overriding the 
immigration deportation order and is now allowing him back 
into Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have mentioned before, it 
is difficult for parliamentarians to speak about the facts in an 
ongoing case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10004"> 10004 </A></B>
<P>
	We are speaking about a case that is before a quasi-judicial 
independent tribunal. We do not discuss matters when they are 
before judicial courts. I am not sure we should be getting into 
the intricate details while the case is ongoing.
<P>
	Suffice it to say, I am equally concerned about a number of 
cases that cause a certain degree of frustration and consternation 
for Canadians. That is one of the principal reasons this 
government has moved quickly to try to address the systematic 
features that could certainly be righted and could eliminate 
more abuse. This is one of the reasons we have Bill C-44.
<P>
	Why do Reform members relish talking about individual 
cases and at the same time refuse legislation to improve the 
system which would minimize the very cases they bring forward 
in this House of Commons day after day?
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister has said to me before in this House that these are 
isolated cases. There have been three in my own riding. Where 
else do we talk about these issues if not here?
<P>
	If we talk about where there is room to cut in budgets, this 
fellow has been ordered to pay $4,000 back to UIC after he 
picked up that amount of money while he was in jail. Want to 
look for places to cut in the budget?
<P>
	This man failed to comply with the conditions laid down the 
last time his deportation appeal was successful. Who is going to 
be responsible when he comes back in? Will it be the minister or 
the refugee board? Or would it really be most logical and likely 
that the minister could now overturn this and just not let him 
back in at all?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not saying we should not 
debate the issues here. There is a difference between discussing 
the responsibilities that we have as legislators and 
parliamentarians and not interfering with, as those on that side 
of the House talk to us about, independent tribunals.
<P>
	Let us talk about responsibility. Bill C-44 would permit the 
government of the day to forbid individuals like the hon. 
member member talks about from returning to Canada. We 
would not have to go through an inquiry process to get them out. 
It would enable a government to stop a refugee hearing and 
move it into an immigration inquiry. It would allow us as a 
government pending this legislation to forbid individuals based 
on national security from entering the refugee process.
<P>

rejecting Bill C-44 and then beating their chests about 
individual cases?

the minister realize that she is in the process of repeating with

security, the number of welfare recipients has gone up again. 
There are now more than 797,000 people on welfare. Although 
massive layoffs are announced in several sectors elsewhere in 
Canada, the government is clearly content to rely on the 
economic recovery to create jobs.
<P>
	Given the significant increase in the number of welfare 
recipients and the fact that the results of job creation programs 
are well below the figures quoted by the Prime Minister, does 
the government realize that it cannot just sit back and let the 
economy do the work and that it must put in place an active 
employment policy to provide the jobs so badly needed by 
Canadians and Quebecers?

constituency the unemployment rate has dropped almost 3 per 
cent during that one-year period.

average than under this government, notwithstanding the

<P>
	As members will know, this is one area within this 
government where we have not only held our budget but have 
increased

<B><A NAME="10008"> 10008 </A></B>
<P>
our budget because we believe that tourism marketing is one 
area through which we can put a lot of Canadians back to work in 
very short order.
<P>
	To facilitate that the Prime Minister announced in early 
January the Canadian tourism commission. The Minister of 
Industry announced all the appointed members February 1 and 
that commission is now receiving proposals from the private 
sector from tourism operators.
<P>
	It will consider those private sector marketing plans along 
with those funds. They in turn will be matched with the tourism 
commission's funds. Hopefully through that kind of joint 
venture and leveraged attempt we can-

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, each year the federal government gives provincial 
education departments millions of dollars to subsidize French 
classes.
<P>
	Much of this money is used by school boards as a source of 
general revenue rather than French language education. For 
example, a recent report by the Carleton Board of Education 
states the income from these grants supports the system as a 
whole and is not specifically directed to the immersion program.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Canadian Heritage or his secretary of 
state explain why his government is permitting money intended 
for French immersion to be used for general administration 
costs by school boards from coast to coast?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will have 
to take the question under advisement.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	In its red book, the Liberal government promised to create 
150,000 new child care spaces as soon as economic growth 
exceeded 3 per cent, at a rate of 50,000 spaces annually, a 
commitment that was reiterated by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development in his reform proposals. Last February, 
the Minister of Finance provided for a $120 million envelope for 
1995-96 and another $240 million for 1996-97 to finance these 
new child care spaces.
<P>
	Since there is every indication that this year, economic 
growth will exceed 3 per cent, is the government still prepared 
to act on its commitment, while of course respecting current 
provincial responsibility for child care?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have already started 
discussions with the provinces.
<P>
	My deputy met with his counterparts in January. We hope to 
have a follow-up meeting in the spring. We have also started 
direct negotiations with representatives of the First Nations 
peoples to provide 6,000 spaces for them.
<P>
	It is simply a matter of having to work in co-operation with 
both our aboriginal peoples and provincial jurisdictions.

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, some of my 
colleagues on the finance committee who attended the 
committee's sittings wish to thank all the groups and experts 
who came to testify before the committee. Since today, they are 
away on business in their constituencies, I will express our 
party's dissenting opinion.
<P>
	After several attempts to reach a consensus, the Bloc 
Quebecois had to reject the majority report tabled by the finance 
committee.
<P>
	The official opposition is not against the principle of family 
trusts as such. However, the Bloc Quebecois cannot endorse the 
conclusions of the committee that favour maintaining Bill C-92, 
which allows wealthy Canadian families to use family trusts as a 
tax shelter. According to the experts who testified before the 
committee, the tax revenues forgone as a result of Bill C-92 
would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois was also surprised at the complete 
reversal of the position taken by the Liberal Party of Canada 
which, when it was in the opposition, vigorously condemned 
Bill C-92. Today, by tabling this report, the Liberals put their 
seal of approval on the deferral of capital gains tax for the next 
twenty or thirty years and have thus refused to abolish the tax 
privileges of the wealthy.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to say that, for these reasons, the 
Bloc Quebecois demands, in its dissenting opinion, that the 
family trust system be amended so as to tax the capital gains of 
these family trusts.

moved for leave to introduce Bill C-310, an act to provide 
resumption of operations of Archer Daniel Midland Ltd.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide a few details on 
this bill.
<P>
	There is a labour dispute between ADM Agri-Industries Ltd. 
and the Ogilvie Mills Ltd employees union affecting some 150 
production employees. The parties are negotiating a new 
collective agreement to replace the one which expired on 
January 31, 1992.
<P>
	A conciliator and then a mediator were appointed to help the 
parties resolve their differences. Unfortunately, little progress 
has been made up to now. The union declared a legal general 
strike on June 6, 1994. The strike begun eight months ago is 
continuing. The employer has continued its activities with the 
help of replacement workers.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I am therefore proposing a bill to provide for the appointment 
of an arbitrator to resolve this dispute, and, within 30 days, or 
longer, with the approval of the minister, the arbitrator should 
determine the issues on which the parties agreed, make an 
arbitration award on unresolved issues and prepare a 
memorandum of understanding for a return to work.
<P>
	The bill contains provisions to require the parties to accept the 
memorandum of agreement for the return to work and the 
resumption of operations. It also contains sanctions in the form 
of fines, in the event the act is contravened. The act would come 
into force the day after royal assent.

<P>
	In 1994 Canada and the United States and over 100 countries 
signed a new GATT agreement aimed at reducing trade barriers 
and increasing market access over time. However, in the face 
of this global trade liberalization the United States preserved 
its own protectionist, high priced sugar program and took the 
opportunity to further reduce Canada's access for sugar and 
sugar containing products.
<P>
	On January 1, 1995 Canada's exports of refined sugar and 
sugar containing products were forcibly reduced to a trickle. 
The sugar industry estimates that this will result in a $90 million 
loss in export trade accompanied by substantial job losses in 
Canada's refining and food processing industries.
<P>
	Imports from the United States are unrestricted and continue 
to rise as Canadian tariffs on U.S. sugar and sugar containing 
products decline under NAFTA.
<P>
	This is one way free trade and will result in millions of dollars 
of lost revenue, countless job losses and the reallocation of 
plants producing sugar containing products to the United States.
<P>
	In conclusion, our Prime Minister yesterday quoted that the 
Americans are our best friends whether we like it or not. Let us 
resolve this issue quickly as friends.

operations at ADM Agri-Industries Ltd.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would also like to table a bill 
regarding the resumption of operations of the company ADM 
Agri-Industries Ltd. As was already said, the employees of this 
company have been negotiating their collective agreement since 
it expired on January 31, 1992. The employees have been on 
strike now for eight months.
<P>
	Despite the efforts of conciliators and mediators to put an end 
to this strike, it has dragged on and the employer has kept 
operations running by hiring outside help. Therefore, I am 
tabling this bill, which provides for a mediator-arbitrator to 
settle the conflict and which provides that employees will go 
back to work under the terms of a memorandum of agreement, 
drafted by the mediator-arbitrator.

the legislation is not respected.

the signatures of 500 residents of Saint-Hyacinthe that were 
sent to met by my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	The petitioners wish to draw the attention of Parliament to 
their current precarious situation and their inability to afford the 
20 per cent rent increase contemplated by the government. This 
increase will affect 110,000 Quebec households who live in 
social housing units and earn an average annual income of 
$10,000. That translates into an annual rent increase of $500 per 
household, which is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	The petitioners urge Parliament to renounce any measures to 
save money that would impoverish tenants.
<P>
	I totally and wholeheartedly support this petition and urge the 
government to take appropriate action.

Question No. 104-<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is there, or has there ever been an audit of the Canadian Wheat Board 
accounts and if so, (<I>a</I>) by whom, (<I>b</I>) are the audits publicly available, (<I>c</I>) how 
much money is owed to the CWB by foreign governments and (<I>d</I>) how much of 
that debt has been written off as uncollectable?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> (a) The Canadian Wheat Board accounts are 
audited by an independent external auditor, Deloitte and 
Touche, Chartered Accountants. In addition, management of the 
Canadian Wheat Board is responsible for having good internal 
controls and formal policies and procedures to ensure the 
integrity and reliability of accounting and financial reporting. 
Management continually evaluates policies and procedures to 
ensure they meet the needs of the board and comply with current 
Canadian accounting standards. An internal audit group 
independently assesses the effectiveness of internal controls and 
recommends improvements.
<P>
	(b) Audit results are published each year in the annual report 
of the Canadian Wheat Board which is tabled in Parliament and 
publicly available.
<P>
	(c) As of 30 September 1994, the Canadian Wheat Board 
accounts receivable due from foreign customers totals $6.901 
billion.
<P>
	(d) The Canadian Wheat Board has not written off receivables 
from foreign governments. The Canadian government has, 
however, agreed, along with other creditor countries to 
implement multilateral, Paris club, debt relief initiatives for 
Poland and Egypt. Zambia and Ethiopia received much smaller 
debt relief packages. The Polish debt relief package was created 
to assist that country in its transition to a democratic state in 
pursuit of market oriented reforms. The Egyptian debt relief 
agreement was made to enable Egypt to recover from the 
aftereffects of the gulf war. In neither case was the debt relief 
granted because the debt was considered to be uncollectible.
<P>
	About $522 million will be drawn down in this fiscal year 
from the allowances of the Government of Canada for general 
contingencies which were created in 1990. Further drawdowns 
will be made in fiscal year 1995-96 to complete debt relief 
operations for Poland and Egypt.
<P>
	Poland's debt to Canadian government agencies has been 
reduced by about $216 million. After debt reduction, Egypt's 
debts will be reduced by $279 million. Egypt and Poland are 
servicing the remainder of their debts punctually.

<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to reports by non-governmental organizations that Vietnamese 
refugees interned in Southeast Asian camps are being subjected to inhumane 
treatment by host governments, (<I>a</I>) is the government investigating these 
reports and (<I>b</I>) what action does the government plan to take with respect to 
these alleged human rights violations?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
The specific non-governmental report cited by the member in 
this question is Amnesty International Calls for Action to 
Protect Asylum-Seekers, Al Index ASA 19/WU 03/94.
<P>
	Although cognizant of allegations of human rights abuses in 
Hong Kong refugee camps, the government was not aware of 
this specific report prior to the member's question.
<P>
	As an active supporter of the comprehensive plan of action, 
CPA, on indochinese refugees, Canada recognizes that persons 
who are not refugees should return to their countries of origin. 
The group under discussion was determined by authorities not to 
be refugees. At the same time, the Government of Canada 
prefers that humane methods be used to ensure the safe 
repatriation of these individuals.
<P>
	The Government of Canada recognizes that the protection of 
refugees and asylum seekers falls under the mandate of the 
United Nations high commissioner for refugees, UNHCR, and 
will continue to work with the UNCHR to bring the CPA to a 
successful conclusion.

Speaker, would you be so kind as to call Starred Question No. 
86.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
*Question No. 86-<B>Mr. Deshaies:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Regarding service, supply and leasing contracts awarded by Public Works and 
Government Services Canada, (a) how many such contracts have been awarded 
in Abitibi since October 25, 1993, (<I>b</I>) what amounts are involved, (<I>c</I>) to whom 
were these contracts awarded?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> The information requested is not 
available in an existing document and it cannot be produced 
within the department's routine operations. The manual and 
electronic data banks of the four distinct organizations which 
existed prior to the merger forming the department of Public 
Works and Government Services have not as of yet been 
integrated or updated. To compile information which represents 
the contracting activities of the entire department, an in-depth 
search would have to be conducted throughout the many sectors 
of the department and their data banks.
<P>
	The department does not currently have the capability within 
its routine operations to produce accurate statistical information 
for all of its contracting activities within electoral boundaries.
<P>
	The department is presently considering the various options 
available to it to update and integrate its various information 
holdings.
<P>
	As an alternative approach to providing contracting 
information to members of Parliament, efforts have been made 
to facilitate access to the open bidding service, OBS. The OBS is 
a user-pay electronic bulletin board which publicly advertises 
contract opportunities, notices of planned sole-source 
contracts, as well as notices of contract awards. Through the 
OBS, contract histories are also available, allowing subscribers 
to find information on OBS contracts that have been awarded in 
the past, to whom, and for what amount.
<P>
	In addition, PWGSC's publication, ``Government Business 
Opportunities'', GBO, is published three times a week and 
provides similar information on federal government 
procurement. The GBO is available to members of Parliament 
free of charge through the federal government depository 
services program.
<P>
	Please note that this type of information for the whole 
province of Quebec is available in the answer to question Q-93 
tabled this day.
<P>

<P>
	The hon. member says that it has taken a long time to answer 
this question. He is correct. Over 1,000 pages of material have

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion. That Bill 
C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act and the Criminal 
Code, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak once more against the bill 
before us, Bill C-37.
<P>
	I am sad to see that the government keeps wanting us to pass 
yet another bill tinted with a social policy that goes against the 
wishes and reality of the people of Quebec as well as the 
interests of the people of Canada.
<P>
	On this issue as on many others, we, in Quebec, do not regard 
or live the juvenile delinquency problem the same way as 
English Canada does. As I said eight months ago, the rate of 
juvenile delinquency in Quebec is the second lowest in Canada, 
after Prince Edward Island. In Quebec, the detention rate for 
young offenders is the lowest in Canada.
<P>
	When you put these two facts together, you can see that a more 
systematic and lengthy detention, as proposed in the bill, has no 
bearing on the rate of juvenile delinquency. That is what we 
found out in Quebec.
<P>
	In Quebec, we believe that where the real problems with the 
judicial handling of young offenders lie is with undue delays 
before sentencing and a settlement rate of 29 per cent at best for 
problems related to crime. This means that 71 per cent of young 
offenders get the idea they can do it again with complete 
impunity.
<P>
	In Quebec, we also believe that the first thing to do is to deal 
with the social roots of violence. We believe in eradicating 
poverty affecting women and their children. In Quebec, we 
believe in making easier the access of women and their children 
to shelters, so that they can escape family violence. In Quebec, 
we believe in improving access to social housing so that young 
people can brought up in a healthy environment. In Quebec, this 
is the approach generally favoured.
<P>
	These points quite naturally demonstrate that Quebec society 
is opposed to any change to the existing legislation, because, if 
used wisely, it can achieve different results depending on the 
situation. Unfortunately, it is not the Quebec approach that the 
federal government wants to impose on us. The quick fix the 
government would have us adopt is a heavy-handed approach.
<P>
	This government is inconsistency personified. For instance, it 
blithely reneges on its campaign promise that it would not 
reduce transfer payments to the provinces, payments which help 
to improve the quality of life of the neediest in our society, 
including women and children, while it insists on keeping those 
with more devious public appeal.
<P>
	How do we reconcile statements by the minister that there has 
been no increase in violent crime in Canada with Bill C-37? The 
answer is simple: this bill fits nicely into the latter categories: 
the promises the party has to keep if it is to maintain its standing 
in the polls.
<P>
	This is outrageous, and this so-called social policy should be 
seen for what it really is: a campaign promise based not on 
reality but on myth, a campaign promise whose impact will be 
extremely harmful, and finally, a campaign promise that smacks 
of the extreme right wing.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10015"> 10015 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	We condemn this clumsy attempt by the government to make 
political gains at the expense of minors. This is not the Quebec 
way. The end, the means and the probable results are equally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	It is common knowledge that increased sentencing and the 
incarceration of young offenders in prisons for adults are the 
easy way out and are more likely to provide opportunities for the 
homosexual exploitation of young people than for rehabilitation 
and for training these people to be responsible citizens. It is also 
common knowledge that the amount of time spent in custody is 
not a factor in treatment and social reintegration, and that five 
years are ample, since the impact on young people is different.
<P>
	Two experiments conducted in the United States, which were 
similar to those proposed by the Minister of Justice, produced 
negative results.
<P>
	I would now like to discuss the position of the victims who are 
supposed to benefit as a result of amendments to the legislation, 
and I am referring to women. I have already pointed out that a 
number of women's groups do not support the proposed 
amendments.
<P>
	During the six months elapsed since the second reading of this 
bill, the government has failed to convince women that the 
proposed changes will help reduce violence against women. 
Women know perfectly well that young boys, who constitute the 
vast majority of offenders affected by the legislation, do not 
represent a threat to women, although the legislation is also 
supposed to be a way to reduce violence against women. I may 
refer hon. members to the findings of a wide ranging survey by 
Statistics Canada on violence against women, published in 
November 1993. According to the survey, one woman out of two 
was a victim of violence and, in the vast majority of cases, the 
aggressor was known to the victim.
<P>
	In this instance, aggressor refers to the spouse or ex-spouse, 
not an unknown adolescent. We must look at the facts. Women 
who fall prey to violence are the targets of someone with whom 
they are having or have had an intimate relationship. In 
discussing the problem of violence against women, a possible 
role of a juvenile delinquent does not even come to mind.
<P>
	Other important players, by virtue of their position in society, 
have also spoken out against this government bill. Think for 
example of religious communities whose apostolic mandate 
permits them to evaluate social policies from a global 
perspective. Moreover, the Church Council on Justice and 
Corrections argues that these presumably draconian measures 
do not provide a legitimate solution to juvenile delinquency. 
The ``law and order'' approach seems to calm public fears for 
the time being, but it does not address the true problems of 
juvenile crime. What is worse, it fosters false hopes given the ad 
hoc and simplistic nature of the legislation.
<P>
	I would like to point out that this view is shared by the 
Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Quakers, the 
Mennonite Central Committee of Canada, the United Church of 
Canada and the Oblate Community of Manitoba.
<P>
	There is also the scientific community whose research on 
dealing with juvenile delinquency does not in any way support 
the conclusions reached by the justice minister.
<P>
	This would be the result of the proposed amendments. They 
would help neither the victims nor the young persons. They do 
not in any way address the problems with which young 
Canadians are grappling.
<P>
	Above all, no consideration whatsoever is given to the 
specific nature of Quebec. What a great example of federalism. 
This bill, conceived purely with elections in mind, will 
unfortunately harm individuals who in fact need the 
government's help, that is the victims and young persons. 
Instead of giving women's organizations the necessary funding 
to help deal with the effects of violence, it would imprison the 
most vulnerable in our society, our young people. Another 
opportunity wasted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to address Bill 
C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	This is an issue about which my constituents feel very 
strongly. That is probably true across Canada. Not a day goes by 
without my office receiving a letter on this subject. Two weeks 
ago I presented a petition with 16,300 names calling on 
Parliament to revise this act in a more meaningful way.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The organizer of the petition is a constituent of mine, Mr. 
Bernard Castet. Mr. Castet became involved in this issue after 
his young son, André, was brutally and senselessly beaten and 
killed by two youths.
<P>
	It is hard enough for a parent to handle the loss of a child but 
Mr. Castet's grief was further compounded by the fact that these 
two young offenders would be tried in youth court for this 
vicious and unprovoked attack.
<P>
	It is a sad reality of the current act that Mr. Castet had to go to 
court to fight the system in an effort to have the two youths 
raised to adult court where, if found guilty, they could receive 
the type of sentence that would match the crime. After months of 
hearings, the court has now ruled that these two accused killers 
will be tried as adults. However if the government had accepted 
Reform's amendments to the bill, others like Mr. Castet would 
not have to go through this same trauma.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10016"> 10016 </A></B>
<P>
	One such amendment called for any young offender charged 
with murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated 
sexual assault and aggravated assault to be tried in adult court. 
This is also the substance of Mr. Castet's petition.
<P>
	The Reform Party, along with Mr. Castet and the more than 
16,300 people who signed that petition, believe such an 
amendment would be a positive step, not only in terms of meting 
out punishment to fit the crime, but also as a deterrent factor. 
Admittedly the justice committee did put forward a compromise 
amendment but it is still less than what the public demands and 
desires.
<P>
	Reform also called for a lowering of the age definition by two 
years from 12 to 17 years inclusive to 10 to 15 years. Most 
people, except the government, seem to agree that if a person is 
old enough to get a driver's licence and have many other societal 
responsibilities, that person is old enough to be accountable for 
his or her actions in adult court. Such a change in age limits 
would also prevent young offenders from slipping through the 
cracks of the current legislation.
<P>
	Mr. Castet and his 16,300 petitioners also agree with the 
Reform Party that the extra privacy provisions of the Young 
Offenders Act are inappropriate for violent or repeat young 
offenders. In these cases, the publishing of names would make 
protection of the community the number one priority.
<P>
	Reform also supports amendments to make parents more 
accountable for the actions of their children. This accountability 
would take the form of compensating victims for property 
crimes if it can be demonstrated that there was not a reasonable 
effort to exercise parental control.
<P>
	While Reform members advocate such things as stiffer 
penalties for serious crimes, we are not looking to lock up all 
young offenders nor do we believe that even the most hardened 
young offender is beyond rehabilitation. A further Reform 
amendment posed just such an approach, calling for 
rehabilitation opportunities to be emphasized in a disciplined 
environment.
<P>
	I would like to take a minute to address another item that I 
have brought up in the House before. I would like the House to 
consider seriously the whole matter of the punishment of young 
offenders.
<P>
	Looking at the situation facing us today, young offenders are 
put away but they lose none of their rights. They can go with 
their hair whatever length they want. They have colour TV. They 
have all the rights in the world. There is no sense of punishment 
or discipline. A movement was started in the United States 
called boot camps. I approve of the thrust of this movement 
because it disciplines young offenders. They cannot go into a 
punishment facility with their own agenda. If they are found 
guilty of something they have to follow the agenda of the boot 
camp.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I have stood here before and spoken of my experience in the 
past, not as an inmate of a Canadian army detention barracks but 
as an observer of one. The basic thing about a detention barracks 
was that the inmate obeyed every rule immediately. After 
having served his minimal time he swore that he would never go 
back to that facility again. He was not abused. He was not 
beaten. He was simply made to toe the line. This works.
<P>
	The other big benefit of this scheme where inmates are 
disciplined and made to follow our agenda and not their own 
agenda is that it is cost effective. Young offenders or anyone else 
for that matter, even an older offender, can be put in such a 
facility and in 30 days they are ready to obey the rules of society. 
It will have an effect that 60 days or 90 days or half a year of 
doing what they want in a youth facility will not have.
<P>
	I will wind down that portion of my pitch to the House in 
pleading with all members to please let us take a look at the 
effectiveness of such discipline on young offenders particularly, 
but on others as well.
<P>
	In conclusion, in carefully reviewing the bill I fully 
appreciate the efforts the Minister of Justice has made to try and 
satisfy the various special interest groups which make up the 
Liberal Party. It is a formidable task. However, in doing so the 
minister has put forward yet another piece of middle of the road 
legislation which has become the trademark of all Liberal 
governments.
<P>
	Unfortunately the vast majority of Canadians want decisive 
action on this issue, not this watered down liberalism. On behalf 
of Mr. Castet and his late son André, I urge the government to 
hop off the fence and make the necessary changes to this 
important legislation.
<P>
	If I have two minutes left I am going to once again return to 
my pitch and plead with the public as well as the members of the 
House to consider running boot camps or military style 
detention camps. For a minimum period of incarceration these 
camps will have a disciplinary effect for life on the people 
subject to that sort of punishment. It does not inflict physical 
harm. It simply says: ``You obey the rules of this establishment. 
You do not have rules of your own''. In so doing, it brings them 
around to saying: ``Yes. Maybe I had better pay attention and 
listen to what society is telling me''.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is of course my pleasure to take my turn to 
speak on Bill C-37. As my colleagues already mentioned 
several times, the Bloc Quebecois finds this bill totally 
unacceptable for many reasons. The short time I have been 
allotted only allows me to gloss over the four main reasons.
<P>
	As I said, there are four major reasons why we do not accept 
this bill. Firstly, the bill's methodology is incoherent; secondly, 
in many respects, it is poorly designed and is very ambiguous; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10017"> 10017 </A></B>
<P>
thirdly, it imposes on  Quebec nation wide legislation, although 
we already have the best system in this area in Canada; fourthly, 
it is doubtful the bill will be effective.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	This bill is incoherent. I hope that my hon. colleague will 
listen, and he will see what I mean. The minister is proposing 
important changes to the act that the committee will be carefully 
studying later on. Obviously, the time to do a study is before and 
not after the changes are made. This is a classic case of putting 
the cart before the horse. Furthermore, the Quebec Bar 
Association's paper, from which I will read a few passages, fully 
agrees with this analysis.
<P>
	The bar association stated that, regarding this issue, it could 
only deplore the decision to start by amending the law, and then 
to backtrack and carefully study the legislation and juvenile 
delinquency. In addition to acknowledging Quebec's success in 
the area, starting at the other end would have made it easier to 
identify the specific mechanisms needed for the system to work 
well and the preliminary study of juvenile delinquency would 
have allowed to take stock of the outcome of the 1992 changes. 
This bill has already been amended. No one has evaluated the 
consequences, yet, we are getting ready to once again amend it 
and to do studies after the fact.
<P>
	And the bar association ended by saying that it had reached 
the inevitable conclusion that Bill C-37, currently under 
consideration, should be withdrawn. It acknowledged that this 
was politically out of the question and that the minister had 
doubtless already made a public commitment. It proposed that 
the minister at least suspend consideration and first study the 
situation of crime among young people and look at the overall 
structure of the Young Offenders Act and then only return to the 
legislative amendments.
<P>
	There is a another reason we find this awkward and highly 
ambiguous bill unacceptable. We have cited many ambiguities 
here in the House in the past few days, since we started 
discussing the bill. I would like to draw attention to some of 
them, in passing, before going on to other points.
<P>
	Clause 1 of Bill C-37 introduces statements of principles into 
the act to the effect that crime prevention is essential to the 
protection of society and that a multidisciplinary approach is 
required to put an end to the problem.
<P>
	Clause 15 of the bill provides that custody is not a substitute 
for appropriate child protection or health measures. It also 
provides that the courts should consider other alternatives 
before contemplating custody. Such statements are entirely in 
keeping with the Bloc's statements, of course. However, the bill 
does not speak about the actual alternatives. The bill talks of 
alternative solutions, but no effective measures are provided to 
carry them out.
<P>
	Another argument is as follows. One of the major points of 
this bill is the amendment to arrangements for transfer to an 
adult court. Under the current system, youth court is supposed to 
bear society's interests in mind, notably public protection and 
social reintegration of the young person; at the same time, it 
must ascertain whether these two objectives can be reconciled 
while retaining jurisdiction over young persons. Otherwise, the 
young person must be transferred to adult court.
<P>
	Clauses 3 and 8 of Bill C-37 introduce amendments providing 
for 16 or 17 year olds charged with criminal offences involving 
serious bodily harm to be automatically transferred to adult 
court. These criminal offences are first or second degree murder, 
attempt to commit murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual 
assault and assault. Bill C-37 stipulates that a young person sent 
directly to adult court could nevertheless ask a youth court judge 
to hear his case.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	In cases of 16 or 17 year olds charged with serious bodily 
harm, the burden of proof is thus reversed in regard to transfer to 
adult court. This young person would in fact have to convince 
the youth court that it is suited to judge his case. Under present 
provisions, the crown must convince the judge to transfer the 
young person to adult court.
<P>
	Thus this serves to a create of a hierarchy of age groups in 
respect of the courts. However, while the legislation does not 
distinguish between 12 to 15 year olds and 16 and 17 year olds, 
these amendments will change the way they are dealt with for 
offences involving serious bodily harm. Certain lawyers might 
argue that this represents a violation of the right to equality 
before the law granted under section 15 of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	On the other hand, subclause 13(3) of the same bill provides 
that maximum sentences imposed for first and second degree 
murder be increased from five years to ten and seven years 
respectively. In cases of first degree murder, the maximum 
period of custody is six years to be served continuously and 
seven years for second degree murder, with four years served 
continuously.
<P>
	These harsher sentences are not justified given that homicide 
rates have dropped since the 1970s. Furthermore, it seems that 
16 and 17 year olds are responsible for the vast majority, or 
about 60 per cent, of murders committed by teenagers. The bill 
provides that they will be transferred to adult court and tried 
according to adult rules. The impact of these increased 
sentences will not be as significant as one would think at first. 
Everything seems to indicate that the burden will fall mostly on 
the shoulders of 12 to 15 year olds, something which is not 
justified by crime statistics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10018"> 10018 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, the act was amended before in 1992, as was pointed 
out earlier, to increase sentences to five years in murder cases. 
Since statistics are not up to date, there is no way to check the 
effect of the 1992 amendment at the present time. How can 
another amendment be justified at this stage? Why not wait to 
find out the impact of the 1992 amendment before taking more 
repressive measures? That is what the bar association is 
wondering.
<P>
	Finally, this is a Canada-wide piece of legislation, which 
would force Quebec to adopt procedures when Quebec already 
has its own rather remarkable ways of doing things. I would like 
to, once again, quote some of the comments made by the bar 
association: ``It is important to note that Quebec did not address 
the problems in the same way as the rest of Canada. As a result, 
the problems are rarely experienced in Quebec and it would 
therefore be more appropriate to preserve the overall status quo 
than to modify a proven system. On the other hand, we must 
conclude that the same results could be achieved in the rest of 
Canada with adequate material resources''.
<P>
	The bar association recognizes that one of the major flaws in 
this bill is the lack of resources that we are willing to allocate to 
our young people's social reintegration. I would also like to 
mention what a colleague from the Liberal Party, the hon. 
member for London West, said recently. I think she is absolutely 
right. She said: ``If I were a youth in trouble with the law today, I 
would much rather be in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada. 
Quebec takes a much more progressive interpretation of the 
Young Offenders Act. More diversions tactics are used to 
prevent young people from being tried. I think that we can and 
must follow its lead''.
<P>
	But it is not the case here. The federal government is not 
following the lead of Quebec, but rather trying to impose upon 
Quebec an unduly punitive legislation under the circumstances, 
since, as we know and as my hon. colleague from Quebec just 
mentioned, Quebec is the province who achieves the best results 
while using the least repression.
<P>
	Finally, one can very seriously doubt the effectiveness of this 
legislation because nothing, at present, indicates that crime is 
reduced in inverse proportion to the length of sentences. I will 
conclude on this. At the same time, and many of our colleagues 
raised this point, the public is being hugely sensitized to crime 
nowadays.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Just take the United States, the best example of a place where 
you find both maximum repression and maximum crime. We do 
not think that the present circumstances justify a stiffening of 
legislation to solve what is more than anything else a profound 
social problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach. And 
in this respect, Quebec's lead should be followed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to something as 
important as Bill C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders 
Act and Criminal Code.
<P>
	This bill is in response to the increasing tide of violent crime. 
It especially is in response to the cries for justice from a public 
that is fed up with being terrorized by criminals, youth and adult 
alike, and seeing a judicial system inadequate to protect them 
and their property. It also responds to the cries from police who 
find the system which has been set out to deal with convicted 
criminals to be completely inadequate.
<P>
	The frustration has been so extreme that some individuals in 
my riding who have been harassed by youth criminals have even 
suggested corporal punishment as a disincentive. Given some of 
the situations these people have been in, I cannot say I disagree 
with them.
<P>
	I agree with this bill's initiative and will support it. However, 
I and my party believe the bill does not go far enough. In my 
speech I will deal with the principles of the bill and put forth 
some constructive criticisms and additions that I hope the 
minister will consider.
<P>
	I agree with the increased penalties particularly for violent 
offences such as first degree and second degree murder and also 
the movement of 16 and 17 year olds to adult court at the 
discretion of the judges for violent offences.
<P>
	I would agree with the principle of discouraging lengthening 
incarcerations in secure custody for non-violent offenders as I 
do not think it will serve the offender nor will it serve society 
well. However, we must also ask ourselves what this will be 
replaced with. Nowhere in this bill do I see this addressed.
<P>
	One of the greatest problems in youth criminal behaviour is 
not only the violence but also the non-violent criminal acts 
which encompass a much larger number of criminal behaviour. 
Many youths who commit these acts for example, break and 
enter and auto theft, often repeat them many times over. They 
are convicted, penalized, incarcerated and released, only to 
repeat the sad cycle of breaking the law once again. The public 
and the police are understandably frustrated.
<P>
	Justice must be served in a number of functions. The first one 
is the protection of society. The second one is the rehabilitation 
of the criminal. The third is the restitution to society and the 
victim. There should also be a disincentive to offend. The justice 
system has failed in many cases on all three fronts. All you need 
to do, as I said before, is to speak to those individuals who work 
in the system to know this is so.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party have suggested that the convicted 
must pay back to the victim or society in some substantive 
fashion, for example by way of work or money. Also, to effect 
rehabilitation part of the penalty  must be obligatory; the youth 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10019"> 10019 </A></B>
<P>
must engage in school or a training program to provide him or 
her with the skills needed to be a productive member of society. 
This can similarly be applied to counselling and psychiatric 
services that the courts feel the offender must take. The offender 
must also be an active and willing participant in this, for not to 
do this would defeat the whole purpose of rehabilitation.
<P>
	Relating to the rehabilitation of the young offender or lack 
thereof, many of these youths offend and reoffend. We must ask 
ourselves why this is so. Part of the reason is that tragically 
many of them themselves find that secure custody is a better 
environment than the one they come from.
<P>
	This was graphically illustrated to me by a patient I saw not 
too many years ago. This young man of 15 stood in front of me 
prior to his release and pleaded with me to stay in the maximum 
security youth detention centre. He said: ``Dr. Martin, if you let 
me go, I will go out and reoffend''. That broke my heart. It was 
tragic. It brought to my mind that there was something 
desperately in need in our system if we had a young offender 
who had to say that. These young people need to be removed 
from the environment they find themselves and sent far away 
from the city to perhaps a setting in a rural area away from the 
drugs, the alcohol, the sexual abuse and the violence they are 
subjected to.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	A change in environment is absolutely imperative for their 
rehabilitation. Also important is the length of time they are 
subjected to this change. They must be away from these 
destructive environments for a long period of time. I cannot 
emphasize that enough. It requires a long period of time to effect 
a change in behaviour and undo the damage of the many years of 
destructive influence they have been subjected to during their 
formative years. Repeat young offenders need stable, 
disciplined and constructive environments not for months but 
for a year or preferably longer.
<P>
	Some may consider this suggestion harsh, but the idea is to get 
them into an secure and safe environment of normalcy where 
they can start to address the psychological and behavioural 
reasons they commit crimes. This cannot be done in the 
destructive environment in which many offenders find 
themselves, regardless how many dollars are spent on social 
workers and counselling. It will not work.
<P>
	We will not change much by putting these individuals either 
into halfway houses or community rehabilitation centres for a 
few months, the reason being that they are in close proximity to 
the same environment they were in before. Therefore they are 
subjected to the same stresses that bred criminal behaviour in 
the first place that we see manifested in society.
<P>
	Also the Reform Party has suggested that parents who 
wilfully abrogate responsibility for their children must also be 
held accountable. This could be in the form of fines imposed on 
parents.
<P>
	Finally I address the penalty for violent crime. I agree with 
the lengthening of sentences. I suggest to the minister that 
another aspect is not addressed in the bill. Youth and adults who 
commit violent offences and are deemed to likely reoffend at the 
end of their sentences should continue to be held in custody until 
such time as they do not pose a threat to innocent people.
<P>
	The rationale behind this idea comes from our belief that the 
rights and protection of victims in society are of the greatest 
importance with regard to justice. In the past I believe the rights 
of the victim have been violated and in our perception the rights 
of the convicted have been held at a higher level than those of 
the innocent.
<P>
	The bill talks about the consideration of victim impact 
statements along those lines prior to sentencing. Rather than 
making them a consideration they should be made obligatory. It 
should be the right of the victim to give an impact statement at 
the time of sentencing.
<P>
	I will address the prevention of crime. I do not have the 
answer but I would like to give a few insights having worked in 
the system both as a guard and as a physician. As we have all 
agreed the causes of crime are multifaceted. As I have said 
before many youths who commit crimes tragically come from 
horrendous family situations, often broken families, and are 
subject to the improper or inadequate parenting, sexual or 
physical abuse and alcohol and drug abuse often rampant in their 
history. Many children are born into these tragic situations and 
develop personality and psychological traits and behaviours that 
can lead to criminal behaviour.
<P>
	The number of individuals subjected to such a tragic 
environment are increasing. Thus the number of people who 
suffer psychological dislocations as children that are manifested 
in criminal behaviour as adults will also increase. This will 
result in an increase in social costs in many areas, only one of 
which is criminal behaviour.
<P>
	We should address the contributing factors that produce 
criminal behaviour. Children must be taught early at the 
beginning of their school years about appropriate behaviour, 
self-respect, respect for others, personal responsibility, what 
drugs, alcohol and sexual abuse are about, in addition to their <I>a, 
b, c</I>'s. It must happen at a very early age, at the age of five or six.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The parents could also be brought into the classroom so that 
they too could learn the value of important parenting and those 
lessons they may not have been subjected to as children. As 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10020"> 10020 </A></B>
<P>
individuals we must learn these things if we are collectively to 
have a safe, responsible and law-abiding society.
<P>
	If we are to address the antecedent issues to youth crime it 
will serve not only current youth offenders but will hopefully 
prevent those who normally take the path to criminal behaviour 
from doing so. It is an advantage to them and for the protection 
of society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in June 1994, the Minister of Justice proposed the 
second reading of Bill C-37 and its referral to a committee for 
review.
<P>
	The standing committee on justice recently made 28 
amendments which do not significantly change the original 
piece of legislation. Indeed, the repressive nature of the bill 
remains intact and the current version once again overlooks the 
issue of social reintegration and rehabilitation of young 
offenders.
<P>
	Today, Bill C-37 still only meets one objective: to silence 
Liberal hard-liners and to try to please those of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	The bill is very simple; yet, its scope will greatly change the 
government's view of the issue of juvenile delinquency and the 
way to deal with it.
<P>
	Indeed, this legislation significantly changes the statement of 
principle governing the current law by stating the following, and 
I quote: ``the protection of society, which is a primary objective 
of the criminal law applicable to youth, is best served by 
rehabilitation, wherever possible, of young persons''.
<P>
	Bill C-37 also provides harsher sentences for young 
offenders, as well as an automatic appearance before an adult 
court for 16 and 17 year olds who commit serious crimes.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-37 proposes a major change to the current 
legislation by specifying that the professionals involved will be 
allowed to exchange information on young offenders, and that 
the records of these young offenders will be retained by police 
authorities for a period of ten years in the case of serious crimes 
and three years for other offences.
<P>
	In 1984, the Juvenile Delinquents Act was replaced by the 
Young Offenders Act, which then applied exclusively to young 
people aged 12 to 17.
<P>
	Its purpose was to make young offenders accountable for their 
criminal behaviour, even though their degree of responsibility 
may differ largely from that of adults. A responsibility was also 
put on society in the sense that, while the population has the 
right to be protected from acts which threaten its safety, crime 
prevention does remain an important social responsibility.
<P>
	As a result, young offenders had the right to equitable 
treatment, since their youth and degree of maturity required 
particular assistance of a sort not available from the justice 
system for adults.
<P>
	In this spirit, the 1984 act prohibited the media from 
divulging the identity of an accused young person or that of 
witnesses called to appear. The ban did not last long. In 1986 the 
act was amended to allow the disclosure of the identity of a 
young person sought in connection with, charged with or found 
guilty of an offence and considered to be a threat to public 
security.
<P>
	In 1992 the Conservative government again amended the 
Young Offenders Act, increasing the sentence for murder from 3 
to 5 years. Also introduced at this time was the principle that a 
young offender could be tried before an adult court if measures 
to ensure public safety were inadequate.
<P>
	There is no doubt that this bill will mean harsher sentences for 
young persons and an important shift in the act's declaration of 
principle.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	In actual fact, the harshness of sentences for serious crimes or 
offences will be reflected in an increase in the number of years 
of detention. Thus, in the case of first degree murder, the 
sentence will be increased from 5 to 10 years, and in the case of 
second degree murder, it will be increased from 5 to 7 years, 
during which time these young persons will not be eligible for 
parole.
<P>
	A number of specialists and other parties interested in the 
field of juvenile delinquency have observed that the severity of 
sentences for serious crimes plays a very small role in deterring 
young offenders.
<P>
	A number of studies, need I remind you, have shown clearly 
that individuals who commit serious crime are unable to 
contemplate the consequences of what they have done or of what 
they are about to do. Generally speaking, there are three 
categories of young delinquents involved in serious crime. The 
first category comprises those whose psychological state or 
mental health is fragile. With the help of appropriate 
rehabilitation programs, the young people in this category have 
every chance of recovering and finding their place in society.
<P>
	The second category comprises young delinquents who 
commit misdemeanours, and, under unforseen circumstances, 
do the irreparable and commit murder or some other serious 
crime.
<P>
	Finally, the third category comprises 16 and 17 year olds 
guilty of serious crime, because their delinquent past has led 
them to where they are. This is juvenile delinquency at its most 
serious. These young people are referred to adult court, because 
prevention and rehabilitation have failed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10021"> 10021 </A></B>
<P>
	It must be said that the majority of young offenders are in 
the first two categories.
<P>
	A number of studies would tend to indicate that the rate of 
homicide among young people has hardly increased in recent 
years. A document published by the Department of Justice in 
May 1994 reveals that, in recent years, the number of people 
under the age of 18 suspected of homicide has been considerably 
lower than in the 1970s. Between 1974 and 1979, police had an 
average of 60 homicide suspects under 18 years of age annually, 
whereas, between 1986 and 1992, the average was only 46.
<P>
	The public appears more sensitive to violence among young 
people, however. It really seems that people overestimate the 
incidence of acts of serious violence. Consider for example a 
survey carried out in 1992 indicating that ``Canadians believed 
that violent crimes accounted for 30 per cent of all crimes 
committed''.
<P>
	In reality, only 10 per cent of crimes are violent. Reality is 
often distorted by the media which for obvious reasons often 
stress sensational crimes, thus leading the public to believe that 
the rate of violent crime has risen sharply.
<P>
	In the opinion of the official opposition, the repressive 
measures contained in the present bill are far from being 
justifiable in all cases of juvenile delinquency. All the more so 
since the present legislation already includes measures to 
punish offenders guilty of serious offfences.
<P>
	The statement of principle proposed by the justice minister in 
Bill C-37 leaves the door wide open for repressing crime rather 
than preventing it. How else does one explain that this bill does 
not contain a single new provision in respect of prevention, 
rehabilitation or reintegration.
<P>
	In Quebec and certain provinces in Canada, such as Ontario, 
the approach to young offenders focuses on prevention, 
rehabilitation and reintegration. Several studies including the 
Boscoville study have demonstrated the advantages of this 
approach.
<P>
	It is true that several provinces in Canada do not have 
sufficient structures and resources at their disposal to proceed 
this way. So one might think that repression is the easiest option 
to choose.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Over the last few months, everyone in the judicial sector has 
criticized this bill because it ignores the issue of rehabilitation 
and reintegration. Juvenile delinquency cannot be looked at in 
isolation from a strictly judicial point of view; other much 
deeper factors that cause delinquent behaviour in young people 
must be taken into consideration.
<P>
	Juvenile delinquency as we now see it is like a mirror held up 
to society. Without facing this reality, we cannot stem 
delinquency at its root.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask you the following question: 
Does Canadian society have the right to choose the simplistic 
solution of punishment, and to pass this off as the fulfilment of 
its responsibilities in this matter?
<P>
	The official opposition thinks not, and I am certain that this is 
not what Canada wants.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on this bill. I have had a lot 
of feedback from my riding that people are very dissatisfied 
with the way the Young Offenders Act works at present. I know 
from the feedback I am getting that they are also dissatisfied that 
the provisions of the bill do not go nearly far enough.
<P>
	I conducted an electronic referendum on the Young Offenders 
Act, the first of its type, certainly in North America, during last 
year. I would like to cover a few of its results which fortify the 
belief that this bill does not go far enough.
<P>
	I would like to cover a bit of the background on the Young 
Offenders Act so we know what we are talking about. The Young 
Offenders Act, Bill C-61 at the time, was passed in 1984, 
replacing the 76-year old Juvenile Deliquents Act of 1908. It 
had been around for a long time and it was generally recognized 
to be out of date and overly rigid.
<P>
	Shortly after its passage the Young Offenders Act was also 
found to be somewhat rigid in certain aspects. Therefore, in 
1986 Bill C-106 was passed, making changes to the sections of 
the Young Offenders Act dealing with the short term 
incarceration of juveniles awaiting preliminary hearings, the 
compilation and disclosure of criminal records of young 
offenders, and some other aspects of the law. Sentencing rules 
for first and second degree murder were toughened in 1992 by 
Bill C-12.
<P>
	The government of the day carried out a poll in 1991 when it 
had made some changes to the Young Offenders Act in early 
1990. The poll question asked: ``The federal government has 
recently introduced legislation which would increase the 
sentences received by young offenders, 18 years or younger who 
commit crimes like murder. Do you approve or disagree with 
this legislation?'' The results were remarkable. Eighty-eight to 
90 per cent of the people polled felt that the sentences were not 
nearly tough enough.
<P>
	I still see the same sort of result coming today from the 
referendum that I held in my riding. In answer to the question of 
whether there should be automatic transfer to adult court for 
serious crimes such as murder, over 95 per cent of the 5,500 
people who responded said yes. To the question of whether there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10022"> 10022 </A></B>
<P>
should be a special category in the Young Offenders Act for 
repeat and  dangerous offenders, 97 per cent answered yes. 
There is a sense in the community that people are not safe under 
the present Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	My office is in a building that has a McDonald's on the bottom 
floor, and often a crowd of young people gather there on the 
weekends. Sometimes graffiti, urine and other things appear 
over the weekend. I have spoken to the RCMP about it, as have 
many people who live in the area. The police seem to be very 
limited in their ability to deal with the situation.
<P>
	The residents who live in the area are very upset that nothing 
gets done. They see the police arrive to try to break up minor 
fights and so on and they hear these young offenders telling the 
police to f-off and get out of there. It has reached the stage that if 
the average person on the street witnesses a youth crime and 
tries to do something about it by calling the police, the whole 
exercise will turn out to be totally unsatisfactory for everyone 
involved; for the person who reported it, for the police, and for 
the people who had the damage done to their property. The only 
person who seems to get off scot free is this young offender who 
gets released right away and does not seem to have to pay any 
penalty for what he or she did.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	In a semi-famous case that was printed in our local 
newspaper, I recently had the mother of a young offender come 
to my office. Shortly after arriving she burst into tears. She 
could hardly tell me the story. She had a son who was a young 
offender. He was a repeat offender. She had pleaded with judges. 
She had pleaded with people to get tough on this young guy and 
give him a sentence.
<P>
	Unfortunately it seemed this kid was constantly given another 
chance. His crimes progressively got worse. Finally he was 
picked up on a series of break and enter charges and minor 
assault. The mother decided this time she would not bail him 
out; she would not do anything to get him out. She begged that 
he be put in jail. Of course a lawyer was engaged to defend the 
young man when he appeared in the courts. He was let out right 
away.
<P>
	The first thing he did was to set fire to his family home. That 
same evening he burned down the family home because his 
mother had stood up and said something has to be done about 
this young man. The next day he was back in our local area 
serving pizzas as usual.
<P>
	It is a pretty bad situation to have that going on in our society. 
The people in my riding certainly feel this bill is not going to 
address those sorts of problems.
<P>
	I go back to the referendum that was held in my riding. It was 
one of the biggest samples ever taken on this issue. Over 7,000 
votes were cast. We provided a very comprehensive 
householder. I know I cannot use props in the House so I cannot 
hold it up for everyone to see.
<P>
	We set out the background of the Young Offenders Act in the 
householder and gave both sides of the argument. We quoted 
from a speech that the Minister of Justice made in a debate on 
March 17, 1994:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the act substantially has been a success and that in principle it is the right 
approach. I am certain improvements are needed but I am equally certain this 
process will result in a confirmation of the enlightened approach which the 
Young Offenders Act contemplates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is not what the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police 
think. In its 1994 response to the Department of Justice report 
``Toward Safer Communities'' we get the quote: ``It is our view 
that the Young Offenders Act requires amendment in many areas 
and a piecemeal approach will prove ineffective. A 
comprehensive approach, which includes not only legislative 
change but also functional changes, is fundamental to 
addressing the problems of troubled youth''.
<P>
	I have a quotation from the working paper on the victims of 
violence with respect to the Young Offenders Act. It was also 
included in my householder: ``Instead of becoming more 
responsible for their behaviour, young offenders are hiding 
behind the act. Society's right to protection from illegal 
behaviour has been eroded to the point that nothing short of a 
major shake-up of the Young Offenders Act will regain its 
confidence''. That is absolutely true.
<P>
	I have mentioned before in the House that I have gone into the 
schools in my area and we have discussed the Young Offenders 
Act. I have asked the young people there what they think of the 
Young Offenders Act. They think it is a sham. Many of the 
young people in the schools are afraid of it because it does not 
protect them from the gang violence that occurs in society.
<P>
	I said to one young class: ``Are you sure you are not just 
making this judgment that the Young Offenders Act is not 
working based on the hysteria in the community, that really you 
do not know what is in it and you are just making an emotional 
judgment?'' Those hands went up again. About 35 out of 37 
students in the class said: ``No, it is not an emotional decision. 
We know what happens with the Young Offenders Act. We know 
how these gang members get off. We want something done about 
it''.
<P>
	Within the referendum that was held in my riding we had a 
separate electronic referendum for students. They too confirmed 
by over 95 per cent that they wanted the Young Offenders Act 
dramatically revised.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not think there is any question that the rate of youths 
charged with violent crimes per 100,000 population has 
increased dramatically since 1986. The rate of youths charged 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10023"> 10023 </A></B>
<P>
with violent crimes has increased by an average of 14 per cent 
annually.
<P>
	During this time the rate of adults charged with violent crimes 
increased only an average of 7 per cent. Therefore youth crime 
of a violent nature has really accelerated away from those that 
are happening at the adult level. This has to be because there is 
no deterrent in the present Young Offenders Act. Young people 
can do practically anything they want.
<P>
	I am extremely disappointed that this bill does not give us 
what we really need to make a difference. I hope that eventually 
the minister will see the light, change his mind and bring in 
some tough provisions.
<P>
	Besides all that, the Deputy Prime Minister promised to 
resign if the GST was not gone in one year and she still has not 
done it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently I received a letter from one of my constituents, 
Mr. Brian Gregory of Enderby, B.C. Although I have never met 
Mr. Gregory, I would like to quote from his letter. He says in 
part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As time passes, it appears that more and more people are developing a lack of 
respect for the law and even outright indignation- If laws are unfair or unjust, 
then it is up to you, the lawmakers, to change the laws. This brings me to the main 
purpose of my letter: the criminal justice system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The terrible tragedies recently involving Rodney Bell, Mindy Tran, and now, 
Melanie Carpenter, have exposed a weak, tattered criminal justice system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night, my wife and I sat down and brainstormed a list of changes that we 
think would improve our criminal justice system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Here is our list of changes which we'd like you to consider bringing to the 
attention of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The law-abiding citizens must be protected at all costs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. An environment must be created where people regain respect and trust for 
the law. Justice must prevail.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms should not apply to any criminal 
(including white collar) who is incarcerated. A separate set of minimum rights 
for criminals should be legislated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. Young offenders should attend adult court and their identities must not be 
hidden. Teenagers who are old enough to perform criminal acts are old enough 
to attend adult court and do ``adult time''. I do believe, however, they should be 
segregated from adults in separate prisons. These kids are old enough to know 
right from wrong.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Mr. Gregory went on to write that these are the views of an

convinced that most Canadians share similar viewpoints:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Please do not be influenced by a few elite academics who say that the crime rate 
is decreasing. One preventable murder is one too many. Let us bring common 
sense and justice back to our justice system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My staff phoned Mr. Gregory at 7 a.m. B.C. time this morning 
to ask if I could quote his letter today. His wife said that she was 
sure he would be tickled to have me do that. I was tickled to get 
such down to earth letter on the complex subject of the reforms 
that ordinary Canadians want to see enacted by Parliament so 
that law-abiding citizens will once again feel safe in their 
homes and in their communities.
<P>
	By contrast, the puny little baby steps that are proposed by 
Bill C-37 do not begin to answer the need people have to see our 
young people regain respect for the law.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act today does just the opposite. It 
makes young people look at the law as if it were a joke.
<P>
	In November many of us attended the justice for Joshua rally. 
We met here on November 3, which would have been Joshua's 
fifth birthday except that he died September 15 from head 
injuries received when a 16-year old in a stolen car fled police at 
high speed and rammed a van driven by Joshua's grandmother. 
The young offender was sentenced to one year in closed custody 
for criminal negligence causing death, one year in open custody, 
served at the same time, one year of probation and a five year 
driving prohibition.
<P>
	In Ottawa-Hull some 10,000 motor vehicles per year are 
stolen, mostly by young offenders. Many of them will try to get 
away from police, thereby threatening public safety. Even in my 
own relatively law-abiding riding of Okanagan-Shuswap last 
year nearly 200 motor vehicles were stolen in the Vernon area, 
and more than 50 motor vehicles were stolen in Salmon Arm.
<P>
	At the justice for Joshua rally Ottawa talk show host Steve 
Madely claimed that 20 per cent of young offenders have 
reoffended five times or more. For young victims like Joshua, 
there is no second chance.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	Canadians are fed up with going easy on young offenders and 
especially violent offenders. Repeatedly they have called on us 
as law makers to put the justice back into our criminal justice 
system. Instead, Bill C-37 will not permit 10 and 11 year old 
offenders to be charged at an age when there is still hope of 
setting them straight.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should initiate an 
amendment to section 7 of the Constitution Act, 1982, to recognize the right of 
the individual to enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof 
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to 
rise in the Chamber to move that in the opinion of this House the 
government should initiate an amendment to section 7 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982, to recognize the right of the individual 
to enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof 
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. 
Nothing is more important to a system of government than this.
<P>
	In rising in this Chamber today I am following many people of 
greater stature and ability than myself who have fought for this 
most fundamental right. I follow, however unworthily, in the 
footsteps of those who have made the glorious revolution. I 
follow in the footsteps of those who confronted King John and 
compelled him to sign the Magna Carta. I follow in the footsteps 
of those who for 1,000 years or more have worked and when 
necessary have fought and died to ensure that governments serve 
the rights of their citizens rather than oppress them.
<P>
	I intend to continue the fight for property rights, the core of 
our ancient liberties. Since this is not how most people 
understand the concept of property rights, I have three primary 
purposes in my remarks today. First, I would like to begin by 
explaining what property rights really are. Second, I would like 
to outline why they are central to the problem of good 
government. Then I would like to explain how my motion would 
address that problem.
<P>
	Property rights begin with the concept of self-ownership. It is 
vital to stress this point because when people hear the term 
property they generally think of real property: houses, boats, 
mansions and yachts. They generally think not just of real 
property, but of real property of a luxurious nature. They think 
of property  rights as protecting the rich, or as protecting the 
existing order of things. This is fundamentally and entirely 
wrong.
<P>
	The essence of property rights is the concept of 
self-ownership, of the individual's conscience and the 
individual's judgment as inviolable, even sacred. People have 
the right to make their own decisions. That is my most 
fundamental belief.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	Our property is ourselves, our labour, our imagination and our 
courage. The right to control one's own actions is what property 
rights is all about. Only by extension is property material.
<P>
	In a universe of material things and in a universe in which 
time passes, a respect for self-ownership of others must mean a 
respect for the things they make or modify. Property does mean 
things too, but fundamentally, the right to own property is a right 
to own oneself, to make one's own decisions, to trade 
voluntarily with others, to labour freely and for oneself and not 
for others as a slave.
<P>
	It is therefore profoundly mistaken to believe that property 
rights favour the rich. Take half of a rich man's things and he 
will still be well off, but take half of a poor man's or a middle 
class man's things away and what hope do they have of one day 
being comfortable?
<P>
	It is also unsound to say that one can be free without 
ownership of the things one makes with one's labour. It is 
unsound to contrast mere material things with higher matters 
such as love. However bright the eye of a beloved child, food, 
clothing and shelter are essential to that child, but they are not 
the end of that child's material needs. It is not a case of 
satisfying material needs and then moving to a higher plateau. 
Toys, games, books and the very arms with which a parent hugs a 
child are all material. No parent who cannot make a thing and 
keep it or trade it for another, whether simple food or a book of 
poetry can express their love effectively and freely.
<P>
	The right of self-ownership is fundamental. It must imply the 
right to control the material things that one owns, makes or 
alters. However, its origin is in self-ownership: the ownership 
of ourselves, our labour and our imagination.
<P>
	Those who deny the right to own property, deny not the right 
of the exploiter to hoard, but the right of the ordinary citizen to 
live according to his or her own lights. That right is fundamental 
to human dignity.
<P>
	That brings me to my second point, the problem of good 
government. However sound the right of self-ownership may be 
in abstract theory, it is threatened in practice from two 
directions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10025"> 10025 </A></B>
<P>
	People may be subject to force and fraud from within their 
own community. Their rights may be insecure either in theory 
or in practice, if theft is legal or if it is unpunished. If that is 
the case, nothing we may do to make the world a better place 
as we understand it can persist. Whatever is achieved is 
snatched away. Then whatever a person may dream will be only 
a dream. It will never be realized.
<P>
	People may be subjected to force and fraud from outside. 
Whatever system of rights they possess, an attack from outside 
may overwhelm that system and leave them raped and murdered 
in their burning houses. Whatever they have achieved may be 
taken away this way also.
<P>
	Therefore people combine into societies and create 
governments. Through them they seek to define a system of 
rights and enforce it internally and also protect the system as a 
whole from attack from the outside. Sometimes they fail and if 
they do the results are clearly catastrophic. A government too 
weak to protect the lives, liberty and property of its citizens is 
unbearable, but the usual problem is quite the reverse.
<P>
	Through most of human history the problem has been that 
governments wield too much power. The usual result of having a 
government too weak to protect people's rights is to have it 
displaced by one strong enough to do it, but unwilling to.
<P>
	The historical problem is that governments have had the 
ability to protect citizens but not the will. Instead, they 
themselves have taken these rights away. What they have done is 
to treat citizens as means and not ends. They declare some 
higher purpose and then force citizens to seek to fulfil it, 
whatever it may be.
<P>
	In most parts of the world the problem of government quite 
simply has never been solved. The Romans considered it. ``Quis 
custodiet custodientes?'' they asked. Who shall guard the 
guardians? But they did not solve it.
<P>
	In the Anglo-American tradition it was solved, if imperfectly. 
The solution was partly theoretical and partly practical, but the 
larger and more impersonal societies and governments became 
the more important, the theory was. In Britain the Anglo-Saxon 
councils seemed somehow to have solved the problem of 
government, to give chiefs and leaders some power but not too 
much. They could defend rights but not take them away.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	After the Norman conquest it seemed that government had 
triumphed over society, but it had not. At swordpoint at 
Runnymede, civil society told King John he would sign the 
Magna Carta or he would die and it told him he would abide by it 
or he would die.
<P>
	When the Stuarts sought to shake free of it the people 
revolted. Charles I lost his head over it, literally. When Oliver 
Cromwell sought to use power to engage in social engineering, 
the people withdrew their consent to be governed. Shortly after 
his death the Commonwealth was abolished.
<P>
	The monarchy was brought back under strictly limited terms 
after James II showed he would not keep the bargain. The 
glorious revolution brought William and Mary to the throne but 
also the 1689 Bill of Rights. Again the right of the citizen to be 
free from his or her own government triumphed.
<P>
	Governments, however, have a real tendency to encroach. The 
guardians must be guarded. It was that which led to the revolt in 
the 13 colonies in the 1770s. It was the danger of another revolt 
that led to the Durham report urging self-government in this 
country. For most of our history the common law and its 
protection of the right to own property withstood any attempt to 
undermine it.
<P>
	Unfortunately what wise men create clever men can undo. 
And so it was here. The Right Hon. Pierre Elliot Trudeau neither 
fully understood nor cared much about the notion of citizens as 
ends rather than means, nor did he understand or sympathize 
with the British parliamentary tradition and the supremacy of 
common law.
<P>
	In 1982, quite casually, he traded away our most fundamental 
right in a slick and clever political calculation, but he should not 
have done it. Since 1982 things have gone downhill very fast in 
this country. Since 1982 we have somehow had the idea that 
government is the master and the citizen is the servant.
<P>
	Mr. Trudeau felt very clever because he had reached 
agreement with the premiers to have the Constitution 
repatriated. However, when one level of government agrees with 
another to abolish citizens' protection against government, a 
protection 1,000 years old or more, it is not good and it is not 
wise. Therefore, I want this House to take steps to restore it to 
the Constitution.
<P>
	The Canadian people were denied a chance to vote on property 
rights in 1982 when the Constitution was repatriated. Nobody 
asked them. They were denied it again in 1992 when the right to 
own property was deliberately omitted from the Charlottetown 
accord, against the wishes of the Canadian people I might add. 
They have been denied it here because hon. members opposite 
have denied the House a chance to vote on this motion, to stand 
up and be counted with the Commons or with bad King John. 
However, it is time we restored it.
<P>
	What I am proposing is very precise, that the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms should be amended to include the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10026"> 10026 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government shall take no property from any citizen, in whole or in 
part, through eminent domain, regulation, or any other way, except for public use, 
through due process and with just and timely compensation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This does not encroach on provincial jurisdiction. It only 
binds the federal government. It does not paralyse public policy. 
It only holds it to a reasonable standard of serving the public and 
not abusing it. It does not forbid takings. It only insists that they 
must be done in a legitimate way and for a legitimate purpose.
<P>
	What it does do is admit the existence of the paradox of 
government and to seek to apply the solution of wise men to the 
problems created by those who were merely clever. It seeks to 
restore government to its proper function: protecting the rights 
of citizens, not usurping them, not taking them away.
<P>
	The most important of these rights is the right to own 
property. That right is the right to own oneself, to be a free 
person and not a slave. I therefore urge this House to express 
itself in favour of the entrenchment of the right to own private 
property in the Constitution.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues will have an opportunity to speak to 
this motion today but many others will not. It is an additional 
unfortunate consequence of being denied votable status that the 
time for debate is drastically restricted.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Those of my colleagues who would like to speak but cannot 
have therefore asked me to read into the record a statement of 
their support. On behalf of the members for Calgary Northeast, 
Lethbridge, Mission-Coquitlam, Prince George-Peace River, 
Port Moody-Coquitlam, Prince George-Bulkley Valley, 
Vegreville and Wetaskiwin, I would like to conclude with this 
statement:
<P>
	``Mr. Speaker, hon. colleagues and fellow Canadians, we 
believe the right to own property and not to be deprived thereof, 
except for public use, through due process and with just 
compensation is at the core of Canadians' ancient liberties as 
free people. Each of us would like to be able to rise in the 
Chamber today to voice our support for the entrenchment of that 
right in the Constitution. In case we do not have that opportunity 
today, we have asked our colleague, the member for Skeena, to 
place this statement of our support for this measure into the 
record''.
<P>
	I hope that all members of whatever party in this House will 
share and endorse that sentiment. This is most emphatically not 
a partisan issue but a matter of fundamental justice and human 
rights.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this motion. I 
want to thank the hon. member opposite for bringing this issue 
to the fore.
<P>
	He seeks to initiate an amendment to section 7 of the great 
Canadian Charter of Rights to recognize the right of the 
individual to the enjoyment of property and the right not to be 
deprived thereof, except in accordance with the principles of 
fundamental justice, a right which exists.
<P>
	I caution the member to recall-he seems to be quite the 
student of history-that there was another great revolution 
against the crown of Britain, the American revolution. As a 
result of that, it also has a constitution. It is a constitution that 
has created a tremendous problem in its courts with the issue of 
the entrenchment of property rights.
<P>
	We have had a pleasant visit this week from the President of 
the United States. Perhaps it is timely to raise this issue today, 
even as he departs from our country.
<P>
	It is probably a good idea to look at what happened down 
south when we look at the question of the entrenchment of 
property rights. As I understand it, the courts in the United 
States have extended property rights beyond traditional forms of 
property such as land or housing to include such things as social 
security benefits, drivers' licences and employment with the 
government; entitlements, I think they are called. These are 
considered to be forms of property in the United States to which 
constitutional property rights protections apply.
<P>
	This is an interesting notion, particularly when one contrasts 
this with what I think is the traditional view of the Reform Party. 
If the reform Party in its infancy can have any tradition, surely it 
is its opposition to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and its 
opposition to what it thinks is government involvement in the 
activities of ordinary citizens.
<P>
	I would suggest that an amendment to section 7 conflicts with 
those fundamental beliefs it purports to have. Certainly the 
American experience raises questions about how Canadian 
courts would interpret a property rights amendment if such 
rights were added to the charter.
<P>
	One wonders what the impact would be. The impact would be 
an unwarranted interference in the property rights of Canadians. 
Our American neighbours also had some unfortunate experience 
with constitutional property rights during the first half of this 
century. This was under what became known as the doctrine of 
substantive due process. Under this doctrine the American 
courts, the United States Supreme Court included, struck down 
some important social legislation such as laws regulating the 
maximum hours of work, laws regulating minimum wage and 
child labour laws.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10027"> 10027 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Child labour laws were struck down because they were seen to 
be violations of the employer's property rights, or should I say 
the slave owner's property rights.
<P>
	The United States Supreme Court ultimately repudiated this 
approach in the 1930s. Nevertheless the American courts have 
continued to apply American constitutional protections in a 
variety of areas.
<P>
	Canadian courts would be free to follow their own approach to 
constitutional rights issues and have done so even where 
provisions in our Constitution and our charter are similar to 
American constitutional provisions.
<P>
	Given that we share so much in common with the United 
States in terms of our legal foundations, I would suggest to the 
members opposite that it would be well worth studying the 
American experience.
<P>
	Undoubtedly this effort would be repaid in the greater 
understanding that we would develop about the meaning of 
property rights and their potential impact on our system.
<P>
	The more one delves into this matter, the more one realizes 
that it is not easy and it is not clear. Nevertheless, the Reform 
Party typically puts forward the quick fix, the simple solution to 
a problem that exists primarily in its mind.
<P>
	We should start with the simple and basic idea of the right to 
own and enjoy property. Your home, your property should not 
arbitrarily be interfered with. How could anyone dispute that?
<P>
	When we start to examine the concept of property and when 
we start to see its actual and possible scope, when we begin to 
understand the range and the extent of laws that regulate or 
affect property, when we begin to understand all of these 
concepts, we need to take a step back and look at this in a 
concerted fashion.
<P>
	It is one thing to talk about this in general and abstract terms 
but it is quite another thing when we consider the entrenchment 
of these kinds of rights in our constitution, an action that would 
result in power to the courts to review a whole range of laws 
which in some way may affect ownership or use of property.
<P>
	Entrenching property rights in the Constitution would require 
the approval of the majority of the provinces. Given that the 
Constitution already gives the provinces jurisdiction over 
property and civil rights within their boundaries, I would 
assume they would have a rather prominent interest in this and 
certainly a real and valid one. Given that their agreement would 
be required for any change to the Constitution, I would argue 
that this is not the sort of step that could or should be 
accomplished through unilateral measures.
<P>
	Students of the Constitution will tell members that this may 
be the kind of measure that a province could opt out of under the 
amending formulas set out in section 38 of the Constitution Act 
of 1982.
<P>
	The parliamentary record from the debates leading up to the 
patriation of the Constitution and since that time indicates that 
some provinces have had concerns about constitutional changes 
that would constrain their ability to regulate property.
<P>
	I do not know where the provinces stand on this issue at the 
present time but I am fairly certain that it is not a priority for 
them. The party opposite should know very well that reopening 
the Constitution is not a priority for the vast majority of 
Canadians at this time.
<P>
	We have evolved elaborate laws regulating and protecting the 
ownership and enjoyment of property. Real and personal 
property laws regulate acquisition and disposition of all kinds of 
property and they regulate in some cases how property is 
managed or the use to which it is put.
<P>
	The point of these laws is not, as the member opposite 
suggests, to burden individuals, but rather to ensure that these 
transactions occur in an orderly and fair fashion and to guard 
against mistakes or fraud in the purchase, sale and management 
of property.
<P>
	In Quebec the civil code provides for the disposition of real 
and personal property and in other provinces statutes and 
common law deal with the same issues.
<P>
	These common law rules can be traced back hundreds of years 
in English law. While we are on that, they can be traced back 
farther than the Magna Carta.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	I cannot stand on this side of the House and not comment on 
my friend's argument concerning the glorious revolution. I 
would suggest that the glorious revolution and the Reform Party 
cannot be seen to be synonymous. The Magna Carta, which 
really is a predecessor and a direct line to our own charter, 
provided basic fundamental rights.
<P>
	The Reform Party today stands in the House and seeks by this 
amendment to narrow those rights. The present charter for 
Canada was a part of and proof of the glorious revolution; the 
glorious revolution in Canada being the revolution that 
entrenched for us forever basic human rights and other basic 
civil liberties, my friend says the most important of which is the 
right to own property.
<P>
	There are other views on which of these rights is more 
important. One of those rights is clearly the right of the citizen 
to live freely in this country.
<P>
	The glorious revolution, an amendment to entrench property 
rights in the Constitution. I say that is an attempt by those who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10028"> 10028 </A></B>
<P>
support it to limit the rights of Canadians and to prevent 
Canadians through their government from protecting 
themselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
amending the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms so as to 
include the right to enjoyment of property is not a new idea. The 
entrenchment of a property right was an objective of the former 
Liberal government of 1968. Indeed, the Prime Minister of the 
time, Mr. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who had also been a Minister of 
Justice, proposed the adoption of a charter designed to ensure 
the constitutional protection of certain rights including, of 
course, the right to enjoyment of property.
<P>
	As you know, that motion was rejected. In 1978, some 
provinces squarely opposed the idea, which was included in a 
bill on constitutional reform, Bill C-60. As I recall, those 
provinces included Manitoba and Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	In 1980, the federal government proposed a new measure to 
guarantee the right to enjoyment of property. Again, the 
provinces strongly opposed the idea. Consequently, I have to tell 
the hon. member that, if he hopes to see section 7 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982, amended so as to include such a right, he 
has a very difficult task ahead of him. To give you an idea of how 
difficult this would be, assuming it can be done, it is important 
to look at the technical aspects of the issue for a moment.
<P>
	First, since the charter is part of the Constitution, it can only 
be changed by way of an amendment to the Constitution itself. 
This first requires resolutions from the Senate and the House of 
Commons, something which is not easily obtained, and, second, 
resolutions from the legislative assemblies of at least two thirds 
of the provinces, the latter representing at least 50 per cent of the 
Canadian population. That also is not going to be easy to get.
<P>
	This latter condition implies that Ontario or Quebec will have 
to be one of the provinces that support a draft amendment, since 
together, they represent more than 50 per cent of the population. 
Furthermore, the Constitution Act, 1982 provides under section 
38(2), I believe, that the resolution must be adopted by a 
majority of the members of a legislative assembly, as opposed to 
a majority of the members present at the time of voting, if the 
proposed amendment derogates from the legislative powers, the 
proprietary rights or any other rights or privileges of the 
legislature or government of a province. That would be the case 
here if the Charter were amended to include property rights. As 
the hon. member can see, his motion is practically dead in the 
water.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	So far, judgments up to the Supreme Court, have failed to 
establish that property rights should be protected under the 1982 
Charter. This was even ruled out in the Irwin Toys Ltd. 
judgment, an important decision supported by a majority on the 
Supreme Court, which stated that the intentional exclusion of 
property  rights from section 7 and its replacement by the 
``security of the person'' had a twofold effect. First, one can 
conclude that on the whole, economic rights, generally 
designated by the term ``property rights'', are not covered by 
section 7. However, that does not mean that no rights with 
economic overtones could not be covered by the term ``security 
of the person''.
<P>
	In other words, there are some serious reservations because of 
the potential negative impact. Many groups have expressed their 
concerns about the possible entrenchment of property rights in 
the Constitution. I will mention some of their concerns as well 
as some of their priorities.
<P>
	Aboriginal people are, for instance, apprehensive about the 
potential impact on their land claims and property rights. 
Nowadays this is a sensitive issue, and land claims are 
sacro-sanct. The unions are worried about a conflict between 
the rights of workers and the rights of those who own the 
resources. Environmental groups wonder about the legislative 
impact if property rights were entrenched in the Constitution, 
rights that are entirely legitimate.
<P>
	The provinces should be concerned that entrenchment of 
property rights would allow the courts to obstruct the 
application of laws that protect important community interests, 
including legislation on planning and land use, ownership of 
moveable goods and real estate, and even legislation on health 
and safety.
<P>
	Entrenchment would have clearly unpredictable and even 
absurd consequences for municipal by-laws on zoning, 
environmental regulations and spousal property rights in the 
case of marriage breakdown.
<P>
	Take, for example, the case of a man and a woman who 
separate, who get a divorce. The family patrimony act, a 
provincial statute, provides that in case of marriage dissolution, 
the house shall be sold and the proceeds of sale divided between 
the ex-spouses. In the event that the Constitution is amended to 
include the right to property, as is being proposed by my Reform 
colleague, that would mean that the ex-spouse who bought the 
house could contest the provincial legislation under the 
Canadian Charter simply by saying that his or her right to 
enjoyment of property is being interfered with. The other spouse 
would thus be completely deprived of his rights under the 
provincial legislation. There would be no solution to the 
dispute. The lack of sense of such an amendment is therefore 
readily apparent.
<P>
	The entrenchment of the right to property in the Canadian 
Charter is also dangerous and represents an intrusion of the 
federal government into an area of jurisdiction reserved 
exclusively for the provinces under section 92(13) of the 
Constitution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10029"> 10029 </A></B>
<P>
Act, 1867, which states that only the provinces may make laws 
regarding property and civil rights in each province.
<P>
	Furthermore, how will the courts interpret the right to 
property, since in Quebec, the civil law governs this right and 
the courts interpret it from a civil law point of view, while in the 
other provinces a common law interpretation is used?
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to point out that no one can say that 
this right is less respected in Canada than elsewhere in the 
world. It is clear that, for the official opposition, the real interest 
in such an amendment probably stems from considerations of a 
completely different sort. It is clear that the addition of such a 
right to legislation transcending the powers of the federal and 
provincial governments, such as the Charter of Rights, and 
entrenching enduring values for regulating the life of society 
constitutes, for the federal government, a powerful means of 
once again interfering in an exclusively provincial area of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bellemare):</B> As no government 
member wishes to speak, I now go to the Reform Party.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party have asked me if there is 
consent to split the ten minute period between the member for 
Yorkton-Melville and the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, 
allowing each five minutes.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is unusual to find champions of property rights who 
are active in politics.
<P>
	A lot of people reacted to the Reform Party with surprise and 
with a sense that we did not belong in federal politics. There is a 
real sense in which they were right, though not for the reason 
that they believed. We are not typical politicians. It is that we 
really do not like big government. That is why we are here. We 
think we have to be here. It is not just because we want to be.
<P>
	I have been trying to understand why Canadians are in such a 
bad mood these days and why government seems to be at the 
centre of all their complaints. I believe it is because of the issue 
before us today.
<P>
	The right to own property means the right to live unmolested 
by government. I listened very carefully to the arguments of the 
member from Windsor, but the objections are those that are 
typical of the Liberal Party that believes in more big 
government. I listened carefully to the argument the Bloc 
presented, that this was a provincial matter.
<P>
	Who will protect the people of Canada from more big federal 
government? Will it be the provinces? I think there is a real 
contradiction in what Bloc members are saying about their own 
policies and their own beliefs. In a democracy government is not 
them; it is us. It is not the government molesting us. It is one 
another through government.
<P>
	We have decided we can vote ourselves free money and we 
can. The more we try to beat wealth out of one another and 
tolerance and all other virtues, the more angry we get not just 
with government but with one another. Democracy is the 
practice of voting for public authorities. That is a way of 
keeping government under control, not a way of legitimizing 
any action it may take.
<P>
	The right to own and use private property means the right to 
live unmolested by government. It really is not the government 
taking our hard earned tax dollars, our property; it is all of us 
molesting and taking property from each other through 
government.
<P>
	Government is not benevolent. Government is force. The 
more wealth we try to get from each other through government, 
the more angry we get not just with government but with each 
other. We have trouble seeing what the lack of property rights 
has caused us and society. Too many of us believe that 
democracy gives the government the ultimate authority to take 
away our fundamental rights and our property. However this is 
just using democracy as an excuse. What we have in Canada is 
not a true democracy. We vote every four or five years to elect 
another bunch of tax and spend specialists who disregard our 
fundamental right to own and use our own property.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	That is not what democracy is. Democracy is supposed to be a 
way of keeping government under control, not a way of 
legitimizing the confiscation of private property without due 
process of law and without fair and timely compensation. Voting 
should be a way of preventing government from taking our 
property. Instead we have become addicted to using it as a tool to 
take one another's wealth. That is socialism.
<P>
	This is what I think is wrong with Canada and no amount of 
voting can fix it. For example, if private property rights were in 
our Constitution, the justice minister could not implement his 
gun control laws and we would all be better off. Unless we hold a 
referendum to include the right of private property in the 
Constitution we have little hope of getting true democracy in 
Canada. We need true democracy in our country and we need it 
desperately.
<P>
	We in the House need to amend the Constitution or hold a 
referendum on the subject of putting the right to own property 
into the Constitution.
<P>
	The member for Skeena has asked me to read a statement into 
the record in support of the motion. The principle and policy is 
our blue book policy and that would therefore include all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10030"> 10030 </A></B>
<P>
Reform MPs. Hopefully the government will consider carefully 
what we have presented in our reasoned argument.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I like to think Canadians live in a democratic and just 
society. I like to believe Canada is a country which respects the 
rule of law.
<P>
	However when I look at our Constitution including the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms I become concerned. Property 
rights constitute the most fundamental of rights: the right to 
keep what we earn, to acquire what we need through fair 
exchange and to enjoy those freedoms while respecting the 
rights of others.
<P>
	Thomas Bethell wrote in <I>Property and Justice</I>: ``There is a 
close relationship between the operation of a private property 
system and the idea of justice itself''. As Canadians we believe 
we have an inherent right to justice. That means if a criminal 
steals something we expect to be compensated and we expect the 
criminal to be punished. If neither happens we are morally 
outraged.
<P>
	It is our fundamental belief in justice that has motivated many 
Canadians to demand stiffer penalties for criminals, to demand 
more accountability of government spending of their tax 
dollars, and to demand the retrenchment of their property rights.
<P>
	In a just society the weak do not have to fear the strong or the 
corrupt because they know their rights will be respected and the 
rule of law will protect them. In a just society the state will 
defend individual property rights from those who would take 
them. One reason for the state having a police force is to prevent 
criminals from violating the rights of other citizens.
<P>
	Likewise when the state arbitrarily confiscates private 
property without regard to the rule of law justice has failed. Our 
justice system is built on the concept of private ownership, on 
the premise that when someone takes something from another 
they have broken a fundamental law of our society. This is 
because or possessions are privately owned, not commonly 
owned. Property can generally be state owned, privately owned 
or commonly owned. In Canada we like to think we have private 
ownership, but how can we guarantee it without constitutional 
protection?
<P>
	A system of common ownership is by its very nature unjust. 
Anyone can take the fruits of our labours but it is not called 
stealing. It is called redistribution because everyone in the 
community owns whatever is produced. This ultimately leads to 
a society where justice means from each according to his ability 
and to each according to their need. Have we heard that one 
before? Inevitably under this system the needy are merely the 
greedy and the honest workers are the destitute.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	In a society where the state claims ownership or control over 
property and arbitrarily denies its citizens the right to use and 
enjoy their property then it has broken its covenant with the 
people.
<P>
	Individual liberty and freedom is lost and a state that does not 
respect the rule of law is a tyranny. Sometimes Canadians have a 
hard time defining what it is to be Canadian but I do not think 
communal or state ownership of property fits with that 
definition.
<P>
	There is something wrong when Canadians have a 
fundamental belief in property rights and yet nowhere is that 
right expressly protected. Why does the government not 
recognize this right?
<P>
	There is something wrong when a minister can arbitrarily 
impose his personal beliefs on society and enact legislation to 
deprive law-abiding citizens of their property because he does 
not like guns. This means that Canadians are being governed by 
people who do not believe in basic property rights. This is not 
comforting.
<P>
	In support of M-301 I would sleep better at night knowing 
that my property rights were protected. I therefore wholly 
support this motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We would normally pass to the other 
side of the floor but the member I see rising has already spoken 
and may not speak again. Accordingly, the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster will divide his time with unanimous 
consent among three members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like consent to divide my time with the 
member for Vancouver North and the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Do we have unanimous consent for the 
members to do that?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are three and a third minutes for 
the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will have your 
stop watch out.
<P>
	I am very pleased to express my support for property rights in 
Canada. The issue of property rights is an important one for all 
Canadians. It is not merely an issue for the wealthy or for those 
with business interests.
<P>
	It is not an issue that can be labelled left or right. It is about 
personal freedom which is fundamental to free societies. It is a 
tragedy that a mature democracy like Canada has excluded the 
right to own property from its constitutional and legal tradition. 
I will explain how the issue of property rights, or rather a lack of 
them, adversely affects prairie farmers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10031"> 10031 </A></B>
<P>
	The effect of inadequate property provisions in our legal 
system means that these farmers do not really own all the 
commodities they produce. To own something means that one 
can choose how one uses one's property so long as it does not 
harm others.
<P>
	Wheat is not a hazardous substance, therefore the farmer 
should be able to sell his grain to anyone he pleases by the 
marketing mechanisms he or she with colleagues choose at 
whatever price the buyer and seller mutually agree to.
<P>
	Moreover, the farmer would have the choice of the means of 
transportation and the route taken to ship the wheat. After all, it 
is his grain, is it not? In the prairies wheat does not belong to the 
farmer. It is not his because he cannot sell it freely. He is told 
who he will sell the grain to. He is told what the price will be and 
he is told how he must ship the grain. Because of the lack of 
property rights in Canada, farmers do not own the wheat they 
produce with their own labour. By implication, the farmer does 
not own his own labour and therefore he does not own himself.
<P>
	The farmer is reduced to being an agent of the state, paid for 
his efforts whatever the government decides to pay him for the 
produce. If property rights were honoured, all farmers would 
have the choice whether they wanted to market collectively. I 
am sure many farmers would make that choice. That is fine as 
long as it is the farmer's free choice and not one mandated by 
government.
<P>
	It is said all that a man owns is himself and his labour. 
Because of that he then owns the fruit of his labour. By 
introducing property rights into the Canadian legal tradition we 
would be freeing farmers to make their own choices about how 
to meet their own needs using their own resources and the fruits 
of their own labour. Property rights legislation would give each 
farmer the authority to make his or own decision as to how to 
meet those needs.
<P>
	I would urge all members of this House, particularly members 
from farm communities, to support the principle of property 
rights in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
members of this House will know that I often use New Zealand 
as an example in some of my speeches on economic affairs.
<P>
	I do so not because I believe that everything that New Zealand 
has done is right but because I believe that we have a lot to learn 
from looking at the experience of others who have also faced 
similar problems.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	There are lessons to be learned from history about property 
rights. We need to take a look at the experiences of others in 
assessing whether property rights should be in our charter.
<P>
	We have plenty of recorded history at our disposal. For 
example, we know the histories of ancient Rome, Greece, China, 
Egypt and Mesopotamia. We know what happened in classical 
times, medieval times, the industrial revolution and even 
modern times. Everything is documented. We know plenty 
about Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, the 
United States and Cambodia. By studying the historical records 
of these places and times we can quickly see which government 
did not respect property rights and which did. We can see that 
those that did not respect property rights ended up with their 
people living in misery and poverty.
<P>
	Perhaps it starts innocently enough. A government promises 
to regulate the economy for the common good, to redistribute 
the wealth more fairly, to make the rich pay their fair share and 
to close the loopholes. I have the feeling that I have heard these 
words before, a naive assumption that the government knows 
best and the average citizen needs to be protected from himself.
<P>
	History is full of examples. Whether headed by a madman like 
Stalin or Hitler or by well meaning dreamers like Nehru and 
Nyerere, they always fail. Along the way they produce conflicts 
instead of peace, famine instead of plenty, poverty instead of 
prosperity. Instead of more and better rights than those we hold 
in a line from the Magna Carta, they deliver fewer and worse 
rights. Instead of delivering the gilded cage they deliver only the 
cage.
<P>
	I challenge members to name one society that respected 
property rights where the people are not better off. I also 
challenge them to name one society where the government did 
not respect property rights where they are not worse off. The 
more protected the right to property, the better the living 
conditions and the better the societal order.
<P>
	History also teaches us that when property rights are 
protected so are personal rights. Along with the loss of property 
rights comes the loss of personal rights, loss of freedom of 
speech and loss of decency in society. Property rights are the 
foundation of a decent society. They are the most important 
human right.
<P>
	It amazes me that we have a Constitution and a Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms that guarantee the lengthy avoidance of 
deportation by known criminals who have come into Canada as 
bogus refugees but do not guarantee property rights to 
law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	It amazes me that we have a Constitution and a Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms that permit crimes to be committed under a 
defence of drunkenness but do not protect the property rights of 
law-abiding citizens. Canadians are supposed to feel good about 
their Constitution. No wonder they are disgusted with it.
<P>
	The motion put forward by the Reform Party member for 
Skeena is an excellent one which the government would do well 
to acknowledge and act upon.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10032"> 10032 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to all of that, the Deputy Prime Minister said she 
would resign if the GST had not gone in one year and she still 
has not done it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to speak to Motion 301 by 
my colleague from Skeena.
<P>
	At issue here is the case for including property rights in the 
Canadian Constitution. During the three years I worked in 
Tanzania I saw the transition from a government with a strong, 
ideological belief in socialism where everybody owns 
everything and nobody owns anything to a society which 
accepted that it is human nature for people to want a plot of land 
or a piece of equipment or a business to call their very own.
<P>
	That desire had also been there but it had been subjugated by 
the government and it was only when the change was made that 
pride and productivity began to improve.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	As Canadians we enjoy the right to property but at the moment 
this right is at the pleasure of our government. Our only property 
rights are to be found in common case law developed over 
centuries and recognized by our courts.
<P>
	At present, federal or provincial courts can arbitrarily take 
these rights away, setting their own value and overriding the 
right of the individual to establish what he or she considers to be 
fair and equitable compensation.
<P>
	The establishment of property right is long over due and both 
federal and provincial governments should take prompt action 
to entrench them.
<P>
	Traditionally democracies have been based on four 
fundamental rights: life, liberty, security of the person and the 
right to have and hold property. Property rights go back to the 
Magna Carta. The United Nations universal declaration of 
human rights in 1948 included property rights.
<P>
	Property rights were included in section 1(a) of the Canadian 
Bill of Rights in 1960. The 1981 original draft of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms included property rights but 
they were deleted in political bargaining.
<P>
	Perhaps particularly meaningful to my liberal colleagues 
across the floor, the Right Hon. Prime Minister Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau wrote in 1983: ``I reiterate the full support of my 
government for the passage of a parliamentary resolution to 
entrench property rights in our Constitution''.
<P>
	At least 24 countries including the U.S., Australia, Italy, 
Germany, Sweden and Finland have protected property rights 
within their constitution.
<P>
	No reasonable person would question the right of a 
government to appropriate property needed for the common 
good of society, but the rights of that person to be justly 
compensated for the deprivation should be clearly stated and 
protected. Entrenching property rights in the Constitution would 
obligate any authority expropriating property to be accountable 
to the citizens of our country. As a fundamental right, property 
should be afforded the same constitutional protection as our 
right to life, liberty and security of the person.
<P>
	The government should provide this protection and when the 
necessities of the common good override this personal right, 
provisions should be made to ensure fundamental justice is 
assured.
<P>
	Let us hope that there will be no lack of political will to 
provide this basic human right for our citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I ask the 
unanimous consent of this House to make this important motion 
votable.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has asked the question. 
There have been negatives indicated. I understand the hon. 
member has a second point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena)</B> Mr. Speaker, I then ask the unanimous 
consent of this House to refer this important motion to the 
Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of 
Disabled Persons for further consideration.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The indication has been that there is 
not unanimous consent to the second request by the member.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wanted to raise a couple of points because in the few minutes I 
have been listening to this debate I have never heard such drivel 
of such total lack of logic, devious reasoning, and any lack of 
understanding of a people governing themselves as a 
community who believe that together we can have a life that is 
better than the dog eat dog survival of the fittest mode where 
only the individual and the one with the strongest fangs or the 
longest rifle survives.
<P>
	I have heard a suggestion that not having property rights in the 
Constitution leads to misery and poverty. I have not heard one 
example of a country which I could challenge where having 
property rights in the Constitution leads to wealth and joy.
<P>
	On the contrary, the United Nations has twice deemed this a 
country, which has never had property rights in its Constitution, 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10033"> 10033 </A></B>
<P>
the most blessed country in the world in which to live based on 
quality of life and standard of living. That alone I think belies 
some of the arguments we have heard in this House today.
<P>
	The least we owe Canadians when we use the time of this 
House is logic, reason and truth. There has been a fair bit of that 
lacking in this debate.
<P>
<B>	The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Accordingly, the order is dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m., the House adjourned until 11 a.m. on 
Monday, February 27.

APPENDIX
<P>
Address
<P>
	of
<P>
Mr. William J. Clinton,
<P>
President of the United States of America
<P>
to
<P>
both Houses of Parliament
<P>
in the
<P>
House of Commons Chamber, Ottawa
<P>
on
<P>
Thursday, February 23, 1995
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<I>Mr. and Mrs. William J. Clinton were welcomed by the Right 
Honourable Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada, by the 
Honourable Gildas Molgat, Speaker of the Senate and by the 
Honourable Gilbert Parent, Speaker of the House of Commons.</I>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Gilbert Parent (Speaker of the House of Commons):</B> 
My colleagues, I call this meeting to order.
<P>
	Mr. President, it is a great privilege for Canadians to have you 
address this joint session of the Senate and the House of 
Commons. We are honoured to have you with us today.
<P>
	I now call upon the right hon. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to 
introduce our distinguished guest.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. President, 
it is an honour to welcome you to Parliament on behalf of all 
Canadians. Before speaking a word in this Chamber, I must say 
you have already given eloquent proof of the friendship between 
our two nations by agreeing to visit Ottawa in February.
<P>
	I would like to tell you, Mr. President, that something very 
unusual occurred yesterday in this House. By unanimous vote of 
all members of the House of Commons it was resolved that, very 
rare in the month of February, we were to have a good spring day 
for you today.
<P>
	Mr. President, the cold weather outside that we normally have 
may be typically Canadian, but so is the warm welcome for you 
inside today. It is a warmth that we reserve only for our closest 
friends.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien:</B> A great deal has been written and said about 
the friendship between our two countries. It has not always been 
an easy friendship which is normal considering one friend is a 
relatively small nation and the other is the most powerful nation 
in the world. As one member of this House put it three decades 
ago, the Americans are our best friends, whether we like it or 
not.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien:</B> Our relationship has grown and evolved 
through the years. Today, like any mature, healthy friendship, it 
is a friendship between equals. As friends and neighbours, we 
are able to separate business and friendship when we must. In 
the vast majority of cases, we are able to work together, as we 
always have, toward common goals.
<P>
	The fact is, Mr. President, that both our administrations were 
elected on a platform of jobs and growth. We have both focused 
on a job and growth agenda in office. In each country our agenda 
has been working with strong, steady and lasting economic 
recoveries in Canada and the U.S.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You can listen to the translation now, Mr. President.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is the way we do things in Canada, you know.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien:</B> Our economies have strong links. More trade 
goes on between our two nations than any other two nations in 
the world- almost a billion dollars a day, every day. If one 
country does well, the other benefits. And if both economies are 
going strong, there is no stopping us. Jobs in British Columbia 
mean jobs in Washington State. Jobs in Ontario mean jobs in 
Michigan. Jobs in Quebec mean jobs in New York State.
<P>
	But our shared goals go beyond our immediate relationship. 
Both our administrations understand that increased and 
liberalized trade everywhere means jobs and growth in our 
countries.
<P>
	You and I were together in Jakarta in November, when the 
Asia Pacific countries committed to a free trade zone by the year 
2010. And at the conference you chaired in Miami in December, 
where all the countries of the hemisphere agreed on a Free Trade 
Area of the Americas by the year 2005.
<P>
	I want to salute you, Mr. President, for the role you have 
played in realizing this new vision. And you have not confined 
this vision to economic matters. You took decisive action in 
leading the restoration of democracy in Haiti. And you have 
played a key role in the remarkable breakthroughs in the peace 
process in the Middle East.

<P>
	Mr. President, you have understood the forces shaping the 
modern global economy. You have worked to ensure a new unity 
and optimism in the hemisphere. You have worked to bring 
people and countries together. These are all goals that this 
House and the people across Canada share with you. We are 
committed to working with the United States and other nations 
to achieve them.
<P>
	My recent travels to Asia and Latin America have reminded 
me that it is more important than ever to have a strong U.S. role 
in the world. The upheavals of the post-cold war world mean 
that the United States can and must play a bigger leadership role 
than ever.
<P>
	Our own government has outlined our new foreign policy 
direction. We want to continue Canada's long tradition of 
promoting global peace and security. We all learned long ago 
that isolation is much more costly and dangerous than 
international co-operation.
<P>
	Mr. President, you may not know it, but among your 
predecessors who have addressed the Parliament of Canada 
during your lifetime are Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, 
Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. They all had one thing in 
common. They were all elected for a second term.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien:</B> Now, that might not seem like such a 
remarkable coincidence. But look at the recent presidents who 
have not addressed the Canadian Parliament: Gerald Ford, 
Jimmy Carter and George Bush.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will, however, refrain from drawing any conclusions from 
that, Mr. President.
<P>
	As you know, Canada adheres strictly to a policy of 
non-interference and non-intervention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Any way you look at it, Mr. President, we are delighted that 
you have accepted our invitation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, honoured members, senators and dear guests, I 
give you our friend and neighbour, the President of the United 
States of America, William J. Clinton.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. William J. Clinton (President of the United States):</B> 
Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Chrétien, Mr. Speaker of the Senate, 
Mr. Speaker of the House of Commons, hon. senators and 
members of the House of Commons, distinguished members of 
the diplomatic corps, ladies and gentlemen; I have pondered for 
some time the differences between the Canadian political 
system and the American one. When the Prime Minister pointed 
out the unanimous resolution you passed yesterday, I realized 
that in one respect clearly you are superior. We do not control 
the weather in Washington, D.C. and I am grateful that you do.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> I also thank the Prime Minister for his history 
lesson. I have never believed in the iron laws of history so much 
as I do now.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> I thank the Prime Minister and all of you for 
welcoming me to this magnificent capital city. The Prime 
Minister first came to this Chamber to represent the people of 
Canada when President Kennedy was in the White House. I 
resent that because when President Kennedy was in the White 
House I was in junior high school. Now the Prime Minister has 
less grey hair than I do. And he does, in spite of that fact that 
since that time he has occupied nearly every seat in his nation's 
cabinet. The first time I met him I wondered why this fellow 
could not hold down a job.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> I can tell you this, we in the United States know 
that his service to this nation over so many years has earned him 
the gratitude and the respect of the Canadian people. It also has 
earned the gratitude and the respect of the people of the United 
States.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> I know it is traditional for American presidents 
when they address this body to speak of their affection for their 
ties to the Canadian people. On behalf of the United States let 
me stay with that tradition and say l'amitié solide, but let me say 
to you that it is a big part of our lives.
<P>
	I remember so well more than a decade ago when Hillary and I 
with our then very young daughter came to Canada to celebrate 
the New Year. We started in Montreal and drove to Chateau 
Montebello. Along the way we drove around Ottawa and 
watched all those wonderful people skating along the canal. I 
come from a southern state. I could not imagine that anybody 
could ever get on skates and stand in any body of water for very 
long. I can see that Hillary has had in the back of her mind all 
this long time how much she would like to be skating along this 
canal. I think tomorrow Mrs. Chrétien is going to give her her 
wish. We will be looking forward to that.
<P>

<P>
	My wife has visited Toronto and we had a wonderful, 
wonderful family vacation in western Canada in Victoria and 
Vancouver back in 1990. It was one of the best times that all of 
us have ever had together anywhere.
<P>
	We are deeply indebted to your culture. Our daughter's name 
was inspired by Canadian songwriter Joni Mitchell's wonderful 
song ``Chelsea Morning''.
<P>
	All of you know that in the spring of 1993, the first time I left 
the United States as president, I came to Vancouver for the 
summit with President Yeltsin. Both of us at that time were 
under some significant amount of stress as we tried to reaffirm 
our relationship and solidify democracy in Russia. I can say 
without any equivocation, the reception we received from the 
people of Canada as well as from the government and the Prime 
Minister made it very, very easy for us to have a successful 
meeting. For that we are very grateful.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	I come here today to reaffirm the ties that bind the United 
States and Canada in a new age of great promise and challenge: a 
time of rapid change when both opportunity and uncertainty live 
side by side in my country and in yours; a time when people are 
being lifted up by new possibilities and held down by old 
demons all across the world.
<P>
	I came here because I believe that our nations together must 
seize the opportunities and meet the challenges of this new age. 
We must, I say again, do this together.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> From the oil from Alberta that fires factories in 
the United States to silicon chips from California that power 
your computers, we are living proof of the value of partnerships 
and co-operation.
<P>
	Technologies produced in your nation saves lives in our 
hospitals, while food from our farms line your supermarkets. 
Our horizons have broadened because we have listened in the 
United States to the CBC.
<P>
	Our culture is much richer because of the contributions of 
writers like Robertson Davies, who Hillary had the pleasure of 
meeting last week after reading him for years, and Margaret 
Atwood; also, the wonderful photography of Yousuf Karsh, 
whose famous picture of Churchill I just saw. He took some 
pictures of Hillary and me that are not so distinguished, but I 
love them anyway.
<P>
	As a musician, I have to thank you especially for Oscar 
Peterson, a man I consider to be the greatest jazz pianist of our 
time.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> Ours is the world's most remarkable 
relationship. The Prime Minister said, ``whether we like it or 
not''. I can tell you that on most days I like it very, very much.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> We have to strengthen that relationship. We 
have to strengthen it for our own benefit through trade and 
commerce and travel. We have to strengthen it because it is our 
job to help to spread the benefits of democracy and freedom and 
prosperity and peace beyond our shores.
<P>
	We are neighbours by the grace of nature. We are allies and 
friends by choice. There are those in both our nations who say 
we can no longer afford to, and perhaps we no longer even need 
to, exercise our leadership in the world. When so many of our 
people are having their own problems, it is easy to listen to that 
assertion. But it is wrong.
<P>
	We are two nations blessed with great resources and great 
histories. We have great responsibilities. Our countries were 
built, after all, by men and women who fled the tyranny and the 
intolerance of the old world for the new.
<P>
	We are the nations of pioneers, people who were armed with 
the confidence they needed to strike out on their own and to have 
the talents that God gave them shape their dreams in a new and 
different land.
<P>
	Culture and tradition, to be sure, distinguish us from one 
another in many ways that all of us are still learning about every 
day. But we share core values and that is more important: a 
devotion to hard work, an ardent belief in democracy, a 
commitment to giving each and every citizen the right to live up 
to his or her God-given potential in an understanding of what we 
owe to the world for the gifts we have been given.
<P>
	These common values have nourished the partnership that has 
become a model for new democracies all around the world. They 
can look at us and see just how much stronger the bonds between 
nations can be when their governments answered the citizens' 
desires for freedom and democracy and enterprise, and when 
they work together to build each other up instead of working 
overtime to tear each other down.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> Of course we have our differences. Some of 
them are complex enough to tear your hair out over. But we have 
approached them directly and in good faith, as true friends must. 
We in the United States come more and more every day to 
respect and to understand that we can learn from what is 
different about your nation and its many peoples.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada has shown the world how to balance freedom with 
compassion and tradition with innovation in your efforts to 
provide health care to all your citizens, to treat your senior 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10039"> 10039 </A></B>
<P>
citizens with the dignity and respect they  deserve, and to take on 
tough issues like the move afoot to outlaw automatic weapons 
designed for killing and not hunting.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> I might say, since you applauded so, that you 
were doing it in a nation of people who respect the right to hunt 
and understand the difference between law and order and 
sportsmanship.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> Those of us who have travelled here appreciate 
especially the reverence you have shown for the bounty of God's 
nature from the Laurentians to the Rockies. In a world darkened 
by ethnic conflicts that literally tear nations apart, Canada has 
stood for all of us as a model of how people of different cultures 
can live and work together in peace, prosperity and 
understanding.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> The United States, as may of my predecessors 
have said, has enjoyed its excellent relationships with a strong 
and united Canada but we recognize, just as the Prime Minister 
said with regard to your relationships to us a moment ago, that 
your political future is of course entirely for you to decide. That 
is what a democracy is all about.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> Now I will tell you something about our 
political system. If you want to know why my State of the Union 
Address took so long, it is because I evenly divided the things 
that would make the Democrats clap and the Republicans clap, 
and we doubled the length of the speech in common enthusiasm.
<P>
	I ask all of you to remember that we do look to you and to 
remember what our great President of the post-war era, Harry 
Truman, said when he came here in 1947: ``Canada's eminent 
position today'', he said, ``is a tribute to the patience, tolerance 
and strength of character of her people. Canada's notable 
achievement of national unity and progress through 
accommodation, moderation and forbearance can be studied 
with profit by sister nations''. Those words ring every bit as true 
today as they did then.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> For generations now our countries have joined 
together in efforts to make the world more secure and more 
prosperous. We have reached out together to defend our values 
and our interests in World War I, on the beaches of Normandy 
and in Korea. Together we helped to summon the United Nations 
into existence. Together we stood fast against communist 
tyranny and prevailed in the cold war. Together we stood 
shoulder to shoulder against aggression in the gulf war. Now our 
nations have stepped forward to help Haiti emerge from 
repression and restore its democracy. I thank the Prime Minister 
for what he said about that. When it was not popular anywhere in 
the world to worry about poor,  beleaguered, abandoned Haiti, 
Canada was truly a friend of Haiti.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> In one international forum after another we 
stand side by side to shape a safer and a better world. Whether it 
is at the World Population Conference pushing together for an 
indefinite extension of NNPT in any number of ways we are 
working together.
<P>
	We know that for Canada this history of action is a matter of 
deep tradition and personal conviction. The tradition runs from 
Lester Pearson to Jean Chrétien. It says that we must be engaged 
in the affairs of the world.
<P>
	You have always shown the wisdom of reaching out instead of 
retreating, of rising to new responsibilities instead of 
retrenching. Your tradition of engagement continues to this day 
and, believe you me, it earns respect all around the world from 
people of all races, ethnic groups and political systems.
<P>
	In places like Cyprus and the Sinai, Canadian troops have 
played an invaluable role in preventing more violence in those 
critical hot spots. Today your 2,000 peacekeepers in the former 
Yugoslavia are courageously fulfilling their mission in the midst 
of one of the most intractable, difficult problems in our lifetime.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> For a half century the United States has shared 
your philosophy of action and consistent exercise of leadership 
abroad. I am determined, notwithstanding all the cross-currents 
in our country, that we shall preserve that commitment.
<P>
	These times may be turbulent, but we have an historic 
opportunity to increase security and prosperity for our own 
people and for people all around the world. I want you to know 
that I intend to do everything in my power to keep our country 
constructively involved in the problems that we must face if we 
are going to guarantee that our children will live in a peaceful, 
sane and free world.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> Imagine what the Persian Gulf would look like 
today if we had not risen to the challenge of Iraqi aggression. 
Imagine what tariffs and barriers would plague the world trading 
system if we had not worked so hard together over such a long 
period of time from the end of World War II to the events which 
the Prime Minister described, to the NAFTA, to the GATT, to the 
Asia-Pacific co-operation, to the Summit of the Americas that 
was held in Miami in December. Imagine how different it would 
have been. Imagine how much worse the horrible tragedy in 
Rwanda would have been if we had not been there to try to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10040"> 10040 </A></B>
<P>
provide essential help in those refugee camps to keep people 
alive.
<P>
	We cannot let anyone or anything break this great tradition of 
our nations. In our partnership we will find the key to protecting 
our people and increasing their prosperity and the power to 
reach beyond our shores in the name of democracy and freedom 
not only because it is right but because it is our interest to do so.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> Just before we came down here the Prime 
Minister and I agreed again that if we are to going meet these 
new challenges in the 21st century we must adapt the 
institutions that helped us to win the cold war so that they can 
serve us as well in the 21st century. We have to do that.
<P>
	Some have evolved with the changing world. Some have 
clearly already discarded their old missions and assumed new 
roles. We have also seen at the end of the east-west conflict the 
advent of 24-hour financial markets, sudden environmental 
disasters, the rise of international terrorism, and the resurgence 
of ancient ethnic hatreds. All these things have placed new 
demands on these institutions that the statesmen of 50 years ago 
simply did not imagine.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The 21st century will leave behind those who sit back and 
think that automatically these problems will be solved. We 
simply have to face these challenges and ask ourselves what we 
have to change and how we are going to do it.
<P>
	For example, to meet the security needs of the future we must 
work together to see that NATO, the most successful military 
alliance in all of history, adapts to this new era. That means we 
must make certain that the inevitable process of NATO 
expansion proceeds smoothly, gradually and openly. There 
should be no surprises to anyone about what we are about. We 
will work so that the conditions, the timing and the military 
implications of NATO expansion will be widely known and 
clearly understood in advance.
<P>
	To parallel the enlargement of NATO we have to develop close 
and strong ties with Russia. I have worked hard for that and so 
has the Prime Minister. We must continue working together at 
the United Nations where our nations have together taken the 
lead in efforts to reform our peacekeeping operations, to control 
costs, to improve information gathering, and to make sure we 
have the right kind of command and control system before the 
young people who put on our uniforms are put in harm's way.
<P>
	We have to continue also to work at reforming international 
economic institutions. We have already made some great strides 
in reshaping the global economy with the passage of GATT, 
which is the most comprehensive trade agreement in history. 
The work is only beginning.
<P>

<P>
	At the upcoming G-7 summit in Halifax, which we are very 
much looking forward to, we will be working to ensure that our 
international trading institutions advance the cause of trade 
liberalization in ways that produce tangible gains for the people 
of the countries involved.
<P>
	We also have to re-examine the institutions that were created 
at the time of Bretton-Woods, the IMF and the World Bank, to 
make sure they are going to be able to master the new and 
increasingly complex generation of transnational problems that 
face us, problems like explosive population growth and 
environmental degradation, problems like those that we have 
been facing together in Mexico and throughout Latin America 
and the recent financial crisis.
<P>
	Real progress in all these areas will depend not only on our 
willingness to be involved but our willingness to lead as 
partners. Together Canada and the United States are striving to 
seize all the advantages the new global economy has to offer.
<P>
	We know that trade produces high wage jobs, the kinds of jobs 
that give our people the opportunity to care for their families, to 
educate their children and to leave the next generation better off 
than they were, a dream that has been called into question in 
many advanced economies in the last few years.
<P>
	The success of NAFTA, which is generating new jobs and 
creating new markets from Monterrey to Medicine Hat, is the 
proof. As the Prime Minister has said so well, we in NAFTA are 
on our way to becoming the four amigos. That phrase will go 
down in history; I wish I had thought of it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> We will soon start our consultations with Chile 
for accession to NAFTA and it will be a very good partner. The 
addition of that thriving economy will only continue to increase 
the benefits for all of us.
<P>
	I want to take another moment here to thank Canada for its 
recent support and help in the financial crisis in Mexico. You 
understood what we had on the line, that more than Mexico was 
involved, that jobs and trade and future and our support for 
democracy and stability throughout Latin America were at 
issue. You understood it and we are grateful. Because we stood 
shoulder to shoulder we have a chance to preserve this 
remarkable explosion of democracy that we saw at the Summit 
of the Americas, and we should continue to do that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clinton:</B> I want to say a word, if I might, about the 
environment. As we expand trade we have to remember we must 
defend that which we have inherited and enhance it if we can.
<P>

<P>
	The natural riches of this continent we share are staggering. 
We have co-operated to such great effect on our continent in the 
past: our air quality agreement is solving the acid rain problem; 
the Great Lakes are on the road to recovery; the eagles have 
returned to Lake Erie. Now we have to build on those 
accomplishments.
<P>
	With the NAFTA Environmental Commission located in 
Montreal, your country will play a key role in ensuring that we 
protect the extraordinary bounty that has been given to us for our 
children and our grandchildren. NAFTA is only one of several 
fronts on which we can work together to both increase our 
prosperity and protect our environment. But we must do both.
<P>
	Our nations are building on the progress of last year's Summit 
of the Americas as well. It will create a free trade area 
embracing the entire hemisphere. Across the Pacific, as the 
Prime Minister said, we have paved the way for new markets and 
for free trade among the dynamic economies in the 
Asian-Pacific area. That was a very important thing for us to do 
because those nations are growing very fast and we do not want 
this world to break up into geographical trading blocks in ways 
that would shrink the potential of the people of Canada and the 
United States for decades to come.
<P>
	All these efforts will only enhance what is now the world's 
greatest trading relationship; yours and ours. Every day people, 
ideas and goods stream cross our border. Bilateral trade now is 
more than a billion Canadian dollars every day-I learned to say 
that-and about $270 billion United States dollars last year. It is 
by far the world's largest bilateral relationship. Our trade with 
each other has become an essential pillar in the architecture of 
both our economies.
<P>
	Today 4.5 million Americans have jobs that involve trade 
between our two countries. Those are the concrete benefits of 
our partnership. Between 1988 and 1994, trade between our 
nations rose about 60 per cent. Last year alone it increased by 15 
per cent. But the statistics do not give the human reality behind 
the flourishing exchange of goods and ideas. Our trade is 
creating real jobs for real people.
<P>
	In Boscawen, New Hampshire, for example, a small company 
called Secure Care Products produces monitoring systems for 
patients in nursing homes. Recently Secure Care began 
exporting its products to Canada. Sales are already growing fast 
and the company expects them to triple this year. And so Secure 
Care is hiring people like Susan Southwick, the granddaughter 
of a Quebecer, the mother of two and now the company's 26th 
employee, giving Susan and her husband a shot at the dream 
which Canadian and Americans share. That is what this 
partnership is all about.
<P>
	Much further away from you in Greensboro, North Carolina, 
another small company called Createc Forestry Systems is 
showing how our trade helps people turn their hopes into 
realities. Founded by a man named Albert  Jenks in his family's 
kitchen, Createc makes hand-held computers that track lumber 
mill inventories. Those computers help managers assess their 
needs better, so fewer trees are cut unnecessarily.
<P>
	A few years ago Createc began to export to Canada, and now 
those sales accounts have risen to nearly 20 per cent of their total 
business. That means a more secure future for the company, for 
Mr. Jenks, for his son Patrick, who works with his father in the 
family business. It shows how our trade can increase our 
prosperity and protect the environment as well.
<P>
	Your companies are thriving in our markets, bringing tangible 
benefits to Canadians. Whether it is repairing the engines of 
some of the U.S. air force's largest planes or manufacturing 
software to manage our natural resources or building some of 
the Olympic village for Atlanta's 1996 games, Canadian firms 
are a strong presence in the United States. Their successes there 
help your people to turn their hopes into facts and their dreams 
into reality.
<P>
	The example of our biggest industry shows another side of 
this remarkable story. Working together, U.S. and Canadian 
companies have integrated North America's auto industry and 
staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in all the history 
of the industrial revolution. We have drawn on each other's 
strengths, and today our companies work so closely that we do 
not speak any longer of U.S. or Canadian content in these 
vehicles, but of North American content, whether it is a Chrysler 
Minivan made in Windsor or a Chrysler Jeep made in Detroit. I 
think that was the ambassador from Michigan-I mean from the 
United States-clapping down there.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Productivity and employment have risen to such a point that 
when I visited Detroit last fall the biggest complaint I heard 
from the auto workers in a state that was given up as being lost 
economically a decade ago was that they were working too much 
overtime. Where I come from that is known as a high class 
problem. The auto industry now provides more than one million 
jobs in our countries.
<P>
	To reinforce our commitment to NAFTA and to dramatically 
expand an important market tomorrow, our nations will sign an 
agreement to open the skies between our two nations. This 
agreement, which allows for a dramatic expansion of U.S. and 
Canadian service to each other's nations, will create thousands 
of new jobs and billions of dollars of economic activities in our 
cities, yours and mine.
<P>
	We have reached a fair solution that will make life easier for 
travellers on both sides of the border, that will profit both 
Canadian and U.S. airline carriers, that will increase the mutual 
travel and interconnections of our people. That we have done so 
amicably provides yet another model of how neighbouring 
nations can settle their differences.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10042"> 10042 </A></B>
<P>
	Friendship and engagement. Canada and the United States 
have shown the best there is in partnerships between nations: all 
the great potential that awaits all the free peoples of this earth if 
they can join in common cause. We are, as the monument at the 
St. Lawrence Seaway declares, two nations whose frontiers are 
the frontiers of friendship, whose ways are the ways of freedom, 
whose works are the works of peace.
<P>
	Every day we see the enormous benefits this partnership gives 
to us in jobs, prosperity and the great creative energy that our 
interchanges bring. We have only seen the beginning. For the 
Susan Southwicks who want a chance to build better lives and 
the companies like Createc that are trying to build solid 
businesses that will last, this partnership holds a great promise 
with all the vast horizons of our great continent.
<P>
	Together we have turned our energies toward improving the 
world around us for nearly a century. Today, more than ever, let 
us reaffirm and renew that great tradition. Let us engage and 
confront the great challenges of the end of this century and the 
beginning of the next. We must sustain our efforts. We must 
enhance our efforts. We must maintain our partnership. We must 
make it stronger.
<P>
	This is our task and our mission. Together we will be equal to 
it. A border separates our peoples, but there are no boundaries to 
our common dreams.
<P>
	Thank you and God bless you all.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Gildas Molgat (Speaker of the Senate):</B> Mr. President 
and Mrs. Clinton, monsieur le premier ministre et madame 
Chrétien, monsieur le Président de la Chambre des communes, 
Your Excellencies, membres distingués du Sénat et de la 
Chambre des communes, mesdames et messieurs.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Mr. President, it is my pleasant task to thank you but no words 
that I could express could thank you better than the applause and 
the standing ovations which you received this afternoon.
<P>
	We are all honoured, Mr. President and Mrs. Clinton, by your 
presence and we welcome the many American friends who have 
joined you in this voyage to Canada.
<P>
	We appreciate your warm expressions of friendship and 
assure you that we hold you and your great nation in great 
esteem, our valued neighbours.
<P>
	Many statesmen from across the world have addressed both 
Houses of Parliament in the past, but none have been more 
welcome than the American presidents and all have spoken 
eloquently, as you have today, of the close friendship between 
our two nations.
<P>
	Mr. President, you referred earlier today at lunch time to the 
words of President Kennedy when he addressed our Parliament 
in May of 1961. I will repeat part of his comments which you 
mentioned: ``Geography has made us neighbours. History has 
made us friends. Economics has made us partners and necessity 
has made us allies. Those whom nature has so joined together 
let no man put asunder. What unites us is far greater than what 
divides us''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. President, the world has changed a great deal since 1961, 
but his remarks hold just as true today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. President, while history and nature have joined us 
together for many purposes, they have also made our two 
countries very different. It is therefore very important that we 
not take each other for granted.
<P>
	It is important that our leaders and the members of their 
respective cabinets meet on a regular basis to co-ordinate policy 
and hopefully to iron out difficulties and disagreements before 
they arise.
<P>
	Mr. President, we are happy to have you with us. We thank you 
for your inspiring words. We hope you will return.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker Parent:</B> Mr. President and my colleagues. Mr. 
President, when you were in my chambers a little earlier I was 
explaining to you how we got the name to be Speaker. For about 
a year now, although I have been Speaker, they have not allowed 
me to speak in this, our own House of Commons.
<P>
	Mr. President, your words and your presence in this Chamber 
underscore the profound friendship that our peoples have 
developed over many generations. Our relationship does stem 
from the fact that we are neighbours but its strength, Mr. 
President, derives from the fact that we share more than a 
common boundary. The 49th parallel is not so much a line that 
divides us as a place where two great nations come together.
<P>
	Canada and the United States were built by immigrants, men 
and women who shared similar aspirations, a spirit of adventure 
and a sense of freedom, of equality, of democracy. When these 
immigrants came here they were met by our aboriginal people, 
whom we must never forget.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker Parent:</B> Our common values are embodied in 
our institutions, and while Congress and Parliament may be 
similar, they are a study in contrast because they reflect our 
distinct traditions and national characters. However, Mr. 
President, they are built with the same mortar, democratic 
values and liberal values that form our common heritage.
<P>

<P>
	Proximity also has its rewards. Like many Canadians I had the 
chance to attend American universities and many Americans 
have studied here in Canada. You may be interested in knowing, 
Mr. President, that five of our parliamentarians were born in the 
United States.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our friendship is not based so much on our personal interests 
as on the values and ideas shared by our two countries. 
Throughout this century, we have worked together to promote 
these values. Our soldiers fought side by side and many of them 
died defending them.
<P>
	Fifty years ago, we paid an enormous price in human lives to 
help bring peace to Europe. Together, Canadians and Americans 
helped create the United Nations and establish an international 
order dedicated to peace and democracy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our international co-operation has taken many forms. 
Together we have been liberators and we have been 
peacekeepers. We have liberalized world trade, promoted 
human rights and fostered the rule of law.
<P>
	Mr. President, very gently I remind you that 15 years ago a 
Canadian diplomat sheltered and secured the freedom of 
American citizens in danger. On that occasion we were 
reminded that we can and we will count on each other when it 
really matters because our friendship is so sacred.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker Parent:</B> The men and women before you in this 
Chamber, Mr. President, are the face of Canada and they are the 
expression of our democracy. Yes, Mr. President, you do us great 
honour by speaking to Canadians in this Chamber.
<P>
	As Speaker of the House of Commons may I offer a renewed 
expression of our respect and warm affection for you, for Mrs. 
Clinton and for all of our American friends.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. President.
<P>
	I now adjourn this meeting.
<P>
