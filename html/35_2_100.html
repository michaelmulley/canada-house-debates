	The House resumed from November 6, 1996 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-41, an act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family 
Orders and Agreements and Enforcement Assistance Act, the 
Garnishment Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and the 
Canada Shipping Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on Bill C-41 which deals with 
child support payments. I think we can say that it was high time 
something was done in this area. For several years we were faced 
with a somewhat incongruous situation, and we had to wait until 
this was settled by the courts.
<P>
	In the 1996 budget, the federal government unveiled a new child 
support payment system consisting of four elements. First, support 
payments will no longer be taxable in the case of the custodial 
parent, and will therefore be taxable in the case of the 
non-custodial parent.
<P>
	We must ensure that this measure, which would seem to reflect a 
certain sense of equity, does not lead to impossible situations where 
in the end, the only winner would be the government. It must 
remain even handed in the way it deals with the parties, and that is 
part of the approach taken by the Bloc Quebecois when considering 
Bill C-41.
<P>
	The second element announced in the budget is that the amount 
of the working income supplement included in the federal child tax 
benefit will be doubled, to ensure that no child will be affected by 
the change. Furthermore, guidelines were introduced for 
establishing the amount of child support payments, while new 
measures for collecting support payments were also announced on 
that occasion.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has analysed Bill C-41, and on the whole, 
like the Quebec government at the provincial level, the bill 
provides the requisite framework for implementing the guidelines I 
just mentioned.
<P>
	This means that except in special cases, the courts will no longer 
allow discretion in determining the amounts allocated for support 
child payments. Today, we realize that in our society, we should no 
longer be subject to arbitrary decisions. We have seen situations, 
not necessarily in this area but in others, where it was clear that 
depending on the values the judge might have and how that might 
influence his decision and also due to the fact that women are not 
adequately represented in Parliament, the decision was not always 
fair.
<P>
	I think this is something we can readily perceive, and it is 
systemic. At least, until the day men and women are equally 
represented among judges in the various courts of the Canadian 
judicial system, I think it would be interesting to replace the bill's 
provisions regarding judicial discretion with standard guidelines 
that would apply to everyone and help make more appropriate 
decisions.
<P>
	It is also interesting to see that this bill shows once again the 
inefficient duplication in the Canadian system. Since the division 
of responsibilities is not totally clear, since the federal government 
always tends to broaden what it sees as its jurisdiction, there is still 
some duplication with the provinces, which, of course, increases 
costs.
<P>
	For example, the Quebec government has designed a model, 
while the federal government has created another model with 
different criteria. For instance, the Quebec model's first criterion is 
based on the real cost of raising a child, while that of the federal 
model is based on the partial equalization of living standards. Right 
from the outset, we see that, despite both governments' good 
intentions, we may end up with different assessments, with 
situations that make little sense.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	Another principle is that, in the Quebec model, the whole tax 
income plan will be harmonized with Quebec's income security 
and taxation programs. We are therefore trying to make sure that 
this does not lead to unfair situations, that another program will not 
upset the balance. This is not found in the federal model, possibly 
because, first of all, it should have been adjusted to the various 
models found in Canada. This shows, by reducing  it to the absurd, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6298"> 6298 </A></B>
<P>
that the federal government is overstepping its mandate and cannot 
take into consideration the various realities in each province of 
Canada.
<P>
	There are five basic criteria in both the Quebec and the federal 
models. However, these criteria differ and result in slightly 
different approaches. Hopefully, this will not ultimately lead to an 
inextricable situation.
<P>
	When the Minister of Justice first introduced his new policy, the 
Bloc Quebecois welcomed the initiative. The Bloc had long been 
asking the Minister of Justice to table a bill to balance the 
child-related financial burden between the two parents. It is 
imperative that the government take immediate action to meet the 
expectations of women. This was pointed out as early as May 1995, 
in statements made by the hon. members for Québec and for 
Témiscamingue, among others.
<P>
	So, this was in May of 1995. We are now in the fall of 1996, 
almost in 1997, and the minister has finally tabled the reform that 
the Bloc had been asking for so long. The official opposition in a 
parliament can play a useful role in pressing the government to take 
concrete action, instead of merely making statements.
<P>
	However, the Bloc Quebecois had some reservations regarding 
the implementation of guidelines in the provinces. These 
reservations, which do not have to do with Bill C-41 itself, but 
rather to the guidelines, are not met. We are not at all convinced 
that, with Bill C-41, the government took them into consideration.
<P>
	Here are some of these reservations. First, let us suppose that a 
provincial government decides to put in place guidelines for its 
province, for example Quebec. We mentioned earlier that the 
Quebec model has specific criteria. These provincial guidelines 
must have priority over the federal ones. However, this will be the 
case only if the governor in council, in other words the federal 
cabinet, decides, through an order in council, that the provincial 
guidelines are the ones that apply. This is a situation where the 
federal government gives itself a somewhat paternalistic role.
<P>
	And it is not the only area in which it has done so and will 
continue to do so. In fact, Quebecers have been convinced for quite 
some time, and I am not referring exclusively to sovereignists, I am 
talking about the 68 per cent of Quebecers who are currently 
dissatisfied by the federal government, because it has not taken any 
concrete action to at least clarify relations with Quebec, to clarify 
everyone's status, so that a proper solution can be found. This is not 
because of my position as a sovereignist, but, with respect to 
federalism, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in Quebec 
because we do not think we are being listened to, we do not get the 
impression this government wants to budge.
<P>
	And here, in a specific example, in a bill where there is 
agreement on the principles, we again come up against this 
nitpicking, slightly petty, vaguely paternalistic attitude in the rules 
of application. In our view, this line is not good enough and is 
inconsistent with the fields of jurisdiction set out in the 
Constitution as it now stands.
<P>
	In this field, we are not asking for anything extra, just that the 
Canadian Constitution be enforced. And even then, the federal 
government disappoints us.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	We have only to look at clause 1(4), which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1.(4) The Governor in Council may, by order, designate a province for the 
purposes of the definition ``applicable guidelines'' in subsection (1)-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This clause could have have used ``shall'' thus indicating that the 
government respects the fact that these fields come under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In addition, the provinces will have to meet the criteria set out by 
the federal government in clause 26.1, if they wish their guidelines 
to be approved. The federal government has complete discretion as 
to whether or not it will issue the order mentioned in clause 1(4).
<P>
	This confirms what I was saying earlier, that the federal 
government is behaving in a paternalistic manner. This clause 
points up the two very different interpretations of this country. In 
other words, when they talk about constitutional issues and tell us 
that that is what people want to hear, it is simply not the case. Here 
again, in this example, how are we going to ensure support for 
children in cases of divorce, which affect many families? This is 
real life, we are not on some other planet.
<P>
	This is another concrete example of the fact that the fields of 
jurisdiction are not clear, and, in particular, that the federal 
government has a tendency to interfere in provincial fields of 
jurisdiction. This creates complications, even in very concrete 
situations such as financial support for children.
<P>
	The federal big brother is still keeping the provinces under his 
thumb. We think this is disgraceful, particularly in a field where 
change is long overdue, and where there has long been a need for 
legislation consistent with the new reality of the end of the 
twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first.
<P>
	What is even more ridiculous is that the rejection of provincial 
guidelines can result in absurd situations. For example, when 
parents separate, the provincial grid would apply, but not when 
they divorce, in which case the federal grid would be used. This 
would result in a double standard.
<P>
	In Quebec, this situation comes up frequently, because it is the 
province with the highest percentage of common law marriages. It 
is a situation in which not all citizens are treated equally. This is not 
good enough.
<P>
	Finally, the federal government uses the place of residence of the 
parent paying support in deciding which  guidelines to apply, while 
the Quebec government uses the child's place of residence. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6299"> 6299 </A></B>
<P>
think this principle is much more consistent with the thinking in a 
number of court rulings where the child's interests must take 
precedence, because the premise of the new approach is that the 
child must have adequate financial support.
<P>
	We want to eliminate the battles that sometimes took place 
between spouses who no longer got along, often working things out 
at a cost to the child. The bill is intended to resolve this situation. 
But the fact that the federal government uses the place of residence 
of the debtor to decide which guidelines apply is somewhat 
contradictory to the principle of the bill.
<P>
	It must, however, be kept in mind that, overall, this project is a 
long-awaited measure. Some of its points may strike us as fairly 
positive, for example that deadbeats could be refused certain 
privileges, for instance passports or certain licences. This, I feel, is 
indeed a good measure, because I have seen cases in my riding 
where the partner has just skipped town rather than pay up. This 
type of situation will be avoidable in future.
<P>
	The bill will also include children between the ages of 16 and 18, 
as well as students, under one definition. I find this appropriate. In 
so doing, a clear priority is established for the child, when the 
former spouse is also demanding support. I think this is an 
interesting principle.
<P>
	Overall, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of the principle of the 
bill. We have been calling on the government for a year to do 
something along this line. We will be voting in favour of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	It seems to us that the government ought to have made some 
major modifications in order to bring the bill in line with the 
flexible federalism they are constantly going on about, which was 
called for in the throne speech.
<P>
	We find ourselves in a situation in which what was said in the 
throne speech does not jibe with what is in the bills. This will mean 
that, in a year, or two or five, there will be test cases, problematical 
situations which will mean court additional costs for both the 
people involved and the government.
<P>
	The federal government could have shown greater respect for the 
rules of the Canadian Constitution and produced a bill that would 
be dispute-proof, one that could not be interpreted or disputed 
because of a lack of respect of jurisdictions, and could not lead to 
judgments contrary to children's interests.
<P>
	I believe that the purpose of this bill is to protect children's 
interests. The federal government ought to have placed the child's 
interest well ahead of its unhealthy desire to treat the provinces 
with paternalism.
<P>
	Let us hope that, with Bill C-41, the federal government will 
have settled partially, but significantly, the question of financial 
support for the children in divorce or separation. The Bloc 
Quebecois will vote in favour of the bill, regretting that the federal 
government could not have risen above its centralizing vision of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
surprised as I listened to my colleague who expressed concern for 
the paternalistic aspect of the bill. Then he went to some length to 
describe exactly what he believed to be some of that paternalism as 
his point of view. He then expressed that his party would be 
supporting the bill.
<P>
	This piece of legislation goes beyond paternalism. While the 
concept of guidelines is very good, what we have here is a seriously 
flawed piece of legislation. For example, there is no consideration 
for additional financial obligations of either parent. There is no 
consideration for the needs of a child based on age specific 
requirements. There is no consideration for servicing the debt of 
the union by either parent. There is no consideration for the assets 
division of the matrimonial property settlement. There is no 
recognition of the costs incurred by the unit to maintain dual 
households. There is no recognition of the costs involved by the 
non-custodial parent in maintaining access, including travel, long 
distance telephone, food, clothing and entertainment. I could go on 
at some length with the very serious flaws in this legislation.
<P>
	If this is for children as the hon. member has expressed, I would 
like my hon. colleague to tell me how he believes a child's needs 
are satisfied, especially when, in the final analysis, there is no 
provision for direct spending on the children by the non-custodial 
parent. This means that a parent who totally ignores the children 
and spends no time and has no expenses for visitation will be 
treated in exactly the same way as the caring parent who does 
spend time with the children, who does provide that emotional 
support for the children in a household. The process absolutely 
ignores this individual over someone who has spent no time with 
the children in the household.
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleague to indicate how he feels that the 
needs of the children are given due consideration in light of that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the hon. member 
that we are on third reading and that the Bloc Quebecois proposed a 
number of amendments when the bill was in committee. These 
amendments were to provide for the fairest possible treatment of 
the parties.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6300"> 6300 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	At the third reading stage, where we are today, we have to decide 
whether, for instance, we want to move a motion to return the bill 
to committee or whether, based on the principle of the bill and after 
debating the matter, we are prepared to adopt the bill in its present 
form. Our position is that the bill will be useful in the light of the 
principle that will be implemented.
<P>
	I understand her point, as to the list of recriminations, for 
instance. We might in fact want this model to function in a different 
way. There is a particular perception at work here, and I would urge 
her to look at what the Quebec model proposes. For instance, 
amounts will be based on the real costs, in the Quebec model,of 
bringing up the child, which means that we will really make sure 
that the amounts paid represent the cost of providing the child with 
adequate financial support.
<P>
	I agree with her that the federal model does not reflect the same 
practical considerations. The model in the Liberal majority's bill is 
based more on an evenhanded apportionment of expenses. 
Additional problems may arise. We may not be comfortable with 
this situation.
<P>
	However, at the stage of today's debate, there does not seem to 
be sufficient reason to vote against the bill. We feel there is some 
hope the provinces will be more sensitive to these problems, since 
those governments will have to administer welfare, for instance.
<P>
	So, in the case of all parents and children in special 
circumstances, we expect that the provinces will be more sensitive 
and that the federal government, although the discretionary powers 
it has under this legislation were criticized and pointed out several 
times in my speech, will allow each province to adopt guidelines 
that reflect its particular needs.
<P>
	Another example: the Quebec model will be harmonized with 
Quebec's income security programs and the provincial tax system. 
So in this model, we are taking into consideration all the other 
measures and programs available to ensure that the child is treated 
fairly.
<P>
	This is not found in the bill, I agree. It is not harmonized with 
Quebec programs, but we are willing to bet that it would be better 
for the children if the bill were passed despite its flaws, which the 
federal government has refused to correct. At this stage, however, 
we think it would be better to accept the bill as is so children will 
stop being taken hostage in conflicts between separated parents.
<P>
	On the whole, we feel this bill will still be an improvement. 
Basically, we had the choice between taking an inflexible, 
uncompromising attitude-a little like the federal government with 
its paternalistic attitude-or agreeing that the provisions in this bill 
are enough for now to make sure children are treated right, to at 
least improve their situation. That is how we look at this bill.
<P>
	Will other amendments be required in the future? Probably. A 
bill like this one should perhaps be reviewed in the short or 
medium term so we can look back and make the necessary 
adjustments to ensure that no children fall between the cracks and 
end up in unacceptable situations.
<P>
	We are willing to bet that the principle of the bill is a good one, 
that it is not inconsistent enough to vote against. But we are also 
betting that the provinces will take their responsibilities seriously 
and do a good job. In any case, we have something to learn in this 
regard, especially in light of the Quebec model.
<P>
	In conclusion, we hope the federal government will keep an open 
mind when it receives applications from the provinces. And its 
preferred approach will be to give priority to provincial guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, continuing 
with my discussion about the needs of children, given what my 
hon. colleague has just expressed, the Canadian Bar Association 
says that Bill C-41 does not go far enough in protecting children 
and, in this specific instance, from poverty. It insists that the 
legislation does not ensure that there is no discrepancy in the 
standard of living of the custodial and non-custodial parent.
<P>
	Equalizing the standard of living in post separation households is 
ultimately in the best interests of the children.
<P>
	For example, under Bill C-41 if a father and a mother earned 
$45,000 and $25,000 a year, respectively, and the mother had 
custody of the two children and the cost of caring for the children 
was calculated at about $1,256 a month, each parent would pay 
$628 a month. But the father's standard of living would be higher 
than those of the mother and the children.
<P>
	I ask my hon. colleague how can we respect this notion of equal 
and fair treatment of households with respect to the whole issue of 
poverty when we have a bill such as Bill C-41 that does nothing to 
look after the interests of children in this instance. I would like my 
hon. colleague to respond to that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by saying that 
things are obviously different throughout Canada, for example, in 
Quebec, in this sort of situation. We must also be sure that the 
Canadian Bar Association is not just trying to complicate the legal 
situation. I think that we have, in the model proposed for the 
province of Quebec in any event, covered all the bases.
<P>
	It will be up to each province with jurisdiction to see that its 
model is satisfactory and meets the public's requirements. I also 
hope that the federal government will keep an open mind when 
considering provincial guidelines. It is obvious that the model 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6301"> 6301 </A></B>
<P>
proposed by the government of Quebec addresses my colleague's 
concerns.
<P>
	Will the model be the same for the rest of Canada? It is up to 
citizens to defend their point of view, but basically we feel that it is 
not up to the federal government to impose guidelines. It is our 
view, and the correct one we feel, backed up by the Canadian 
Constitution, that provincial legislatures should have the final say. 
We also think that the people of Quebec trust the government of 
Quebec to make the best decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to this bill.
<P>
	Bill C-41 deals with a specific component of the Divorce Act, 
child support. It has generated a lot of response not only from the 
public but here in the House with regard to debating other aspects 
of the divorce situation which are flawed.
<P>
	We have talked about the problems of access. I also get letters 
like the one from Sylvia Richards in my riding expressing concerns 
with section 15(6) regarding spousal support.
<P>
	Dealing with the one component, the financial support of 
children, limits the debate on what could be termed an extremely 
flawed bill, the Divorce Act. However, I suppose it is a place to 
start.
<P>
	When the minister made his address the other day he indicated 
that there has to be a starting place with the support of children and 
that guidelines would be the way to go. It is my understanding that 
the concept of guidelines has been around for some time and the 
problem is actually identifying the amounts of guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	To move that back one step before we actually get to the support 
aspect for children, when you look at a marriage it is a contract and 
the initial or main conditions are the sharing of everything. The 
second condition would be that the parties agree to do this for the 
rest of their lives.
<P>
	When a divorce occurs both those conditions are challenged. If 
children are not involved in the family situation of the divorce then 
the sharing component is just a matter of totalling up the assets, 
deducting the liabilities and splitting the balance and that can 
negate the rest of our lives with that type of clause and the 
relationship is finished.
<P>
	When children are involved, somewhere during the course of 
that marriage contract it was agreed to by the parties that they 
would indeed raise and support these children to their adult years. 
That tends to extend at the divorce time to the rest of our lives or to 
at least the adult years of the children.
<P>
	The two components involved with the children are the support 
and the raising of, which tends to beg the argument that access has 
a direct bearing. This bill deals directly with the financial support.
<P>
	In the minister's speech the objective he stated was to introduce 
child support guidelines as a way of determining what constitutes a 
proper amount of support according the financial capabilities of the 
payer. That phrase tends to open a number of possible scenarios, as 
previously mentioned by one of the speakers in the questions 
period with regard to the financial ability of the payer. What does 
this actually mean?
<P>
	If the payer is not working does it mean that the capability is that 
he or she cannot pay anything? If the payer is earning $30,000 a 
year then he or she pays <I>x</I> amount in child support and if that 
increases to $35,000 does <I>x</I> increase proportionately? Or does it 
mean that if the payer could earn $60,000 a year but chooses to earn 
$30,000 a year, then is the support payment based on what he or she 
is earning or what he or she could earn? It does open up a number 
of concerns.
<P>
	The payer's capability is a very broad statement and it would be 
nice if that could be defined a little more closely. One of the 
possible problems generating from that is that it certainly does not 
motivate someone in the paying position to work or to improve 
their salary.
<P>
	It reminds me of a situation when the income tax tables came 
down. Getting a promotion and moving up into the next step, it was 
possible to actually take home less money. I certainly hope with 
these guidelines that as one's earning power increases that does not 
happen.
<P>
	The minister said that the guidelines provide a starting point. 
They involved a numerical calculation which takes into account the 
amounts that families at similar income levels would spend on their 
children. He goes on to say that in this way child support awards 
can be consistent, fair and predictable. Yet further on in his 
statement he makes the comment that there are provisions in the 
bill which would allow the courts to adjust the award if it causes 
unfairness because of special provisions made in pre-existing 
agreements by the party. He illustrates that with an example using 
the house as being part of the child support.
<P>
	I tend to caution here that this may violate the principle of 
sharing equally. We have spent years trying to establish what the 
equal share or the sharing component of the marriage meant.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	It took quite a while to get to the 50:50 aspect of the sharing. I 
am wondering if we are opening an avenue here that when we look 
at the marriage situation and the sharing component one can 
actually take the material assets of the marriage and split them on a 
50:50 basis or negotiate one way or another to come up with as 
close to 50:50 as possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6302"> 6302 </A></B>
<P>
	I caution that if we start taking these assets and applying them 
to what I see is a separate issue, the amount of money that it costs 
to address the raising and financial support of the children, I think 
we may infringe upon the concept of the 50:50 sharing. That is 
one weakness I see there.
<P>
	The other weakness tends to be in wanting to establish a level 
and fair playing field as far as the amount that the custodial parent 
would receive in relation to child support. The main argument 
seems to be that people in similar situations can go into a 
courtroom and come out with totally different end results. There 
does not seem to be a standard.
<P>
	The minister suggests that this bill will certainly address that 
situation. Yet immediately following that, he makes several 
possible exceptions. The judge has the flexibility to award up or 
down. It can be changed if there is a preagreement between the two 
people, i.e. who gets the house kind of thing. Already we start to 
get it out of balance. I tend to wonder if we actually solved that 
problem.
<P>
	The other thing the minister mentioned is that the bill does not 
address the access component of the situation. He bases that on 
input from various organizations, the bar association and this type 
of thing. I think this is quite a misdemeanour. I find it quite difficult 
to separate the two; viewing the raising and the financial assistance 
to the children and separating them totally. I think we will run into 
problems, guidelines or no guidelines.
<P>
	There is another thing I would like to address here. In previous 
debates on this bill, we challenged the guidelines by putting 
amendments in at various stages but they were all defeated in one 
way or another. I think that is also a misconception.
<P>
	The member for Quebec, in her response to the bill, made the 
point quite clearly that the guidelines provided by the provinces 
had been totally ignored which is a problem that they perceived. I 
believe that would be our position as well, that there should have 
been more in-depth study as to how those guidelines would work 
into this bill.
<P>
	The other component I wish to mention at this point concerns the 
comments made by the member for Quebec. She tended to relate 
the fact that the divorce component should be given back to the 
provinces. The marriage component is under civil law and it would 
logically follow that the divorce component should fall back under 
provincial jurisdiction. I agree with that. That process of 
decentralization is an excellent concept here. It is certainly an 
opportunity for the government to show that when it says it would 
like to decentralize some of the authority back to the provinces this 
would be an ideal opportunity. I cannot agree with the member for 
Quebec that this example of decentralization is a component in 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society. This divorce situation is 
applicable across the country. It does not distinguish any particular 
province in any special way.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to make reference to comments made by the 
hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam the other day in 
response to the minister's statement. She indicated that as the bill 
only addresses one component, the access problem was still very 
viable. She also brought to the attention of the House that there are 
three main principles in this bill.
<P>
	I would like to quote to reinforce what she said earlier: ``The 
first principle is the importance of families in our society and the 
importance of government to support those families''. On the 
second principle she said: ``We have a government that is seized 
with its own importance, a government that thinks that government 
can solve all problems, a government that thinks coming to a bill 
such as this in an easy, fast manner, that wants to put a legislative, 
legalistic quick fix to a problem that is much too major''.
<P>
	Basically the message my colleague is trying to get across to the 
House is we have too much government in our lives. Because of the 
different jurisdictions involved, we should seriously consider 
putting the divorce aspect back into the jurisdiction of provincial 
governments.
<P>
	The third principle that she makes reference to is the true 
equality of the process. That brings me back to the sharing concept. 
When we marry we agree to share everything for the rest of our 
lives. We spend a lot of time attempting to put some sort of value 
system on that sharing component, a 50:50 balance system of the 
assets of that partnership. Children are an added commitment to 
that marriage partnership. It is a responsibility that is generated 
during the course of the partnership and indeed should be 
considered separate.
<P>
	We have debated this for some time now and discussed almost 
all parameters. However, I would like to repeat before closing that 
the moneys that are required for the raising of children, from 
whatever their age at the time of the divorce until their adult years, 
I do have concerns that may somehow get infringed on with the 
50:50 sharing concept.
<P>
	I certainly think the three principles mentioned by the hon. 
member for Port Moody-Coquitlam have been overlooked and 
should receive more consideration.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened to my hon. colleague most carefully and I find she has 
raised some very important points.
<P>
	It seems to me that the bill is being somewhat rushed through 
third reading, considering its great importance. I have worked in 
education much of my life, and I have had students whose parents 
were going to divorce or were involved in a divorce. I became 
aware of the numerous conflicts around equal division.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6303"> 6303 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	This is probably a step in the right direction, but I find it 
insufficient. Equitable, fair and honest division of property is a 
complex thing. Who will suffer if there is any conflict? The 
spouses, of course, but the children are the ones who will suffer 
most. Children and teenagers are very sensitive to these problems.
<P>
	Another point justifiably raised by my colleague concerns 
visiting rights. I endorse her words 100 per cent. This needs to be 
looked at again. This bill perhaps needs to be returned to a 
committee. If it is tabled as it is, even if it is generally in order, 
there are certain negative aspects to it.
<P>
	Furthermore, I believe that this entire question ought to be a 
provincial responsibility. If marriage is a provincial responsibility, 
why not divorce also? My colleague called for this, and I back her 
up 100 per cent.
<P>
	My question to my colleague is this: even if the Bloc feels the 
bill is generally in order, has sufficient thought been given to the 
children? Will they feel more secure after this bill is passed, or will 
they still feel more or less the way they did in the past, that is 
almost totally insecure? Will they still worry about whether their 
father or mother will be able to see them tomorrow? Is there still 
too much leeway here? Will the division really be done properly? 
Why not take advantage of this opportunity to delegate this power 
to the provinces? I think everyone would benefit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. As I mentioned in my speech, I share a number of his 
concerns. I do not think the bill as it stands will be able to achieve 
equity. I do not think it is progressive enough to achieve equity of 
assets for the two partners, nor can it address the issues of financial 
support and the raising of the children. I have an extremely difficult 
time trying to separate the financial aspect and the raising of the 
children.
<P>
	I firmly believe this is an excellent opportunity for the 
government to do as it stated: try to decentralize some of the 
authority of the federal government. This is an excellent 
opportunity to put this in the jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>
	One other point has not been mentioned, that of the custodial 
parent obtaining the money that has been allocated for support. 
That is still a problem which the measures in this bill do not really 
address. It is still very difficult when payments are not made and 
the onus is still on the custodial parent to obtain the money, which 
in itself is a financial burden on them.
<P>
	The points made by the member from Calgary Southwest in 
relation to the equity of payments, which I  also made in my speech 
to some extent, are extremely valid. Are they prorated? What 
happens if the amount is $30,000 now, but then moves up to 
$40,000? These types of things are not addressed here at all. 
Basically, what we get is a table of guidelines that says if you make 
$26,000, this is what you pay. On top of that, a judge can sit there 
and make variations to it. Where have we gone? I do not know what 
we have achieved here.

	The bill is about allocating the resource unequally. For example, 
it gives the minister the authority to dedicate fish not to a native 
food fishery but to a native commercial fishery. This has been a 
huge problem within  my province of B.C. Forty per cent of the 
commercial fishing fleet is already native. The natives have a good 
portion of the commercial fleet. Nobody questions the need for a 
native food fishery. That is not the question. The issue is a native

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
1991 census shows that 45 per cent of the people in my riding are 
new immigrants. I need a full time person just to look after 
immigration cases.
<P>
	One of these cases concerned Mr. and Mrs. Fa Qin Lei. Mr. and 
Mrs. Lei came from China in 1990 and applied, by going through 
the regular channels, to bring their three children from China. Their 
case kept being delayed by officials. After several applications, 
acceptances and refusals, the youngest son, Chew Quen, lost heart 
and drowned himself because he feared never being able to join his 
family in Canada.
<P>
	This tragedy is one of the many immigration cases that cross my 
desk. Immigrants have to wait too long and are at the whim of 
immigration officials in their country.
<P>
	It is hard to accept that a young man can drown in red tape, as a 
Vancouver journalist wrote. He was 26 and left his family in 
despair. His brother and sister are still in China waiting for 
approval to travel.
<P>
	Our immigration system must be improved if we really want 
immigrants to continue to come to Canada and to avoid tragedies. I 
would like to express my sympathy to the Lei family.

Canadian radio and television broadcasters gathered in Edmonton

services and the Internet, responsibilities to their communities and 
how they can continue to be the primary source of entertainment

<P>
	One of the areas of real frustration was copyright Bill C-32. 
Broadcasters recognize the work done by many members of the 
House in limiting the damage of neighbouring rights, but they are 
taken aback that promised time shifting and transfer exceptions are 
not in  the bill. Broadcasters need these exceptions so they can 
replay live programming at more convenient times and generally 
operate their stations efficiently.

	Like all members in this House, I am sensitive to the need to 
respect property rights, but we also have to be sensible. 
Broadcasters pay more than $50 million a year to rights holders, 
authors, composers and publishers, to broadcast their music. They 
pay millions more when they record music for programs that are 
exported and used for many years. It is neither practical nor fair to 
expect broadcasters to pay more money to these same rights 
holders when they cover local church services and community 
parades, or time shift concerts or skating championships so 
Canadians across the country can watch them at times convenient 
to them.

<P>
	A talented interpretive writer, Mr. Lacoursière has several works 
to his credit. He is the author of the famous <I>Canada Québec:

which related the history of Quebec and of Canada.

has never stopped ``making people learn and love history'' to use 
his own terms. In his opinion, and I quote: ``A people with no 
history is like a tree with no roots. It cannot stand''. In other words, 
to forget our past is to forget who we are.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	This morning, as they were going into cabinet, three ministers 
gave the following justifications for the choice of June 23 for the 
Supreme Court hearing regarding the next Quebec referendum: the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said it was the only date 
available; the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada 
said it was the date they had requested; and the President of the 
Treasury Board said it was the same date as his birthday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Very serious, this 
government is very serious.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6309"> 6309 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> How else can the Supreme Court's comment 
that the government had not done its homework very well be 
explained except by the fact that it has improvised unpardonably in 
such an important matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, justice department lawyers 
appeared before the Supreme Court of Canada this morning to 
receive instructions, including the date the reference will be heard. 
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court indicated clearly that the 
court will set the date for arguments and for the hearing. It is up to 
the court to decide, during the coming weeks.
<P>
	I would like to add that there was no intended provocation on our 
part in suggesting June 23. We need time between now and next 
June to prepare, and we intend to do everything necessary to 
prepare.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, </B><B>BQ):</B> 
Once again, Mr. Speaker, the facts are being distorted.
<P>
	As I have mentioned in my preamble, at 8.30 this morning, as 
they were going into cabinet, three ministers defended this date. 
However, when the government lawyers set out for the Supreme 
Court, they received a counter-order. Between 8.30 and 9 o'clock, 
cabinet changed its mind and the government lawyers were asked 
to withdraw the June 23 date. What the judge said was this: ``That 
is a good decision, because it really is up to me. You should consult 
with all the provinces to find out which ones wish to make a 
contribution. At a time that suits everyone, when we know who 
wishes to take part in the debate, we will all sit down and we in the 
Supreme Court will set a date in consultation with all parties 
concerned, according to our schedule''. This was what was actually 
said this morning by the Supreme Court.
<P>
	I therefore ask the Minister of Justice to explain why they 
changed their mind between 8.30 and 9 o'clock, if it was not 
because the editorials, the hot lines and the whole world opened 
their eyes to the fact that it was provocation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member speaks of 
provocation. What we are interesting in doing is resolving legal 
issues that are raised by the position of the Government of Quebec 
in relation to the application of the Constitution toward its desire to 
separate that province from the rest of the country.
<P>
	Provocation is hardly the word one would use for a government 
that seeks a court date to determine issues of fundamental legal and 
constitutional importance to all Canadians but particularly to 
Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is in the interests of Quebecers in particular to resolve these 
issues, to clarify the consequences of the position taken by the 
Quebec government and to determine the legal issues that arise.
<P>
	It is in the interest of Quebecers in particular to avoid chaos after 
a unilateral declaration of independence. It is because of the 
position taken by the Government of Quebec that we have made a 
reference.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in life there are no chance occurrences, only coincidences. 
And one must be able to read, analyse and interpret these 
coincidences. The government selected June 23 and then, this 
morning, changed its mind.
<P>
	Once again, are we looking at a government that is at the mercy 
of mandarins who suggested that it be June 23, or will the 
government have the courage to tell us that it alone took the 
decision, and that it is therefore the prime mover in everything that 
is now going on?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member tries to make 
something out of very little.
<P>
	The indignation that comes from this episode is very difficult to 
accept. The hon. member speaks of provocation and humiliation 
and I suppose we should take it that the hon. member and her party 
know what that is all about.
<P>
	We saw it during this past week with a display by the bloquistes 
and their partners in the Government of Quebec, the kind of 
political humiliation and provocation of which they speak, when 
they set out to destroy Jean-Louis Roux, the lieutenant-governor of 
Quebec. They used tactics that have no place in Canadian politics. 
That is the kind of provocation we should avoid in public life.
<P>
	If we want to start somewhere to avoid provocation, I suggest 
that the Bloc Quebecois and the hon. member cease and desist with 
tactics such as that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it would appear that the Minister of Justice is a master at 
provocation. I would submit that the official opposition is a master 
at showing respect for the people of Quebec.
<P>
	What explanation can there be for the decision to choose June 
23, with its obvious political repercussions? How could the 
government make that decision without considering the impact of 
such a provocation?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6310"> 6310 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out first of 
all that we are not the ones who will choose the date, the Supreme 
Court of Canada will choose the date of the hearing.
<P>
	As for the question of provocation, it is the Government of 
Quebec itself which has provoked questions, which has said that 
neither the courts nor the Constitution have anything to do with the 
issue of sovereignty. That is where the provocation lies.
<P>
	We have acted on behalf of all Canadians, including all the 
people of Quebec, in asking questions before the courts so as to 
regulate, clarify, determine the legality of these important 
questions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we acknowledge that the Supreme Court has exercised 
great good judgment in rejecting the government's choice ofJune 23.
<P>
	Might this government provocation in the constitutional issue, 
which appears to have had its origins with employees in the 
Department of Justice, not be explained by the fact that their ranks 
also include supporters of the hard line, of plan B?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was my experience as an 
advocate in the courtroom that when one of the parties was 
completely without confidence in his or her position on the merits 
of the case, he or she would resort to tactics such as complaining 
about the date for hearing in order to distract attention from that 
weak position.
<P>
	What we are witnessing in the House today is exactly that 
syndrome. Left completely without any argument on the merits of 
the case, finding themselves in a position that is untenable legally, 
the members of the Bloc Quebecois have resorted to the selection 
of the hearing date as a ground on which to resist this initiative 
which is intended to clarify and resolve legal questions that they 
themselves have raised.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I suggest this is conclusive evidence of the falsity of their 
position in the law.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
16,000 jobs are on the line as Canadian Airlines attempts to 
restructure the company.
<P>
	The so-called official opposition says that we should merely let 
Canadian go, that there is only room for one national airline in 
Canada. That simply is not acceptable. I am sure the minister 
agrees that is not an option for the Canadian airline system.
<P>
	We are not sure, though, exactly what options or ideas the 
minister has brought to the table in his talks with the airline. Would 
he detail for the House what plans, options or proposals he has 
made to Canadian Airlines to help it in its restructuring plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly agree with the hon. member's comments with 
respect to the importance of Canadian Airlines International, our 
second largest carrier. It is very important to the government's 
competition policy, which has had such a dramatic effect in 
reducing the costs of travel in Canada and increasing the number of 
Canadians who travel.
<P>
	With respect to the second part of the hon. member's question, it 
is not possible for this or any other government simply to continue 
to cover losses of a company that has had a chronic problem of 
losses. What must happen is restructuring to place that company on 
a profitable, competitive footing so that it can expand beyond the 
16,000 jobs which have been created by Canadian Airlines 
International.
<P>
	The plan of restructuring involves a number of elements, for 
example, changing the contract with American, changing the 
routing structure, making use of Vancouver's hub, increasing the 
Asian routes and the open skies routes with the United States, 
adjusting salaries and wages, as well as other measures. We want to 
make sure that plan has a fair chance.
<P>
	I know it is difficult for the employees, but we want them to be 
able to vote on that plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad to hear that the government knows and is concerned about 
the 16,000 jobs that are at stake in the restructuring of Canadian 
Airlines. I believe that Canadian Airlines is doing its part. It is 
aggressively attempting to restructure everything from its debt to 
its service contracts.
<P>
	However, the minister also knows that the government is 
intimately involved in the Canadian airline industry. It is involved 
in everything from fuel tax rates, which are some 30 per cent higher 
than our American competitors, to regulatory regimes and so on. 
All of this plays a part in any restructuring plan. The company 
cannot do it all on its own. The government will be, by necessity, 
involved in whatever changes come to be.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us what options he is considering on the 
open skies treaty and on the taxation policy? What are some of the 
specifics he is offering to Canadian and its employees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is not a situation where we are offering to any one 
particular company some special deal, not at all. What we are 
trying to do is make sure there is competition in the industry and 
that the players are treated as fairly as possible by the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6311"> 6311 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member's colleague, the hon. 
member for Calgary Centre, who stated recently that a government 
bailout does not appear to be a viable option. With that I agree 
wholeheartedly.
<P>
	We want to put Canadian back in the business of being a 
profitable company, creating new jobs and expanding 
internationally and domestically as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask a supplementary question of the Minister of 
Labour.
<P>
	Canadian Airlines is trying to restructure and would like to take 
some of its proposals directly to the Canadian employees for their 
evaluation. While it is up to Canadian Airlines to convince its 
employees of the merits of any restructuring plan, the union 
leadership still refuses to let its members vote directly on any 
company offer. Even after the union leadership divided on the 
question it will not allow its employees the chance to vote on any 
restructuring plan.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Labour intervene to free up employees of 
Canadian Airlines to ensure their democratic right to determine 
their opinion on the restructuring plan and will he ensure that they 
have the right to vote on any restructuring offer by Canadian 
Airlines?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I completely agree that the employees of Canadian should 
have the right to vote on their future and on the restructuring 
program that has been proposed by Mr. Benson, the CEO of 
Canadian Airlines. It is their right and opportunity. It is a difficult 
decision. They have been asked for sacrifices previously. In no way 
do I wish to influence their vote one way or another, but they 
should have that right.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	It is unacceptable to us to have a decision made by 300 people, I 
understand, in Toronto. There are 6,000 to 7,000 employees of that 
company in Vancouver and 6,000 to 7,000 in Calgary. That type of 
approach is simply unacceptable to us.
<P>
	We want to make sure that the actual employees who are affected 
by this plan have the opportunity of expressing their views. That 
seems to be only fair. I certainly implore the leaders of the 
machinists and the Canadian Auto Workers to allow this element of 
democracy to take place.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Today, Rwanda opposed France's participation in plans for 
intervention by the international community. Meanwhile, more 
than 13,000 people have died since the beginning of the conflict, 
and hundreds of thousands of refugees are in danger of dying in 
eastern Zaire. Deprived of help for more than two weeks, they are 
cut off from the outside world by the rebels, who prevent 
humanitarian organizations from reaching their region.
<P>
	Since Kigali is opposed to France's participation but would look 
positively on an Euro-African military mission, could the minister 
tell us whether a proposal of this kind is being considered?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I share the tremendous concern of the hon. 
member over the tragic situation in Zaire and the great lakes 
region. Today, the UN Security Council is considering several 
proposals for a cease fire in the region.
<P>
	As you know, a ceasefire is the only way to ensure that 
humanitarian aid can be safely delivered to these regions. The 
Canadian position is to support the efforts of ambassador Chrétien 
and also to encourage all parties to submit plans to the UN and the 
Security Council for a security program in the region and also for 
expanding humanitarian aid as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the aid professionals sounded the alarm, saying 
they needed action, not words. People are dying like flies in Zaire.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, if the international community 
continues to wait and see, there will be a real slaughter, and that, in 
the circumstances, considering the humanitarian emergency, the 
only solution may be to consider military intervention on short 
notice?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly we agree fully that the potential for disaster is 
imminent.
<P>
	The latest report is that there are still supplies available in the 
region. The major difficulty faced is finding a secure environment 
so that they can be delivered. That has to come about through 
political agreement at the international level.
<P>
	I disagree with the premise of the hon. member that there is no 
action. As I just pointed out, we have the engagement of 
Ambassador Chrétien on behalf of the Secretary-General. He is in 
the region at this moment meeting with leaders and attempting to 
forge some form of consensus.
<P>
	The Security Council is considering a number of proposals 
today. We hope by the latter part of the day to have an indication of 
the initiative by the United Nations. It is something that has to take 
place. There is no magic wand. There is no panacea. There has to 
be an agreement by the international community on a course of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6312"> 6312 </A></B>
<P>
action. At that time, all members of the United Nations will 
consider how they can participate.
<P>
	We are trying to get that agreement through the efforts of 
Ambassador Chrétien, by the diplomatic efforts at the UN and by 
the special efforts that Canada is making to try to influence and 
persuade the Rwandans, in particular, to agree to the return of the 
refugees.
<P>
	Those are the necessary conditions. We are working as actively 
as possible to get that agreement. I hope we can get it soon so that 
we can continue to go on with the kind of aid the hon. member 
would like to see happen.

my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In spite of all his posturing and the government's attempt to pull 
the wool over our eyes, the unemployment rate in Canada has 
reached the 10 per cent psychological threshold. I will not call for a 
minute of silence, but I will remind the House that the OECD had 
forecasted a 2.1 per cent increase in employment, one of the 
highest in the world, according to the government. However, since 
the beginning of the year, in the past 10 months, the average 
increase in employment has been only 1.1 per cent, barely half 
what had ben forecasted.

of thousands of jobs necessary to reach its goals according to the 
OECD's forecast?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the slight increase in the unemployment rate in October is due to

recovery.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that, in fact, that same month the private 
sector created 46,000 jobs, a rather significant number. Moreover, 
since the beginning of the year, nearly 200,000 new jobs have been 
created in the private sector certainly thanks to the climate of 
confidence due in part to the government's agenda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
listen to our colleagues opposite, one would think that everything is 
going well in Canada. And yet, we know that last month the youth 
unemployment rate climbed again, reaching the official critical 
threshold of 16.8 per cent. Moreover, everybody knows that this is 
only the tip of the iceberg.
<P>
	Will the minister finally acknowledge that the measures put in 
place by the government for young people are a totally failure and 
far from meeting its goals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
clearly, we are all very concerned by the level of unemployment 
affecting our young people. As a matter of fact, it is a problem 
common to every country, including the United States where the 
job creation rate is rather impressive, I might add.
<P>
	This is why, in the last budget, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development introduced a significant job creation program aimed 
at young people. We doubled the funds earmarked for the creation 
<P>

of summer jobs for  young people. We have on-the-job training

creation for young people, and we will continue to do so.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister for International Trade blamed the forestry 
industry for the job losses caused by this government's caving into 
the American lumber lobby.
<P>
	Blaming the industry is absolutely inexcusable. This government 
negotiated a bad softwood lumber deal with the Americans and 
now it does not have the backbone to admit that this government, 
not the industry, is the cause of the loss of thousands of sawmill 
jobs in B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	The Liberals ran on a platform of job creation, yet now with 
thousands of sawmill workers losing their jobs they refuse to show 
leadership to rectify the situation.
<P>
	What is the minister going to do now to ensure that these 
sawmills remain in operation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the preamble is entirely wrong. I certainly do 
not blame the industry. In fact, the industry has been most 
co-operative. However, there are some companies within the 
industry that have tried to take advantage of the fact that prices 
have been high and have used all their quota up and are now 
coming and crying to us about needing more quota. However, they 
knew what the rules were because the industry and the provincial 
governments were the biggest participants in setting out the rules.
<P>
	In fact, today we made public the entire list of rules that the 
industry presented to us, the quota details by province. I am happy 
to table them and make them available.
<P>
	The industry wanted this deal and in fact helped set the rules. We 
have bargained with the United States the kind of agreement it 
wanted, to give it protection for five years from countervail from 
the United States. It is a good deal. It is just that all of companies, 
not just most of them, have to comply by the rules that they were a 
big contributor toward setting and not cry about them, as the 
member is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would invite the minister to tell the families out of work what a 
good deal this is. They tend to disagree and disagree strongly.
<P>
	The reason for the losses of thousands of jobs is not that the 
lumber mills overproduced, as the minister said, but that the quotas 
allotted to those mills came in at far below expected levels.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister refused to table a full list of quota 
allocations for the mills all across the country. I suspect the reason 
for the secrecy is that in this way only the minister and his staff 
know the whole picture. There is a large unallocated portion of the 
quota sitting in this minister's pockets.
<P>
	It appears that the minister is refusing to disclose the entire 
allocation list because he wants to reward his Liberal friends with 
the unallocated-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member should not impute 
motive. I would ask the hon. member to go directly to his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the minister avoid 
the secrecy and table the allocation documents in this House now.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said a few moments ago, even before he 
asked the question, we tabled all the information relevant to how 
the allocation was arrived at and what the allocations are per 
province.
<P>
	In terms of the individual companies, it is up to them as to 
whether they want to divulge their figures.
<P>
	Let me say, because jobs are very important, that some of the 
companies have known full well what the formula is and that a 
great amount of the basis for the formula has been their past 
experience and they know what their past exporting is. However, 
they have chosen to rush the border and thereby create a problem 
for their employees. I am sorry that some of them have done that 
because that is outside what the industry wanted to have happen.
<P>
	Notwithstanding that, there are two things they can do. They can 
continue to ship. It is a question of what is free quota. They can 
continue to ship and pay the quota fees. There is nothing stopping 
them from doing that. Further, we have provided for a very small 
quota bank so that we can help these firms if they are-

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister said he could consider relaxing the rules 
to allow American Airlines to acquire a bigger share of Canadian. 
He said he was waiting for an application before reviewing the 
matter. However, yesterday, the Canadian Auto Workers who 
represent 4,000 employees from Canadian International urged the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6314"> 6314 </A></B>
<P>
federal government to relax foreign investment rules so that 
American Airlines could buy a bigger share.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Can the minister give us the assurance that if the rules are 
relaxed he would give Air Canada equal access to destinations 
currently served by Canadian International, thus putting an end to 
its partisan patronage in favour of a company which will be getting 
more and more americanized?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member may have misunderstood what I said 
yesterday. The government policy has not changed. No decision 
has been made. There is no review concerning the participation of 
an American company in the airline industry, none at all.
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned CAW. No American company 
has made an application to invest or increase its investments in 
Canadian International. This is a purely hypothetical issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at least, the 
minister was not being hypothetical when he clearly stated 
yesterday that he did not intend to provide financial assistance to 
Canadian International.
<P>
	However, we were told that his government awarded an 
extension of 30 days for the repayment of a loan granted in 1992. Is 
the minister about to financially assist Canadian International, by 
giving it an extension of 30 days to repay the money it owes the 
federal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has an incredible imagination.
<P>
	What we said was that we had absolutely no intention of 
investing in Canadian International. The reason is obvious: this 
company which has incurred losses year after year is in need of 
some restructuring. The structure of the company needs to be 
changed, its contracts with American Airlines need to be changed, 
its routes need to be changed, and a lot of other things need to be 
changed before this company can begin to show a profit.
<P>
	This is what I want to tell the hon. member. We mentioned no 
investment from the Canadian government. We have have received 
no application for an increase in American investments. No amount 
of Canadian or American money could help a company faced with 
structural problems.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, our Liberal friends are continuing to cosy up to China. 
Last week the defence minister gave Chinese generals special tours 
of our military bases and today Canadians were shocked to learn 
that the government is ignoring its own environmental laws and 
providing interest free loans to sell CANDU reactors.
<P>
	Behind closed doors cabinet has jigged the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act to allow this sale.
<P>
	Instead of scrapping Canada's environmental laws to benefit 
China, should Canada not urge China to change its laws?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, we are not providing any interest 
free loan. This is a regular commercial operation. In fact, AECL is 
expected to make money on it. One hundred Canadian companies 
will profit from this. It will mean some 27,000 person years in 
employment.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	With respect to the environment there is absolutely no 
diminishing of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. That 
act was never intended to apply to the Export Development 
Corporation's commercial financing operations in foreign 
countries, and so it does not apply.
<P>
	Over the years that AECL has produced the CANDU-6 reactor, it 
has done a great deal of environmental work on it and in fact it is 
the safest, most reliable, most environmentally efficient nuclear 
reactor in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the government is breaking its own  environmental 
laws and its red book promises on the environment. The red book 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6315"> 6315 </A></B>
<P>
promised to strengthen the enforcement of the Environmental 
Protection Assessment Act.
<P>
	Instead, behind closed doors the government is violating and 
changing its own environmental review requirements. Is ignoring 
environmental review laws what the government had in mind when 
it promised in 1993 to protect the environment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have greatly protected the environment by 
putting this act into effect. It was never intended to apply to foreign 
projects funded by the Export Development Corporation.
<P>
	We have said that when there is an international environmental 
agreement with respect to standards, yes, we would want to be a 
part of that and we have promoted that very thing. We are not going 
to in an extraterritorial way, like some countries do, apply our law 
against another country. We continue to do all we can to protect the 
environment and have the most environmentally friendly products 
in terms of other countries, and that is what this CANDU-6 reactor 
is.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	On Wednesday, the minister admitted that the tax convention 
between Canada and the United States was unfair to low-income 
pensioners by depriving them of 25 per cent of their American 
pensions.
<P>
	While waiting for the results of negotiations with the Americans, 
would the minister be willing to consider the net income rather than 
the gross income to determine income supplement eligibility so 
that low-income earners are less penalized by this convention?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
the member knows, this problem has not arisen as a result of the 
Canada-United States tax convention, but as a result of action taken 
unilaterally by the American government. I think we all agree that 
we need to continue to put pressure on the Americans because 
some people have certainly been treated unfairly as a result of this 
action.
<P>
	We are negotiating with the Americans. In fact, on election day, I 
discussed this issue with my American counterpart. I think the best 
thing is to pursue these negotiations. We are not making progress as 
fast as we would like, but we are indeed making progress.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, even though the minister keeps saying that it is the 
Americans' fault, it does not change the fact that Canadians are the 
victims of this unfortunate situation.
<P>
	Is the minister willing to ask a special parliamentary committee 
to propose to him, by December 1, 1996, temporary solutions to 
rectify the situation until negotiations with the Americans lead to a 
permanent solution?

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
very much appreciate that there are members on all sides of this

negotiations with the Americans the ability of the government to 
say that we speak with the virtual unanimity of this House gives us 
a very strong card to play.

	The one thing I would not want to do is anything that would slow 
these negotiations down. Under those circumstances I think we are 
far better to continue with the course of action with which we are 
now engaged.

	Yes, we do acknowledge and recognize that hunting represents 
not only an important and traditional pastime, but also an important 
source of revenue and an economic activity in many parts of this

any way with the enjoyment by Canadians of hunting as a sport and 
a pastime.

their interests in mind as we put the final touches on the 
regulations, including the fees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, contrary to what the minister says, a firearms 
manufacturer in Ontario states that his present fees are $850. 
Yesterday the justice minister proposed fees that would cost that 
company $242,000. Today the justice minister lowered it to 
$15,000, still over 15 times its present level. This new export tax 
will force some of the manufacturer's employees out of work.
<P>
	What does the justice minister have to say to that manufacturer? 
Exactly how will he keep his promise not to hurt the firearms 
industry, sports shooters, hunters, collectors and tourism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

information which bears the usual degree of unreliability when it 
comes from him and his colleagues.
<P>
	We have not yet tabled the regulations. We have not yet tabled 
the fees, yet the hon. member is quoting numbers which I take it are 
intended to inflame passions and as usual to groundlessly frighten 
people.
<P>
	When Canadians want advice, direction or policy about firearms 
in this country, they know where to look. They look to this 
government for sensible approaches.
<P>
	It is clear where the Reform Party has come from. One of its 
riding association presidents in Alberta is Mr. Tomlinson, the 
president of the National Firearms Association. The national chair 
of the gun lobby is a riding president for the Reform Party. I think

	People who live in co-operative housing in Peterborough are 
concerned about the government's plans for social housing. They 
are particularly concerned about the future of co-op housing across

assure me and my constituents that the federal government is not 
abandoning social housing in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

yes, this government is offering management of social housing to 
the provinces and territories. However I want to assure the hon. 
member that we are not backing away from our social housing 
commitments.
<P>
	Currently this government pays about $2 billion toward social 
housing which will be maintained. Moreover, there will be savings 
from the consolidation of management of social housing and those 
savings must be kept within the social housing envelope. That is 
over and above the $2 billion.
<P>
	I am glad the hon. member raised the issue of the co-ops. This

role in social housing. That role will not be overlooked and it will

Chair, the proper procedure is that we seek unanimous consent for 
me to move the motion today. I would ask that the Chair seek 
unanimous consent that the member for St. Albert, being myself, 
move the motion in lieu of the member for Kingston and the 
Islands because he is in the Chair.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Does the hon. member for 
St. Albert have the unanimous consent of the House to propose the 
motion standing in the name of the member for Kingston and the 
Islands on today's Order Paper? Is that agreed?

<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in relation to the Orders of Reference adopted by the Senate on March 21, 
1996 and on June 19, 1996, and by the House of Commons on March 12, 1996 and

<BLOCKQUOTE>That a message be sent to the Senate requesting that House to unite with this 
House for these purposes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while we are 
certainly going to support this motion and give the committee the 
extra time in order to table its report, I would like to take this 
occasion to say just a few things about this topic and about the 
process.
<P>
	It is very important for us to recognize what is going on in our 
House of Commons, the place where we make rules for the 
Canadian people, where we pass legislation and where we 
administer on behalf of the people of this great country the money 
they send us in trust as taxpayers. We are managing their affairs.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Referring to the incoming Trudeau regime in 1968, Grattan 
O'Leary said: ``So far we have had nothing but props and music. 
The curtain goes up and the play never begins''. That comment is 
true here as well.
<P>
	We have talked a lot about ethics. It was a large portion of the 
debate during the campaign of 1993. It comes up very frequently in 
the House. Frequently the Prime Minister and other ministers of the 
crown, as well as government members, rise in the House and say 
over and over again: ``We never do anything wrong''. The Prime 
Minister bragged just yesterday: ``I have not had any ministers 
resign''.
<P>
	It is a point of great consternation to us that in fact there now 
seems to be even lower standards than there were under the Tory 
regime of Mr. Mulroney.
<P>
	When the Liberals took power one of the things they said in the 
infamous red book was that Canadians had come to distrust their 
government and they wanted to trust it again. The Liberals were 
able to garner a lot of votes because people wanted to trust 
government. In the red book, in the campaign literature and in the 
campaign speeches the Liberals repeatedly promised that there 
would be a new level of trust, that members of Parliament, cabinet 
ministers and, indeed, even senators would no longer be able to 
look after themselves, that they would have an obligation to deal 
ethically, correctly and honestly with the people who they deal with 
on behalf of taxpayers and that there would be no more of these 
shenanigans that Canadians had come to dislike in the previous 
government.
<P>
	Today I want to point out emphatically that there is a lot of talk 
about ethics. I also want to emphasize just as emphatically that the 
talk is empty. The ethical behaviour that we had expected has not 
been delivered.
<P>
	I remember back in 1984 that we were delighted because the 
member of Parliament for the constituency which included Elk 
Island was a member of the Tory party which had formed the 
government. Finally the Conservatives had won. We knew that it 
would be a great advantage, or so we thought, to send to Ottawa a 
member of the governing party.
<P>
	A scant nine years later the hope that was enjoyed by 
Conservatives right across the country had evaporated. Primarily it 
evaporated because of questionable behaviour and ethics.
<P>
	The same thing is happening with the Liberal government. It 
came to power promising to do things better and to solve the ethics 
problem so that once again Canadians would be able to trust their 
government. We need to look at what has actually happened.
<P>
	I endorse the work of the committee. One of the reasons I am in 
favour of the motion to postpone for two weeks is so we can do a 
better job, a thorough job, instead of meeting a timeline. Of course 
that is important, but it should be the secondary goal. The first goal 
should be to do it well and the second goal should be to be timely. I 
would rather do it very well and have it two weeks late, as this 
motion proposes.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	One of the promises of the Liberals, and I mention it often in the 
House, was the promise of an ethics counsellor. The present ethics 
counsellor is a man who, as far as we know, has an untarnished 
reputation. He is, to the very best of his ability, doing the job to 
which he has been called. Unfortunately he has tremendous 
strictures on his position. He is not independent as the red book 
promised. The Prime Minister has made the ethics counsellor 
answerable to him only.
<P>
	One of the purposes of postponing the work of the committee 
must be to assure that there is a counsellor, an ethics watchdog if 
you like, who will be quite independent of the political realm. That 
is the flaw in the present system. It is deemed much more important 
by the Prime Minister that there be an appearance of doing things 
right rather than actually doing them right.
<P>
	Over and over again we see the political damage control team 
swing into action. All sorts of different tactics are used to persuade 
the people that nothing is wrong when in fact the simple and 
obvious remedy is not implemented. That remedy is to provide 
adequate disclosure. Let us lay the facts out before the people. Let 
us lay them out before the press. Let us lay the facts out before the 
opposition. The facts will speak for themselves. We do not need to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6319"> 6319 </A></B>
<P>
have a large public relations campaign. We do not need a damage 
control team if all we are doing is dealing in facts.
<P>
	I would like to have a couple of things that are very important to 
us included in a code of ethics and I hope that our code will have 
them. One of them is that the person who oversees questions of 
ethics will be totally removed from any implication even of being 
part of the damage control team.
<P>
	In the case most recently before Parliament that appears to be so 
evident. That is very unfortunate because of the fact that, first, the 
ethics counsellor is restricted in what he can ask, what he can do 
and what he can investigate, and second, he is restricted in what he 
can say. If the ethnics counsellor were truly independent, as the 
auditor general is now, he could say what he wants because he 
would say what he actually finds. He would put the truth on the 
record and there would be no attempt to try to hide it or to cover it 
up.
<P>
	We need an ethics counsellor who is truly independent, totally 
removed from the political realm of this place.
<P>
	The next thing we need is adequate disclosure. It is 
unconscionable for us as MPs and as senators, as people who are 
governing the country, to not be willing to put on the public record 
any facts and figures that may be relevant to a discussion. We need 
openness. We need to correct things that prevent the people from 
knowing the truth in a situation.
<P>
	We need to make sure that when we have conflicting rules, for 
example, the Access to Information Act conflicting with 
accountability to the Treasury Board, we need to make sure that in 
those instances that the priority is honesty, openness and 
accountability. Everything should be laid on the table. If something 
is wrong it needs to be corrected.
<P>
	In this House we are only allowed to call each other honourable 
members. I believe that by far the majority of us are. I would like to 
think that all of us are. However, just being forced to say the word 
``honourable'' does not necessarily make it so.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Many years ago when I was a kid I taught high school. I had 
students who were just a little younger than I and we had a 
discussion one day on whether they should respect me. As high 
school students sometimes do, they challenge authority. I 
remember that the discussion went to a level where we agreed on 
two things. The first one was that a certain amount of respect was 
inherent in the position because they were the students and I was 
the teacher. Because of that relationship there would be a certain 
amount of initial respect granted.
<P>
	However, they quickly told me, and I agreed with them, that 
respect also had to be earned and demonstrated. As a teacher in 
mathematics I had to  demonstrate to them that I knew my subject. 
I had to demonstrate to them that I knew how to teach and 
communicate it so that I could improve their knowledge of the 
subject.
<P>
	The same thing is true here. I travel to various parts of the 
country and to my home riding. Some people seem to take a great 
deal of pleasure in being able to introduce their member of 
Parliament. They give us all a certain amount of respect which is 
very humbling actually when one stops to think about it. They do 
that because they expect us to be honest and open.
<P>
	However, when a member of the House or the other place 
engages in activities or involves himself or herself in behaviour 
which does not reflect that honour, truthfulness, openness and 
accountability then the words become empty. Though they may 
still introduce us with an air of respect, the actual respect will 
disappear if we do not demonstrate it.
<P>
	The essence of my little intervention is that while we wait for the 
ethics committee to table its report, I believe that there is much 
more involved here than simply giving the appearance again of 
doing something about ethics. Just repeating over and over again 
that we are ethical is not going to produce ethical behaviour. It is 
only going to happen if we have inherently a predisposition to 
doing things correctly and honestly. If we have a mechanism in 
place that will clearly and succinctly point out to the Canadian 
public when one of us goes wrong, let us be honest and open and 
put it all out on the table and let the truth prevail.
<P>
	I am not content with my participation in this ethics committee 
to simply go through yet another exercise in the whole public 
relations work of this government or any other government in 
trying simply to improve the appearance of being a highly ethical 
party or a highly ethical government or whatever it is. I am not 
content with it. I will not be content until it actually is ethical, 
honest and above reproach. That ought to be our ever-seeking goal.
<P>
	I cannot emphasize strongly enough that the Prime Minister has 
spoken often about his own secret code of ethics that applies to 
ministers. Over the last two and a half to three years he has made 
frequent references to it. The other day in the House he said that the 
ministers have seen it and read it. However, one cannot read 
something that does not exist either on paper, a television screen or 
somewhere. It has to be a document of some sort if one is going to 
read it.
<P>
	Now we are finding that perhaps there is serious doubt as to 
whether or not this code actually exists. I do not in any way want to 
show any disrespect to the Prime Minister of this wonderful 
country. However, I believe that he must give an example of 
honesty, openness and truthfulness which is just beyond reproach 
among Canadians. I seriously doubt that is happening right now 
because of this blight on his record. He is saying that he has this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6320"> 6320 </A></B>
<P>
code of ethics and he is not willing to show any evidence of its 
actual existence. Then he says that this code is a higher standard 
than that which is out there and available to Canadians and 
parliamentarians.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	We have found over and over that even the code which exists is 
not being enforced. We have numerous instances of people clearing 
breaking existing guidelines. We have had several ministers who 
have written to quasi-judicial bodies against regulations.
<P>
	In the previous government when that happened these people 
were forced immediately to resign. That is incredible. That was in 
the previous Mulroney government. They were at least honest 
enough to admit that they had done wrong and resign.
<P>
	This Prime Minister is so proud of being able to say ``none of my 
ministers has resigned'' that he is closing eyes to the facts. There 
have been ministers who have breached these very codes but his 
inability or his unwillingness to take action has resulted in his 
being able to say no ministers have done anything wrong and so 
they have not resigned. The truth is on the other hand which says 
they have done something wrong and the fact is no action has been 
taken.
<P>
	We have this recent case of the minister for youth. I cannot help 
but really feel bad for her and for this situation. What an anguish. I 
regret that this government and this Prime Minister have so little 
accountability and so little conscience that they will let her hang 
because of this. Where were the people who were to have instructed 
her on what was right and what was wrong? Where are the people 
in the department who she said in her statement never told her that 
what she was doing was wrong? That is not acceptable.
<P>
	I have a certain degree of sympathy for this minister. She 
unfortunately is the latest example of people who are breaking 
these ethical guidelines and rules and nothing is being done about 
it.
<P>
	Here is a case which illustrates perfectly my thesis that we need 
to put the truth on the table. If in fact what she is saying is right and 
true then it is perfectly in order for her to table those facts in this 
House. She could show them to me, she could show them to the 
press. Let the facts prevail. Hey, there it is all out in the open.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister said we have this tradition that 
when someone says something we just accept it without checking. 
We accept it without looking. The Reform Party is ready to do 
things differently. We say there is openness, accountability and 
when a person says something we will begin by saying they are 
hon. members and we trust them but when it is demonstrated and 
proven then the trust is built and the trust is established. That is all 
we are asking.
<P>
	In this instance either the minister is stating what is correct, in 
which case it should be demonstrated, or she is stating something 
which is not correct, as we suspect, because the numbers do not add 
up. There are too many blank spaces. We want to get to the root of 
this. That is we want.
<P>
	Again the Prime Minister is bragging. He says nobody ever does 
anything wrong. He has the gall to accuse us in this House of 
breaking the parliamentary tradition to accept what the government 
says without questioning it.
<P>
	I am ready to question it. I am here on behalf of Canadian 
taxpayers and when there is even the appearance of a minister of 
this government's not using taxpayer funds correctly, I and the 
members of the Reform Party are here to hold them to account. 
That is what ethics is all about and that is what we are going to do.
<P>
	I am emphatically stating here that my goal and my purpose in 
saying let us give this committee two more weeks is that those 
types of issues can be addressed.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	We can have built into these ethical guidelines the fact that there 
will be openness. There is one thing we must definitely have. No 
minister should be able to hide behind privacy when they bring 
these types of things into the public domain by using public money 
for this type of expenditure. That is only an example, which I 
would like to state again. We have had others. There have been 
several other ministers.
<P>
	It is wrong to simply put out the image of everything being right. 
Let us strive for the facts of the case, the truth of the case. That is 
the definition of ethical behaviour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree that 
we should have ethical standards to mark our own conduct to see 
whether we are at times meeting those standards. There is no 
question.
<P>
	Not only cabinet ministers but all members of this House should 
be functioning according to a high ethical standard in our dialogue 
and our interchanges with one another. Most Canadians would 
expect such a standard from members of Parliament. I want to 
bring to the attention of the House that this has not happened during 
the time of my service in this House.
<P>
	Just yesterday the chair of the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs indicated that she wanted to speak to me outside 
the room. When I obliged and attended I was accosted with 
inaccurate accusations. Filthy language was directed at me in a 
manner that was far below the ethical standards of members of this 
House. What course do we have to deal with that? What course do 
we have to respond to that kind of interchange when that kind of 
thing occurs?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6321"> 6321 </A></B>
<P>
	We need standards of ethics by which all members can conduct 
themselves so that we will never be accused of functioning in a 
manner that is below the standard that is expected by the people 
who have elected us and sent us to this House to do their business, 
so we can conduct the affairs as elected representatives of the 
people.
<P>
	I believe that if we do establish a clear standard of ethics for 
cabinet ministers we can look on those standards as a guide for us 
all. Would the member for Elk Island agree that it might benefit all 
members of this House to create a standard we could all measure 
ourselves against and, if necessary, measure the actions of other 
hon. members from time to time, when need be?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Crowfoot is right on 
here.
<P>
	This is what we must have for all Canadians. It is how our 
society operates in an orderly and functional way. We have rules. 
We have rules to control our behaviour on the highway and in many 
other areas. There are two things every citizen needs to know and 
there are two things every member of this House needs to know. 
First, we need to know what the rules are. That is the first function 
of the law, to make sure people know what behaviour is allowed. 
And so the ethics code that will be produced will apply to members 
of Parliament, to minister of the crown and to members of the other 
place. The first function is to inform.
<P>
	The second function of the law is certainly that it is to be used as 
a measuring stick and to provide for means of holding people 
accountable.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	I refer to Canadians in general. We in the House of Commons are 
commoners. We represent the wider population. We need in this 
House a set of rules and regulations, a code of conduct which 
clearly sets out what behaviour is unacceptable and what is 
desirable, as the member for Crowfoot has said.
<P>
	The second role of the law is of course to hold accountable those 
who would not live by the code of conduct. As a lawyer, I am sure 
Mr. Speaker knows the rules full well. It is not acceptable in the 
House that we have rules which are not published. How do we 
know whether a person is in breach of a regulation unless we know 
about them?
<P>
	Some are available to us, but the Prime Minister's phantom 
secret code is not. That is not acceptable. We need to have a way of 
holding accountable those who would breach the standards. That, 
of course, is the role of the a code of conduct. I certainly concur 
that we need that. It should set out more than just minimum 
behaviour. It should have a broad spectrum of behaviour outlined 
so that members know when they have stepped across the line. If 
they know in advance, hopefully they will not do it. If they did not 
know it in advance, of course as the public in general knows, 
ignorance of the law is not an excuse, therefore it would then be 
used as a way of showing them what they should have done and 
also an example for others who remain.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to speak to this motion to explain what happened 
and why. The only reason we are debating this motion today is that 
the hon. member for Elk Island did not do his homework.
<P>
	Since the end of August, we have had a report on the work done 
by the committee. As agreed, we were supposed to present this 
document to our caucus for discussion, so that we can then go back 
to the committee and be in a position to determine what we want to 
accept or reject in this code, what we would like to see changed, 
and so forth.
<P>
	This week when we met in committee, the hon. member for Elk 
Island told us he had not read the document, so he could not discuss 
it. He was the only member at the table who had not done his 
homework. He was the only one who was prepared.
<P>
	Today, we are taking the time of the House, and we will have to 
extend debates and pay people overtime, because the House will 
have to reschedule its proceedings. The Reform Party has made a 
habit of wasting the time of this House and then complaining about 
the government's wasting money.
<P>
	Let it look at the weeds in its own backyard. He says he was not 
satisfied with the performance of the committee, but we are not 
satisfied, either, this week. When we wanted to set a date for a 
meeting, the hon. member for Elk Island was not available until the 
end of November. That is really going too far. He rises in the House 
and uses the motion that the reporting date the committee be 
extended from November 29 to December 13 as an excuse to talk 
about a case that has been the subject of questions in the House for 
almost two weeks.
<P>
	Those members who want the ``pablum'' clause, as my colleague 
from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve said so eloquently, in other words, 
who want to make 10-year old children responsible under the 
Criminal Code, instead of considering ways to make our society a 
better place, those members are not, I believe, in a position to tell 
anyone about codes of conduct.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	If he would do his job and read his documents, we would not 
have to extend the reporting date. Perhaps he did not read his 
document on purpose, so he would have a chance to discuss a 
motion and make us waste our time.
<P>
	When you want to tell the truth, you tell the whole truth. You rise 
of your seat and say: ``I agree with the extension because it was my 
fault''. You do not try to use a motion to discuss everything that is 
going: the code of conduct for ministers, the rules of conduct to the  
government, resignations under Brian Mulroney and resignations 
under the Liberals. Why not talk about resignations under Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier, while we are at it? He could go down the list of all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6322"> 6322 </A></B>
<P>
Prime Ministers who had to relieve ministers of their duties during 
the past hundred years, which would keep us busy all afternoon.
<P>
	However, I think that Reform Party members should themselves 
start behaving like responsible parliamentarians and not make us 
waste our time. We have better things to do on a Friday afternoon 
than listen to their foolishness, especially since they are 
responsible for extending the reporting date of the committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe our meeting was held in camera 
yesterday, but I want to set the record straight. What I said was that 
I had received no notice of the meeting that indicated what the 
agenda was, and so I had not brought my documents with me.
<P>
	I have, in fact, read the document. I have not finished my work 
on it, but I have read it, obviously, because we have been working 
together on it as a committee.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the member that I want this work to 
be done well. That is why I am supporting the motion. I want to be 
able to have the time to discuss it with my colleagues, which I think 
is appropriate.
<P>
	I was under the impression, because there was no meeting held 
this fall, that the committee was basically being abandoned by 
default. There was no action being taken. As a result, I have to 
admit that I was not diligent in meeting the deadline because I 
thought it would never happen. That is simply how it is. There has 
been no action on this since last June.
<P>
	With respect to the member's statement on our work as 
Reformers, yes, we do indeed want to do things right here. That is 
our goal. I am not going to be thrown off track simply by 
accusations such as this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure in your nearly 50 years on this earth that you have never 
seen such a debate as this. Although you are an experienced 
parliamentarian and an experienced person, because of your 
advancing age, I am sure you have never seen a debate like this on 
ethics in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The member for Rimouski-Témiscouata kind of went over the 
top with her concern that we are wasting the time of the House. I do 
not consider it to be a waste of time to talk about ethics. I do not 
consider it to be a waste of time to raise concerns about the ethical 
standards of the government and its failure to meet even the low 
standards which seem to have been set. I do not think it is a waste 
of time to ask questions about credit card use, about letters written 
to quasi-judicial boards, or to ask questions about the resignations 
of some ministers.
<P>
	If we want to talk about wasting time we could ask the 
government why it brought forward the debate on the speech from 
the throne yesterday, usurping even Private Members' Business. 
The speech from the throne was so overwhelmingly important to 
the government that it took up an entire day of the business of the 
House of Commons to talk about a February 1996 document which 
no one has heard about since it was tabled. That is a waste of time. 
If she wants to get excited about a waste of time, that is a good 
thing to get excited about. I did not see her complaining about it 
yesterday at all.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	It is not a waste of time to talk about ethics. It is not a waste of 
time to get it right when we are talking about ethics.
<P>
	If we want to get an ethics counsellor, an ethics control system 
and an ethics checks and balances system that works for the House 
of Commons and for Canadians it is not a waste of time to get it 
right.
<P>
	The member for Elk Island has asked if we could have a couple 
of weeks to put forward our suggestions on this. That is not a waste 
of time. The government has sat on that since June, this whole issue 
of the ethics counsellor. It has sat on this since June. It has not had 
one meeting for June, July, August, September, October. Suddenly 
the government says it would like to call a meeting together and 
run it through the House and it is all over.
<P>
	Four months of no comment is hardly a recent rehashing of the 
concerns. To claim that it does not matter now and we should just 
throw our hands up in the air and let it go, when it comes to ethical 
standards it is not good enough. We are not going to let it go. That 
is why we want to talk about the ethical standards of this 
government for a few minutes today. Even if the government is not 
listening, I think the Canadian people are.
<P>
	What has triggered this lately is only an example. I do not want 
to particularly single out one person, but obviously the minister for 
youth has been in the newspapers lately. She has been complaining 
because she has been under scrutiny, that people have been 
watching her every move, that when she uses a government credit 
card and whites out $9,000 worth of expenses, just trust her 
because they were for personal use on her government credit card.
<P>
	She has reimbursed the government. The Prime Minister says 
over some weeks and months she has reimbursed the government. 
That may be so, but if you want to use a government credit card 
issued only to cabinet members for personal use, then you can fully 
expect that we are going to ask questions about it. Members of 
Parliament do not get them. No other member of Parliament, 
government or opposition, gets a credit card; only the ministers get 
credit cards.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6323"> 6323 </A></B>

	On this idea that ``I did not have another credit card so I had 
to use the government credit card'', she has been a member of 
Parliament for eight years. She has lived in Ottawa for the last 
eight years while she has been a member of Parliament. To say 
she does not have another credit card or cannot get another credit 
card, cannot have another credit card, whatever, she has a 
government credit card and she is going to use it for personal use. 
She bought a fur coat with this stupid thing, a down payment on 
a fur coat. Pardon me, it was not a full fur coat, just the collar.

	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think we are 
completely off topic. This is not what is on the Order Paper. We 
discussed it during question period. We are discussing a committee 
report on codes of conduct. I think we are off topic and I would ask 
the chair not to allow any further reference to this question in the 
course of this debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sure the hon. whip 
for the Reform Party is seeking to make his remarks relevant to the 
motion now before the House which does deal with the extension of 
time for the report of a committee on a code of conduct for all MPs. 
I am sure he will bear in mind the need for relevance in the remarks 
he makes to the House. I know he will do that as he carries on his 
remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I am doing is I am detailing in 
lawyer terms, as you will be familiar with, an ironclad case of why 
we need an ethics counsellor and why this review, this extension of 
a couple of weeks, rather than being a waste of time, may allow the 
government or try to make the government do the right thing and 
that is to have ethnics guidelines and some advice for the ethics 
counsellor that is worth more than just the paper it is written on.
<P>
	That is why I am building this case. There are times when it is 
right for opposition members, and I would think and hope 
government members as well, to question the use and the ethics of 
their own cabinet.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	It is true that all members of Parliament have an ethical standard 
that we should adhere to, as the member for Crowfoot mentioned 
earlier. There are things that we can and cannot do. Those 
guidelines are very useful for all members of Parliament.
<P>
	Also, no doubt cabinet ministers are held to a higher standard. I 
just went over the reasons. Cabinet ministers are the only people 
who get credit cards. They are the only members of Parliament who 
get a car and a driver. They are the only members of Parliament 
who have wide ranging responsibilities from coast to coast that 
affect government policy directly by the directives they sign.
<P>
	They have a higher level of standard than members of 
Parliament generally, and so they should. The Prime Minister has 
said repeatedly that should be so.
<P>
	What I am describing here in the youth minister's case is an 
absolute, 100 per cent case of misuse of a government credit card. 
One of the ministers came forward the other day and said that 
because these were personal items she charged on her government 
credit card we had no business knowing what this was about. 
Absolutely.
<P>
	If someone uses a personal credit card for personal use it is their 
business. The privacy commissioner is right to ensure that the 
person is ensured of privacy. If someone uses a government credit 
card for personal use, then the person has lost some of that privacy. 
They have used a government credit card, a government asset and 
government privilege, available only to the cabinet, for personal 
use.
<P>
	Once that happens it should become public knowledge. I am 
disappointed that the Prime Minister seems to believe he has to 
deal with is a cabinet minister who breaks a guideline only when it 
is convenient for the government to shuffle the minister aside.
<P>
	One of the guidelines I hope will be in the report which will be 
tabled will deal with the whole access to information request. The 
way many members access information is through the access to 
information directive.
<P>
	We ask of ministers copies of their expenses, which is routinely 
done, their department expenses, things they spent money on, 
priorities of the departments and so on. It is routinely done. I 
probably tabled 100 access to information requests since being in 
Parliament.
<P>
	I hope one of the things to be dealt with in this report is why 
there is an early warning system given to cabinet minister when an 
access to information request is put in. Why do the red flags go up 
in the privy council office when there is an access to information 
request about something to do with a minister?
<P>
	In other words, instead of saying ``here is the information the 
member for Fraser Valley East has asked for'', it happens 
otherwise. People in Canada should know. It goes through the privy 
council and the privy council puts the early warning flag on it.
<P>
	It says to the minister: ``Is there something in this pot here that 
disturbs you? Do you want to know about it? Is there something 
here that will cause some trouble?'' If so, they are advised of that 
and so on. That is what happened to the former minister of defence.
<P>
	There was an access to information request put in by someone 
from the media. It went by the privy council office. ``Geepers 
creepers, sakes alive. Look at this. It could be very damaging''. It is 
brought to the attention of the Prime Minister, the minister and so 
on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6324"> 6324 </A></B>
<P>
	After they decide how they will spin it and handle it, eventually 
maybe it is handed down to the person who actually asked for the 
information.
<P>
	I hope the report when tabled will deal with that. It is only fair 
that the person asking for the information receives the information 
asked for first. They asked for it. They wanted it.
<P>
	I am not sure what the Prime Minister is thinking about by 
setting up the two standards. The minister of national defence was 
forced to resign for writing a letter to a quasi-judicial body. That is 
fair enough. Those are his guidelines. I do not know what the 
guidelines are but if those were his guideline, fair enough.
<P>
	What about the other ministers? The former Minister of 
Canadian Heritage wrote to the chair of the CRTC, a quasi-judicial 
board, endorsing a radio licence application of a constituent. Was 
that breaking the guidelines? If so, why was no action taken?
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	When Brian Tobin was minister of fisheries he wrote a letter to 
the chair of the CRTC backing francophone demands for the French 
Newsworld. He wanted it carried by Newfoundland cable 
companies so he wrote to the CRTC as a minister and asked for that 
to be done. Interfering with a quasi-judicial board got the Minister 
of National Defence fired, but Brian Tobin just becomes the 
terminator.
<P>
	The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development wrote 
to the CRTC on behalf of a temple in Toronto that applied for a 
religious TV channel. That is interfering with a quasi-judicial 
board. The minister of defence was fired for it, but it was fine for 
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to do 
that.
<P>
	I do not have it here with me today, but perhaps I will bring it 
when we come back. I will bring forward my top 10 suggestions for 
ethics guidelines for ministers since the Prime Minister does not 
seem to have any. It includes things like: Guideline No. 1, do not 
get caught. These are the tough ones. Guideline No. 2, remember 
you can fool all of the people all of the time and some of the people 
some of the time. These are tough guidelines. Another guideline is: 
Always check with Paul Desmarais. That is a good guideline.
<P>
	I do not know what the guidelines are because the Prime 
Minister will not table them. They are as imaginary as his 
imaginary friend, the one he said he visited frequently to talk about 
the problems of the homeless. You probably remember that, Mr. 
Speaker. When he was asked by a reporter where he met this 
homeless friend I think the Prime Minister's response was: ``I see, I 
said, I had, I thought, actually I don't have an imaginary friend. I 
just kind of made that up, but you caught me. Anyway, let's talk 
about something else''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's ethic guidelines that he promised are 
around somewhere have never been tabled. That would have been 
an integral part of the report that the member for Elk Island would 
have liked to have seen tabled in this House. An integral part would 
have been the guidelines, how they are processed, who are they 
responsible for, who are they accountable to, has the ethics 
counsellor even seen them.
<P>
	Watching the ethics counsellor on the news the other day I bled 
for the guy. The reporter says: ``So about these guidelines?''. The 
guy, who is digging his toe in the dirt, says: ``Well, sir, actually I 
have not seen any guidelines''. The ethics counsellor has not seen 
any guidelines. Against what standard does he judge these cabinet 
ministers? How does he enforce? What are the consequences? 
What is he doing anyway? I do not know if he gets paid for this job 
or not. Does he get paid? What does he do? Does he get up in the 
morning and watch ``Quirks and Quarks'' and then make his 
decisions? Does he consult JoJo? Perhaps he does. If JoJo is not 
available then he checks with the imaginary friend. How does he 
judge these people? There is nothing to judge them against.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not just put all this to rest, if he has 
guidelines, and table them, make it part of the report that the 
member for Elk Island would like to table in this House so that we 
can deal with it in its entirety, not some tromped up, last minute, 
drop it on the table, hope it makes it through the House guidelines 
at the last minute. It is not good enough. That is why today we need 
to talk about ethics.
<P>
	The whole problem that the government is having now is with its 
promises. Mr. Speaker, I should sometime give you my top 10 list 
of the ways that the Liberal government tries to seduce the voters, 
but I am not going to get into that today. It is not ethical perhaps at 
this time. Ethics are involved with promises made and promises 
kept. Remember what the Prime Minister said in 1993. ``There is 
not one promise that I have made that I will not keep''. He should 
have signed that GST but he did not. But he just said he would keep 
them all.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Then the excuses started. ``I cannot be expected to keep them 
all,'' says the Prime Minister. And listen to this: ``Sometimes in the 
course of a mandate you are faced with a situation where you 
cannot deliver''. That is kind of a contrast to his earlier statement. 
``You have to have some flexibility because acts of God come into 
the administration. No politician can see everything happening''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> A higher authority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Maybe when he is consulting with JoJo, he can get 
it. But otherwise he cannot see into the future.
<P>
	Imagine, acts of God interfere with the Prime Minister's ability 
to keep his promises. I wonder what that means to the Prime 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6325"> 6325 </A></B>
<P>
Minister. Is that the flood in Quebec? Now, that is an act of God. 
That is registered. No arguments made.
<P>
	But is it an act of God that the GST is still with us when the 
Liberals promised to scrap, kill and abolish it? Is that an act of 
God? When he said: ``We will work with the provinces to redesign 
the social assistance programs,'' only to find out that he moved in 
and did it unilaterally without consultation.
<P>
	Is it an act of God when he says: ``I will renegotiate the FTA and 
the NAFTA agreements. I will not sign it the way it is'' and then 
two weeks later he signed the whole thing?
<P>
	Is it an act of God when he says: ``We will develop a code of 
conduct for public officials to guide cabinet ministers and members 
of Parliament and Senators? And there is no code of conduct.
<P>
	What prevented it? What act of God? What premonition? 
Perhaps some Epiphany? What was it that came on the Prime 
Minister and touched him in such a way that he could not follow 
through with his promise of a public code of conduct for his 
cabinet? There is no excuse. It was not an act of God, it was an act 
of omission. I hope that the people watching and listening and 
keeping track will say: ``You promised, Mr. Prime Minister, when 
you said in 1993 there is not one promise you have made that you 
will not keep, judge you on you record,'' they will say: ``You 
omitted, Mr. Prime Minister, to keep your basic, ethical promise of 
a code of conduct for your cabinet''.
<P>
	It probably also applies to whips. All of us would be covered 
under this code of conduct. He has failed to deliver on that. He 
promised it. He has not given it to us. It is no wonder that the 
member for Elk Island has had to ask for an extension in order to 
get the proper code of conduct and the proper ethics highlighted for 
the benefit of all members of Parliament and especially for the 
cabinet.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member to direct some comments toward 
the public's distrust of politicians. We have seen the public's trust 
in politicians erode over the years. This is the highest court in the 
land when it comes to setting rules and regulations by which to 
govern society. A certain onus falls on individual members when 
they are elected to a position as a member of this House to 
demonstrate leadership qualities.
<P>
	To demonstrate these leadership qualities we certainly cannot 
embark on a ``do as I say, not as I do'' philosophy.
<P>
	I would like some expansion on the perception of the public of 
how this kind of blatant disrespect for ethics in a position of this 
nature has come about and how it has eroded political credibility.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can talk for a couple of minutes about 
why the faith of Canadians in politicians has plummeted so 
severely.
<P>
	It has been a sad trend to watch how people have placed 
politicians somewhere down on the bottom of the list with snake oil 
salesmen as people to trust. It is unfortunate because I do not 
believe it is necessary. It is unfortunate and I do not believe it is 
necessary. The government does not seem to understand, and the 
Prime Minister has not grasped, that there is no shame in stepping 
aside while an investigation goes on.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	There is no shame in a senior official stepping aside and saying 
that while there is a cloud over my administration, while there is 
some question about this, I want a complete airing of the facts and I 
am stepping down until my name is cleared. There is no shame in 
that. That is a proud moment when you are able to come back to 
your peers and say that the investigation is complete, it has been 
fair and open and the facts are all out on the table. We give a nice 
round of applause and the minister comes back into a position of 
trust. That is a proud moment. That is assuring and reassuring the 
Canadian people that the ethics issue is taken seriously.
<P>
	When you are not prepared to lead by example, when there is 
some white out on the expense account but you are told: Take my 
word for it, all is good. I will not tell you what it is, what it is about, 
how long it took to pay it back or the details, it is my own little 
secret because it is personal. People look at that. It might be true, 
they hope it is true but they cannot see it. There is a perception that 
something is going on. Normally there is no white out for routine 
business. It is done because there is something being covered or 
hidden on whatever it is that was changed.
<P>
	It applies not only to ethical things that involve money. It 
involves leadership by example in other areas such as the 
government's plan for something that is as integral to our social 
system as the Canada pension plan. I hear the government say the 
only solution is to double the premiums and slash the benefits and 
that is it. However, members of Parliament get a pension plan fully 
indexed after six years. That is what breaks the trust with 
politicians and their constituents.
<P>
	The member for Beaver River was the first Reform Party 
member to quality for the MP pension. The papers were brought 
into her office and basically it came down to her being told that if 
the MP pension was too extravagant, to opt out of this pension plan, 
put your money where your mouth is and there is a chance to do it 
right now. When the member for Beaver River looked at this asked: 
What is this program worth to me? She was told the pension plan at 
that time was worth $1.4 million.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6326"> 6326 </A></B>
<P>
	The member for Beaver River said, I am sure with some 
hesitation and trembling because it is a lot of money: ``This is 
where the buck does not pass. This is where the rubber meets the 
road''. She signed away $1.4 million. Why did she do this? 
Because she had given her word.
<P>
	It is not fun to give up $1.4 million. It was hers, it was right in 
the papers and she had it. It could not be taken away except by her 
own free will. She said: ``There are tough decisions to be made and 
there were promises made in the last election''. When the crunch 
came, even if it was a personal sacrifice, the hon. member stepped 
up to the batting box and hit a home run. That is why I have respect 
for the hon. member as the chair of our caucus which exceeds the 
respect I have for anybody in this House, on that side of the House 
especially.
<P>
	She put her money where her mouth is. She showed what ethical 
conduct is all about. She set a standard to which the rest of us will 
try to adhere. I opted out of the pension plan as well. We had some 
leadership in our caucus. We made a promise and we kept it. 
Ethical conduct is directly linked to the appreciation that 
constituents have for their MPs. There is a direct correlation 
between ethical conduct and that appreciation. When we see the 
ranking of MPs going down, it is tied entirely to that. People 
always ask me: ``How do I know you will keep your word? How do 
I know I can trust you? How do I know that you will do what you 
say you will do?''
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Keeping ethical standards will restore people's faith in 
parliamentarians. That is what should be happening here today and 
in the past while with the Prime Minister. It has not happened. That 
is too bad because the respect for parliamentarians will continue to 
drop until he gets that straight in his mind.

<P>
this motion dealing with the  Young Offenders Act as seriously and 
move it along through all stages just as quickly.
<P>
	My constituents have asked me to bring this motion to the House 
because of the headlines that we read in our local newspapers 
almost daily. I brought some examples.
<P>
	From the Penticton <I>Herald</I>: ``Teen charged in school standoff''. 
A 15-year old Princeton youth brought a gun into school and had an 
armed standoff with police. His name cannot be released because 
of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Another headline from the Penticton <I>Herald</I>: ``Squatters embark 
on wrecking spree''. There was damage in the tens of thousands of 
dollars after teens trashed a partially completed condo complex. 
Names cannot be released because of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	``Osoyoos demands justice''. Twelve hundred Osoyoos residents 
want two youths tried as adults for the hijacking of a school bus. 
The young offenders' names cannot be released because of the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	``Classmate says suspect obsessed with gun''. Young offender 
cannot be named because of the act.
<P>
	``Crown fights to keep youth killer off streets'', was another 
headline in our newspapers recently. A dangerous young offender 
convicted of murder is set to be released from jail. His name, again, 
cannot be released because of the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	These are just some of the headlines we are greeted with in my 
riding. We must not be misled by these headlines. It is important to 
note that most young people are on their way to being upstanding 
members of society and will contribute in a positive fashion to our 
communities.
<P>
	I worked for many years in the air cadet program. I know the vast 
majority of our children today are good kids. It is just a few bad 
apples that we are speaking of today. It is important to remember 
that when we speak about the Young Offenders Act, we are only 
speaking about youth who have committed crimes. Particularly, we 
are speaking today about violent and dangerous young offenders.
<P>
	The Liberal government has done nothing to address the 
problems of the Young Offenders Act but we in the Reform Party 
are attempting to shore up the holes. My colleague, the hon. 
member for Crowfoot, the Reform Party justice critic has been 
working diligently on changing the Young Offenders Act and he 
should be applauded for his efforts. I am pleased to have his 
support in the House today.
<P>
	As a former police officer, he brings to the debate a level of 
experience that one must respect. He has led the Reform Party in its 
attempts to change the Young Offenders Act. He has led the fight to 
recognize victims' rights. That is what my motion is about today, 
victims' rights and the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	I spent the summer touring my riding as I am sure other 
members did in theirs. I held town hall meetings in each and every 
corner of my riding. I met with people everywhere. Constituents 
told me that they are concerned about high taxes. They are 
concerned about health care. They are concerned about job 
creation. However, the number one issue on their minds, the single 
issue that was brought up at every single meeting I attended is the 
failure of the Young Offenders Act to protect our communities.
<P>
	I was at a very interesting meeting this summer hosted by 
Darlene Harder of the Penticton Court Watch. Darlene is a 
no-nonsense woman with a keen sense of justice. She called 
together a group of people to meet in a church, a most appropriate 
place I thought to have a discussion about justice issues.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Darlene brought her group together to talk about what they could 
do to help fix the problems of youth crime in our riding. At the 
meeting there was a cross-section of people from the community. 
There were lawyers, teachers, doctors, old people and yes, there 
were young people. They had all gathered to express the same 
concern, that something needs to be done to address the fact that 
the Young Offenders Act seems to do more to protect the youth 
who commit crimes than it does the victims of violent youth crime.
<P>
	As a result of the meeting of the Penticton Court Watch, Darlene 
Harder and her workers have put together a petition which when it 
is completed I will be pleased to present in this Chamber. The 
petition prays that the government amend the Young Offenders Act 
to change the age of young offenders down to 10 years from 12 
years. The petition prays that the names of those convicted under 
the act be published and that individuals charged with repeat 
offences of violent crimes be automatically transferred to adult 
court. There are already 3,500 signatures on that petition.
<P>
	I know that we are a very long way away from my beautiful 
riding of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt and it is very hard for 
the Liberal government to hear the voices of their friends in British 
Columbia, but I hope it will listen today and join us in the Reform 
Party in supporting this motion. Every member of this House 
crossing every political line feels the same concerns that I am 
speaking about today from their constituents in their ridings. They 
are facing the same difficulties and the same problems of the good 
people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt with the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	A precedent setting case in Canadian case law occurred in my 
riding last June. The Young Offenders Act was failing to protect 
people in my riding so crown counsel sought to take action on their 
behalf.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6329"> 6329 </A></B>
<P>
	A youth 17 years of age was convicted in the unprovoked 
shooting murder of a complete stranger, Edward McDermott of 
Keremeos in 1993. The young murderer was sentenced to three 
years in jail for the killing after which he would normally receive 
conditional release for a two-year probation period. However, in 
this particular case, several forensic psychiatrists said the accused 
was simply too dangerous to go back out onto the streets. Crown 
counsel in my riding applied under a never before used section 
of the Young Offenders Act to have the man kept in prison until 
the end of his term of probation. The crown won its case and this 
young offender will not be allowed to enter our communities.
<P>
	This success story is the exception and not the rule. It is a sad 
comment that the crown had to go to such lengths to protect our 
society from someone who is protected by the Young Offenders 
Act. This is why we need these long overdue amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Roy O'Shaughnessy is the clinical director of British Columbia's 
youth court services and youth forensic psychiatric services. He 
says that it should come as little surprise that the propensity for 
violence can extend even to the very young. He says that anti-social 
behaviour is a continuum which begins in its worst forms around 
the age of five or six, so there are a few kids starting to display 
aggressive violent behaviour even in preteen years. This group 
accounts for only about 20 per cent of adolescent offenders but 
commits the majority of serious crimes.
<P>
	The first warning signs of this appear in the school yard among 
children who frequently fight, bully others and steal. As they 
approach their teenage years, they may already be engaged in 
violent criminal behaviour. What these youths also have in 
common is a stunning lack of empathy for their victims.
<P>
	Most of these traits were clearly evident in 1993 in a case that 
focused the world's attention on the potential brutality of preteens. 
In Preston, England two 10-year old boys, Robert Thompson and 
Jon Venables, lured two-year old James Bulger away from his 
mother in a shopping centre and brutally beat him to death.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	Let me refer briefly to a recent and equally infamous Canadian 
case that highlights the need for the reduction in age from 12 years 
to 10 years. This case also addresses the need for transfers to adult 
court, but I will be touching on that subject a little later on in my 
speech.
<P>
	The case to which I am referring is that of Sandy Charles. In 
early August of this year Sandy Charles was found not criminally 
responsible by reason of mental illness for the murder of Johnathan 
Thimpsen, age seven, of La Ronge. The point of the story is not to 
highlight the brutality of some youth crimes but to remind 
members of a less publicized fact about this case. Sandy  Charles 
had an accomplice who was eight years old. We can only refer to 
the accomplice as Mr. Charles claimed that M masterminded and 
motivated the killing.
<P>
	Let me highlight one case that demonstrates how our streetsmart 
youth are all too well aware of how the Young Offenders Act serves 
as a shield to protect them.
<P>
	In July of this year in a Toronto case a 13-year old girl told a 
hushed courtroom how an 11-year old helped two other boys, ages 
13 and 15, to rape her. She testified that the older boys were about 
to let her go when the 11-year old insisted that they finish the job. 
Following the arrest of the 11-year old, he taunted police by saying: 
``You got me, so what are you going to do?'' The reason he got off 
scot-free is that the Young Offenders Act does not apply to 
offenders of his age. This needs to be fixed.
<P>
	If we support my motion today we can move to redress this 
obvious and glaring flaw in the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Scott Newark, the executive director of the Canadian Police 
Association agrees that the age needs to be dropped from 12 to 10. 
Our Liberal friends across the way should listen to his advice.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is a tremendous champion of British 
parliamentary tradition. In England and Wales, guess what the age 
for young offenders is. Ten years is the age of criminal 
responsibility. The Liberals and their Prime Minister should follow 
the lead of their friends across the ocean and support Reform's 
motion to reduce the age from 12 to 10 here in Canada.
<P>
	Let us move on to the publishing of names. The principles of the 
Young Offenders Act establish its intent. I must disagree with the 
first principle of the act that puts the interests of the accused and 
convicted ahead of the interests of the victims and society at large. 
It is that disagreement with the act which motivates my interest to 
have published the names of violent young offenders. I believe that 
publishing the names of violent young offenders will go one more 
step toward protecting society.
<P>
	The act states in its declaration of principle that ``society must, 
although it has the responsibility to take reasonable measures to 
prevent criminal conduct by young persons, be afforded the 
necessary protection from illegal behaviour''. Many learned 
commentators have pointed out the tensions within these 
principles. Nowhere in the principles are the rights of victims 
mentioned. Further, the reference to protecting society is 
ambiguous. The act needs to be amended to fix this problem.
<P>
	The principles of the Young Offenders Act allow the names of 
violent young offenders to not be published. I do not believe that 
the names of all young offenders should be published, but the 
names of violent and dangerous young offenders should definitely 
be published. In all cases the protection of society as a whole 
should be paramount. To that extent a young offender should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6330"> 6330 </A></B>
<P>
sacrifice some privacy when he or she has committed a violent and 
dangerous crime.
<P>
	When we have violent young offenders, their privacy rights 
should be subordinate to the rights of society to be protected. In 
some cases information should be made public or at least available 
to the public in order that people in positions of authority, like 
teachers and parents, can make informed decisions to protect their 
charges and their children. A school principal may not know if a 
student has been convicted numerous times of drug trafficking. A 
parent may not know that his child is associating with an offender 
who has been convicted of a series of rapes.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The young man next door, entrusted with babysitting children, 
could be another Jason Gamache. Gamache was a young offender 
convicted of multiple sexual assaults. He began to babysit the girl 
next door. Gamache was a convicted repeat sex offender and by 
law, thanks to the Young Offenders Act, his name was never made 
public. Gamache lured the girl into the woods, sexually assaulted 
her and then murdered her. She might be alive today if his name 
had been allowed to be published. The parents of that little girl 
were not able to make an informed decision to protect their child 
and as a result she fell prey to a predator who this system protects.
<P>
	The first penalty paid for committing a criminal offence against 
society ought to be full disclosure of who the person is, where they 
come from and what they have done. Names should be published.
<P>
	Let me quote from my hon. colleague from Crowfoot who said 
on June 20, 1994, about publishing the names of young offenders 
that the names of victims and the horrific details of the crimes 
perpetrated on them are open to public scrutiny, but the names of 
the offenders remain a state secret. The young faces in Canada's 
courts and jails are like masks. They hide society's ugliest scars, 
scars that will fester unless they are exposed.
<P>
	Let me speak to the issue of transferring violent young offenders 
to adult court. Statistics Canada reports that only 94 cases of young 
offenders were transferred to adult court in 1993-94. Of the 94 
youths transferred to adult court, six were charged with murder. It 
is important to note that in the same year six youths were 
transferred to adult court to be tried for committing murder, 24 
youths were not transferred to adult court after having committed 
murder. In 1993-94, of 30 youths who were charged with murder, 
only six, or 20 per cent, were transferred to adult court.
<P>
	The Liberals amended the Young Offenders Act in 1995 
affecting the transfer to adult court of young offenders. The 
amendments caused 16 and 17-year-olds to be presumptively 
transferred to adult court if they were charged with murder, 
attempted murder, manslaughter or aggravated assault. However, 
the youth  or the crown may seek to transfer down to youth court. 
This is a faint hope clause for young offenders.
<P>
	We want those youth who demonstrate a lack of interest or 
ability to rehabilitate themselves after having committed a crime of 
violence, those youth who reoffend, those youth who repeat violent 
crimes to be automatically transferred to adult court. That is one of 
the key components of this motion today.
<P>
	Statistics Canada reported in early August of this year that the 
violent youth crime rate has continued to increase and last year it 
stood at twice the rate it was in 1986.
<P>
	I cited earlier an expert in British Columbia. Allow me to do so 
again. According to Roy O'Shaughnessy, the perception that a 
segment of young people is becoming more brutally violent is well 
founded. He said: ``The type of crime we are seeing now is 
different from what we saw 10 years ago. We are seeing more use 
of weapons, more gang related activity, more violent behaviour''. 
Canadians do not have a problem believing this.
<P>
	I read some of the headlines from my riding. It was not long ago 
that we saw a story about a school bus that was hijacked in my 
riding. The hijackers were young offenders carrying a gun. 
Thankfully, tragedy was averted and all the children were safely 
returned to their parents. However, this type of incident is not 
isolated and youth who repeatedly commit violent crimes of this 
kind should be automatically transferred to adult court. While the 
motion we are debating today deals predominately with young 
offenders, it proposes a means of amending it in ways to better 
safeguard society and more fairly treat people who commit crimes.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Let us not forget that the challenge still remains of how to 
develop a co-ordinated response to youth crime while respecting 
the different roles played by child welfare, health, education and 
the youth justice system.
<P>
	I thank the House for its time today. I would like to ask for the 
unanimous consent of the House to consider Motion No. 278 to be 
a votable motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is no unanimous 
consent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Motion M-278. I have just listened to the 
remarks of my colleague on this side of the House. He has 
mentioned some incidents that I, and many people in this society, 
find very sad. They are extremely reprehensible, I agree, and we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6331"> 6331 </A></B>
<P>
can see that  there is a malaise in this society. But I do not agree 
with him on the way to resolve these problems.
<P>
	I will begin my speech by summing up the member's thinking as 
follows: ``My son, if you play with fire, I will punish you''. I do not 
think this is the route to take. Rather, let us say: ``My son, I am 
going to teach you that you must not play with fire and why you 
must not do so''. What I am getting at is that legislation will have 
no effect on these young people. It will certainly not steer them 
away from criminal behaviour.
<P>
	Recently, I was talking with a street worker in Alma, a city in my 
riding. The way she works with young people, who are sometimes 
in difficulty, who have completely lost hope, is not by saying to 
them: ``Listen, if you do that, you will be punished, so you should 
not do that''. I do not know if some members here are cut off from 
the real world, but young people, I would not say all of them, but 
many young people, get a kick out of breaking the law. We will not 
improve matters by bringing in tougher legislation.
<P>
	I am inclined to think that the member on this side of the House 
wants to block out the world. Some people shut themselves up in 
their houses because they are afraid, the world is crazy, and they 
think they must bring in tougher laws to put these young people 
back on the straight and narrow. It is my belief that we must try to 
help them, rather than bring in even harsher legislation. They must 
be given hope.
<P>
	When the member says that the public must be protected by laws 
that make people think twice, laws that will improve things, I have 
my doubts. It looks more to me like we are putting a band-aid on a 
gaping wound. This is not the answer. We must find the courage to 
treat the wound itself.
<P>
	I know that sounds easy to say, but there are ways. In my view, 
rather than bring in tougher and tougher legislation, we must 
approach these young people and try to understand why they are 
turning to crime. The essence of my speech is more or less this: let 
us not just put on a bigger band-aid, particularly since young 
people are not familiar with the law.
<P>
	Of course, there is talk of dropping the age limit of young 
offenders to 10 years, from 12. Come on. Even at 14, I cannot give 
any specific statistics, but how many people of any age are familiar 
with the laws of this country? When all is said and done, people do 
not know much about them. So imagine a 14-year old. We will not 
accomplish anything by throwing more severe laws at them.
<P>
	It is extremely difficult, I agree, to propose concrete solutions. 
They are very much at the grassroots level.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	I believe that street workers play a very significant role. I do not 
know if they can be found in every city in  the country, but these 
individuals have the courage to approach young people who might 
be in trouble, to speak to them, to give them hope. In Quebec, we 
have help groups such as Tel-Jeunes, which allows young people to 
talk to someone about their troubles when they are having a rough 
time.
<P>
	In the end, we must ask ourselves what is happening to our 
society and how come it is the way it is, instead of pointing our 
finger at young people, saying they must be punished. It is not their 
fault if they are the way they are, I believe there are other problems. 
To study all the reasons why they commit such serious offenses 
might lead us to an in-depth sociological debate. We must be 
careful.
<P>
	I am certainly not saying I approve of the offenses committed by 
these young people, far from it, but I seriously doubt a stronger law 
can convince young people to behave. I seriously doubt it.
<P>
	What are we talking about in this case? When a young person 
between 12 and 18 commits a minor crime or the kind of crime 
committed by most young offenders, he comes under the Young 
Offenders Act, which is a little different from the laws applying to 
adults. Younger children are, considered perhaps not careless, but 
easier to talk into repeating an offence.
<P>
	What Reform is proposing is to reduce the minimum age from 
12 to 10, which is harsher in the end.
<P>
	I would also point out that Canada's crime rate is dropping. I feel 
we are trying to alarm the population by saying it does not make 
sense. Perhaps it is true that it does not make sense, but we have to 
see the positive side of things, such as the fact that the crime rate is 
going down in Canada. Is it necessary to make our laws harsher? I 
doubt it very much.
<P>
	Local discussions involving stakeholders who see this current 
loss of hope among our young people will do a great deal more to 
revive young people's hopes. Young people do not commit crimes 
for the sake of it. Recently, I recently had a discussion with a 
criminology professor, who told me that the rise in crime is like a 
message sent by our young people to the rest of society. They also 
want their share.
<P>
	In the animal world, those who are hungry are prepared to attack 
the stronger ones to get their share of the food. What is happening 
throughout the world is a bit alarming. Young people are losing 
hope and these extremes push them to commit criminal acts. 
Again, I do not approve such acts. However, instead of resorting to 
punishment, we should hold out our hand to them and lead them 
toward much more constructive solutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to speak to Motion M-278, wherein the hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6332"> 6332 </A></B>
<P>
member moves that the government should amend the Young 
Offenders Act to reduce the age for whom it applies down to the 
age of 10 from 12, to allow for the publication of the names of 
individuals convicted under the act, and to require the immediate 
transfer to adult court of individuals being tried for the repeat 
offence of violent crimes.
<P>
	I want to address each of these suggested amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act in turn. In my opinion this is quite a 
surprising motion in the sense that the mover belongs to a party 
which at a recent policy conference three months ago stated that the 
Young Offenders Act should be repealed. Now we are starting to 
snip around the edges of the Young Offenders Act with this motion.
<P>
	I am surprised by some of the statements I heard made by the 
mover of this motion. In particular I am referring to Dr. 
O'Shaughnessy. As a member of the committee I heard Dr. 
O'Shaughnessy speak.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	My recollection, and I think the record will show this clearly, is 
that Dr. O'Shaughnessy agreed that the age for young offenders 
should remain at 12. It is very easy to selectively refer to witnesses 
and experts who have a particular opinion, but at the end of the day, 
as decision makers and legislators, we have to decide what is best 
based on the evidence presented to us and not be selective and say: 
``Well, expert A said that it should be lowered to the age of 10 and 
my mind is made up and that is good enough for me. I want to 
lower it to the age of 10''.
<P>
	I am very surprised by this because it is almost an Old Testament 
world where it is an eye for eye, a tooth for a tooth. I think as a 
society we have moved beyond that.
<P>
	The other part of this whole concept of tinkering with the Young 
Offenders Act begs the question where do the provinces fit into 
this. If we follow the motion that was passed by the members of the 
Reform Party at their policy convention, we will find that it is very 
consistent because we do not have to worry about the provinces. 
Everybody who commits an act that is deemed to be criminal is 
dealt with in the criminal courts regardless of age.
<P>
	Therefore, if one asks the question where the provinces are in all 
of this, the answer is, if we follow their logic, the provinces have no 
place in this. Everybody, regardless of age, is capable of being a 
criminal in the worst sense of the word.
<P>
	The provinces do have a role in this. There is no question about 
that. The provinces have child welfare legislation. I will certainly 
concede that it is not a uniform code across this country. 
Unfortunately that is the reality, but one can certainly suggest that 
there ought to be a uniform code across this country in terms of 
child welfare legislation.
<P>
	We have heard references to the fact that an 11-year old will say 
to the police: ``You cannot touch me. There is nothing you can do 
about it''. In fact, that is an absolute fallacy because there are 
actions the police can take. I have no doubt that 11-year olds will 
say that. Certainly as a parent, children at various ages will say 
various things. It is part of their development into adulthood. 
However, to suggest that because they fall below the age of 12 that 
nothing can be done is quite frankly not true.
<P>
	I want to first say that this motion is premature because the 
issues raised in this motion are three of the issues that the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs will be 
reporting on shortly.
<P>
	As members know, the standing committee has been travelling 
across Canada and has heard submissions from average Canadians, 
expert Canadians and Canadians from all walks of life and all 
positions within and without the criminal justice system. To move 
ahead now with this motion and to accept it without the benefit of 
the opinion of the standing committee, which in turn has benefited 
from the many Canadians who have appeared before it and have 
taken the time and energy to make submissions to the committee, 
would be an absolute insult to the people and would not show the 
committee the consideration that its opinion should deserve.
<P>
	It seems to me that the appropriate solution in the circumstances 
is to wait merely for a couple of months until the committee tables 
its report.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague that these are issues that are of 
concern, but with all due respect they are more complex than they 
at first appear. The issue of how to address violent activity by 
young people under the age of 12 is a particular difficult one, there 
is no question about that. I believe there is good reason for 
selecting the age of 12 as the minimum age for criminal 
responsibility under the Young Offenders Act. It is because of the 
concern that many children under the age of 12 lack the knowledge 
and experience to fully appreciate the nature and consequences of 
their actions or the ability to fully participate in the proceedings 
against them. These two capacities are fundamental to a fair and 
just criminal prosecution.
<P>
	This is not to say that nothing is done, which I have already 
referred to, when children under 12 commit a criminal offence. In 
many provinces the commission of criminal offences by children 
under the age of 12 is a ground for intervention by child welfare 
authorities. These persons in conjunction with the family and the 
community can best determine how the long term interests of both 
the child and the community can be met.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	In many cases, unlike the criminal proceedings, there is no open 
trial; not a trial in the sense of the law. In fact,  it is a decision made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6333"> 6333 </A></B>
<P>
by child welfare authorities, a decision which we would hope 
would be in the best interests of the child. That is how it is dealt 
with.
<P>
	To suggest the police could do nothing with an 11-year old is 
absolutely true. If we also follow the logic that we should lower the 
age to 10, what would happen when we have a 9-year old saying the 
same thing? If we keep following their logic, we are going to go 
right down to some mystical age like one or two and we will be able 
to lock them up.
<P>
	Similarly, the issue of allowing for the publication of names of 
individuals convicted under the act is also complex. I want to 
remind this House that recent changes to the act which came into 
force on December 1, 1995 under Bill C-37 provide for greater 
information sharing among professionals like school officials and 
police to ensure compliance with the youth court orders, or when 
the safety of others is at stake. In addition, there can be a youth 
court order that the identity of a young offender found guilty of an 
offence involving serious personal injury be disclosed to 
designated person when the young offender poses a risk of serious 
harm to others.
<P>
	At the same time a number of reasons support the prohibition of 
publications such as preventing barriers being imposed which 
could stand in the way of a youth becoming more positively 
involved in the community, including employment and educational 
opportunities.
<P>
	The motion would require the immediate transfer to adult court 
of individuals being tried for the repeat offence of violent crimes. I 
know and the Minister of Justice knows that the commission of 
serious crimes by persons of any age is a cause of grave concern to 
all Canadians, but the best research available suggests that focusing 
merely on harsher treatment is neither going to be effective in 
deterring most youth from committing crimes in the first instance 
nor in preventing their reoffending and therefore offers no 
protection whatsoever to the public. Flexibility in the law to 
address the individual circumstances of each case is extremely 
important.
<P>
	I will address the issue of the immediate transfer to adult court. I 
remind the House that in respect of most serious offences 
committed by older youths, this issue was already addressed in the 
amendments that came into force on December 1, 1995.
<P>
	I emphasize that amendments to the legislation alone will not 
solve the problem of youth crime because it is tied to poverty, 
unemployment, family violence, racism, illiteracy, alcoholism, 
drug abuse and many other factors contributing to criminal 
behaviour in young people and in adults.
<P>
	For a number of reasons this motion is premature. It is 
inconsistent with its mover's party position. It would be 
inappropriate for the House to adopt it without waiting for the full 
report of the standing committee on justice. Therefore I cannot 
support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my colleague for bringing this motion forward at this time. 
As the member who just spoke indicated, some members of the 
standing committee have just finished a cross-country tour to 
examine various aspects of the Young Offenders Act under the 
direction of the justice minister. He asked us to look at lowering the 
age from 12 to 10, and from 17 to 15. He asked us to look at the 
whole business of disclosure.
<P>
	This motion is not a votable motion because my colleagues from 
the Liberal Party voted against that. It gives us an opportunity, at 
least those of us who have spent the last month or so travelling 
across this country listening to experts and others expressing their 
views on these issues that the justice minister asked us to examine, 
to examine what we have heard in light of the possibility of some of 
these amendments. The people who are going to finally decide on 
these issues of course will be the electorate in the next election. If 
we are going to make recommendations for changes, I have always 
looked for balance in the presentations that appeared before the 
committee, and sometimes they were balanced and sometimes they 
were not. Some members or witnesses were totally concerned with 
the rehabilitation of the members and they did not believe that the 
disclosure of names would aid and abet the rehabilitation of those 
individuals.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	They would not take into consideration the other side of the 
equation which was of course the safety of the public in the case of 
a sexual offender or on those rare occasions when it might be 
necessary and in the best interest of the public to disclose the name 
of the repeat violent offender or the sexual offender so that not only 
would groups in society have that information to defend 
themselves and their children from the actions or potential actions 
of those individuals but also there are groups and individuals in 
society who may want to come forward and offer assistance and 
help to those individuals. Without that knowledge they would not 
be able to do so.
<P>
	There is one point I would like to touch on in my examination of 
this motion, the area of reducing the age from 12 to 10.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association supports lowering the age of 
criminal responsibility in recognition of the fact based on 
experience that there are offenders under 12 years of age who 
currently slip through the system and go on to be full fledged youth 
criminals because the justice system cannot deal with them.
<P>
	As mentioned by my colleague, in the spring of this year an 
11-year old Toronto boy with accomplices aged 10, 13 and 15 
abducted and raped a 13-year old girl. This  young offender was 
well known to the police because they had picked him up on more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6334"> 6334 </A></B>
<P>
than one occasion in the past. This juvenile individual taunted 
police with the fact that they could not charge him.
<P>
	If the Liberal justice minister and his government believe that 10 
and 11-year olds should be held accountable for their criminal 
actions and if they had heeded our well founded advice and 
amended the YOA under Bill C-37 to include 10 and 11-year olds, 
there may have been one less rape victim in the city of Toronto. 
One less person may not have been so brutally traumatised as this 
13-year old girl.
<P>
	The Liberals may have ignored us and our recommendation to 
lower the age to 10 and 11-year olds but they cannot ignore the 
experts. They cannot ignore the Canadian Police Association and 
they cannot ignore Professor Nicholas Bala, associate dean of the 
faculty of law at Queen's University. On May 9 Professor Bala 
testified before the justice committee. Contained in his comments 
were a number of statistics which I would like to reiterate.
<P>
	He stated: ``I summarized the work of a 1992 StatsCanada 
survey of 27 police forces in Canada. The data indicated that 
offending behaviour by children under 12 is a significant problem, 
although it is a relatively small part of Canada's total crime picture. 
The study indicates that children under 12 committed about 1.2 per 
cent of all crimes compared to 20.8 per cent by young persons and 
78 per cent by adults''.
<P>
	During his deliberations Professor Bala referred the justice 
committee to a paper he wrote on behalf of the Department of 
Justice. This Queen's law professor's paper was not circulated to 
members of the committee and I have yet to ask the committee why 
the paper was not made available. I question whether or not this 
paper was to meet the same fate as Terrance Wade's report which 
was also commissioned by the Department of Justice. Wade's 
incriminating paper regarding the handgun registration system was 
not made public, nor was it easily attainable until some members 
including myself inadvertently received a copy.
<P>
	Fortunately I have obtained a copy of Professor Bala's paper 
entitled ``Responding to Criminal Behaviour of Children Under 
Twelve: An Analysis of Canadian Law in Practice''. This report 
provides some additional statistics which Professor Bala did not 
reveal to the committee during his appearance before the 
committee.
<P>
	The report states: ``While some of the reports of the offender 
behaviour involved children as young as four or five, the police 
reports indicate that almost two-thirds of the offences by children 
under twelve involve 10 and 11-year olds. Males accounted for 89 
per cent of the children involved. While most of the crimes were 
property related, one major offence of concern is arson. About 13 
per cent of all arson cases involve children aged 12. About 6 per 
cent of the offences by children under  12 involve violence, for a 
total of 275 victims. Only 4 per cent of the victims of these assaults 
were family members of the offender; 2 per cent were close 
friends; 12 per cent were strangers and 82 per cent were 
acquaintances; 74 per cent of the assaults involved physical force; 
8 per cent involved knives; 7 per cent involved clubs; 10 per cent 
other instruments and 1 per cent guns''.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	Referring to a paper released by the Department of Justice in 
1994, Professor Bala said the paper raised: ``Some disturbing 
questions about sexual offending by children under the age of 12. 
Based on police records, about 20 per cent of all sex offences were 
committed by youth under 18. Of these, about 10 per cent were 
committed by children under the age of 12. Many of the acts 
committed by this youngest age group were such highly intrusive 
acts as oral sex and vaginal penetration''.
<P>
	This is information provided in the study commission by the 
justice department and paid for by the taxpayer, a report that was 
not circulated to members of the committee.
<P>
	On page 5 of the report Bala concludes: ``Present legal responses 
are not totally adequate and serious consideration should be given 
to lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10, with 
restrictions to ensure that a criminal response is used in an 
appropriate and restrained fashion''.
<P>
	Professor Bala told the committee that his paper is: ``Probably 
one of the most exhaustive, recent treatments of the issues by an 
academic in this country. It traces the history, the variation in 
provincial offence rates and responses and some of the problems 
that are there and comes up with the ultimate conclusion''.
<P>
	Professor Bala cited the findings of Dr. Peterson-Badaili and Dr. 
Rona Abramovitch. Dr. Peterson-Badaili gave 144 students in 
grades 5 to 8, roughly ages 10 to 14 a series of questions about 
hypothetical criminal offences committed by children and 
adolescents. She found that all of the children were: ``Reasonably 
accurate at identifying specifically what the transgression was. 
These results suggest that at least when the offence is relatively 
straightforward, children are capable of understanding what 
constitutes a criminal action. This is an important point since 
comprehension of wrongdoing is a prerequisite to criminal 
responsibility. It is already acknowledged in our juvenile laws that 
it does not make sense to hold a child responsible for an action that 
he or she did not know was wrong''.
<P>
	The work of the Canadian psychologist, Thomas Dalby, Alan 
Leschied and Susan Wilson was also referred to by Bala.
<P>
	I see that I am running out of time. The report is there for all 
members of the House to read. It recommends, based on findings 
and exhaustive investigation into this particular area, that the age 
of criminality should be  reduced from 12 to 10. I hope that when 
the committee looks at its final report and considers this particular 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6335"> 6335 </A></B>
<P>
area that the justice minister asked us to examine, it will consider 
Professor Bala's testimony and his report together.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to join in the debate because it gives me an 
opportunity to respond to yet another Reform simple minded, 
facile, quick fix proposal.
<P>
	Reform Party members have already made up their minds about 
the Young Offenders Act. The thought that they want to amend it 
now certainly rings hollow. The Reform fresh start pamphlet says 
under the category of safe streets that Reformers promise to 
eliminate the Young Offenders Act and replace it with laws making 
juvenile offenders accountable for their actions. If they want to 
eliminate it, I have no idea why they want to amend it at this time. 
Inconsistency, I suppose, is not something that they have any 
trouble dealing with because they are inconsistent in many ways.
<P>
	They claim that the people of Canada are obsessed by youth 
crime. They use inflammatory rhetoric and, quite frankly, 
misleading information or misinformation to support that claim 
and to fire up the public who listen to them without realizing that 
they do not have the statistics, the numbers or the research to back 
up what they say.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	What is interesting to me is that the member for Crowfoot, who 
is the only member of the Reform Party who travels with the justice 
committee which I chair, has said from the very beginning that he 
thinks the age should be lowered. He thinks we should change the 
publication terms of the act. He is still saying the same thing after 
five weeks of touring the country and listening to people on all 
sides of the issue. Members of his party are still saying the same 
thing they were saying during the last election campaign. They 
have not listened to Canadians.
<P>
	In an absolutely unbelievable act yesterday, those members 
moved to try to prevent the justice committee from completing its 
deliberations by hearing from Canadians across the country. I am 
happy to announce to all of Canada today that their little, cynical 
act did not work. I can announce that the justice committee, on 
November 22, will spend a day with 40 experts and ordinary 
citizens from across the country trying to reconcile the different 
views on the issue of youth justice.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party tried to prevent us from hearing 
from Canadians. They tried to prevent us, at the same time, because 
the hearings will be televised, from sharing this massive 
information and discussion with all of Canada. They tried to 
prevent us from doing that. They tried to stifle debate. However, we 
caught them and  we stopped them. Fortunately for Canadians, we 
will have an excellent chance to review all of these issues.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party have tried to pre-empt debate 
today by bringing this motion, knowing that it is their intention to 
eliminate the act altogether. But I have it figured out. They know 
they will never form a government, so they will never get a chance 
to eliminate the act in any event.
<P>
	The first speaker from the Reform Party talked about and quoted 
an eminent psychiatrist from Vancouver, Dr. Roy O'Shaughnessy. 
Dr. O'Shaughnessy also said what the member for Crowfoot and 
the mover of this motion have conveniently not included. Dr. 
O'Shaughnessy commented on the age of 12 years as being the 
cut-off age in the Young Offenders Act. As a developmental 
psychiatrist with an expertise in child development, when I told 
him that age 12 was a fairly arbitrary selection that was a 
compromise among the different provincial views, he said to me: 
``Oh, is that not funny? I thought it was chosen because in terms of 
child development it is the perfect age. It is the average age at 
which one could attribute some form of culpability''. It is funny 
that the member for Crowfoot did not quote that.
<P>
	The mover of the motion said that Liberals have done nothing 
with respect to the Young Offenders Act and, by inference, with 
respect to youth justice. Let me quote Sean Durkan who is a 
columnist with the <I>Sun</I> chain of newspapers. In the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> in 
July 1994 Mr. Durkan said the following: ``Jean Chrétien's red 
book brigade has introduced more tough law and order legislation 
in a little under nine months in office than the Tories did during 
nine years in power''.
<P>
	Under our red book commitment we said this: ``Every person has 
a right to personal security and a Liberal government will move to 
protect that right, with particular attention being paid to those who 
today, by virtue of gender, sex, religion, age or sexual orientation, 
are more likely to be targets of violent crime''.
<P>
	We then introduced Bill C-41, which was given royal assent in 
July of 1995 to provide that in sentencing a judge must consider 
those characteristics.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Did the Reform Party join us in trying to make the streets of 
Canada safer, in trying to make the homes of Canada safer? No, 
instead it focused on the words sexual orientation in that bill. Its 
members voted against it.
<P>
	We promised in the red book to strengthen gun control: ``A 
Liberal government will, among other measures, counter the illegal 
importation of banned and restricted firearms into Canada and 
prohibit anyone convicted of an indictable drug related offence, a 
stalking offence or any violent offence from owning or possessing 
a gun''. We had massive public backing for this, including the 
active support of the Canadian Police Association. Did the Reform 
Party support it? No.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6336"> 6336 </A></B>
<P>
	We promised to reform the Young Offenders Act to increase 
sentence length for violent crimes, to ensure that treatment and 
rehabilitation services are available to all convicted young 
offenders and we promised to review the act. Bill C-37 amended 
the Young Offenders Act. Are Reformers commenting on that? No.
<P>
	Nor are they admitting that it created longer sentences in youth 
court for young people where first or second degree murder 
applied; that it transferred 16 and 17-year olds charged more easily 
to adult court; that it provided better rehabilitation for lesser 
crimes; that it improved measures for information sharing, which 
they are talking about today. Did they admit that? No.
<P>
	This motion is somewhat disingenuous. It is inconsistent with 
their party policies. It is inconsistent with their participation in the 
justice committee review of the Young Offenders Act, another 
promise that we are keeping, and it is inconsistent with anyone who 
is concerned about family values and about safer streets. Why do 
they not just play ball?
<P>
	I will tell members why. It is just politics as usual with the 
Reformers. They do not care about anything but getting re-elected.
<P>
	We are very busy in the Commons justice committee trying to 
make the streets safer for Canadians and trying to deal honestly, 
openly and fairly with young people who go astray in our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
moved to say a few words in the last two and a half minutes of 
debate.
<P>
	I too have been a principal, a teacher and a superintendent. I 
taught both elementary and secondary school. I find that the 
characterization that my colleagues from 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt and Crowfoot have put on 
young people in the last hour is totally without foundation with 
respect to the majority of those young people.
<P>
	I found them almost completely and totally honest, ready to 
learn, ready to admit, ready to be compassionate people. I also met 
some who, because of upbringing or lack of love in their own life, 
perhaps nutrition, perhaps the experiences they had suffered which 
were not of their own doing, were confused and, hence, reacted 
violently sometimes to the due discipline which we tried to bring 
out. However, to suggest that we are somehow going to cure this 
problem by punishing them even more severely totally escapes me.
<P>
	My colleague from Windsor-St. Clair used the word 
inconsistent. I find it most inconsistent. My colleague from 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt mentioned a meeting in a 
church, which came up with the suggestion, it seemed to me, that 
we should ignore the teachings of Christ, we should ignore our 
forgiveness of sins, we should ignore allowing the little children to 
come unto us, we should ignore doing unto others and asking us to  
forgive our trespasses by making perfectly sure we made it clear 
that we branded everybody under 12 who committed a violent, 
sexual or otherwise untoward crime for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	We had enough of that this week when we saw an eminent 
Canadian damned for something he did at 19, like wearing a 
swastika. If we are going to continue to run our country, our 
government or make our laws on the basis of what happened 50 
years ago, 100 years ago or 1,000 years ago, we are never going to 
reach the promised land.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It being 2.30 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until Monday, November 18, 1996 at11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Orders 28(2) and 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
