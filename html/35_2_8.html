<P>

	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour of tabling and presenting, for the approval of the 
honourable members of this House, the main estimates of the 
Government of Canada for the 1996-97 fiscal year.
<P>
	This is my first occasion to address this House as the President 
of the Treasury Board. And if I may say so, I am very pleased to be 
here in this capacity, although I am very aware of the many 
responsibilities that this position brings with it.
<P>
	The control of the government's expenditures, the delivery of 
public services adapted to the needs of Canadians, and the 
well-being of a dedicated and efficient public service are all 
significant challenges facing the Treasury Board. They are issues 
that I was able to examine in depth in my former portfolio of 
President of the Privy Council and Minister reponsible for Public 
Service Renewal.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity, today, not only to discuss 
the content of the estimates tabled in this House, but also the 
process and initiatives that preceded them.
<P>
	In particular, I would like to highlight the program review begun 
two years ago and the prospects it offers for today, the many 
alternatives for delivering government services, and our vision of a 
renewed, dynamic, and efficient public service.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	The estimates submitted to this House reflect the government's 
main priority-which encompasses all of the others-and that is to 
put Canada back on the right track a track characterized by fiscal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="386"> 386 </A></B>
<P>
responsibility, by more effective program and service delivery, and 
by  harmonious and productive relations between the federal and 
other levels of government.
<P>
	When we assumed responsibility in 1993, the government was 
struggling with two major, endemic problems: a deficit and a debt 
that were out of control, and a lack of clarity in the roles and 
responsibilities of the federal government. To put the country back 
on the right track, we had both to reduce the budget deficit and 
clarify the roles, responsibilities, and priorities of the Government 
of Canada.
<P>
	Canadians clearly would not be satisfied with cosmetic 
solutions. They expected us to act methodically and with good 
judgment. This was the framework in which we launched a 
comprehensive review of all federal government programs and 
services in 1994.
<P>
	We based this review on six specific criteria. First, the criterion 
of public interest: Was the activity still serving the public? Second, 
the role of the government: Did the government have a necessary 
and legitimate role in this activity? Third, the criterion of 
federalism: Could some other level of government deliver the 
program more effectively? Fourth, the criterion of partnership: 
What activities or programs could we transfer, in whole or in part, 
to the private sector or a volunteer organization? Fifth, the criterion 
of efficiency: How can we enhance the efficiency of the activity or 
program? And sixth, the criterion of affordability: Can the 
government still afford this type of activity?
<P>
	This program review has been a success on many fronts. First, it 
has enabled the government to reduce is spending significantly. By 
the end of 1998-99, program review measures will have reduced 
program expenditures by $9 billion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The program review decisions have also enabled the government 
to refocus its efforts and to concentrate on its priorities. For 
example, there have been almost no reductions in the programs for 
aboriginal peoples and those for corrections and the justice system. 
In contrast we have cut spending on natural resources and defence 
substantially and eliminated many subsidies to business.
<P>
	The program has opened the door to very interesting prospects in 
federal-provincial relations. In particular, federal departments have 
a much clearer picture of their roles and responsibilities. This new 
vision is based on a recognition of the federal government's true 
spending capacity and a clear understanding of its priorities.
<P>
	Our vision was evident in last week's throne speech and the 
subsequent statement by the Prime Minister. We are confident that 
it will have a positive impact on relations between the federal and 
other levels of government and will strengthen Canadian unity.
<P>
	I have also tabled in the House, along with the estimates, a 
document entitled ``Getting Government Right'' which 
summarizes the government's approach to its review process and 
highlights the key results to date.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In addition to redefining its role and responsibilities, the 
Government of Canada must also attack another fundamental issue: 
What are the most efficient and least costly ways to deliver its 
programs and services? Like most organizations in the world, the 
government has rethought the way it delivers its services based on 
what many call the ``client approach.''
<P>
	The government continues to develop ways to measure 
performance. It is making more use of modern technology to 
reduce costs and enhance service quality. And more and more, it is 
seeking feedback from Canadians on the quality of the services 
they receive. As a service provider, we must be flexible if we are to 
meet the expectations of our citizens. That is why we must be open 
to other ways of delivering our services.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	But this does not mean that the government's presence will no 
longer be important, because it will continue to play an active role. 
Alternative delivery will not be appropriate for all federal 
programs or services. The Treasury Board will review carefully 
individual programs or services put forward as candidates for 
alternative delivery.
<P>
	The government will continue to restructure service delivery 
where this is a sensible thing to do. A few examples will illustrate 
some of the ways in which we have experimented with alternative 
service delivery.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, for some years the government has been shifting 
its role from an operator of the transportation system to focus on 
developing policy and legislation and enforcing standards for 
safety and security. This has led to the transfer of airports to local 
airport authorities and the proposed sale of Transport Canada's air 
navigation system to a not for profit operator.
<P>
	The sale of both Petro-Canada and CN Rail illustrates situations 
where it makes sense to privatize government assets or activities 
that the public sector no longer needs to retain.
<P>
	Using an alternative delivery model, Canada business service 
centres provide single window services to small businesses from 21 
federal departments and agencies and related provincial services.
<P>
	Recent announcements have enhanced the development of new 
approaches to services. The government has announced the cre-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="387"> 387 </A></B>
<P>
ation of three new organizations, a parks agency, a single food 
inspection service and a Canada revenue commission. These  
organizations, which will remain within the public sector, will be 
established under separate legislation.
<P>
	As our experience with these new structures increases, we expect 
other departments and agencies to submit more candidates for 
alternative program delivery.
<P>
	In addition, the Treasury Board has recently established a new 
policy for employee takeovers which will make it easier for groups 
of employees to take over activities their departments previously 
did. We already have some early examples of this process. We see 
real potential here to privatize or commercialize certain functions 
in a way that protects the jobs of former public service employees 
and yet allows the government to reduce costs.
<P>
	Our approach to service delivery is pragmatic. Our goal is to 
identify flexible and efficient delivery options so that we can 
continue to offer Canadians the services they expect.
<P>
	Each case must be evaluated on its merits and the solution made 
to measure in the spirit of innovation, efficiency and service to the 
client.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The past six years have been difficult ones for the Public Service 
of Canada. As a former career public service employee, I am very 
much aware of this fact. The significant reductions in the number 
of jobs have created uncertainty and anxiety among employees. For 
those who remain, there has been no collective bargaining and their 
workloads have increased. Salary increases have been suspended 
for five of the last six years.
<P>
	I am pleased to say, that we can now see the light at the end of 
the tunnel. Not only do we wish to treat our employees fairly, we 
what them to be motivated and feel valued for the work they do for 
the public service.
<P>
	In the near future, we will introduce measures that will help to 
recognize our employees' contributions and modernize our human 
resources practices.
<P>
	I am pleased to announce that the Public Sector Compensation 
Act will not be extended and will expire as scheduled. This act was 
introduced as a temporary measure in 1991, and has been 
subsequently extended and broadened in its application. It has been 
an important component of accomplishing much needed fiscal 
objectives.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance confirmed in the budget yesterday, 
the government is on track with its fiscal targets. Now it is time to 
resume more sustainable compensation practices. This means that, 
beginning this June, we will lift the two-year suspension of annual 
increments, as was promised when this provision was introduced.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	At the same time, we will reintroduce performance pay, the 
equivalent of such increments for more senior employees, which 
has been suspended since 1991.
<P>
	Because of the timing of the application of the Public Sector 
Compensation Act, some junior ranks in the Canadian Forces have 
a salary shorfall when compared with other public service 
employees. We will compensate these groups by lifting the freeze 
on them sooner. My colleague, the hon. David Collenette, will 
announce details shortly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government is committed to returning to collective 
bargaining in a way that is fair to employees and to taxpayers. 
Many critics say collective bargaining cannot work in the present 
public sector environment. The success we have had with most of 
the unions in negotiating terms for alternative service delivery 
gives us cause for optimism. It shows that collectively it is possible 
to find better solutions to difficult issues when both sides are 
prepared to make a reasonable compromise, the very essence of 
collective bargaining.
<P>
	We need to bring together at one table issues such as wages, 
benefits and employment security which have a cost for the 
employer and economic value for employees rather than dealing 
with them separately. Where we can increase efficiency by 
streamlining existing policies and practices such as the travel and 
foreign service directives, we will share the savings at the table.
<P>
	We will ask the unions to sit down with us shortly to design such 
a process. However, given the difficult times ahead of us we must 
be cautious. Obviously with our continued need for fiscal 
responsibility we cannot leave determining the results of collective 
bargaining to a third party unaccountable to Parliament. For this 
reason we will introduce legislation shortly to suspend the binding 
arbitration in collective bargaining for the next three years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear that both the services of government and how these 
services are delivered must change. While it is not possible to 
guarantee continuing employment for all public service employees, 
we want to protect employees when arrangements are made to 
transfer activities out of public service departments to alternative 
service delivery structures, whether they are inside or outside the 
public sector.
<P>
	We will introduce legislation to provide fair and reasonable 
conditions for employees who transfer to a new employer in such 
situations. We will enhance these arrangements for employees in 
unions with which we have entered into agreements on such 
transfers.
<P>
	We will also introduce a series of amendments to the Public 
Service Superannuation Act to provide for  pension vesting and 
portability arrangements that meet the requirements of the 
Pensions Benefits Standards Act. This will give public service em-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="388"> 388 </A></B>
<P>
ployees the same range of pension options that other employees 
have when they leave their employees.
<P>
	Yesterday, my colleague, the Minister of Finance, noted in the 
budget that more employment reductions are likely. We do not 
anticipate than these reductions will be as big as those resulting 
from previous decisions. Departments will decide during the 
coming months where to make these reductions for 1998-99 and 
establish what impact the reductions will have on employment.
<P>
	We do not expect to have to extend the early Departure Incentive 
and early retirement incentive programs beyond their current 
expiry dates.
<P>
	The Public Service of Canada has always been known for its 
competency, integrity, and hard work. I am confident that the men 
and women of the public service will continue to display these 
qualities of professionalism.
<P>
	I would now like to highlight the key elements of the 1996-97 
Estimates. This year's estimates package responds to concerns of 
parliamentarians and the auditor general about the need to make the 
estimates document more strategic, easier to read, and less oriented 
to accounting.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	We have included in the package six pilot Part IIIs that test the 
new approach. Part III has been simplified and arranged to bring 
together in one section all the information related to departmental 
performance. We shall continue to work with parliamentarians and 
others to evaluate this new way of presenting information. If it is 
effective, we shall update the information and table more 
departmental performance reports in the fall.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The estimates provide details to support $157 billion in 
expenditure authorities for the 1996-97 fiscal year. Of this total, 
$45 billion must be voted and authorized through an appropriation 
act. The remaining $112 billion is statutory and has been approved 
previously by Parliament in various pieces of legislation. All those 
statutory programs do not require Parliament's approval.
<P>
	The estimates provide information on how these programs are 
proceeding. Although the Minister of Finance presented planned 
program spending of $109 billion in his budget yesterday, this 
figure and the total in the estimates differ significantly.
<P>
	In particular, the estimates do not include any program spending 
changes that require legislation. These technical differences 
between the estimates and budget figures can obscure the 
information parliamentarians need to examine departmental 
spending plans.
<P>
	Therefore this year I am introducing a new document entitled 
``Program Expenditure Detail: A Profile of  Departmental 
Spending'' which provides information on program expenditures at 
departmental and agency levels. This document will undoubtedly 
help people who use the estimates to understand the implications of 
the program review and other changes in spending plans for the 
coming fiscal year.
<P>
	The move to a smaller, more effective federal government means 
spending on programs and services will continue to drop. The 
government plans to spend $109 billion on programs and services 
in the coming year. This is almost $5 billion or about 4.4 per cent 
less than in 1995-96.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us now take a look at the challenge ahead. This government 
has taken a straightforward approach in its efforts to put Canada on 
the right track. First, we must get the deficit under control so that 
we have a reasonable margin to manoeuver in responding to the 
issues facing Canadians. Second, we must enhance our ability to 
assess and respond to the new pressures on Canadian society.
<P>
	Finally, by relying on a motivated and dynamic public service, 
we must provide Canadians with a government that knows how to 
deliver its programs and services more efficiently and more 
flexibly. I know we are on the right track.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Given the size of 
the estimates, the dollar amount of the announced national debt and 
the impact this will have on Canada's social programs and future 
taxation, would it be appropriate to ask for a moment of silence to 
allow the minister personal reflection-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Clearly the hon. member 
does not raise a point of order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
President of Treasury Board this morning tabled the Estimates of 
nearly $157 billion, of which $76 billion is earmarked for various 
transfer payments to individuals and the provinces primarily and 
nearly $48 billion will go to service the public debt, which is the 
government's largest budget item each year.
<P>
	The minister said that deficit control, improved government 
ability to assess and react in time to new pressures exerted on 
Canadian society and support for a motivated and dynamic public 
service are the three main pillars underlying the 1996-97 
Estimates.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Let us have a closer look at the merits of the minister's 
objectives and try to assess the means he will use to achieve them.
<P>
	To control the deficit, they talk of controlling government 
expenditure through program review. What  has come of these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="389"> 389 </A></B>
<P>
program reviews? We should point out that all major regional 
development agencies are seriously affected in this time of high 
unemployment, when young people are leaving the regions for the 
cities.
<P>
	There is, for example, the Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation, 
whose budget has been cut by 36.1 per cent; the Western economic 
diversification program, cut by 24.3 per cent, and the Federal 
Office of Regional Development-Quebec, the hardest hit by a 
budget cut of $102 million or 21.3 per cent of its total budget.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the budget of the Office of the Commissioner for 
Federal Judicial Affairs has been increased by $6.3 million, an 
increase related to judges' salaries, allowances and pensions.
<P>
	Although cut, defence spending still represents 21 per cent of 
direct program expenditures, excluding transfer programs. This is 
still far too much in a post cold war period.
<P>
	The minister says we have to look and see whether, in the federal 
context, another level of government would be better placed to 
deliver a specific program more effectively. I would say to the 
minister that 11 years as councillor with the city of St. Lambert, a 
city in my riding, 13 years as a Quebec provincial official and two 
years here in this House as a federal elected representative have 
shown me very clearly that the closer a government is to the 
people, the more effectively it delivers a program and that the 
client approach the minister seems to favour requires the transfer of 
as many powers as possible to the provinces, the regions and the 
municipalities.
<P>
	The increased control the government is preparing to exercise is 
what hurts the most. While it is talking about a client approach, the 
government is planning to create three new agencies, as mentioned 
this morning by the minister: a national parks board, a single food 
inspection agency and a national revenue commission that will be 
competing directly with Revenue Quebec, which already collects 
the GST and the QST on its territory.
<P>
	There is a lack on consistency between the goals set by the 
minister and the means he intends to use to meet them. The 
government is talking about flexible arrangements with the 
provinces, but whenever it has a chance, it tries to centralize.
<P>
	Similarly, we are told that, by the end of the 1998-99 fiscal 
period, the new measures brought about by this year's program 
review will allow the government to cut its program spending by $9 
billion. However, the documents tabled yesterday in this House by 
the Minister of Finance clearly show that, due to the reallocation of 
funds to other programs, the net result of the program review will 
be a net increase of $34 million this year and a drop of barely $200 
million next year, as the effect of this year's new measures will 
obviously be felt only in two or three years.
<P>
	In short, cuts are badly targeted, reallocations are badly targeted, 
and, for the time being, these new measures have absolutely no 
impact on the fiscal situation.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to ask the minister how he thinks he 
will be able to rely on a motivated and dynamic civil service, when 
a more generous package is being offered to employees belonging 
to the unions with which the government has reached a settlement 
regarding the transition to a new structure, and when the Minister 
of Finance announced in yesterday's budget the possibility of more 
layoffs?
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start 
by congratulating the minister on his appointment as President of 
the Treasury Board. I also congratulate the department on the six 
pilot projects on the reformatting of the part IIIs so that 
parliamentarians can more fully enjoy and appreciate what is going 
on in the departments. We hope this progress will continue and that 
parliamentarians will be able to have useful documentation in order 
to analyse what the government is doing. Unfortunately my 
compliments seem to stop there.
<P>
	The government is spending $157 billion and the minister gave a 
fairly short speech to cover how the government intends to do that. 
He boasts about the fact that program spending is coming down by 
about $9 billion, but interest on the debt is going up by $9.8 billion. 
It is not even a saw-off; we are spending more money. That was 
quite evident in the budget which was tabled yesterday by the 
Minister of Finance. We saw quite clearly that the deficit is coming 
down on the backs of the taxpayers because as the deficit has come 
down by $25 billion, tax revenues have gone up by the same 
amount.
<P>
	He talked about program review. In the last session of this 
Parliament I tabled Private Member's Bill C-289 which talked 
about program review. I said that four things have to be done. We 
should be looking at programs and reviewing programs on a 
cyclical basis, based on the following: What is a program designed 
to do? Is the program meeting that definition that we intend to 
serve society? Is it being done efficiently? Is it a better way to 
accomplish the same service to society at a lesser cost?
<P>
	The program review which has been done by this government 
has been done behind closed doors. It has been politically 
motivated. We have not seen very much in the way of efficiencies 
and improvements. Yet the government continues to slash across 
the board each department by 2 per cent, 3 per cent and 4 per cent. 
That is not program review; that is management without  
intelligence. It is basically cost cutting for the sake of cost cutting. 
It does not focus on service to Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="390"> 390 </A></B>
<P>
	If we look at the main estimates which were tabled today, we 
wonder why the status of women and the office of the co-ordinator 
get almost a 9 per cent increase, up by $1.3 million, while every 
other Canadian has to do with less.
<P>
	The Department of Citizenship and Immigration will get another 
$8.6 million, which is an increase of 3.8 per cent. That amounts to 
$8.6 million extra with the concept that it is going to save money. It 
seems rather strange.
<P>
	We all know what is happening in the fisheries, but the 
government is going to give an extra 47 per cent to the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans. Maybe that is just to go out and look for 
some fish. We need programs that work and programs that help 
Canadians. Giving another 47 per cent to the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans is not going to bring back the fish as far as I 
am aware.
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Canadian 
International Development Agency are both up, while Canadians 
get less. We want to maintain this facade of an image abroad that 
Canada is a wonderful place and that it has money to spend, while 
Canadians pay more and get less.
<P>
	These are the types of things that have to change if the 
government is going to get it right. One of the documents which the 
minister tabled this morning was: ``Getting Government Right''. I 
think that getting government right is spending on Canadians, not 
maintaining this facade abroad by spending our money on other 
people.
<P>
	It says here that the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development had a 20 per cent reduction in its budget, but 
yesterday the Minister of Finance said that the government was 
going to spend more. Money is going up and the numbers are going 
down just because they fudge it and move it elsewhere.
<P>
	These are not the types of things we like to see in the estimates. 
We like to see some real solid facts and continuity from year to 
year so that parliamentarians can understand what the government 
is doing.
<P>
	His own department, Treasury Board Secretariat, is going to get 
another $160 million. That is the department which is in charge of 
downsizing government, but he takes another $160 million for his 
own department to do that. It is incongruous that we see these types 
of numbers in the estimates.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	I was glad to see the minister intends to remove the wage freeze 
next year. We have already called for the government to do that and 
we are glad to see it is doing it. At the same time we called for the 
unions to give up the job guarantees. We want to see merit in the 
civil  service where people who do a good job are recognized. We 
want every civil servant to know that if they are doing a valuable 
job and doing it well, job security is there on that basis. We have to 
tell them that.
<P>
	However, the government has gone one step further. It has 
suspended binding arbitration. It has said it is prepared to talk 
about an increase in wages, but it will suspend binding arbitration 
which simply says: ``We are going to compromise, but we will do it 
our way''. I do not think that is the message the government should 
be sending to the civil service. It is like the sword of Damocles.
<P>
	Last year the Minister of Finance announced 45,000 job cuts. 
Tens of thousands of jobs were going to disappear and the civil 
service took it on the chin and carried on knowing that the morale 
was low because so many of their colleagues were going to go. 
Yesterday the Minister of Finance said: ``That is not all. More are 
going to go''. We do not know how many are going to go or when.
<P>
	The minister said this morning that the civil service is known for 
its competency, integrity and hard work. The government has 
maintained the wage freeze during the two and a half years it has 
been in office. It has said it is going to eliminate 45,000 jobs and it 
has said it is going to eliminate more. It is going to deny binding 
arbitration to the civil service. I wonder how long Canadians can 
expect competency, integrity and hard work from those in the civil 
service while the government continues to treat them this way. That 
has to change. We have to treat our civil service well. We have to 
recognize that those employees are working under difficult 
circumstances and they deserve better treatment.
<P>
	The minister talked about client approach. Client approach in the 
government has to serve Canadians. As a businessman I always 
knew I could look after my customers. Accountability and service 
delivery has to be number one. While the minister talks about it, 
what do we find?
<P>
	The Canadian health and social transfer is being maintained at a 
constant level by the Minister of Finance. He said so yesterday. 
There is no accounting for inflation which means that the extra 
costs are going to have to be borne by the provinces. That is not 
service.
<P>
	We have seen cuts to medicare from the 50 per cent that was 
guaranteed by the Liberal government many years ago. It is now 
down to the fact that it is only paying 23 per cent of health care. 
And the minister calls this client approach service delivery. 
Hospitals are closing, people are waiting for surgery everywhere. 
That is not a service delivery approach. It is budget cutting and 
Canadians suffer.
<P>
	Total spending is $157 billion in these estimates and we know 
there will be more coming in the supplementaries. There is $112 
billion in statutory  spending and we as parliamentarians are going 
to vote on $45 billion. That is a disgrace. It is absolutely intolerable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="391"> 391 </A></B>
<P>
that with the fiscal situation we are in today we as parliamentarians 
can only vote and express an opinion on $45 billion out of $157 
billion.
<P>
	We know from past experiences over the last two years that the 
government has maintained that absolutely not one nickel can 
change in the estimates regardless of what people on this side of the 
House say. That has to change. I look forward to the day the 
Reform Party is over on that side and introduces some meaningful 
change so that parliamentarians on both sides can have input on 
how money is spent in this country.
<P>
	According to the minister, spending will continue to drop. Taxes 
are going to remain high. We got no tax relief yesterday. The 
amount of money being spent on programs is going down and down 
every year by the government's own admission and there is no tax 
relief. It points out that the Reform Party had it right when it told 
the government to balance its budget as quickly as possible. Every 
dollar that Canadians are denied from tax revenue is being spent on 
bankers abroad. There is no way the government can deliver or 
continue to deliver social services to Canadians that are so dearly 
needed. The government promised jobs and it has yet to deliver on 
that promise.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	I see government is spending another $111 million on CIDA, the 
Canadian International Development Agency. The estimates say 
aid is going up and yet the Minister of Finance said yesterday it is 
going down $150 million over the next two years. This is yo-yo 
accounting. One year the government jacks it up, the next year it 
cuts down and says it is saving money. This is no way to do things.
<P>
	Let us be realistic. If cuts are to be made, let us cut, let us cut 
now and let us get the benefits so that we can ensure that things are 
going well.
<P>
	My last point is defence. I have some correspondence from the 
minister of defence. Last year he said that the estimate to build a 
new range in CFB Gagetown was $2 million. I see in the estimates 
it is going to cost $3.5 million. That is a 75 per cent increase over 
the estimate in one year.
<P>
	In Shilo, Manitoba, construction estimates according to 
documents that I have was $29.9 million last year and is now going 
to cost $47.2 million. That is increase of 58 per cent over the 
estimate of less than one year ago. There is no management in 
defence. In the meantime it has been cut overall by 21 per cent. 
There are morale problems in the ministry of defence. The chief of 
defence staff has said he cannot even fight a war to defend 
Canadians. Budgets are being cut and the estimates are out to 
lunch. There is a problem in the management of  the department of 
defence. It should be fixed and fixed now.
<P>
	I look forward to examining these estimates in committee over 
the next few months. Reform members will be calling the 
government to task. We expect that if we point out real, meaningful 
and
<P>
intelligent savings that government members will agree to them 
and amend these estimates when we vote on them in the months to 
come.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we often say that we should sleep on something, and I did. 
However, I am still of the same opinion as yesterday, and I have the 
same arguments against the last budget of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	To us, this budget is window-dressing. It was a big production 
meant, first and foremost, to hide the real damaging effects of the 
finance minister's measures on the economy and on jobs, and to 
hide also the real state of the federal government's finances.
<P>
	The minister who, for months, has been saying that he is a good 
manager, that he will reach his budgetary targets and make sure we 
see a definite improvement in public finances, forgot to tell us that 
the accumulated debt will top $600 billion this year. He forgot to 
tell us also that since he has been in the job, and after three 
consecutive budgets, he has added more than $110 billion to the 
debt. Is that good management of public finances? Is that 
controlling the medium-term debt? Is that having regained control 
of public finances? I wonder whether it is not the contrary. I does 
not make any sense.
<P>
	If it had not been for the Unemployment Insurance Fund which, 
after a reform that everybody is denouncing across Canada, 
produced an annual surplus of $5 billion; if it had not been for the 
systematic transfer of deficit problems to the provinces; if it had 
not been for the economic growth of the last two years, the Minister 
of Finance would certainly not have reached his target for the 
deficit, which is 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	It is by tampering with reality, by dipping into a fund to which it 
does not contribute any more-the unemployment insurance 
fund-by dumping its responsibilities onto the provinces and by 
taking into account the evolution of the economic situation only 
that the Minister of Finance gets to present this overall picture.
<P>
	But this is no way to improve public finances. This is no way to 
put public finances back on the right track. There are two ways, and 
both involve systematic elimination of the shameful waste that we 
have seen for the last two and a half years. Since we have been 
elected, we have come to know the machinery of government. We 
know there is waste, we know there is duplication, we know there is 
a lot of overlap.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	As far as this first way of really improving public finances, the 
Minister of Finance announced yesterday that the fight against 
waste is over. This is no joke. Even in his budget plan, we see in his 
table on page 14 that, in the direct budget savings for 1996-97, he 
expects additional cuts in the government machine of 0.0; that 
means zero. There are no cuts this year. It is over. There is no more 
waste, no more duplication, no more overlap, no more fat 
anywhere. It is zero.
<P>
	Next year, it will be 0.2; what does it mean? It means $200 
million in a budget of over $150 billion. It is an insult to taxpayers 
in Quebec and Canada to present such a plan for reducing waste, 
for downsizing the cumbersome government machine. And the 
Minister of Finance claims to be a good manager of public 
finances.
<P>
	Why, for example, did he not follow the suggestions of the 
official opposition, which asked him, among other things, to 
continue to make massive cuts in national defence? It is not normal 
that, in peace time, the armed forces still require an investment of 
tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of dollars in different 
types of war time equipment. There is talk, for example, of 
anti-tank missiles or ultra sophisticated equipment for submarines.
<P>
	There is talk of investing in all kinds of weapons and equipment, 
when all experts agree that we could cut $1.5 billion from the 
defence budget and amend DND's mandate so as to provide for the 
maintenance of peacekeeping forces around the world. That is the 
way to make public finances healthier and more rational-common 
sense would also prevail.
<P>
	Why did they not propose, for example-and I am sure that most 
taxpayers in Canada and Quebec would be agreeable-cutting the 
nearly $50 million allocated to the other House, to 
parliamentarians who doze off during the throne speech? People 
noticed that, too. The time has come not only to get rid of the 
deadwood but also to give in to official opposition demands to 
eliminate, once and for all, all appropriations to these people who 
are paid to do nothing or to sleep.
<P>
	As for the ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' that were promised in the last three 
years, this slogan can still be heard but it is getting fainter and 
fainter as the months go by, for the very good reason that this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="396"> 396 </A></B>
<P>
government not only did not put forward significant measures to 
create good, lasting jobs but also made cuts, in the finance 
minister's last  budget, that apply to the levers or ways used to 
create jobs.
<P>
	Let us take, for instance, the finance minister's attack on labour 
sponsored venture capital funds. This is incredible. The Fonds de 
solidarité des travailleurs du Québec, for example, works well and 
helps maintain 40,000 jobs. Yesterday, the finance minister decided 
to pull the rug out from under their feet- this also applies to the 
newly created CSN fund-thus undermining this instrument that is 
so important to Quebecers. This is not normal.
<P>
	It is not normal to talk about creating jobs while at the same time 
undermining the basic tools used to create jobs and spread the 
benefits of economic growth throughout Quebec. The same goes 
for Canadian funds in all parts of Canada. This is what they call 
taking measures to promote employment? Had we known this, we 
would have explained to the people that when they were talking 
about ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', what they really meant was job cuts. That 
is what the government was proposing.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Student summer employment, that too is to laugh at the face of 
students in Quebec and Canada. A sum of $120 million has been 
earmarked for student employment creation, it is true. But did you 
know how much money was taken away from students through 
transfer cuts to post-secondary education and so on? This year, the 
government has cut or plans to cut $150 million.
<P>
	Do you know how much will be cut next year? Approximately 
$500 million. On the one hand, $650 million is taken away from 
students over two years, while, on the other hand, $120 million will 
be provided to create summer jobs. I can understand why they are 
upset and why they came out, Mr. Rebello first, to denounce the 
government's attitude. They are being laughed at.
<P>
	Another measure designed to discourage job creation was 
announced yesterday in the finance minister's speech. As you 
know, to maintain one cent of the employees' or employers' 
contribution to the UI fund, the jobs of 6,000 Quebecers or 
Canadians have to be sacrificed.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance could have announced yesterday plans 
to substantially reduce the unemployment insurance premiums 
paid by employers and employees. Instead of appropriating the UI 
fund surplus he could have announced that it would be used to 
alleviate some of the problems faced by the economy these past 
couple of years in creating employment. He could have come out 
and said: ``We will balance our budget by systematically 
eliminating waste and create thousands of jobs by lowering 
employer and employee premiums''.
<P>
	Instead, premium levels remained unchanged. When we hear 
that this government is about jobs, never has it been more obvious
<P>
than yesterday that this government is working against the creation 
of the thousands of jobs our economies need, in Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	Regarding the Canada social transfer, the minister announced, 
and immediately recanted-but it is nonetheless written on page 59 
of his budget plan-that cuts would be shared among the provinces 
on the basis of population.
<P>
	What does this mean? I will repeat it over and over again: This 
means that Quebec, which represents about 25 per cent of the 
population, will support 40 per cent of the cuts to the Canada social 
transfer. On page 59 of his budget plan, the minister said, and I 
quote: ``-each province's allocation will be further adjusted to 
more closely reflect its share of Canada's population''.
<P>
	Solutions are thus being delayed by a few years, but the 
machinery is clearly on the move to have Quebec absorb 40 per 
cent of the cuts to be made under the social program transfer.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister told us: ``Do not worry. The issue will be 
discussed. Nothing is definite yet''. Well, maybe nothing is 
definite, but there seems to be a clear and precise intent in the 
budget toward making cuts based on population, and Quebec would 
clearly lose out if other criteria than population were applied. That 
is unacceptable.
<P>
	Does anybody know what the cuts imposed by the federal 
government on the provinces will amount to this year and the next? 
These cuts of $2.5 billion plus $4.5 billion will total $7 billion in 
the next two years, and Quebec alone will lose $650 million this 
year, more than $1 billion next year, and 5 billion over the three 
following years. For the government, stabilizing public finance 
means offloading its deficit onto the provinces and making Quebec 
pay more than its fair share.
<P>
	With this budget, not only harmful budgetary measures are being 
introduced, but principles are being trampled.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Some struggles lasted for decades, but now the gains that were 
made are simply pushed aside. I am referring to the measures 
proposed in the budget regarding old age security and women.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance decided that the progress made by 
Quebec and Canadian women was not important. In just three lines, 
he pushed aside what was gained over 50 years of hard struggle to 
promote gender equality and financial independence for women by 
making these priorities secondary issues and moral values for 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	The minister proposes to use the family income as a criterion to 
determine the level of benefits to be paid to  Quebec and Canadian 
households. This clearly penalizes women. Earlier today, I listened 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="397"> 397 </A></B>
<P>
to the reaction of some women. They were outraged by the fact that 
the government's action will set them back several decades behind.
<P>
	Remember, not that long ago, when a woman had to get her 
husband's signature to borrow money at the bank. What difference 
is there between using the household income, to which the man is 
usually the main contributor, and the way loans were granted to 
women a few years ago? In terms of principles involved, it is a 
shame to have included such a measure in a budget.
<P>
	Let us now take a look at the tax system. Yesterday, the official 
opposition made what I would call a small gain. Why? Because the 
Minister of Finance has finally understood that there were 
inequities in Canada's tax system, that there were all kinds of 
loopholes in the corporate tax system, and that, ultimately, every 
Quebec and Canadian taxpayer pays for the loopholes used mostly 
by major corporations to avoid paying their due to Revenue 
Canada.
<P>
	After urging and pressuring the government and the Minister of 
Finance for two and a half years, we have finally convinced them 
that it is necessary to do a major clean-up in the corporate tax 
system, whose exemptions cost us at least $10 billion 
annually-and this figure is based only on the measures that are 
known, because we do not know the impact of just as many 
loopholes.
<P>
	The minister has just realized that you clean up government 
finances not by making cuts that impact on provinces, not by 
making cuts in the unemployment insurance account, not by 
surfing on the economic conditions, but by taking action in an area 
which I feel is fundamental, taxation.
<P>
	We see that, while he realized that, he does not really intend to 
do anything to remedy unfairness in the tax system. Why? For two 
reasons. First, he proposes to establish a working group, which he 
calls a technical committee on business taxation. The members of 
that working group will be mandated to work behind closed doors, 
in camera, without anybody knowing where their discussions are 
going and exactly what tax breaks are available to 
businesses-some might no longer have any justification-and the 
cost of these tax breaks to the public purse. If they work behind 
closed doors, it may be to hide a little strategy that would go like 
this: change two or three tax breaks; then, once two or three of 
them have been changed, say that nothing more can be done.
<P>
	That is not what the minister was asked to do. That is not what 
Quebecers and Canadians expected from the finance minister. We 
asked for an open process, for a special parliamentary committee 
that would swiftly review, in the open-that is what democracy is 
all about- the whole range of tax breaks available to big 
corporations at a cost of billions of dollars to the public purse, year 
after year.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	This is what we wanted and what the people want. Instead of 
that, we are faced with a closed process, a review that will take 
place behind closed doors. What kind of credibility can such a 
review have? How can we trust it?
<P>
	There is something far worse than that, however. If one looks at 
the membership of this working group, one realizes that it does not 
make any sense to have people from corporations or universities 
who not only have their own set agenda, but may also be in a 
conflict of interest because of the committee's mandate. We notice 
for example that one member comes from the Simon Fraser 
Institute, an institution not particularly well known for 
social-democratic leanings. It is not known to favour big business 
having to pay its fair share of taxes. It clearly came out in favour of 
cuts in social programs as the only means to get our financial house 
in order. Here we have a representative of that venerable institution 
on a committee whose mandate is to review the corporate tax 
system and point out to us unfair aspects of the system we can deal 
with so that all corporations, and not only some of them, pay their 
fair share. That is quite something. It certainly does not do much 
for the credibility of this working group.
<P>
	But there is even worse than that. People from Ernst &amp; Young 
and Price Waterhouse will sit on this technical committee whose 
mandate, I repeat, is to find out how we can close loopholes 
corporations and big taxpayers use to avoid tax. One of these is tax 
havens. For the last two years and a half, we have been decrying the 
tax treaties Canada has signed with countries that are considered 
like real tax havens, such as the Caribbean or many others. In these 
11 countries, corporate income tax rates are a lot lower than ours, 
something like 10 per cent of the Canadian tax rate. Therefore, 
profits are transferred to affiliates set up in these tax havens, taxed 
at a much lower rate than the Canadian one, and then sent back 
here. These profits are not subjected to any further taxation 
measure. By transferring their profits and losses in this way, 
corporations manage to avoid paying any taxes to Revenue Canada.
<P>
	Well, can you believe that the two companies I referred to 
earlier, Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young, both have affiliates 
in countries considered as tax havens? That is unbelievable.
<P>
	As the Leader of the Opposition put it so eloquently yesterday 
and again today, that is like inviting the fox into the henhouse, and I 
would even go so far as to say that it is like inviting the fox to 
lunch.
<P>
	``Price Waterhouse, P.O. Box 3910, Nassau''. Do the hon. 
members want the phone number? I have it. ``Ernst &amp; Young, 
Nassau, the Bahamas''. ``Ernst &amp; Young, Gibraltar'', that is 
another country considered to be a tax haven. ``Ernst &amp; Young, the 
Cayman Islands'', the best of all tax havens, with 28,000 
companies for  30,000 people. Incredible, right? ``Ernst &amp; Young, 
rue d'Italie, Geneva'', Switzerland being another famous tax 
haven. ``Price Waterhouse, Les Échelons Street-nothing to do 
with taxation echelons, as we call them in French-, Guernsey'', 
the British Isles; another marvellous tax haven. ``Price Waterhouse, 
P. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="398"> 398 </A></B>
<P>
O. Box 3910, Nassau, the Bahamas'', again, I have the fax and 
phone numbers for those who think it might be useful.
<P>
	That does not make any sense. Quebecers and Canadians are 
being laughed at. The minister no longer has the political will to 
solve the problems related to corporate income tax. He no longer 
has the political will to do so. This hare-brained scheme, this 
creation of a closed group with obvious conflicts of interests, 
proves it. They talk of a delay in the production of a paper, which 
could come out sometime by the end of the year, because it is still 
on the agenda. This paper will probably be released after the 
election.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	This reminds me of the initiative that the Minister of Finance 
announced last year concerning family trusts. He said: ``Yes, we 
will abolish some privileges associated with family trusts but only 
in 1999'', giving all those with millions and millions of dollars 
stashed in these luxury tax exemptions enough time to find other 
tax shelters, thus denying the government any new money, since 
capital will have fled by 1999 to other tax havens in order to avoid 
taxation.
<P>
	The only tax initiative in this paper by the Minister of Finance is 
the creation of the Canada Revenue Commission. The only purpose 
of this sole initiative is to once again isolate Quebec. In his paper 
titled: <I>Budget Speech</I>, which he read to us yesterday, the finance 
minister told us: ``Canadians know full well that there is only one 
taxpayer. A number of provinces have asked us why there was not, 
as well, only one tax collector?''
<P>
	This is the object of the Canada Revenue Commission.
<P>
	Has anyone realized what we are saying in these two sentences to 
Quebec, which is the only Canadian province to levy its own 
income tax, the only one that acquired, the very hard way, since Mr. 
Jean Lesage, the tax autonomy that it had always wanted and that 
went with Quebec's distinct society?
<P>
	Does the minister of Finance realize that what he is saying about 
the possibility of setting up a national revenue commission, 
combined with the provision in the speech from the throne 
concerning the possibility that the federal government would create 
a Canada-wide program in areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction, where a majority of provinces agree, makes for a very 
explosive mixture? Does he realize that?
<P>
	Sometimes, I wonder if the minister of Finance is aware of the 
impact of his budgetary policies. Ever since taking power, he has 
announced a whole series of measures aimed at, firstly, isolating 
Quebec, and  secondly, further centralizing all aspects of social, 
economic and political life in this country.
<P>
	He has announced a national securities commission, in a field of 
exclusive Quebec jurisdiction. No problem, let us do it! Last year, 
he announced Bill C-100 on financial institutions. Once again, the 
Bank of Canada and other federal institutions are moving in and 
even shoving aside institutions such as the Quebec Securities 
Commission or the Inspector General for Financial Institutions.
<P>
	Now we are being told that it might be a good idea to do away 
with duplications and overlaps, and why not, while we are at it, do 
away as well with the tax autonomy of the Quebec government. 
Now that takes a lot of nerve! On top of that, he has something 
planned which has been in the works for about two years, and that 
is the implementation of a Canada-wide sales tax.
<P>
	This national sales tax would be administered by the Canada 
Revenue Commission; as a result, if the government of Quebec 
decides it does not want this second version of the GST, it will be 
forced to accept it because it is said clearly in the speech from the 
throne that if a province wishes to opt out of this new national 
program, it could do so only if it proposed to apply exactly the 
same program with the same criteria or equivalences in the 
province.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	In other words, if the federal government decides to create a new 
national sales tax that is not wanted in Quebec because the Quebec 
government wishes to control its tax base, what goods and services 
to tax or not to tax, it will not be able to do so because it will be 
forced to accept the new tax, a majority of provinces having 
decided otherwise in its place. Those are the hidden intentions 
behind the budget speech and the orientations of the speech from 
the throne.
<P>
	When we are talking about disguising, that is also what we mean. 
And it is ironic, as I said yesterday, and I will say it again today, 
that when it is speaking of eliminating duplications and overlaps, 
the federal government is not looking in its backyard, but in the 
provinces' backyards. That is where, in its opinion, duplications 
and overlaps are to be found, even in strictly provincial fields of 
jurisdiction. That takes the cake!
<P>
	One last point on which I would like to inform the people of 
Quebec, and of Canada as well, is the treatment of the milk subsidy, 
which affects particularly Quebec's milk producers.
<P>
	You will recall that, last year, the minister of Finance cut $32 
million in the budget for Quebec's milk producers. While cutting 
$32 million in the budget for Quebec's agricultural sector, it 
planned to increase by $2.9 billion the credits extended to the 
Prairie provinces. It planned to make $32 million worth of cuts in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="399"> 399 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec while increasing by $2.9 billion the credits allowed to the  
Prairie provinces. Such is the Canadian agricultural policy.
<P>
	What the minister told us yesterday is that not only did Quebec 
pay more than its share while the Prairies received several billion 
dollars more, but also that the government has made a unilateral 
decision to cut all subsidies to dairy producers in Quebec and 
Canada. This decision affects Quebec producers in particular since 
approximately 47 per cent of industrial milk production subject to 
subsidies comes from Quebec. Strangely, this measure hurts 
Quebec. There are no phoney committees set up, no panels of 
experts who are in a position of conflict of interest and who are 
prejudiced. The government has decided to cut and that is all there 
is to it.
<P>
	Do you know how much Quebec dairy producers will lose? 
Between $80 and $100 million. In tough times, at a time when they 
have to adjust to the new rules imposed by the recent World Trade 
Organization agreement, to the opening of the borders and to 
stronger competition, at a time when they have to consolidate their 
industry to be more competitive in a global trade environment, the 
government is depriving them of $100 million, and we are 
supposed to think that this is a good budget. That is going a bit too 
far.
<P>
	The conclusion is the same as yesterday. I hear my Liberal 
colleagues who are laughing. They think that this inequity, this 
unfairness toward Quebec is funny.
<P>
	In closing, I move the following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the word ``That'' 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the budget statement by the Minister of Finance be rejected by this House 
because: it proposes no real job creation initiatives and does not reduce 
government spending, most notably the approximately $50 million 
appropriated annually to the Senate; it uses the Unemployment Insurance Fund 
surplus to reduce the budget deficit and reduces social transfers to the 
provinces; it undermines labour sponsored venture capital funds, such as the 
FTQ and CSN funds; it does not propose a transparent process for achieving 
genuine reform of corporate taxation, or an unequivocal determination to 
undertake such reform; it undermines the provinces' fiscal autonomy; it 
eliminates subsidies to dairy producers without offering them adequate 
financial compensation; it jeopardizes women's financial independence by 
adopting household income as the basis for determining seniors' benefits.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment is in order.
<P>
	We now move to the next stage of debate where members will be 
entitled to a 20-minute intervention subject to 10 minutes of 
questions or comments, unless there are other indications as to 
whether members might be splitting their time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be taking 10 minutes.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you remember a time when you had aches and 
pains and went to the doctor for help? He may have given you some 
bitter tasting medicine and assured you that you would be well in 
two weeks. When you left the doctor's office you probably already 
felt better because your worries were relieved and you knew that all 
would be well within a definite period of time.
<P>
	Canadians feel the pain and are worried about their economic 
situation. There are 1.4 million of them who are unemployed. Their 
neighbours who work for the government are expecting a pink slip 
any day. The daughter graduating from university has no job yet. 
There is a long wait at the hospital for the operation needed by one 
of their relatives. There is disturbing talk about the viability of the 
Canada pension plan. This is only a partial list of what worries and 
pains Canadians in 1996.
<P>
	Canadians expect their doctor, the government, to help them. 
They expect the budget to offer relief and hope. They were 
disappointed. The doctor said: ``Keep on taking the bitter medicine 
I prescribed for you last year. Sorry, while I think you will be all 
right, I cannot give you a definite date when you can stop taking the 
medicine and stop worrying''.
<P>
	Canadians are not satisfied with the measures by the government 
in this budget. The measures are not adequate to restore fiscal 
balance within a definite time frame. The uncertainty continues as 
there is increasing talk about a recession, another Quebec crisis or 
international financial upheaval.
<P>
	Just a tiny bit more medicine in the form of spending reductions 
in this budget would have done the trick. Canadians were ready for 
it. They want to get it over with. They want to get back to normal. 
What did they get instead? A budget that interrupts a momentum 
gained by last year's tough love measures.
<P>
	No one believes that next year's budget leading up to an election 
will restore this momentum. These facts are also known to 
international investors. They will not give up their demand for 
getting at least one or two points more on Canadian bonds than they 
can get on U.S. bonds.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	As a result there is no interest rate relief. High interest rates are 
the main obstacle to job creation. They burden Canadians with 
higher mortgage payments and leave them with less income to 
spend on consumer goods and services that would result in the 
hiring of more Canadians. Investors cannot afford to build those 
factories. The interest costs make them non-competitive in 
international markets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="400"> 400 </A></B>
<P>
	What worries Canadians also is what a number of media reports 
noted. The budget signals a shift away from deficit fighting into 
an election mode. The traditional Liberal methods for buying votes 
have reappeared.
<P>
	Money we do not have is being spent to help summer student 
employment. I feel sorry for those students when in a few years 
they become taxpayers and have to repay these gifts from Ottawa in 
full, plus an awful lot of interest on top.
<P>
	Money we do not have is going into the support of high tech 
industries. There are pious assurances that the money goes out 
through recoverable loans and in partnership. Some leaders of high 
tech industries say they do not want such programs. They do not 
like having to pay general taxes so that money can be given to 
competitors who will make life tougher for them. They know there 
are plenty of venture capitalists out there who lend money to those 
with economically viable projects and who are large enough to 
spread the risk.
<P>
	It is only the high tech ventures that are rejected by the private 
investors as being too risky that the government will support. 
Almost by definition, a collection of them will end up not earning 
enough to repay the government. This is how loans made by the 
government inevitably turn into subsidies.
<P>
	Finally, I am on a personal crusade to point out the almost 
criminal injustice that is being perpetrated on future generations of 
Canadians. They do not have a vote in Parliament. No one in the 
system is representing them. They can be taxed without cost to 
sitting politicians.
<P>
	We are passing on to the helpless future generations not just a 
visible debt which already requires to service it about $50 billion of 
interest every year or 35 per cent of current tax revenues, but we 
also have burdened them with the cost of services for the elderly. It 
has been estimated that when the bulk of baby boomers retire in 
2030, young or unborn Canadians will be required to pay another 
$50 billion for medicare, old age security benefits and the Canada 
pension plan.
<P>
	Only economic growth, expected to be small, will relieve them 
of the burden of having to pay at least 70 per cent of tax revenue on 
the visible and hidden debt they are inheriting. The interest of these 
unborn or young Canadians obviously does not carry any weight in 
the minds of those who designed this budget.
<P>
	It may be on target, as the minister keeps on boasting, but it is 
also adding shamelessly $90 million a day to the visible debt. I ask 
the minister and his colleagues: Where is the vaunted Liberal 
compassion? Does it get applied only to those who can vote for 
them in the next election? Do the young and future generations 
count for naught because they cannot vote?
<P>
	Let me summarize Reform's and my objection to this budget. It 
coasts. It is giving up momentum in the move to a balanced budget. 
It fails to provide a definite end to the nation's trauma and 
uncertainty. It delays the time we are out of the tunnel and the sun 
shines once more on the possibility of lower interest rates, more 
jobs, tax reductions and a return to the good old times when 
budgets are balanced. It sends the wrong message by starting the 
traditional Liberal spending that precedes and election. It shows no 
compassion for future generations. It is a bad budget for the current 
generation; it is a terrible one for future generations.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding after the word ``Senate'' the 
following: ``and in particular, its impact on investor confidence results in these 
investors continuing to demand high interest rates on Canadian bonds, which 
delays economic and normal job creation'' and;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By adding after the words ``transfers to provinces'' the following: ``and in 
particular it does not offer Canadians a definite date within this government's 
mandate in which the deficit is eliminated, and in which economic growth once 
again would make feasible discussions about tax cuts, debt reductions and the 
restoration of social program spending''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will take the suggested 
subamendment on behalf of the member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound under advisement. I will ask our clerk and table officers 
simply to verify that it is procedurally in order and I will render 
that decision momentarily.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound lamented 
and shed endless crocodile tears that the budget spent money the 
government did not have and thereby increased the deficit. I know 
that he and his party are enthusiastic at the prospect of reducing the 
deficit, but I did not hear in his speech anything about the proposals 
for cuts he would make in government spending. I know they do 
not like cuts in defence spending.
<P>
	I would like to have the hon. member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound tell us where he would cut the billions of dollars required to 
bring the dollars into balance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
Indeed it is a legitimate question.
<P>
	I do not believe that in the past opposition parties have been as 
courageous and open as the Reform Party has been in presenting 
alternative budgets, even though the job to propose methods is the 
responsibility of the government, not the opposition. The 
opposition's task is to criticize, and this is our main task. As I 
suggested, we have done so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="401"> 401 </A></B>
<P>
	I will send the member the taxpayers budget as prepared last 
year. In there all of the cuts are presented. I did some calculations. 
It would take 5 per cent out of program spending this year and 
next year and the sun would shine on Canadians again. We would 
be out of the tunnel.
<P>
	From what I hear from my constituents, this is what they would 
like to have more than anything else. They have continued pain and 
uncertainty of having to take bitter pills of continuously hearing 
cuts already on the books and which are still coming, and yet there 
is no hope.
<P>
	This is a budget without hope. Everything is more cuts. More 
cuts have been announced for 1998-99, outside of the range of the 
government. That is all it is. There is no hope, nothing but pain. I 
believe it is a strategic error to do that, on top of the fact that the 
government has on its books an increase in the debt of $112 billion, 
if all goes well, which many are questioning.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	It will be over $600 billion that we are handing to future 
generations. I want to know how the member opposite will face his 
grandchildren and tell them he has left them as a permanent gift the 
interest costs and amortization on $600 billion, and that he was in 
the House of Commons while it went from $300 billion to $600 
billion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Clearly a lot of members are 
anxious to participate in this debate, but I must now resume debate 
with the hon. member for Medicine Hat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
1993 election one of the things the Liberal government did was set 
up expectations. It campaigned on the promise that it would create 
jobs, jobs, jobs. Those were the expectations it left Canadians with.
<P>
	In the 1996 budget and over the previous two and a half years we 
have seen nothing that solves the problem of the high 
unemployment we have in this country.
<P>
	Today we have youth unemployment of 16 per cent to 18 per 
cent. We have 9.5 per cent overall unemployment. That is simply 
unacceptable. The government has failed miserably in its promise 
to create jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	There are many good reasons for that. One of the things 
Canadians were hoping for in this budget was some tax relief, some 
light at the end of the tunnel. There is nothing like that in this 
budget. This budget is simply a cipher. It is a willow wisp. There is 
nothing to it. It is hollow. Anything proposed is over the hill and 
into the next millennium.
<P>
	Canadians were hoping there would be something indicating 
stronger social programs down the road. They have certainly talked 
about the mechanics of social programs as they now exist and how 
they would change  them. There is nothing in this document that 
explains it all. Nothing explains where the money will come from 
to sustain these programs over the long haul. By continuing to add 
debt on to debt the government is simply weakening these 
programs.
<P>
	The government set very high expectations. It encouraged 
Canadians to think positively about what would come under a 
Liberal government. Unfortunately it dashed those hopes in the 
1996 budget. It is simply an empty document with a lot of hot air.
<P>
	It want to talk specifically about some of the challenges we face 
and how the government has failed to deal with these issues. I have 
talked about jobs, higher taxes and the unsustainability of social 
programs as they presently are. Now I want to talk about the cause 
of those things, why we have those problems.
<P>
	The reason we have high unemployment is not that the 
government has failed to come up with short term, make work job 
creation programs, dusted off programs from the 1970s. That is not 
why we failed to deal with the unemployment problem. The 
problem is a debt of $575 billion. That has contributed to a 
structural problem with unemployment. That is why we have had 
11 per cent, 10 per cent, and 9 per cent unemployment over the 
years.
<P>
	This budget has completely failed to deal with that problem.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberals are laughing at this. It is a big joke that we have 
unemployment. I do not think it is a joke. I do not think that when 
they went door to door saying they would solve the problem they 
made a joke of it. They led people to believe there was something 
serious going on and that they would solve it.
<P>
	They have failed miserably to address the problem in the budget. 
They have not got to the root of the problem, the huge debt of $575 
billion.
<P>
	The only way we can create the jobs Canadians so desperately 
desire is to lower taxes and interest rates. The only way to do that is 
to wipe out the deficit and begin to pay down the debt. They have 
failed completely to do that. They have added $112 billion to the 
debt over the course of their mandate.
<P>
	Not only have they failed to meet the hopes of Canadians with 
respect to jobs and job creation, they have contributed to the 
problem. They have added unemployment and for that they will be 
judged very harshly.
<P>
	One of the concerns Canadians have, particularly those who are 
job creators such as small business people, is that we have 
extremely high taxes. The finance minister and members opposite 
have been crowing that they did not raise taxes in the budget. 
Raising taxes should not be a standard of a budget; it should be the 
exemption.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="402"> 402 </A></B>
<P>
	We have seen 22 tax increases since the government came to 
power. It has added $5.9 billion to the personal debt load of 
Canadians. That is shameful. Is it any wonder there are record 
bankruptcies in Canada. Is it any wonder people are so pessimistic 
about the future of the country.
<P>
	The budget did not address that problem. There is no mention of 
tax relief. The reason there is no mention of tax relief is that the 
only way we can have tax relief is by wiping out the deficit. The 
government has failed miserably to address that problem.
<P>
	The government did talk about a tax of one kind, in a very 
innocuous way about the GST. If I remember correctly, during the 
election campaign hon. members opposite told Canadians they 
would abolish the GST. They would axe it. They would kill it.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister on CBC national television on 
October 18, 1993, a week and a half before the election, said the 
GST would be abolished under a Liberal government and if not she 
would resign. Two and a half years and three budgets later, the 
Deputy Prime Minister sits in her seat and smiles. She knows the 
government has succeeded with its ruse, at least until now.
<P>
	Canadians will not forget the issue. They will not forget that 
promise. They are already cynical about the promises politicians 
make. They will be very hard on the Liberals for that promise 
which they have failed to keep.
<P>
	Not only have they failed to keep their promise with respect to 
the GST, the very tax they said they hated and would abolish, one 
which the finance minister called a stupid and contemptible tax, but 
they are talking about augmenting and strengthening it. They are 
talking about making it a tax which would reach more goods and 
services. They are talking about creating a super tax which in 
Ontario alone, according to a recent University of Toronto study, 
would kill 70,000 jobs. How does that square with their 
commitment to create jobs? It does not square at all.
<P>
	I will talk about social programs. We have a situation in Canada 
today in which people are fearful about not being able to collect the 
pensions into which they have been paying over the course of their 
lifetime. The government has done nothing to address that issue. It 
has gone the other way.
<P>
	The government talks about making changes to RRSPs which 
would mean that Canadians could contribute only until age 69 
instead of age 71 and therefore they will not be able to save as 
much for their retirement. On the other hand CPP is in terrible 
danger. That works against the principle of merit. It works against 
the principle of initiative, that people should look after themselves. 
We are working against that. Why are we doing that? It makes 
absolutely no sense. We are making the pension system 
unsustainable on the one hand but also robbing  people of the 
ability to save for themselves on the other hand. It does not make 
any sense.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Again, is it surprising that people feel pessimistic when the 
government does not deliver on its implied promise that somehow 
things would be better when the Liberals got to power.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying Canadians want some hope. They want 
to feel optimistic about their future. This government led them on 
in the 1993 election by saying: ``We will provide you with jobs, 
jobs, jobs''. Implied in that was prosperity; implied in that was that 
we would have a strong social safety net. None of that is 
happening. Quite the contrary, it is going the other way.
<P>
	In fact this budget has been a budget of irresponsibility in the 
sense that despite the fact the government knows that these 
problems sit over the heads of Canadians like a very sharp sword, it 
has not done a thing to deal with them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened carefully to the hon. member. I was hoping perhaps 
he might share with us either his personal views or his party's 
views on a couple of specifics, namely the seniors benefit, the child 
support changes, the credit for infirm dependants and the charitable 
donation changes.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the fact that there were no issues 
which dealt with securing the social safety net. There are some very 
concrete specifics on which we would certainly like to hear from 
the Reform Party, particularly as they relate to seniors and young 
people. I would be anxious to have him respond to the specifics 
about what this government has proposed in this budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has asked me to 
comment on the specifics. Let me comment on them as a whole 
first.
<P>
	The government has majored on the minors with respect to these 
programs. It has tinkered with the mechanics of these various 
programs but it has not addressed the underlying problem which is 
that we do not have enough money to sustain these programs. That 
is the underlying problem.
<P>
	We do not have a particular problem with the direction in which 
the government has moved with respect to old age security and the 
guaranteed income supplement. It makes some sense to us. We 
have applauded the government for that. We have publicly said we 
agree with that direction.
<P>
	However to major on the minors gives people the impression 
that somehow the government is providing some long term 
sustainability for that program. That is not the case. We are simply 
going deeper and deeper into debt by not announcing a date by 
which we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="403"> 403 </A></B>
<P>
will balance  the budget. Therefore these programs ultimately are 
destined to become unsustainable.
<P>
	On the question of child support payments, we have a concern 
about what the government has proposed. I am very concerned that 
by heavily taxing people who are currently getting a tax deduction 
for paying child support, we are going to end up driving a lot those 
people away from making their child support payments.
<P>
	We support the idea that there should be stronger enforcement 
measures. There must be stronger enforcement measures. That is 
where the emphasis should be in our judgment. We also want to see 
more money end up in the hands of the children. That has got to be 
the idea behind this.
<P>
	In what the government is setting out to do I think it is going to 
end up driving a lot of people who pay child support payments 
away from doing that. It is going to give them an incentive to skip 
their child support payments.
<P>
	With some of the other things the hon. member has mentioned, 
for instance child tax credits and things like that, again the 
government has not got to the underlying problem. If we give 
somebody $120 or $10 more a month or whatever it is, that is 
peanuts compared to the debt the government is asking them to 
assume the moment they take on a job. They pay for that debt in the 
form of higher taxes and weakened social programs down the road. 
They pay for it in the form of higher interest rates. They pay for it 
in the form of higher unemployment. It is simply ludicrous to give 
them $10 in one hand and to take $10,000 from them on the other 
hand because of the interest on the debt.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Although tinkering around inside the envelope of the programs 
is fine, unless the government deals with the underlying structural 
problems then it is really not doing the job it was sent here to do.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to resolve the 
issue of the subamendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. An unfortunate 
clerical error has been made. Would you please in our 
subamendment insert the word ``recovery'' after ``delays 
economic'' so that the passage would read ``delays economic 
recovery and normal job creation''. Mr. Speaker, you have it in 
front of you so there will not be any ambiguity.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to thank the hon. 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound. Is there agreement?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Ultimately, the 
subamendment brought forward is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to lead off the debate 
for the government on the 1996 federal budget and to share my 
perspective on how our government views fiscal policy in the 
context of overriding economic and social priorities. But before I 
do that, I want to make a number of comments.
<P>
	Comments from the official opposition reflect a fundamental 
lack of logic, as Quebecers and other Canadians will see 
immediately. Perhaps it is only on the opposition benches that you 
can suck and blow at the same time. Let me give some examples.
<P>
	We often hear people from the official opposition sounding like 
Reformers, complaining that we are adding to the deficit. I heard 
that this morning. Yet two sentences later we hear it said not to cut 
and certainly do not cut defence in the province of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On the one hand they say the rich should pay more income tax 
but on the other they say it is not fair to take into account the family 
income, the combined income of rich people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They cannot have it both ways. They tell us to look at the tax 
system. We are responding and looking at the tax system but they 
do not want us to include people in that consultation that do not 
agree with their opinion.
<P>
	We hear from the third party the question of alternate budgets. 
Perhaps the reason that no alternate budget has been presented this 
year is that when Reform members presented last year's alternate 
budget they called for massive cuts immediately across the board 
and the only increase was going to be crime control and prisons. 
That is the kind of society they saw emerging from those cuts.
<P>
	This budget is the third mile post on our government's journey to 
securing fiscal stability and a dynamic competitive economy, an 
economy that can provide the jobs Canadians need and sustain the 
social programs we cherish.
<P>
	The plan announced yesterday consolidates and extends the 
actions taken in our earlier budgets. Together these implement a 
comprehensive strategy Canadians can believe in. This is an 
important point. The ultimate measure of any government's 
success is its credibility.
<P>
	All of us here are aware of the disrespect and cynicism felt 
toward the political system by too many Canadians. There should 
be no mystery about why they feel that way. Too often they have 
experienced governments that seemed focused on special and 
narrow interests and more concerned with private and hidden 
agendas.
<P>
	Our agenda is different. It is a public agenda to serve the interest 
groups that are the real heart of Canada. People who want jobs, who 
want medicare and social programs sustained; seniors and seniors 
to be, worried  about their pensions; children made vulnerable by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="404"> 404 </A></B>
<P>
family breakdown; students, young people looking for their first 
job experience; charities struggling to respond to the needs of 
Canadians: these are our vested interests. This budget provides 
them and every Canadian in every region with renewed hope for 
our future. We should be proud of that.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	I am also proud that our new initiatives do not violate the core 
commitment of getting Canada's deficit under control. We are 
reallocating funds to keep the trust of Canadians, not digging 
deeper into the pockets of besieged taxpayers.
<P>
	Let me underscore our fiscal philosophy. We are tackling 
Canada's fiscal problem not as a narrow goal in and of itself but 
rather because it is a fundamental component of national growth, 
new jobs, economic security and sovereignty. We will keep hitting 
or bettering our fiscal targets again and again and again. And that is 
the nightmare of the third party. Our fiscal progress to date and 
other actions are paying off. Canada's economic fundamentals are 
strong.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, let us begin by looking at this budget from a perspective I 
believe is everyone's concern: employment and economic growth.
<P>
	As the minister said, the changing nature of work and the 
evolution of the economy are such that ``we are facing a revolution 
whose scope and depth rival that of the industrial revolution 
itself''.
<P>
	Canadians know that direct job creation must come from the 
private sector. But it is incumbent upon the government to make 
sure the economic context is the best possible and favours the 
continuous economic growth necessary for job creation.
<P>
	This requires first of all a reduction of the deficit because 
deficits keep interest rates much too high. High interest rates 
hinder investments, employment, and consumption. In a nutshell, 
they are an obstacle to job creation.
<P>
	Deficit control requires, among other things, that we keep 
inflation low. This contributes to reducing pressures on interest 
rates and helps control the other costs of doing business. This 
makes Canada more competitive on foreign markets. We can also 
see the dividends derived from our ability to control the deficit and 
inflation.
<P>
	Short term interest rates have diminished by three percentage 
points since last year's budget. This means a saving of $2,400 a 
year on a $100,000 mortgage.
<P>
	Our increased competitiveness means a strong increase in our 
exports and a record exports surplus.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear that our work is far from over. Much more needs to be 
done. Continued progress begins with further fiscal improvement 
and the 1996 budget delivers. With our first two budgets we 
established rock hard foundations. With these measures our 
1995-96 and 1996-97 deficit targets bringing the deficit down to 3 
per cent of GDP are secure.
<P>
	The steps proposed in yesterday's budget consolidate and extend 
our first two budgets and further contribute to economic and 
financial objectives. We are maintaining our focus on reducing 
program spending because the debt is a problem created by 
government and the solution has to focus primarily in our own 
backyard. That is why of the cumulative fiscal actions we have 
taken from 1994-95 to 1998-99, a full 87 per cent have been 
expenditure savings.
<P>
	Together the budgets will contribute $26.1 billion in savings for 
1997-98. This action together with reform of employment 
insurance will ensure that we hit our new deficit target to reduce the 
deficit to 2 per cent of GDP in 1997-98. As the minister said the 
other day in this House: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. When the Liberals arrived the 
ratio was at almost 6 per cent of GDP. We are heading toward 2 per 
cent and beyond. We are getting the job done in a balanced, 
humane, sensitive, reasonable way.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The combined budget plans will deliver additional savings in 
1998-99 of $28.9 billion. This means the deficit will continue to 
drop. It is very important that the debt to GDP ratio also start to 
fall.
<P>
	Let me highlight one important fiscal measure we shall achieve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is changing financial needs-new money the government must 
borrow on lending markets.
<P>
	When we came to power in 1993-94, the federal borrowing 
requirement was $30 billion. In 1997-98, thanks to our initiatives, 
it will only amount to $6 billion, or 0.7 per cent of the GDP. In 
relation to the economy, this is the lowest level since 1970, which 
would mean that of all central governments of the G-7, Canada 
would have the lowest budget variance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is a related issue. It is not just that the federal fiscal 
situation is improving. The outlook for the provinces and the 
territories is also improving markedly. The provincial-territorial 
deficit was cut to $12.6 billion in 1995-96 from its peak of $25 
billion in 1992-93. That is a drop from 3.6 per cent of GDP to 1.6 
per cent.
<P>
	This year Canada's total government deficit should fall below 
the G-7 average to second lowest behind the United States. By 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="405"> 405 </A></B>
<P>
1997 the nation's total government  deficit should be the lowest of 
the G-7 based on other members' current plans. I am confident that 
is hard fact, not rosy rhetoric. The government is making sustained 
fiscal progress and it is driving the opposition crazy.
<P>
	However, the 1996 budget goes beyond bottom line calculations. 
As Liberals we know that financial reform must never be an end in 
itself. The steps we are taking to get our fiscal house in order are a 
means to an end. What is that end? It is lower interest rates and 
better job growth. These steps are a means to ensure that we can 
preserve the Canada that Canadians want.
<P>
	Canada's social programs can be preserved while being fiscally 
responsible. The two are not mutually exclusive. The 1996 budget 
establishes a long term funding arrangement for the new Canada 
health and social transfer which was announced in last year's 
budget. This long term funding arrangement will be stable, 
predictable and sustainable.
<P>
	The 1996 budget proposes a five-year legislative funding 
arrangement for the CHST covering the period 1998-99 through to 
2002-2003. At the end of the five-year period total CHST transfers 
are projected to be $2.3 billion higher than 1997-98. This will mark 
the first time the federal government has taken action to increase 
the growth in these transfers since the mid-1980s, contrary to some 
of the things we have heard in this House which have suggested 
that we will continue to cut transfers forever. The government is 
moving in the other direction with the 1996 budget.
<P>
	Most important, as part of this, framework legislation will be 
passed which says that cash transfers will never, ever fall below 
$11 billion. The cash component of the CHST will be maintained. 
A floor will be set. It may be above that but never below. As the 
minister stated yesterday, this will assure Canadians that the 
commitment of the national government in support of health care, 
post-secondary education and assistance to the poor will be intact 
and strong.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Measures like these to secure social programs on a macro level 
are vital, but if any group deserves special focus it is young people, 
especially those buffeted by family breakdown. This budget speaks 
to them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It announces a new child support system, a new strategy which is 
founded on the principle that children come first. First of all, 
according to the new system, child support payments will not be 
included in the income of the custodial parent for tax purposes, nor 
will they be deductible for the non custodial parent.
<P>
	Second, the government establishes guidelines for determining 
levels of child support in a fairer and more consistent manner, in 
order to reduce conflicts between parents who separate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is another element of the action plan. The government will 
be reinvesting the anticipated revenue gains from the new tax rules 
in measures to benefit children.
<P>
	Most Canadians agree it is time to prioritize the saving that are 
realized. Among other things, the working income supplement of 
the child tax benefit will be doubled. Beginning in July 1997, the 
supplement will go from a maximum of $500 to $750 and in July 
1998 it will be increased further to a maximum of $1,000.
<P>
	I have touched on some of the actions the budget will be taking 
to help children, but there is another vital component of the budget 
which is new support for the charitable sector.
<P>
	Past budgets have emphasized the need to look to the non-profit 
and voluntary sectors, to recognize the fine work they do and have 
indicated that Canadians will be increasingly looking to the 
non-profit, voluntary charitable sectors when government has 
declining resources to do everything it might wish to do. That is 
why the role of charitable organizations has become more 
important than ever.
<P>
	It is not enough for government to talk the talk, to say: 
``Canadians will have to look to that sector. They do a better job in 
some respects than government does in any event and it has to pull 
back''. We have to walk the walk. We have to give that sector the 
tools it needs to get the job done. The 1996 budget does that. It 
takes an important first step in helping that sector to do more by 
encouraging more Canadians to be partners with charities.
<P>
	It has been proposed, among other things, that the annual limit 
for tax assistance on charitable donations be raised from the current 
20 per cent of net income to 50 per cent and to 100 per cent in the 
event of testamentary gifts, gifts on death. Gifts of appreciated 
property will also be encouraged through the measures being taken.
<P>
	I want to stress that these are first steps because over the next 
year the government will be examining other ways to encourage 
charitable giving and charitable activities.
<P>
	This is a budget of wide ranging and dramatic action. No single 
speech can fairly reflect the scope of its plans: the proposed seniors 
benefit, plans to boost investment and youth training in technology 
and trade, the measures that will help young people increase their 
lifetime contributions to RRSPs and tax measures to encourage 
sustainable development. My hon. colleagues will be addressing 
these other areas in detail as this debate continues.
<P>
	I would like to close on the overall bottom line of this budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="406"> 406 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think that today's budget reproduces and intensifies the 
positive messages contained in the speech from the throne, so as to 
restore hope for Canadians in key sectors.
<P>
	We are continuing to restore fiscal health, an essential condition 
for job creation and economic growth. We are rethinking the 
government's role so that it better serves Canadians and the 
economy. We are securing the future of social programs, viable and 
fairer programs which help the most needy. We are investing in the 
future in order to provide new opportunities for Canadians in key 
sectors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When we came to office three years ago, the economic 
challenges seemed daunting. We have taken dramatic action and as 
a result the economic and fiscal fundamentals in Canada are strong 
and improving. We will neither squander that progress nor abandon 
Canadians along the way.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	I urge all hon. members to support the 1996 budget and help us 
get on with the job of securing Canada's future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened attentively to my colleague's speech. 
Finally, he himself stressed the weakest element in the budget 
speech and the budget itself.
<P>
	Today, we are experiencing a completely new situation in that 
there is economic growth, but not necessarily employment growth. 
When speaking of restoring hope among Canadians, we have to ask 
ourselves one question: Does the government have any solution 
that will give jobs to young people coming on the job market and to 
workers evicted from the work market by new technologies? Those 
are two categories of people who, today, cannot find a place on the 
job market despite the economic growth. Considering the budget's 
content on this aspect, it is not very promising.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member: Would it not have been better if the 
government had sent positive messages by making an asset out of 
the UI fund surplus? By cutting premiums or in some other fashion, 
the government could have made this money available instead of 
using it only to cover the deficit. Is the UI fund's surplus not 
something that should have been addressed in the budget speech as 
something that could become a positive instrument?
<P>
	The second element is: What message are you sending to Quebec 
regions for example when you make it so that the Fonds de 
solidarité des travailleurs-something that works, that allows 
capital venture investment of funds provided by workers-is less 
attractive under the Income Tax Act? That will certainly not help 
solve the job issue.
<P>
	The third part of my question is this: How can the federal 
government simply establish what it calls a technical committee on 
business taxation, when time and time again for the last two years 
the official oppsition has been asking for a review of business 
taxation? After two years and a half in office all the government 
does is to establish a technical committee. It says that this 
committee will be made up of economists and taxation experts, but 
no one will be representing the social view so people can come and 
ask questions on human resource utilization.
<P>
	In this society of ours, instead of being evaluated only according 
to the gross domestic product, why could we not be evaluated also 
on the way we develop all our human resources? How can we 
ensure that when 45 or 50-year old workers are laid off because of 
technical changes, they have an alternative, something to help them 
start another career. While there was still time before the next 
election to take concrete measures in favour of job creation why 
did the federal government not really give priority to the 
employment issue in this budget?
<P>
	Why is the government not dealing with current issues?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, beginning with the last point 
on the technical committee, I thought that the opposition members 
wanted to study business taxation and other taxation issues. What 
they are saying is that they know exactly what to do right now, so 
let us just do it. Let us not consult with anybody who disagrees with 
our opinion. Let us just do what they say. We see things differently. 
We think Canadians want into the discussion and the process.
<P>
	As for measures with respect to employment, the budget is right 
with those suggestions. As the opposition appears to be doing, I 
would not belittle the investment being made in youth. For 
instance, let us focus on the $315 million in budget savings which 
will be put into new employment opportunities specifically created 
for youth.
<P>
	Let us not overlook, as the opposition is apparently doing, the 
technology partnerships Canada program which is laid out in the 
budget which will bring direct results to the province of Quebec. It 
has depended to a great extent on the previous DIP for high tech 
and important jobs for young people.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Let us not overlook, as they seem to want to because they do not 
want to remind the House, improved funding, increased capital for 
the Business Development Bank of Canada and the Export 
Development Bank. That translates into investments and jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Let us not overlook getting the fiscal fundamentals right. That 
will also contribute to lower interest rates and more jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
since this is the first time I am addressing the House in this session 
with you in the chair, I congratulate you on the position. I know the 
decorum of this place will certainly improve with your excellent 
skills.
<P>
	I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance on his address to the budget.
<P>
	I was very pleased that he and the budget stressed the importance 
of protecting the rights of our children, especially the rights of 
children in a split marriage. Most parents, whether they live 
together or are separated, have the interests of their children at 
heart and provide support payments. However, there are always a 
few chronic defaulters who use children as pawns and do 
everything possible to delay the payments, to decrease them, et 
cetera.
<P>
	I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could tell the House if 
there is anything in the budget plans to pursue chronic defaulters. It 
is not the other spouse who suffers; the children suffer.
<P>
	I am pleased that Parliament is addressing the rights of the 
children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, the budget and in particular the 
new child support package do contain measures with respect to 
enforcement.
<P>
	Contrary to members of the third party who seem to feel we 
should look to the Income Tax Act to induce spouses to support 
their children, we believe that responsibility is there regardless of 
the Income Tax Act. We believe that parents under a court order or 
who have an agreement to pay certain amounts should meet those 
obligations. I think we all believe that parents have that obligation 
whether or not they have a written agreement to that effect. It is one 
of the fundamental principles of being a parent.
<P>
	In specific terms we are proposing as part of the program to deal 
with chronic default, with which the hon. member was concerned, a 
number of features: a federal licence suspension initiative; 
extended searches to trace defaulters; broader powers for the 
diversion of federal pensions; generally supporting those ideas 
with enhanced consultations with the provinces. To a great extent 
this is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. We are working very 
closely with the provinces on this matter which is of interest to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was looking at some economic statistics, some of which 
were in the budget, which indicate that in the first quarter of this 
year we have for the first time in some 23 years begun to turn the 
curve on the debt to GDP ratio.
<P>
	The opposition may not believe that. It comes from the 
University of Toronto's policy analysis group. It is a major change 
in direction.
<P>
	On a national accounts basis our cash borrowing needs for the 
year 1998 will be zero. That is a computer projection for the year 
1998. That basically says we will not have to borrow any new 
money to finance the deficit.
<P>
	I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary can confirm for us 
that our budget projections and the direction which the minister has 
taken in the budget will bring us to those computer projected goals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, I will not comment on those 
specific projections because I have not seen them.
<P>
	However, looking to the budget documents, taking us to 
1997-98, in that year our financial requirements will be 0.7 per cent 
of GDP, the lowest in a long time. The debt to GDP ratio in that 
year will be declining. Those two ratios will continue to improve 
after that.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
always a great moment in the life of a government and in the life of 
politicians when a budget is introduced. It is an important moment 
as we can tell when we see the media bustle feverishly around the 
House of Commons or the Quebec National Assembly trying to 
see, to understand if what is going to be announced will have some 
impact on our lives. They try to find out if all the affirmations made 
some days earlier in the different media, in the newspapers-a tax 
on this or that-will be confirmed and if the government will once 
again hit the taxpayer with new taxes or increases.
<P>
	In this case, I watched the media this morning and I read all the 
documents that the Minister of Finance tabled in the House. I 
worked with my hon. colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, 
who is the critic of our party on these matters, and with assistants to 
try to find out what the Minister of Finance had said and especially, 
what he had not said in his budget speech. I came to the following 
conclusion: either the government is short of ideas or it is preparing 
to call an election. We are going to discuss both scenarios.
<P>
	I repeat: the government has no imagination. I know that you are 
going to ask me to prove it and it will be an easy task. Experts 
admit that they have not seen such a minor, feeble, watered-down 
budget tabled in the House for in a very long time. The Minister of 
Finance gave us some general indications on the state of the 
economy, on his deficit predictions, on the state of the debt. He 
mentioned a few small programs here and there, made some nicely 
put announcements, but his speech did not really respond to the 
need to know of parliamentarians and experts alike.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="408"> 408 </A></B>
<P>
	I decided to push my analysis a bit further. I looked at the 
documents. I took this one, <I>The Budget Plan tabled in the House 
of Commons by the Minister of Finance</I>. On page 14, we can read 
``Direct budget savings''. Everybody knows, citizens asked us 
that, that the government's first objective is to reduce the size of 
the government. We absolutely must succeed in reducing the size 
of our governments, particularly the federal government, which 
is the biggest. The government must learn to withdraw, to do more 
with less, to reduce the size of its departments and organizations.
<P>
	I tried to determine what direct savings would flow from this 
budget. Normally, in a budget speech like the one that was 
delivered yesterday, the finance minister tells us that the 
government will reduce its spending by three or five billion dollars. 
That is normally what the minister should have done, but he did 
not. That made me think.
<P>
	I checked again and found that there will be absolutely no direct 
savings in the 1996-97 budget-and I use the minister's own 
numbers, Madam Speaker. None, and that is not much. There will 
be no savings in 1996-97. Zero savings, zero for the Minister of 
Finance. In 1997-98, the savings will reach $0.2 billion. I must 
come to the conclusion-and that can be checked-that the net 
impact of the budget on the reduction of the government's size will 
be nil. Zero again for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	That shows that the government is unable to reduce its own 
expenditures. But you will object that according to the estimates 
tabled this morning by the President of the Treasury Board, there 
will be some budget cuts.
<P>
	All these cuts result from previous budgets. As he is used to, the 
finance minister announced long term programs. We hear about 
cuts, but they will apply only next year. The cuts he talked about 
last year will show up this year in some departments. This year, the 
minister tells us that he is not cutting, which means that he 
considers he has finished downsizing the government. To me, that 
shows a considerable lack of imagination.
<P>
	After realizing that he had not cut spending, I decided to find out 
what he himself said in praise of his budget. I checked the 
document giving an overview of the 1996 budget. These documents 
from the Minister of Finance are quite interesting. In the first 
section of this document, the finance minister and his government 
talk about ``securing our financial future''. This is interesting. 
What they fail to say is that we will be paying for a long time. Let 
me explain.
<P>
	First of all, they say that the deficit will be cut to about 3 per cent 
of GDP, as though this 3 per cent was the ultimate objective, the 
philosopher's stone. Our spending will be cut to 12 per cent of 
GDP, which, according to the Minister of Finance, is a great 
achievement. So 3 per  cent of GDP, 12 per cent of GDP, and then 
next year's goal is to bring the deficit down to 2 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	I, however, looked at a different set of figures. This looked 
interesting. Like many others perhaps, I thought that the minister 
had done a terrific job and was on the right track, and then I looked 
at some other figures. The reality is this: Canada's debt exceeds 
$600 billion, or $20,000 per Canadian. This is quite something. I 
am not talking about 3, 2 or 15 per cent of GDP, but about the debt 
that we will have to pay: $600 billion, or $20,000 for every 
Canadian man, woman and child. Most interestingly, since this 
hon. Minister of Finance took the helm two and a half years ago, he 
has added $110 billion to the debt-as I figured out with my friend, 
the Bloc Quebecois' financial expert.
<P>
	In the last two and a half years, this minister who brags about a 
budget with nothing in it has increased the debt by $110 billion, or 
$3,700 for every Canadian man, woman and child. Did you realize 
that, since the Minister of Finance took over this portfolio, he has 
borrowed or incurred a debt of $3,700 for every Canadian-for 
everyone of us in this House, for every person listening to us, for 
every member of our families, for each of our children and 
grandchildren, for everybody we know. That is a huge amount of 
money.
<P>
	I looked at another figure that is more significant than the 12 and 
3 per cent of GDP. Thirty-six cents out of every dollar we pay in 
taxes-and we know what a tax dollar means-go to service the 
debt, to assume our collective responsibility for this debt.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance submit a budget he claims to be 
proud of? How can he brag and say: ``You see, we are reaching our 
goals''? The finance minister thinks he is a good manager who 
meets his targets, but his figures are meaningless for Canadians, 
considering that, in the last two and one half years, his government 
put them $110 billion deeper into debt, for a total of $600 billion, 
that it put an additional burden of $3,700 on each of them, bringing 
the total to $20,000 per capita, and that 36 cents of each dollar goes 
to the service of the debt.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I decided to go a little farther in my analysis. You will 
understand that I was disappointed to see the state of public 
finances, given what we were told by our friend the Minister of 
Finance. So, I went a little farther. In that same brochure, which 
MPs will use to sell this budget, it says: ``Getting the government 
right''. I find this rather cute. ``Further action is being taken to 
define a more appropriate and effective role for the federal 
government''.
<P>
	There is also a reference to Parliament's effectiveness. ``In the 
modern Canadian federation, most departments will have their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="409"> 409 </A></B>
<P>
budgets cut-''. Etc., etc., etc. I checked it out. I kept searching. I 
certainly did my homework,  Madam Speaker. I consulted a 
brochure tabled by the President of the Treasury Board on the role 
of the state.
<P>
	I expected, like most Canadians I am sure, to learn that the 
federal government would withdraw from certain areas, given that 
it is involved in numerous fields that do not come under its 
jurisdiction, that it does not even comply with its own Constitution 
in that regard, that it is way too big, cumbersome and loaded down 
with debts, that it has difficulty making good decisions, and that it 
is overburdened by its bureaucracy. I would have expected the 
government to say that it would withdraw from certain areas. We 
could have expected the federal government to give back to the 
provinces the areas of jurisdiction that belong to them, to put an 
end to all the duplication and to totally abolish some of the 
services, which are provided by some departments that have no 
business providing them, and which duplicate services provided by 
other levels of government.
<P>
	I found some real gems in this document. According to this 
action plan, the objectives of the federal government are to: 
``strengthen our economy and economic union to ensure a 
prosperous country for ourselves and our children-that is so nice; 
enhance social solidarity in Canada-in preserving and 
modernizing the social union so that the caring and sharing society 
is truly Canada-wide in scope-this is really fine; pool our national 
resources to achieve common goals efficiently and effectively; 
protect and promote Canadian values and identity while celebrating 
our diversity; and defend Canada's sovereignty and speaking for 
Canadians collectively on the world stage''.
<P>
	I found in the document a lot of principles and a lot of things that 
look quite trivial when you read them in a brochure like this one. 
However, when you know about the federal government's 
propensity to centralize and to interfere in areas of jurisdiction 
where it should not get involved, I think you are right to worry 
about the centralizing hidden behind all these nice principles.
<P>
	So, I reread the throne speech, the budget speech, and realized 
something: the throne speech indicated that ``the federal 
government would not intervene in areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction''. One must know the real meaning behind these 
words. ``The federal government would not intervene in areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction without-''
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> ``-without the consent of the majority of the 
provinces''. Which means that if the majority of the provinces 
consent, the federal government will interfere in areas in which it 
has no business.
<P>
	Instead of withdrawing, of minding its own business, of 
simplifying its machinery, the federal government has chosen to 
interfere still further in areas of exclusively provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	How can anyone conceive of a country where the main 
occupation of a government consists in seeking out areas of 
jurisdiction that do not belong to it, just to stir things up? To my 
knowledge, the only government that does so is the government in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	Evidence of this is easy to find. We have been told of the creation 
of a Canadian securities commission. This is an area in which the 
federal government has never been involved and in which it has no 
business being involved, one which will require it to rehire staff, to 
create a structure, to duplicate what is already being done in 
Quebec, to complicate things. And why? In honour of what? In 
honour of its so-called mission, or what it thinks is its mission.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The federal government has also announced its intention of 
creating a Canada revenue commission. ``It would be good if there 
were only one collector for all taxes in Canada''. In the course of 
history, not only has the federal government funded its war efforts 
through powers of taxation it did not originally have under the 
Constitution, but now as well it wants to collect taxes on behalf of 
all of the administrations in Canada. If this is how a government 
acts when it wants to cut back, to trim the fat, to mind its own 
business, my goodness, I wonder where we are headed. Over time, 
there is an increasing tendency for the government to want to poke 
its finger into areas where it has no business being.
<P>
	Some may reply that it might be worthwhile to eliminate 
duplication. That could be the case, if there were only one 
department of revenue, one national commission. Have you noticed 
how the federal government is in a rush to do away with 
duplication if that means cornering all of the powers for itself, and 
how reluctant it is to return those powers to their rightful owners?
<P>
	Not only is the federal government incapable of cutting its 
expenditures, not only is it incapable of staying within its own 
federal role and of leaving the jurisdictions of others alone, but on 
top of that it refuses to act in areas where it ought to have 
responsibility, employment for one. How many job creation 
measures-and this is another way of looking at the budget-did 
the Minister of Finance announce? Is the minister aware of the 
need to take action to create conditions that are conducive to job 
creation in this country?
<P>
	``Jobs, jobs, jobs'', as they were saying during the election 
campaign. So I checked. Did the minister announce major job 
creation measures? Although, in the budget document, the 
government claims to be investing in future jobs and growth, 
students and their families get nothing but crumbs: $165 million 
over three 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="410"> 410 </A></B>
<P>
years. In the last budget, the minister cut student funding by half a 
billion dollars. Last year, they cut half a billion dollars  but this 
year, they are investing in jobs and setting aside, for example, $165 
million for students.
<P>
	Have you ever seen anything like it? On the one hand, they cut 
millions of dollars and, on the other hand, they give away a few 
crumbs while bragging: ``We took action to stimulate employment. 
We are reallocating $315 million over three years to create new job 
opportunities for young people by, among other things, doubling 
the funds for student summer employment''. The federal 
government is incapable of taking action, of making changes, of 
supporting provincial governments adequately in their efforts to 
promote economic recovery, but it keeps unemployment hovering 
around 10 per cent in Canada and it tells us: ``We have allocated 
$165 million for students and their families, $315 million, over a 
three year period, for new job opportunities, including summer 
jobs''.
<P>
	The government shows a total lack of vision. This is a trim down 
budget. There is nothing regarding what was asked of the 
government itself. There is nothing about stimulating the economy. 
The only thing this government made in recent years was to ask 
other governments to make an effort. Indeed, the federal 
government asked provincial governments to absorb part of its 
deficit. It asked the provinces to absorb a total of $7 billion.
<P>
	It is easy for the federal government to lower its deficit when it 
tells the provinces: ``Look, you will no longer receive the money 
that you used to get from us''. So much for that. This means a 
shortfall of $7 billion for the provinces. It also means $5 billion 
less each year in the UI fund. It is easy to tell the unemployed: 
``Listen, there is a surplus of money in your fund, even though the 
government does not contribute one penny to that fund. That 
surplus of $5 billion per year comes from your own contributions 
and those of your employers. Nevertheless, we want to put that 
money in our pockets. This is part of the federal government's 
budgetary effort''.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Some $7 billion less for the provinces and about $5 billion taken 
every year from the UI fund. And the Minister of Finance tells us 
that these cuts will be maintained over a number of years. The 
minister says: ``Look at how good I am. I reached my objectives. I 
am a remarkable administrator and, in addition to all that, I also 
injected a few million dollars into the employment sector. Let us 
hear it for me, after all I am the best finance minister this country 
has ever had
<P>
	We are not fooled by the message that was delivered to us. The 
Minister of Finance has tried to disguise the bad news for the 
unemployed and for the women who will lose their financial 
autonomy when they reach retirement age, as a result of the 
changes the minister wants to make in a few years in the old age 
security program. So, bad news for the unemployed, for women, 
for young people too, who will be bearing the brunt of the sizeable 
cuts imposed upon them by the minister, despite the few  millions 
announced. Bad news for those who were hoping the federal 
government would finally learn to mind its own business and stay 
within its own areas of jurisdiction. Bad news, too, for those who 
had hopes that the government would finally trim some of the fat 
and become more productive.
<P>
	In short, this budget reflects one of two things: either the 
minister has totally run out of new ideas, no longer knows what to 
do, is running out of energy, sees himself as unable to do more and 
is settling for apologies about what he has done in his time as 
minister, or the government is getting ready to go to the people and 
is trying to butter them up a bit, to use a bit of subterfuge, to say 
``Well now, things may not be all that great, but neither are we all 
that bad a government after all''.
<P>
	Before I close, let me say that the people are not fools. We will 
never be able to accept a government that has put us into debt to the 
tune of some $3,700 per person in the past two and a half years still 
wants to invade areas of jurisdiction that do not belong to it, nor 
will we accept its refusal to trim the fat as it should, or that it is now 
coming to us with the explanation that the provincial governments 
need to do their part, need to reduce their deficits, need to assume 
the federal deficit, in short that it wants to direct things on behalf of 
everyone within the Canadian federation.
<P>
	I will be frank: Quebecers cannot accept such a budget. It is a 
cosmetic budget, one hiding the truth, one which may help the 
Minister of Finance and his government to hold on for a few more 
months, but it does not address the underlying problem. It does not 
address Canada's true financial situation, which is a disaster from 
all points of view. I believe that people have more respect for those 
who have courage and who know how to call things by their right 
name than those who try to disguise them with politics. This is a 
lesson the Minister of Finance ought to take to heart.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in the debate on the budget 
presented by the Minister of Finance. It contains measures to 
satisfy the main concerns that I brought forward on behalf of my 
constituents.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to go through some of the 
concerns of the constituents of Souris-Moose Mountain. Interest 
rates affect everything we do. Even a 1 per cent increase can mean 
a great deal to homeowners, farmers, those who wish to purchase 
machinery and to the mining companies if they are looking to 
expand their staffs or their businesses. Interest rates have come 
down over 3 percentage points since 1995.
<P>
	The act of keeping our fiscal house in order and doing it in a 
rational and balanced way is paying off. A lower deficit means 
lower interest rates, growing confidence in new investments 
leading to more jobs and growth. That  means jobs for young 
people as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="411"> 411 </A></B>
<P>
well. For us in Souris-Moose Mountain it offers an opportunity 
for hope.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	This budget offers a framework for that opportunity. We are 
encouraging education for young people, increasing tax benefits 
for students to allow them to continue, using summer employment 
as a mechanism.
<P>
	Jobs will also continue to come from increased trade. That will 
continue to be a priority of this government.
<P>
	One other thing that businesses in my area are concerned about is 
taxes. I am pleased to say we have set up a special technical 
committee to review the tax system to make it simpler and more 
effective. One more thing businesses are pleased with, and several 
phoned me last night, is we will make sure that banks do not enter 
into the insurance and the car leasing businesses. I am happy to 
announce that we have stayed the course and we recognize their 
concerns.
<P>
	My constituents told me: ``Do not raise taxes''. I can tell them 
there are no tax increases in this budget. There have been no 
personal tax rate increases in any of the three budgets since we 
were elected as the government.
<P>
	We continue to meet our deficit targets and to restore faith in our 
fiscal management through getting government right: reducing 
overlap, reducing waste and setting priorities that Canadians want.
<P>
	Another thing that is extremely important to my constituents is 
security for families now and in the future. That is why all of these 
actions in the budget are very positive for stability and 
sustainability. We want our programs to still be there for our 
children.
<P>
	In this budget we are acting now to ensure that social programs 
are affordable and will be there for Canadians in the future. We will 
restore growth to transfers to provinces and we will secure stable 
and growing funding for health, post-secondary education and 
social assistance.
<P>
	Let us examine for a moment the Saskatchewan situation. The 
CHST transfer to Saskatchewan will increase $50 million over the 
next five years. From the years 1998 to 2003 we will maintain that 
base level. As well, Saskatchewan will of course continue to 
benefit from equalization.
<P>
	Following consultations with the provinces, this budget put the 
CHST on a secure footing. There will be no further cuts to the 
CHST. It sets out new five year funding arrangements in which 
transfers are maintained and then grow.
<P>
	Also important to Saskatchewan is the federal equalization 
payments because they will grow also. There are arrangements to 
safeguard medicare, which is very important in Saskatchewan, and 
our social programs, and restores stability and predictability for 
provincial governments.
<P>
	This is the first time since the mid-1980s that the federal 
government has taken action to increase growth in these transfers. 
Our fiscal discipline is paying off. Getting our house in order and 
setting priorities has allowed us to now budget in growth in 
spending in the areas that count.
<P>
	Speaking of these changes, many constituents have been asking 
since the time I was elected to do something about the taxation of 
child support payments. It is now done. As of May 1, 1997 child 
support will be paid but will not be included in the income of 
recipients for tax purposes, nor will it be tax deductible for the 
payer. This is only part of the child support package which puts the 
emphasis where it belongs, on the welfare of the child.
<P>
	Many seniors have asked us to address their concerns with 
security for their grandchildren and security for themselves. I am 
pleased to see a new tax free benefit for seniors that will replace the 
old OAS and GIS benefits and will secure and ensure the long term 
stability and sustainability for seniors' pensions.
<P>
	These seniors benefits will help those who need it most while 
streamlining the program. It will make the system fairer. It will 
guarantee that all current seniors, in fact all those who are over 60 
years of age now, will receive no less than the current pension 
benefits. Most people will receive the same or more money under 
this system.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	We in Souris-Moose Mountain in the rural agricultural area of 
southeast Saskatchewan are heavily dependent on agriculture. 
These actions have a large impact upon us. As well, we endure 
many restrictions due to our rural nature. We must overcome 
distance and resource barriers to be able to contribute to the 
economy and support ourselves adequately.
<P>
	This budget builds on actions in the last two years that laid the 
foundation for changes in the west. Spending reductions, 
elimination of waste and overlap made room for spending in 
research, adaptation initiatives and trade. We need to see a 
continued focus in these areas laying the infrastructure or 
framework for a new revitalized agricultural sector.
<P>
	Subsidies have been eliminated and change is upon us. We need 
adjustment assistance for this major change. And so it has been 
delivered. This budget will see the time frame accelerated for 
distributing $300 million in the western grain transportation 
adjustment fund and $72.6 million under the feed freight assistance 
adjustment fund.
<P>
	Just this morning I spoke to the president of the Saskatchewan 
Association of Rural Municipalities, Sinc Harrison. He said how 
pleased he was that the government is moving quickly to put 
money into the hands of rural governments in a faster and fairer 
manner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="412"> 412 </A></B>
<P>
	Adaptation support is needed. And so our government delivers 
again. Direct producer delivery mechanisms for federal funding 
will set up adaptations and rural development funds and other 
adjustment initiatives.
<P>
	We continue to consult with producers and other stakeholders 
toward a more efficient grain handling and transportation system. 
We will be selling 13,000 hopper cars. We will continue to discuss 
with producers the most efficient way of doing this.
<P>
	This is the kind of budget my constituents have asked for. It is 
fairer across the board. It deals with all regions of Canada. It 
secures a future for us both fiscally and socially.
<P>
	As I travelled throughout my riding, constituents raised 
concerns. They did not want a fuel tax because we travel such a 
large area. There was no fuel tax. Others wanted streamlining. The 
minister has streamlined to make the Government of Canada run 
more efficiently.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to talk about youth employment 
programs. I talked to the mayor and some councillors in 
Broadview. They were really impressed with our youth 
employment program. I am glad to see we are going to double the 
youth employment program this summer to meet the needs of those 
students who want to go on to post-secondary education.
<P>
	In summary, let me say I am happy to be one of Team Canada's 
players. In a country as diverse as ours, it is a real privilege for each 
of us to be able to be part of a team that sets objectives and goals 
and meets them. We do not just talk about them; we meet them. We 
have set the challenges for the years to come. I know through our 
Minister of Finance and all who are involved we will meet those 
challenges.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
attentively to the remarks by the member who just spoke and I am 
tempted to ask him the following question: ``Could it be that his 
political partisanship is making him totally blind?''
<P>
	When comments are made on a budget as important as the one 
tabled yesterday, people have the right to know what it will cost 
them, what awaits them, what are the risks in job terms, what about 
their own jobs, how big is the debt. The Minister of Finance talks of 
2 per cent of the GDP, 3 per cent of the GDP and 15 per cent of the 
GDP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Of course, one must understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Would you be please quiet. It is a bit as if I took the 
minister's hat size, divided by his shoe size, less his waist size and 
said: ``There is the amount of your debt''. If he puts on weight, it 
does not work anymore. The same is true for the GDP.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We want Canadians to know that they are in debt to the tune of 
$20,000 each, babies born this morning arrive with a $20,000 debt. 
In the past two years, we have added $3,700 to their debt load and 
to that of those who are not yet born, but are on the way.
<P>
	I do not think we can close our eyes. The government appears to 
be acting like a windsurfer who has just come off a great big wave 
and is on the flat part of the wave. He is turned sideways and is 
getting ready for the next wave, whenever and however it comes.
<P>
	This is what a budget plan is. You have to invent, think of the 
next wave. Right now we are talking about 10 per cent 
unemployment. Some 400,000 workers in Quebec alone were 
added to the welfare rolls last year. They are not considered 
unemployed anymore, and our statistics are therefore lower. But 
there are people who are not eating or eating very little. The 
member, with every good intention, I am sure, refuses to see the 
data of the problem.
<P>
	My question is as follows: Does the budget tabled by the 
Minister of Finance meet his expectations? Is he ready for the next 
wave? He has not convinced me that he is.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to respond to the 
series of ramblings by my friend from the Bloc.
<P>
	I certainly do know what it is like for young people. Having eight 
children and ten grandchildren, I know what they are going to face 
as they come into the challenges of the future.
<P>
	What we have done as a Team Canada approach is we have said 
that we want to lead. When we came in as government there were a 
series of things we had to do. We had to set some targets. We set 
those targets and surpassed them. If the member wants to review 
those I think he should. Let us put them in factual order and see 
what has happened with this government over the years we have 
been here. The member may be well advised to check with the new 
premier of Quebec to see what he will do with the challenge that 
faces him as the premier of that province.
<P>
	Yes, it is not easy. No, I do not like to see those who face 
unemployment. On the other hand, I do say that the task we have 
been dealt is a serious one and one we do not take lightly. We will 
continue to set the goals and objectives, whether it is for the youth, 
the old, or the unemployed. They will know this government is 
committed to meeting those challenges. They will know that as 
they come into the workforce there will be a job. If the member had 
only followed Team Canada he would know that for every billion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="413"> 413 </A></B>
<P>
dollars of new funds we were  able to create in the way of exchange 
11,000 new jobs will come into the Canadian economy.
<P>
	There is a reality there and the member has to address it. Perhaps 
once he has done that, he will agree with us and will be more than 
happy to support this budget and the work of the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to address a question to my hon. colleague 
who spoke most eloquently. It is with respect to the youth and 
seniors in his rural riding.
<P>
	In the budget last night there was the community access 
component of the SchoolNet. He and I both share a rural riding so I 
know how important the low cost initiative aimed at helping 1,000 
rural communities to participate in this knowledge based economy 
is to my hon. colleague. I would like my hon. colleague to explain 
to us how this will affect his riding and how beneficial it will be to 
youth.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Madam Speaker, it is a very important topic for us 
in rural ridings whether in Ontario, Saskatchewan, New 
Brunswick, Manitoba or Prince Edward Island. We have to ensure 
those people in the rural areas will be part of this whole country.
<P>
	Through this program I am pleased to see that seven of those 
Internet arrangements were allowed to come into my riding. Now a 
series of others want to get on to it because it is a program that 
brings us in very close contact with one another. It provides us with 
vehicles through the communication network we did not have 
before. This brings us together because we have distance barriers of 
rural ridings. It allows us to communicate almost instantly.
<P>
	In the agricultural sector I have grain farmers who are so excited 
that they can now use this as a basis for communication worldwide 
on almost an instantaneous arrangement.
<P>
	I thank the member for the question. It is a very important aspect 
of our whole budget proposal and it will take us forward into the 
next century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is now my turn to talk about the budget and I am doing it with 
great pleasure.
<P>
	I would like to start by congratulating my colleague from 
Souris-Moose Mountain on his speech, which I found quite 
eloquent and which helped clarify the content of the budget.
<P>
	Here we go again, as you probably noticed. The opposition 
parties are saying all kinds of nasty things on the budget. What is 
interesting is that it is not at all what is being reported by the media. 
What are people with no political connection saying? Let me share 
it with you.
<P>
	Earlier, you heard the Reform Party members and their magical 
solutions, simple solutions to complex problems; such is their 
political platform. I am looking forward to seeing what kind of 
solutions the nearly defunct New Democratic Party is going to 
offer. What could the Progressive Conservative Party have to say, it 
is already extinct.
<P>
	What concerns me is that the Bloc has already started to spread 
information; in a little while, I will read a quote showing what I 
mean. Let us look at what today's papers are saying.
<P>
	<I>Le Devoir</I>: No tax increase in Martin's budget. The Bloc and the 
Reform do not like this, but Canadian people do. <I>Le Droit</I> says it is 
a good budget. We read in <I>La Presse</I>: ``What the Minister of 
Finance is telling us is that it is quite possible to wrestle the deficit 
and yet remain compassionate; he is also telling us that fiscal 
responsibility is possible without an abrupt change in direction, 
contrary to what we have witnessed in Alberta and Ontario.'' This 
is what <I>La Presse</I> is saying.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> said: ``The budget is a compromise between 
relief and austerity''. The Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> said: ``Budget 
Boosts Buck'' and ``Blueprint Encourages Economists''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<I>La Presse</I>: ``$480 million for young people''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The <I>Financial Post</I> said: ``Old and young to reap rewards from 
continued program spending cuts''. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> said: 
``Education, Jobs to Receive Boost'' and ``Students, Families Get 
Relief from Taxes''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is what the media are saying. The vast majority are praising 
the budget. They are saying, with great eloquence, that the Minister 
of Finance gave us a budget that answers the needs of Canadians; 
they are saying that he listened and responded.
<P>
	But what happened to the Bloc? They used part of a quote that I 
will repeat for you: ``The government will not use its spending 
power to create new shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction without the consent of a majority of the 
provinces''. They stopped there. But that was not the end of the 
paragraph, the rest said: ``Any new programs will be designed so 
that non-participating provinces will be compensated, provided 
they establish equivalent or comparable initiatives''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="414"> 414 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Why did the Bloc use only half of the quote? Obviously because 
it does not want it to work. This is regrettable because the Bloc 
ought to have been perfectly frank, totally honest and open.
<P>
	Now, I am going to talk about the four main themes of the 
budget. The budget of Canadians: securing their financial future in 
a number of key areas; reaching or exceeding financial objectives; 
consistently reducing program spending. There is much 
information proving it is being done. We are going to rethink the 
role of government. We will take measures to determine a more 
appropriate role in the context of a modern federation economy. We 
will guarantee the future of our social programs, restore trust in the 
old age security system by providing long term sustainability, and 
guarantee the security and stability of federal support for health 
care, postsecondary education and welfare. We will also invest in 
the future, reallocate funds to make new investments, provide help 
for young people and support technology and international trade. 
These are essential areas for job creation and future growth.
<P>
	I would like to be more specific on some of these points. I will 
talk first about the investments in our future as they are described 
in our budget, but before that, there are some details we must 
remember and repeat. There are no new taxes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is $2 million in additional government expenditure 
reductions. This marks the point at which the Canadian economy 
begins to gain on the accumulated debt. This is a historic, 
meaningful and significant happening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There will be investments in our future. To ensure our future and 
restore the confidence of Canadians, job creation and financial 
growth are a priority in the budget; the government has allocated 
resources to new investments in three main areas: youth, 
technology and external trade.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Action in these fields is not an increase in expenditure but is 
financed by budget savings through reallocations from lower 
priorities. Government cannot solve Canada's problems by simply 
throwing massive sums of public money at them. This is what has 
created our difficulties in the past. Instead, we must create an 
economic and social environment which will encourage the 
economic growth that makes sustainable new jobs possible.
<P>
	There is still much work to do, unemployment and youth 
employment in particular. Therefore taking a collaborative 
partnership oriented approach to building an environment 
propitious to economic growth and employment is of utmost 
importance. We need low  inflation, low interest rates and declining 
deficits because these are all critical to the future of our nation, to 
the future of Canada.
<P>
	Let me talk for a moment about youth. Most of us will know that 
the unemployment of youth, those under 25, is very high; it is in the 
neighbourhood of 16 per cent. This therefore needs to be addressed. 
They are the key to our future and we must never forget that. We 
need to enhance the educational opportunities that will lead to jobs. 
We must help young people get their first jobs. In that objective I 
applaud the government for asking profitable businesses to reach 
out and do exactly that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is a very commendable initiative and I see some colleagues in 
the opposition parties nodding; no doubt it means they agree. I am 
very happy to see that agreement because it does not happen often 
enough here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us talk about the learning package. There is an additional 
$165 million in tax assistance to students and their families over 
three years. There is 25 per cent in educational tax credits and 
tuition fee limits.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The ceiling on annual contributions to an education savings plan 
has been raised. Some help is given to low-income parents living 
alone in the form of a tax deduction for child care; there is also help 
for secondary school students; that is a new initiative.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Two-parent families are also eligible for the deduction if both 
parents are full time students. The current age limit for the 
deduction will be raised from 14 to 16.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is $315 million dollars for new employment opportunities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Seven hundred million dollars are already provided through such 
programs as Youth Internship Canada, Youth Service Canada and 
summer job programs.
<P>
	We will double government commitment to summer job 
programs, from $60 million to $120 million. With these $60 
million we created 30,000 jobs, so we hope to double this number. 
The remaining funds will be used to improve job possibilities for 
young people in innovative sectors: information technology, 
environmental technology, tourism, culture, trade and international 
development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These investments will build on a new domestic Team Canada 
style partnership between business and governments to create entry 
level jobs for youth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="415"> 415 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With these new funds, $315 million reallocated and $165 million 
in tax expenditures, the budget brings total expenditures for 
youth-specific programs over a three year period from $700 
million to $1.2 billion.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that I could have gone on for another two 
hours. I am sure that had I seeked unanimous consent of the House 
the answer would have been yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, since this is my first speech since you 
became Acting Speaker, I wish to congratulate you on your 
appointment.
<P>
	I would like to share my colleague from St. Boniface's optimism 
regarding the budget. Unfortunately, like all government members, 
our colleague from St. Boniface merely watched the finance 
minister's show in this House yesterday and let himself be 
hypnotized by the minister's oratorical performance.
<P>
	What government members failed to do is read between the 
lines; it is one thing to listen to or read the budget speech and quite 
another to appreciate or analyze the impact of this budget.
<P>
	I will take the hon. member for St. Boniface's own example, 
because I want to give him the chance to repent and perhaps correct 
what he said in this House a few minutes ago-I will take his own 
example, student assistance. I will get to my question in a minute if 
you allow me to continue.
<P>
	Regarding student assistance, the hon. member reminded us that 
the budget sets aside $375 million over three years for student 
summer employment. This is a panacea, the find of the century.
<P>
	The hon. member fails to mention that, as a result of the cuts to 
the Canada social transfer that were announced last year, which for 
Quebec alone amounted to $600 million last year and $1.2 billion 
for the coming year, Quebec's finance minister will probably have 
to raise tuition fees by a significant amount.
<P>
	The few additional jobs that will be created for our 
students-and I am happy for them-will not be enough to 
compensate for the increase in tuition fees. That is one 
consequence of this budget.
<P>
	I could go on for several minutes on this, but I will give the hon. 
member for St. Boniface a chance to immediately repent in this 
House in front of all his colleagues. I will get back to this later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments and his question. I would have thought that the first 
thing he would have done was to explain why the leader of his party 
quoted only half a paragraph.
<P>
	It troubled me. If the whole paragraph had been quoted, it would 
have been obvious that that section deals with trying to meet the 
needs of all provinces, including Quebec. This worries me a little.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	He chose to remain silent, so bet it. But I was also surprised to 
realize that the hon. member is incredibly pessimistic. Since the 
budget speech yesterday, we hear all sorts of comments 
everywhere. The only people opposed are members of the 
opposition parties. I thought such pessimism was exclusive to 
Reform members, but I see that it is contagious and that Bloc 
members have caught it. How unfortunate.
<P>
	How can the hon. member say that the $700 million to which 
nearly $500 million has been added, totalling $1,2 billion, does not 
provide significant help for students? This is really sad.
<P>
	Moreover, as far as cash transfers are concerned, there is a figure 
of $25 billion, that will be increased to more than $27 billion. That 
is a lot of money.
<P>
	Really, the hon. member looked at only a line or two on one 
page, and he is using that as the whole basis for his argument. One 
must look at the whole picture. Optimism and understanding are in 
order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for North 
Vancouver.
<P>
	I was encouraged to hear that the government has listened to 
what the Reform Party and many Canadians have been saying all 
along: Do not raise taxes. However, when the Minister of Finance 
said that he was staying on course and maintaining the current 
pace, he may as well have been referring to the reckless spending 
going on in some areas under the guise of regional and economic 
development.
<P>
	We have heard the old rhetoric about the need to eliminate 
overlap and duplication, yet a slew of government offices are still 
subsidizing private business with taxpayers' money. Various 
federal agencies are competing with each other and with provincial 
bodies for the same client and fighting over which can spend the 
most tax dollars the fastest. There could be nothing more 
ridiculous.
<P>
	The government has talked about eliminating direct loans to 
businesses. What does that matter if it is still dishing out indirect 
subsidies? It is just a play on words. The government has no 
business trying to manipulate the private sector. Not only is this 
grossly distorting the marketplace, it is creating unfair competition 
among businesses. It is helping some businesses at the expense of 
others. The government is propping up the economy and creating a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="416"> 416 </A></B>
<P>
system of corporate welfare. The government  is trying to give us a 
false sense of security and it is costing us big time.
<P>
	For example, an audit revealed that 17 failed projects supported 
by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency have cost Canadians 
nearly $100 million in grants, loans and loan guarantees. This is 
just one of many examples of wasted money. As if this pill could 
get any harder to swallow, the auditors concluded that a good look 
at the failed business plans would have indicated they simply were 
not viable.
<P>
	Government spending entities such as ACOA, western economic 
diversification and others are actually hurting the people they are 
supposed to help. Atlantic Canadians pay taxes too. ACOA has put 
Canadians further into debt. Regional development agencies are 
nothing but a front for wasting billions of tax dollars on political 
pork barrelling and patronage.
<P>
	It is no coincidence that Winnipeg received a disproportionate 
amount of WED dollars. The WED minister, the member for 
Winnipeg South Centre, became the patronage saint of pork 
barrelling after his hometown received a disproportionate amount 
of WED funding between November 1993 and November 1994. 
That city received more than $12 million. The next highest was 
Vancouver. Despite its larger population it received just over $2 
million. Calgary and Edmonton combined received just over $3 
million. There was also the outrageous patronage in Atlantic 
Canada during the last ACOA minister's reign.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	The government cannot continue its reckless spending to buy 
taxpayer votes using its own money. Regional development 
agencies must be eliminated as soon as possible. The savings will 
put a significant dent in our $600 billion debt.
<P>
	Consider also the senseless waste of money through 
administrative and overhead costs of WED, ACOA, the federal 
economic development initiative in northern Ontario and the 
Federal Office of Regional Development in Quebec. For example, 
WED has an annual budget of about $478 million.
<P>
	Add to that list numerous other organizations that grant loans 
and waste government money. There is the Business Development 
Bank of Canada, the business development centres, aboriginal 
business programs, business service centres, women's enterprises 
centres, community futures offices and others. On top of that the 
provinces have their own economic development initiatives. These 
various offices are competing for the same client. They are all 
funded from the same source, the same taxpayers. These 
organizations report to different people in different governments.
<P>
	Ultimately the government's right arm has no idea what the left 
arm is doing. We have a number of players involved in one game: 
handing out government money.  Too many cooks are spoiling the 
broth. The pot is already bubbling over with debt. It is rising at $95 
million per day and $1,000 per second.
<P>
	In many cases these organizations refuse to release details of 
their dealings in the interest of client confidentiality. They are not 
accountable to those who foot the bill: the public. Canadians get 
angry when they hear of their money being used to fund businesses 
that are competing with others. There is the potential for one 
government funded business to push another publicly funded 
business into bankruptcy and render it unable to repay its 
government loan.
<P>
	It has been argued that giving the private sector a boost benefits 
Canadians in the long run because it fosters private sector job 
creation and diversifies local economies. That is rarely the case. It 
has also been said that even the businesses that fail benefit 
Canadians by taking people off the welfare rolls temporarily. This 
is misleading. In reality, while some businesses are temporarily up 
and running, others are thrown off kilter.
<P>
	ACOA reported to Parliament that it had created 42,000 jobs 
between 1988 and 1992 but could not back that claim with any 
evidence except a Price Waterhouse study of which officials 
refused to release details. An audit found the agency had based 
some of its success statistics on proposals rather than on results. 
There certainly has been a lack of consistent monitoring of long 
term results by the regional development agencies. Simplifying the 
tax system to encourage private sector job creation would have 
been a much healthier way to go.
<P>
	ACOA has a long history of reckless spending. For example in 
1990 it invested $13 million in a wallpaper company that failed, 
then later paid its loans and the bills to clean up the hazardous 
waste it left behind.
<P>
	Why do large firms that rake in billions of dollars in profits 
receive government handouts? Between 1992 and 1994 federal aid 
to large corporations included a $200,000 grant to IBM for 
employee training and nearly $76 million to Pratt &amp; Whitney 
Canada for research and development. Multimillion dollar 
companies do not require scarce tax dollars. WED handed out 
nearly $280,000 between November 1993 and October 1994 to 
lobby groups, some of which lobby against the government.
<P>
	The government's priorities are mixed up. It would rather invest 
half a million dollars in a Newfoundland golf course when the 
people of Goose Bay, Labrador are still waiting for a decent road to 
connect them with the rest of the country. That is not regional 
development. Regional development entities and other money 
agencies are supposed to be lenders of last resort. That does not 
mean giving money out to anyone who asks.
<P>
	Hagensborg Marine Farms Ltd., a project to build the first land 
based fish farm on the west coast went into receivership in 1991. 
The more than $1 million it  received from WED is lost forever. 
Altero Technologies Inc. borrowed $475,000 to produce exercise 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="417"> 417 </A></B>
<P>
machines. The company went out of business and the loan was 
written off. These are just two of many examples.
<P>
	It is more tempting for entrepreneurs to launch themselves into 
risky business ventures when it is other people's money that is at 
stake and with loans that can be written off. Certainly there are 
some cases in which it may be beneficial for the private sector to be 
able to turn to government as a lender of last resort. However, there 
is a much better way to do it without the tremendous waste of 
money that has been going on in the past.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	First, there should be only one money lending agency reporting 
to one minister and it should eventually be self-sufficient. That is, 
the interest it makes off loans would be used to cover its operating 
costs.
<P>
	It should not be a slush fund for politicians to dole out cash to 
favoured individuals. Borrowers would have to meet certain 
criteria, including presenting a viable business plan. National 
standards must be established. Any duplication with the provinces 
must be eliminated. Any Canadian needing business help will 
appreciate a one stop shopping office rather than getting the 
government runaround.
<P>
	Money lending decisions must be taken out of the hands of 
patronage minded politicians and distant bureaucrats. Decisions 
must be made at the local level by a board of business people with 
proven track records. This would help ensure decisions are made 
with a community's or region's best interests at heart. Perhaps the 
community futures program could be used as a model since this 
program has been quite successful in some provinces.
<P>
	All decisions must be open to public scrutiny. Private banks 
scrutinize and monitor their borrowers. Why would the public 
expect any less with its money? If this government is really serious 
about boosting the economy, it will do so by fostering a good 
business environment. However, that does not mean giving away 
free money because there is no such thing. It means eliminating the 
deficit, lowering the barriers to trade, reducing taxes, lowering real 
interest rates and enhancing labour mobility.
<P>
	Taxpayers want real action, not the pork barrel of false promises 
we have been getting in the past.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with great interest that I have been listening to the 
speech that was just given by the member for Prince 
George-Peace River. I stopped paying attention to the member's 
speech in his reference to ACOA. For the two years the Reform 
Party has been here, time after time its members have debased 
ACOA. He also touched on FedNor which affects my region of 
northern Ontario. We all know these economic  development 
agencies are there to spur the economy and growth and to create 
jobs.
<P>
	Western diversification has also created thousands of jobs. I 
want the hon. member on behalf of his party to tell us whether he is 
willing to totally scrap western diversification, the dollars that 
come along with it, the jobs that have been created and the 
economic growth that has been created. We noticed that Reformers 
never talk about it. I want him to come clean and answer a specific 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
short answer would be yes we are. We have talked as much about 
WED as we have about ACOA. Therefore, I dispute what the hon. 
member is saying. We have talked about all the regional 
development agencies and we say it has to end.
<P>
	This government talks about balancing the budget. It wants to 
move toward a balanced budget. It is always asking for new ways 
in which to bring down government spending. We have been 
consistent in condemning these types of ridiculous loans to 
business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> Say the number of jobs that are going to be lost.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Say the number of 
jobs that are going to be lost. There is absolutely no accountability 
for these agencies. There never has been and there never will be as 
long as they continue to be run the way they have.
<P>
	We have seen a tremendous growth in the amount of dollars 
spent on these agencies over the last few years. In 1991-92 WED, 
since that is the particular agency the hon. member is directing his 
attention to, had a little over $185 million to dole out. In 1995-96, 
our current year which is coming to an end at the end of March, it 
had almost $500 million to dole out, yet we have not seen the 
positive effect of that. There is so much money taken up in the 
administrative costs of running these programs they actually kill 
jobs, not create them.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member alluded to Labrador during his speech. Maybe we should 
send a copy of it to the constituents in Labrador.
<P>
	I wonder what the Reform Party is telling the people of Labrador 
about the unemployment insurance system. Is it telling them that 
the unemployment insurance system should be eliminated? Is it 
saying that ACOA should be eliminated? Ninety per cent of ACOA 
supported businesses are successful in that area. Is it telling the 
people of Labrador that it would like to reduce the Marine Atlantic 
program? Is it telling them it is in favour of a two-tier medical 
system?
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to respond to what the Reform 
Party is telling the people of Labrador.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was recently in Labrador. While I was there I met with 
representatives of ACOA, representatives of the business 
development centres, and I talked to them about the problem. The 
most frustrated people are the people inside the system. They see 
the huge waste of tax dollars. They are also taxpayers. It has to 
end.
<P>
	Perhaps after March 25 we will have a member representing 
Labrador over here who will be truly representing those people for 
the first time in a long while.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, after 
studying the finance minister's budget I could just about give last 
year's speech. We are still on the debt and deficit treadmill and 
nothing much has changed.
<P>
	The one good piece of news is that last weekend it seems that the 
Deputy Prime Minister went through some sort of fiscal 
conversion. I heard her on ``Ottawa Inside Out''. She said that a 
dollar invested by the private sector in jobs was a dollar going a lot 
further than one put into job creation by the government.
<P>
	Most people in Canada instinctively know this is true. The 
Reform Party has been saying so at public meetings and in its 
election brochures since 1989. A dollar left in the hands of an 
investor, a business person, a consumer or a taxpayer will be much 
more productive in the economy than that same dollar in the hands 
of politicians.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister now realizes that the Liberal $6 
billion infrastructure program was a complete waste of money. It 
did not create a single job, just like we told her. The Prime 
Minister's solutions of 30 years ago simply do not work.
<P>
	Business has told the government how to create jobs: stop 
running deficits and reduce taxes. The resulting flow of money 
back into the hands of consumers and taxpayers will guarantee 
generous job creation from increased demand and new investment.
<P>
	It is not really a hard concept to grasp. However, instead of doing 
what is required, the Minister of Finance has chosen to keep us on 
the treadmill of deficit and debt, exceeding $30 billion per year for 
the deficit and a debt which is now approaching $600 billion, with 
enormous interest payments of almost $50 billion per year on that 
debt.
<P>
	In the time that it takes me to give this short speech the 
government will have overspent by another million dollars. As 
long as there is no swift action to really balance the budget and to 
begin running surpluses, taxes are certain to increase, the debt will 
continue to grow and interest payments will get larger.
<P>
	It certainly does not take a rocket scientist to calculate that the 
cancer of interest payments will within a few  short years 
completely consume our social programs and virtually wipe out 
every government service which is offered today.
<P>
	Since the end of 1993 the Liberal government has added almost 
$90 billion to the national debt and, as a result, almost $10 billion 
in interest payments. That extra $10 billion per year has to be cut 
out of government services before we make one step forward in 
reducing the overall deficit.
<P>
	Are sensible decisions being made about spending cuts? 
Absolutely not. There are major areas of waste not properly dealt 
with in the budget, such as the massive Indian affairs budget which 
is forecast to expand by 15 per cent over the next three years while 
services to other Canadians are being reduced by up to 70 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	There is the excessive and unwanted spending on 
multiculturalism and grants to all manner of special interests and 
businesses. The government also fails to exhibit any will to control 
incremental spending waste, the little things that together add up to 
billions of dollars.
<P>
	For example, a few days ago I received in the mail a certificate 
from the minister of heritage. It was beautifully printed, multiple 
colours with gold ribbon on it. It said: ``Canada Day Certificate of 
Merit: Awarded to the Hon. Ted White in recognition of your 
contribution to Canada Day 1995''. The award was signed by the 
minister of heritage. When I showed that certificate to a number of 
people in my riding I had comments like: ``What sort of 
pea-brained, cerebrally challenged idiot would approve the 
expenditure of tax dollars on a certificate of merit to MPs for doing 
their job on Canada Day?''
<P>
	I do not know who the pea-brained idiot was but the minister 
should have had enough common sense to put a stop to that project 
before it even started. The fact that she did not shows that she has a 
flagrant disregard for other people's money. It is certainly easy to 
spend it, is it not, when they just have to dip into the trough.
<P>
	As a second example of incremental waste, a travel agent in my 
riding approached me and showed me the actual computer records 
of how taxpayers ended up spending much more than was 
necessary on a fare from Vancouver to Ottawa return.
<P>
	A conscientious federal employee, knowing that a visit to 
Ottawa was coming up, approached a travel agent and requested the 
cheapest fare. The agent showed how a certain combination of 
fares would result in a total cost of $880. Instead of being pleased, 
the employee's supervisor instructed the employee to use Rider 
Travel here in Ottawa which subsequently issued a ticket costing 
$1,963, almost $1,100 more than that employee would have spent 
purchasing the ticket in North Vancouver.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="419"> 419 </A></B>
<P>
	Every MP gets letters and calls with examples of that type of 
waste but absolutely nothing is being done to control it. No 
wonder the voters have lost respect for the politicians. People see 
MPs as puffed up porkers slurping at the trough, handing out hard 
earned taxpayers' dollars to people who will not work, to special 
interest groups and to businesses that do not need and should not 
be getting the money.
<P>
	Meanwhile the Minister of Finance is subjecting Canadians to 
the torture of a thousand small cuts. That is not the death of a 
thousand small cuts, but the torture of a thousand small cuts, 
nothing large enough to get us off the debt and deficit treadmill, but 
just enough to prevent an immediate fiscal crisis. Irritating little 
bits of pain for absolutely no gain. It is a course of action that will 
guarantee years of suffering and no measurable benefits for all of 
the action taken.
<P>
	It represents a failure to learn from the experience of countries 
like New Zealand, provinces like Alberta and states like New 
Jersey, Massachusetts and Michigan which have shown that the 
more quickly the budget is balanced the faster the benefits accrue.
<P>
	The man who was the Prime Minister of New Zealand during the 
debt crisis, the Hon. David Lange, who is roughly equivalent to an 
NDP type of prime minister, told me in 1994 that the only regret he 
had was that he had not moved faster to balance the budget. In 
hindsight he could see that the benefits would have accrued much 
more rapidly, shortening the adjustment period and creating jobs 
more quickly. Today the New Zealand economy is even in better 
condition that when I spoke about it last year. I used it as an 
example and I am pleased to update members.
<P>
	The government sector is about 40 per cent of the size it was in 
1984. The abolition of various marketing boards has allowed 
entrepreneurs to develop new products and markets. Income tax 
reductions approaching $23 per week for the average worker are 
being introduced in the next couple of months, and a further tax cut 
of the same size next year is promised, while the government 
continues to run large surpluses, paying down its national debt and 
increasing spending on social programs at the very same time.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Imagine how stimulative it would have been for the Canadian 
economy if the Minister of Finance had been running surpluses and 
yesterday had announced a $46 per week tax cut for Canadian 
workers. This could easily have been attained if the Minister of 
Finance had adopted Reform's zero in three program the day he 
came to office in 1993.
<P>
	We would not today be talking about how to balance the budget. 
We would be arguing about how to spend the surpluses. With more 
money in their pockets Canadians would have spent more, 
increasing domestic demand  which in turn would create jobs and 
increase government revenues.
<P>
	In New Zealand and in Alberta revenues increased faster than 
expected after the budget was balanced, allowing spending on 
social programs to be increased, for example in New Zealand by 
almost $1 billion in one year.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the 12 per cent unemployment 
rate in New Zealand is now down to 5.6 per cent. When did Canada 
last have a 5.6 per cent unemployment rate? Canada has proven 
government deficit spending kills jobs and it will continue to kill 
jobs as long as it stays on this track.
<P>
	The failure of the Minister of Finance to decrease taxes in 
yesterday's budget guarantees that even more jobs will be killed. It 
also guarantees ongoing deficits and a crippling tax load for our 
children and our grandchildren.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened intently to what the hon. member from the third 
party had to say. Let me raise a whole series of items to which he 
may wish to respond. The only thing about the zero in three is that 
in three years we would all have zero. We would all be out on the 
streets looking for a job.
<P>
	Concerning infrastructure, I do not know where the member 
travels but as a municipal person who has travelled throughout his 
riding, I want to assure him that municipal people throughout 
Saskatchewan were more than proud of the infrastructure program. 
They supported it wholeheartedly. I do not know where he travels 
in his riding but he should get out to my riding in Saskatchewan. He 
would find that people there are responsive. They said that it was a 
good program. They would like it to go on.
<P>
	With regard to his evaluation of MPs, I can assure him that as I 
travel throughout my riding in Saskatchewan and elsewhere in 
Canada the attitude and level of respect for MPs will come up 
depending on what he expects it to come up to. If he wants to 
downgrade MPs and say that all MPs are not doing their jobs, he 
should just keep on. However, as an MP who feels he has a 
responsibility to the public, I will continue maintain that we are 
there, we are honest-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As members know, I like to start a few seconds 
early. May I ask the hon. member if he would be prepared to 
answer this question immediately following the question period?

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to share some information with the House about Steve 
MacRae. One might ask ``who was Steve MacRae?'' He was a 
dedicated family man, a well liked dependable employee of Knight 
Computers and an integral part of his parents' and his four siblings' 
lives.
<P>
	However, that is not why I bring Mr. MacRae to the attention of 
the House today. Sadly I bring the House's attention to Mr. MacRae 
not for what he has done but for something he has not done, which 
is to continue living. Mr. MacRae has become another statistic in 
the fight against drunk driving. His life was senselessly ended on 
January 6, 1996. Because of one person's selfish action numerous 
lives have been altered.
<P>
	It is time for us to put in place severe penalties which will deter 
people from getting behind the wheel if they have been drinking. I 
strongly urge all members of the House to support the private 
member's bill of the member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley 
which would increase the minimum sentences for impaired driving 
causing death. After all, it is the very least we can do for Steve 
MacRae now.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, scholarship recipients are some of the brightest stars of 
our future. Many could not afford post secondary education 
without scholarships, particularly those from northern 
communities who must attends schools in the south. Competition 
for scholarships is fierce and students work hard to get them.
<P>
	On the one hand, by announcing increased spending for summer 
employment the government wants us to believe it is supporting 
students. At the same time, the government continues to tax student 
scholarships.
<P>
	Students are facing massive tuition increases and higher 
educational costs. With high unemployment and a workforce 
unqualified to fill the thousands of available high tech jobs, a 
system that discourages students from furthering their education is 
ridiculous.
<P>
	It is one thing for the Prime Minister to urge the private sector to 
create more jobs. If the government really wants to help students it 
should make scholarships tax free, or at a minimum increase the 
tax free amount of $500 established in 1972 to something more 
appropriate for 1996.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Finance should have announced 
in his budget that the health and social transfer floor the provinces 
were promised would kick in immediately. Instead, we have to wait 
until the next century and likely a different government.
<P>
	The premier of Saskatchewan says that by 1997-98 the province 
will still have $200 million less per year to spend on health, 
education and social services and approximately $35 million less 
for each of the two years after that.
<P>
	This means that as Saskatchewan is crafting its own budget it is 
looking at a dramatic cut over the next four years to finance its 
education and health programs.
<P>
	The finance minister says he is protecting the provinces but the 
provinces are saying they cannot absorb four more years of cuts.
<P>
	This is most disappointing, especially given the government's 
track record of fulfilling its promise to get rid of the GST. Can it 
really expect us to trust it when it says a future government will 
honour this promise of a health and social transfer floor in the year 
2000?

Fortunately very few personal injuries were sustained.

	Recently, the Saint-Hubert institution signed a co-operation 
agreement with the Lycée professionnel privé of Blanchet, in 
Guadeloupe, to develop a training program on aircraft 
maintenance.

	The development and implementation of this program mean that 
some training equivalency can be arranged between these two

	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we celebrate International Women's Week, it is 
important to highlight women's accomplishments. We must also 
take stock of the progress made to date and look at what still needs 
to be done regarding violence against women. Canada has been a 
world leader in openly discussing this issue and demanding 
changes.
<P>
	In certain countries, the subject of family violence is seen as a 
private matter and remains taboo. A national survey on wife abuse 
conducted by Statistics Canada shows that at least 50 per cent of all 
Canadian women have been subjected, in their adult life, to a form 
of violence as defined in the Criminal Code. These past few years, 
we have stepped up our efforts to resolve this serious problem. For 
one thing, strict gun control legislation is now in place.
<P>
	The Criminal Code has been amended to strengthen anti stalking 
legislation. Our ultimate goal must be to ensure that violence 
against women will no longer be tolerated in our society. Now that 
the problem has been exposed, never again-

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
writing a statement about the appointment of Alberta Senator Bud 
Olson as Alberta's next lieutenant-governor, calling for a Senate 
election under Alberta's Senatorial Selection Act to fill the 
vacancy. Before I was finished writing, former Alberta Liberal 
leader Nick Taylor was appointed to the Senate.
<P>
	It may take 10 years to balance the budget, 10 years to lower 
taxes, and 10 years to reform people's pension, but it takes only 10 
minutes to reward friends with Senate appointments. Albertans 
expect the Prime Minister to respect their wishes and permit them 
to elect their senators.
<P>
	Canadians from Newfoundland and Labrador to British 
Columbia remain ashamed of Canada's senior legislative body. 
They are ashamed the Prime Minister continues the disgraceful, 
undemocratic appointment of undemocratic Liberals to the 
undemocratic Senate to pass all too often undemocratic legislation. 
Fourteen times a seat has become available in the Senate; fourteen 
times loyal Liberal cronies have been rewarded. Oops, I should say 
fifteen times. I had better revise that.

	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Minister for International Co-operation, the Hon. 
Pierre Pettigrew, I would like to remind the House that today is 
International Women's Day. The status of women remains a serious 
concern, particularly in developing countries. This is an enormous 
challenge, because the human rights of half of the world's 
population are at stake and, in many cases, the concept of human 
rights may even include the right to live.
<P>
	But we have come a long way, and the recent UN conference on 
women held in Beijing was an important milestone, which 
followed many others. I am referring to the milestones set through 
our international development co-operation program. Canada has 
long been a leader in the advancement of women, as the OECD 
calls it. We must all support this program of international 
co-operation, if we want it to continue promoting equality for 
women around the world.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, unemployment 
insurance reform is of great concern to the people of the Gaspé 
Peninsula. In this context, it is essential that the information given 
to them be exact. I deplore the statement made by the hon. member 
for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine as reported in the March 3 
edition of the newspaper <I>SPEC</I>. According to the hon. member, 
new entrants on the job market in the Gaspé Peninsula could be 
eligible for benefits after 700 hours of work, whereas Bill C-111 
clearly stipulates that a new entrant will have to work 910 hours to 
become eligible for employment insurance benefits.
<P>
	Unless it is assumed that our region is already no longer part of 
Canada, which is not the case, misinforming the public for partisan 
purposes has no place in a matter that is so crucial to the future of a 
region. The member should withdraw his statement as soon as 
possible or the minister should announce changes to the program.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ORAL QUESTION PERIOD</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEBUDGET">THE BUDGET</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we were there when the budget was tabled yesterday. The 
budget tabled by the Minister of Finance is, in some ways, a sort of 
exercise in centralization with the creation of a national revenue 
commission, an exercise in cosmetics because it hides the nasty 
blows of the government's decisions to the unemployed, to women 
and to the provincial governments, and an expression of 
incompetence by the government, which has done nothing more to 
cut its expenditures than it did in past budgets.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister or the Minister of Finance. 
Will they acknowledge that the establishment of a national revenue 
commission, like the securities commission announced in the 
speech from the throne, is an act of centralization revealing the 
government's uncontrollable propensity to assume powers that are, 
constitutionally, in the hands of the provincial governments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, absolutely not. What we want is to make public 
administration in Canada more efficient. Jurisdictions are being 
fully respected.
<P>
	As far as the securities commission is concerned, the provinces 
that want to can be part of it. It will enable people who apply to 
issue bonds or shares on the market to get approval at one counter 
rather than having to apply to six, eight or ten governments. The 
aim is to make operations easier and more efficient. Matters of 
legislation will remain the responsibility of the provinces.
<P>
	In the case of tax collection, it is the same thing. At the moment, 
income and sales taxes are collected in all provinces, except 
Quebec, by the federal government. This will make the job a lot 
easier for everyone. We want to make it even easier so that 
taxpayers do not have to go knocking on two or three doors, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="424"> 424 </A></B>
<P>
will have a  single-window service that enables them to pay their 
federal and provincial taxes at the same time and place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is surprising to see that, for the Prime Minister, 
simplifying operations always means taking them out of the hands 
of the provinces and moving them to the federal level.
<P>
	The federal government has this bad habit of constantly 
intervening in fields of jurisdiction that do not belong to it. Will the 
Prime Minister acknowledge that yesterday's budget contained 
nothing to reduce the government's operating expenses, which 
would have helped reduce the exorbitant lifestyle of the federal 
government? A fine example is the creation of two new national 
agencies, which will overlap provincial agencies doing the same 
work.
<P>
	Does he not realize that he missed a fine opportunity to realize 
savings in government operations?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the moment, the federal government collects income 
tax for all provincial governments, except that of Quebec. In the 
case of Ontario, it costs the federal government no more to do it for 
two levels of government than for one. At the end of the month, a 
cheque will be sent to the Province of Ontario. The taxpayer has 
only one tax return to complete, and he only has to fill in one line to 
indicate what he is to pay to the provincial government. It is a lot 
more efficient, and all the provinces have found the system works 
well.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	So, we want to improve it and ensure it will be much more 
effective in the years to come. It has nothing to do with 
centralizing. We are already doing it and we want to do it more 
closely with provincial governments by including them more than 
they are at the moment in the administration of this department.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am going to have to come back to the Prime Minister and 
ask him this: Would he not agree, if the federal government were to 
withdraw from the field of health, where it has no business being, 
from the field of education, where it has no business being, from 
manpower training, where it has no business, if it did not get into 
securities, where it has no business and if it did not get into tax 
collecting, which is none of its business, does he not realize that the 
federal machinery would be less ponderous and less costly and that 
there would be fewer problems in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us take manpower training for example. We offered it 
to the provinces. As for health, all Canadians, including those in 
Quebec, want to be sure there is a national plan that provides 
people with the same services all across the country, because health 
has nothing to do with language. The day-to-day administration of 
health  care, however, is the responsibility of the provincial 
governments and not the federal government.
<P>
	However we believe there are values that belong to all 
Canadians, and I think the Leader of the Opposition with his 
accusations of a few seconds ago, has to realize that the federal 
government has cut spending more in federal administration than it 
did in transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the Prime Minister just said is inaccurate. It is not 
true that the federal government cut proportionally more than the 
Quebec government did in its first budget, which cut 30 per cent. 
What it has done is reduce its deficit on the backs of the provinces. 
That is what the government did.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Finance confirmed that the federal 
government intends to cut transfer payments to the provinces for 
social programs by 33 per cent over the next three years.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. How does the 
Minister of Finance explain the difference between his speech, 
which talks about an increase in transfers to the provinces for social 
programs, and his own budget figures, according to which 
payments to the provinces will be cut by more than a third?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
when we look at the federal government's three budgets, we see 
that we cut our own programs, our own spending by about 22 per 
cent. As for transfers to the provinces, they dropped by less than 7 
per cent, which means that our own spending was cut much more 
deeply than transfers to the provinces. Unfortunately, the figures 
are quite inaccurate.
<P>
	Second, as far as transfers are concerned, they will be 
maintained at a level of $25 billion for two years before the growth 
formula kicks in. That means that, at the end of the five year 
period, they will rise to $27.4 billion. If we look at the Campeau 
budget's projections, we anticipate transferring to Quebec in 
1997-98 $600 million more than forecast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again, I must say that the Minister of Finance's last 
statement is also inaccurate. Cash transfers controlled by the 
federal government will shrink from $18 billion in 1995-96 to $11 
billion, a drop of $7 billion. He should not be talking about tax 
points, as this is none of his business. If not for Jean Lesage, who 
managed to wrest these tax points from the federal government, 
today Quebec would be taking a quite a licking.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Will the minister admit that, as a result of the cut distribution 
criteria, Quebec will pay proportionally more than any other 
Canadian province in the next five years?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="425"> 425 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, Quebec, with 25 per cent of the Canadian population, 
will have received 31 per cent of all federal transfers at the end 
of the five year period.
<P>
	Second, Quebec will receive per capita 105 per cent of the 
national average, or more per capita than any other province.
<P>
	Third, the hon. member talks about tax points and cash transfers. 
He should at least recognize that Quebec benefits more from 
equalization than any other province and that equalization 
payments will increase in the next four or five years. Mr. Speaker, 
those members are afraid of the truth.
<P>
	Fourth, tax points and cash transfers should be taken into 
consideration. If tax points do not count, why then is Quebec 
asking for more? Allow me to add that if Quebec or any other 
province wishes to return its tax points to us, we will gladly take 
them back.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians were looking for some kind of hope in yesterday's 
budget but the only thing they got was illusion. There was the 
illusion of job creation, an end to the cuts, an illusion to preserving 
social programs and the illusion of no new taxes, which looks so 
grand.
<P>
	The reality is that the budget does nothing to create long term 
jobs. It only puts off cuts until after the next election. It ends the 
sanctimonious promise of universality for social programs. Also, 
by failing to deal decisively with the debt and deficit, the budget 
takes more money from taxpayers' pockets.
<P>
	Did the finance minister really think Canadians would be fooled 
by a time release budget that delays tax increases and program cuts 
until after the next election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what the finance minister felt was that Canadians were given a fair 
budget that continued the track of deficit reduction, a budget which 
invested in youth, a budget which invested in newer technologies, a 
budget which invested in trade, a budget which provided hope and 
a vision for a better Canada.
<P>
	The finance minister recognized that the budget would be 
accepted. If we look at the reaction across the country, that is 
exactly what has happened.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
reaction I have been getting on the talk shows I have been doing 
today is that people are saying that 10 cents, 20 cents, 30 cents, 40 
cents out of every dollar they are sending to the government is 
going to pay the interest on the debt. That is money that cannot go 
to hospitals, universities and jobs.
<P>
	How does the finance minister have the nerve to say he has 
addressed Canadians' anxieties about hope and vision over the 
future of medicare, CPP and other social  programs when interest 
payments remain the largest single government expenditure?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member asks how I have the nerve when her party has 
brought forth a plan for the CPP that would scrap it; when her party 
has brought forth a plan that says no more pensions for the poor and 
the middle class, pensions only for the rich. And she asks how I 
have the nerve? She asks how I have the nerve when last year her 
party brought out a budget that would emasculate medicare and 
eliminate transfers to the provinces. And she asks how I have the 
nerve?
<P>
	How does she have the nerve to stand up in the House and say 
one thing today when she said another thing yesterday? Who does 
she think she is fooling?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
amazing. He was begging us for another taxpayers' budget this 
year and now he is misquoting it. It just seems absolutely 
ridiculous. The finance minister says we will continue to gut social 
programs and emasculate medicare but our program calls for 
sustained spending for medicare, not cuts as he has done.
<P>
	What the minister avoids and what he got so worked up about 
right now is the fact that foreign banks are going to be taking so 
much of the money we are giving to this government in taxes 
hoping it will be used responsibly. He talks about the future, 2006, 
but he did nothing to improve the actual lives of Canadians now. 
Youth unemployment is still 16 per cent. The CPP is in trouble and 
needs something more serious than just tinkering. Social programs 
are being eroded.
<P>
	Since this finance minister is so good at looking 10 years ahead 
rather than at tomorrow or balancing the budget very soon, would 
he please answer the following: What is he going to do? When is he 
going to balance the books? When is he going to provide tax cuts? 
When will he give us the unemployment numbers for star date 
2006?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is something about being on that side of the House that makes 
arithmetic very difficult.
<P>
	I said yesterday that in terms of foreign borrowing we have gone 
from something like $29 billion to $13 billion. The fact is that it is 
going to go down next year and the year after that. What most 
people are saying is that one of the triumphs of this government's 
administration is that we have regained our economic sovereignty. 
Why does the member not accept that? Why does the member not 
look at her numbers?
<P>
	If I have misquoted the member's budget, perhaps she would 
refresh her mind. Was it not right that the opposition party said it 
was going to take $11 billion out of medicare? Was it not right that 
the opposition party  was going to totally destroy the old age 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="426"> 426 </A></B>
<P>
security system? Was it not right that it said we should go to a super 
RRSP and get rid of the Canada pension plan? Was it not right that 
it said that tax exemptions for small business are a giveaway?
<P>
	If I am wrong, I stand to be corrected. Perhaps the hon. member 
will give us her party's new budget and then we can debate what it 
really said.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is of course directed to the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	For two years, the Bloc Quebecois asked for an in-depth review 
of the corporate tax system. The minister has finally decided to act 
by setting up a technical committee to look at the issue.
<P>
	How can the minister think that an in-depth review of corporate 
tax can be conducted behind closed doors by a select group of 
experts, with no parliamentarian taking part in this exercise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
this is not the case at all. The committee of experts must prepare a 
background document for consultation and discussion purposes. 
Indeed, I anticipate that our finance committee will use that 
document for consultation purposes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the government is putting the review off indefinitely, 
as it did with the GST.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that two of these experts are 
from Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse, two accounting firms 
that each have at least five subsidiaries in countries considered to 
be tax havens, including the Cayman Islands, Barbados and the 
Bahamas? Does he think that these people have every reason to 
wish for tax havens to disappear?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
three members of the committee are scholars, including the 
chairperson. They have no bias regarding the issue. These are 
scholars who are able to look at both sides of the issue and also 
raise objections to what someone from Ernst &amp; Young or another 
firm might say. If we are going to close loopholes, we might as well 
recruit those who know best how to find these loopholes.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for four 
years leading up to the election, the Liberals vowed they would 
scrap the GST. The finance minister talks about nerve. Yesterday he 
did not have the nerve to call the GST by its name in the budget. He 
did not have the nerve to even mention it.
<P>
	The finance minister is playing Canadians as a bunch of suckers. 
He is saying: ``Too bad you did not read the fine print in the red 
book, but we are not going to meet our promise on the GST''. The 
evidence is overwhelming. They promised it. When are they going 
to follow through? When are they going to scrap the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am not sure I understand why the member needs notes to read his 
question; he has asked it so many times.
<P>
	If I could back to page 22 of the red book: ``A Liberal 
government will replace the GST with a system that generates 
equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and to small business, 
minimizes disruption to small business and promotes 
federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization''. If the 
member asks me the question three more times, I think I will know 
this by heart.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
another quote he might recognize. It was made in 1989 in the 
House of Commons: ``The goods and services tax is a stupid, inept 
and incompetent tax''. He said that in this House. He said that he 
would abolish it. The Deputy Prime Minister said on national 
television that if it was not abolished, she would resign.
<P>
	Is the minister going to keep his promise or is he going to let the 
Deputy Prime Minister hang on her own words, as tempting as that 
might be?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the description of the tax as given by the hon. member is quite 
accurate. Very rarely does he speak words so true, however it is too 
bad he had to quote me to do it.
<P>
	The problem with the tax is that the previous government did not 
succeed in harmonizing. It imposed on consumers a multitude of 
taxes. It made the tax inefficient. The previous government did not 
provide it for small and medium size business. We are working on a 
substantial streamlining and we will succeed.
<P>
	When I look at Canadian culture and the absolute necessity of 
giving this country cultural sovereignty, I can say there is nobody I 
would rather put my faith in than the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The old age pension reform announced yesterday by the minister 
represents a considerable erosion of the financial independence 
that has been hard won by and for women over the years. Seniors' 
benefits will now be determined based on family income. 
Receiving a cheque in his or her own name will not be more than a 
sop to the feelings of the one spouse who is considered dependent 
on the other.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="427"> 427 </A></B>
<P>
	Is the minister aware that he is jeopardizing women's financial 
independence by treating them as second class citizens dependent 
on their husband's income?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
trust that the hon. member is not recommending a system with two 
different sets of rules. The supplement is based on the couples' 
income, and so I think he will agree that it is absolutely fair for 
those who are better off, wealthier, who also deserve to receive 
their cheque on the same basis as the less advantaged. It is a 
question of fairness.
<P>
	Second, nine women out of ten will get more money because of 
our reform. One of the main reasons behind this reform was 
precisely that, to be able to give more money to those who are the 
least well off, mainly women.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the reform ought not to run roughshod over women's 
dignity.
<P>
	Does the minister acknowledge that, in actual fact, his reform 
will transform today's benefits for seniors into welfare for seniors?
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
not in the least, in fact exactly the opposite is true. First, it is taken 
out of the taxation system for greater independence. Second, I am 
in the process of restoring total indexing, in other words in future 
our seniors will not lose money because of inflation. They have 
now been protected.
<P>
	This is why the majority of comments from seniors' groups have 
been most favourable to this reform; they are well aware that it will 
not only sustain the system but will also be better for women and 
better for our seniors' dignity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday's 
Liberal budget tried to fool Canadians into believing that funding 
for medicare is being stabilized. Here are the Liberal funding facts: 
$30 billion, $29 billion, $27 billion and $25 billion.
<P>
	Will the health minister admit that he is letting medicare funding 
plunge until 1998 when he will be somewhere else collecting his 
gold plated pension?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would have thought the hon. member would stand today and 
congratulate the Minister of Finance for bringing in one of the best 
budgets the country has seen.
<P>
	I realize where the hon. member comes from and the individuals 
he is attempting to support. But even he has to recognize that the 
finance minister has put in place a regime which will not only 
stabilize the transfer, it establishes a cash floor and it is consistent 
for an extended period of time.
<P>
	It is what the provincial ministers of health wanted and it is what 
the provincial ministers of finance wanted. It is a good deal for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I finally figured 
out where the Liberals are getting their advice. They are not getting 
their advice from medical doctors, they are getting it from spin 
doctors.
<P>
	It is time to set the record straight. The finance minister said 
Reform would cut medicare by $11 billion. The fact of the matter is 
that these suckers are cutting by $4.3 billion. We would not cut a 
penny, not a penny from medicare.
<P>
	How would we do that? We would cut waste. We would cut 
business subsidies and we would cut pork barrel highway projects.
<P>
	Will the health minister step down and convince the finance 
minister to put medicare as the highest priority and stop the cuts to 
medicare?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I did not raise the issue of spin doctors. But the leader of the third 
party said in September 1993 that his party supported user fees, 
deductibles and would eliminate universality. However, just before 
the election there was a flip-flop. Reform members said in October 
that they were opposed to private health care and user fees.
<P>
	When they got into the House of Commons in October they said 
medicare was bad for everyone. Then they flip-flopped again. In 
November they said that medicare is important to all Canadians.
<P>
	It is high time that members of the Reform Party stopped talking 
out of both sides of their mouths.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Answer the question David.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. When the Crow benefit was 
abolished last year, the government recognized the importance of 
that subsidy by providing $3 billion in compensation. The dairy 
subsidy that the government is about to phase out, as a result of 
yesterday's budget, is just as important to milk producers. But 
strangely enough, there is no compensation in this case.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	How can the minister explain the unfairness of this measure that 
will severely penalize Quebec since 50 per cent of Canada's dairy 
producers are in that province?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from Frontenac is comparing two programs that are 
totally different. I agree with him that the dairy subsidy is very 
important to milk producers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="428"> 428 </A></B>
<P>
	Members will recall that, last year, the Minister of Finance had 
announced two successive reductions of 15 per cent a year and 
had said that the industry would be consulted to determine what 
would happen to the remainder of the subsidy. That is exactly what 
was done. There were consultations by both the parliamentary 
secretary and the minister. Stakeholders in the industry chose the 
process that we announced yesterday, a phasing out of the subsidy 
over five years, because it would have a lesser impact on the 
market.
<P>
	People in this industry agree with this measure. We consulted 
them and we acted according to the result of these consultations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
producers I had the pleasure of talking to last night and again this 
morning told me that they were not consulted personally and that 
they will lose between $4,000 and $6,000 a year because of this 
measure. Do you want us to believe that dairy producers will accept 
such a cut? Never.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance recognize that this measure 
affecting dairy producers is unacceptable and confirms his 
department's double standard policy, a policy that the Bloc 
Quebecois has been condemning for nearly three years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
totally disagree with the member when he talks about a double 
standard.
<P>
	The industry was consulted. Maybe the producers to whom he 
talked yesterday were not aware of that or were not consulted, but 
the fact remains that the key stakeholders in this industry were 
consulted and they chose a phasing out of the subsidy rather than a 
buy out over a period of one or two years.
<P>
	They thought it was the best way to proceed in order to avoid 
causing too big a change over a short period. We will phase out the 
subsidy over five years, just as recommended by these people.

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	On February 24 two American civilian planes were shot down by 
Cuban air force MIG jets. This unfortunate incident resulted in four 
deaths. The facts in this case have not been fully established, 
therefore it is essential that a credible international organization 
examine this matter.
<P>
	On February 27 the UN Security Council passed a motion 
requesting the International Civil Aviation  Organization to 
investigate this incident. As Canada enjoys friendly relations with 
both Cuba and the United States, our role can be one of mediation.
<P>
	Will the minister commit himself to working with both 
governments to ensure that ICAO receives full co-operation and 
full disclosures of the facts from both Cuba and the United States 
and that both nations will comply with the recommendations made 
by ICAO on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question.
<P>
	I would like to report to the House that yesterday in Montreal at 
the ICAO meetings, the Canadian delegation was led by my 
parliamentary secretary, the member for Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso. At that meeting we took the very strong 
position that we should condemn the shooting down of any civilian 
aircraft, in keeping with the full rights under the Chicago 
convention. We made that very clear. We also were very active in 
promoting the development of a resolution that would undertake a 
full investigation of all the facts surrounding the shooting down of 
the aircraft outside Cuban waters a week or so ago.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	That resolution was adopted by full consensus, which we are 
very pleased to see. We have been urging both parties to adhere to 
the results of that investigation, to ratify the Chicago convention 
that outlaws the shooting down of civilian aircraft.
<P>
	I think it is a clear example of how, when we work through 
international institutions by international rules that is the best way 
to solve disputes.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday's budget speech by the finance minister created 
a serious puzzle. He noted that the private sector had created 
263,000 jobs over the last 13 months. A check with Statistics 
Canada, on the other hand, shows that there had been a net loss of 
227,000 jobs.
<P>
	Can the minister please explain this puzzle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the jobs that I quoted were private sector jobs created. They came 
from Statistics Canada. The numbers that I quoted yesterday were 
right. There would be other numbers which would be the net 
numbers, which would be the private sector numbers less perhaps 
the public sector losses which have occurred. But the private sector 
numbers that I quoted yesterday were correct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the puzzle still remains. The Statistics Canada  numbers I 
have in front of me give me the January 1995 and January 1996 
numbers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="429"> 429 </A></B>
<P>
of full time employment in Canada and they have decreased by 
227,000.
<P>
	I would think that if this is correct, then to be bragging or 
boasting about gross jobs of 263,000 is highly misleading, that in 
fact there has been a serious loss.
<P>
	When will the government create jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have great respect for the hon. member, but I suggest perhaps that a 
review of the numbers would demonstrate that there has not been a 
net loss of jobs. There has been a net creation of jobs and all of the 
numbers show that. That answers his question. The premise of his 
question being incorrect, therefore the question follows.
<P>
	Since we took office there has been very large scale job creation. 
Almost 600,000 jobs have been created in the private sector since 
we took office. That is a very substantial record and we are very 
proud of it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In yesterday's budget, the government talked from both sides of 
its mouth. It has the nerve to talk about stimulating job creation 
while being extremely harsh on workers' venture capital funds, a 
favoured job creation tool in Quebec. The Fonds de solidarité de la 
FTQ alone is responsible for the creation of 40,000 jobs over the 
last few years, a good number of which in the regions.
<P>
	How can the government justify attacking a tax haven which 
benefits mostly the middle class, instead of reducing the number of 
tax havens available to major corporations and the rich?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt in my mind that these funds, which can be found 
across Canada, are meeting a very important need. As a Quebecer, I 
am very proud of the fact that, out of the $4 billion available from 
this source, $2 billion are available in Quebec.
<P>
	This being said, now that these funds are well established, and 
since some of the money has not yet been invested, the vast 
majority of experts and provinces agree that these advantages 
should be reduced as they are very costly for taxpayers. This 
money could be used to stimulate job creation elsewhere, through a 
youth program, for instance.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to tell the minister that it is not the case of the CSN fund, in 
Quebec, which is just starting, and of several workers' funds across 
Canada.
<P>
	Will the government admit that, of all tax havens, those used to 
create jobs should be the last to be revised, as opposed to those 
used to shelter profits made by major corporations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
am certainly aware not only of the Fonds de solidarité, but also of 
the new CSN fund. As a matter of fact, I congratulated its 
managers. I believe they are playing a very important role. I am 
convinced of that, and they know that the incentives now in place 
as the result of the budget will be sufficient to allow them not only 
to start up, but also to pursue their undertaking.
<P>
	The issue is simply one of limited resources. If we want to fund, 
for instance, youth employment, and if we want to try something 
else to stimulate job creation, we have to proceed in a balanced way 
and with a much broader vision, and this is exactly what we are 
doing.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party campaigned on consolidating seniors' benefits with a 
clawback at $54,000. Yesterday we got a new seniors' benefit that 
combined seniors' benefits effective in 2001. And ``2001: a 
benefits odyssey'' cuts the benefits ceiling down to $40,000.
<P>
	The Liberals howls of rage against an end to universality ring 
hollow on this pension flip-flop.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the seniors' benefit is just a code 
phrase for the fudge-it budget's assault on the retirement future of 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what has happened with the new seniors' benefit is that we have 
installed complete indexation for protection from inflation, which 
the Reform Party did not have. We have increased the amount of 
money that will be going to poor seniors, which the Reform Party 
did not have.
<P>
	Our plan is infinitely superior, not to the Reform Party plan, but 
by that put forward by the hon. member. The House should know 
that the hon. member put forward her plan and it contradicts 
completely the plan put forward by her party. However, I must say 
that it is a heck of a lot better than the one put forward by her party.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
despite the answer, the government has given seniors merely 33 
cents more in spending power per day.
<P>
	It has cut benefits to middle income seniors. It has frozen RRSP 
contribution limits. It is taxing seniors by forcing them to use their 
RRSPs at age 69 rather than 71. It has broken every promise to 
seniors while protecting MPs gold plated pension.
<P>
	When will the government end its war on Canada's future 
seniors?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="430"> 430 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately the hon. member's facts are simply not correct.
<P>
	Let us look at what we did in the RRSP area. Up until yesterday's 
budget young people who are raising families or paying for schools 
were not able to put enough money into RRSPs for their savings. 
That is why the average is about $2,500 to $3,000 per year.
<P>
	There was a limit of seven years that they could go back, which 
meant that when these young people became my age and their 
families were gone they would not be able to go back and make up 
for the time lost. We have given them that capability. This is very 
important so that young people can save for their retirement.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the hon. member's facts are wrong. On the other 
hand, I have to say that her motivation is right and she must be very 
lonely over there.

	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	In the last few weeks China has taken a number of actions, 
including military exercises along the coast of the island of Taiwan, 
involving about 150,000 troops, all in an attempt to influence the 
outcome of the Taiwanese elections.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	Given the need to maintain stability in this important economic 
region and Canada's act of international support of democratic 
processes, can the minister tell the House the government's 
position on these events and what it will do to ensure that peace 
will prevail in this region?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member rightly knows there have been increasing 
tensions between the Government of China and the Government of 
Taiwan over the past several weeks.
<P>
	Our position right along has been that the best way to resolve 
these tensions is through serious discussion, to adhere to the rules 
of law and to provide for any kind of international resolution in 
those disputes. The last thing we need is a heightening of tensions 
by the use of any kind of military force.
<P>
	To that end, yesterday I spoke with the Chinese ambassador here 
to express Canada's concern about the missile testing and to press 
upon him that Canada would offer any good offices we could to 
help resolve the disputes or the tensions in a very peaceful and open 
conciliatory way.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The other day the Minister of Finance was reluctant to chastise 
Conrad Black for repudiating the Prime Minister's challenge to the 
private sector to create jobs. We noticed a similar reluctance in the 
budget.
<P>
	Why in the budget, a budget which for the first time contained no 
job strategy, job creation predictions or anything like that, was 
there no attempt to implement policies which would actively 
discourage through the tax system or through other disincentives 
profitable corporations from casting off their employees?
<P>
	Why was there nothing in the budget to meet the policy 
challenge the government enunciated with respect to challenging 
the private sector to create jobs and encouraging it to do so and 
discouraging it when it lays off people even though it is making 
profits.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member's premise is simply wrong. The main thrust of the 
budget was job creation.
<P>
	The hon. member will recognize that there is a clear link 
between deficit reduction, interest rate reduction and job creation. 
That is exactly what we are doing. We have seen interest rates come 
down. We have seen the spread between our interest rates and 
American interest rates virtually disappear.
<P>
	The budget had a major youth program both for summer jobs and 
for first entry jobs which the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will be speaking to. It had a major focus on the 
development of the new technology and the newer economy which 
the Minister of Industry will be speaking to. It had a major focus on 
trade, the kinds of things that really create jobs. This was a jobs 
budget.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am rising to pay tribute to a former member of the House, Mr. 
Randolph Harding, the NDP member for Kootenay West from 1968 
to 1974. Mr. Harding died earlier this week in his 82nd year.
<P>
	Ran Harding was described to me by Lyle Kristiansen, another 
former member of the House who knew him well, as one of the 
most self-effacing, honest and truly nice persons one might 
encounter in political life.
<P>
	It is not surprising therefore to observe that Mr. Harding served 
the public as an elected official for a combined total of some 60 
years in municipal, provincial, federal and then municipal politics 
once again. I understand that in his seventies he was still serving as 
the mayor of Silverton, B.C.
<P>
	Mr. Harding during his time in provincial politics was known as 
the ombudsman of the Kootenays, as the silvery tongued orator 
from Silverton, as one who fought the Columbia River treaty.
<P>
	In this House he was the NDP environment critic at a time when 
concern for the environment was just beginning to grow. He was 
described by then energy minister Joe Greene as the MP most 
knowledgeable about the environment. Mr. Harding was here 
during the difficult days of the War Measures Act and was a 
staunch opponent of its use. He had seen the effects of that act on 
Japanese-Canadians in his riding and he wanted no part of it.
<P>
	Randolph Harding, a school teacher by profession, served his 
country in time of war and in peace. He was first elected to the B.C. 
legislature while still in uniform.
<P>
	To his wife, Francis, and to his family we express our 
condolences and invoke the well known commendation of which 
Mr. Harding was a fine example. Having fought the good fight, 
having run the race that was set before him, we can truly say well 
done, thou good and faithful servant.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to join with my colleague from the NDP, and offer, on behalf of 
all the members of the Bloc Quebecois, our sympathy to the 
Harding family. I have not had the opportunity to know Mr. 
Harding personally nor to sit with him during my 12 years here, but 
as a member of the environment committee I was often reminded 
of his brilliant contributions. That was during the early days of the 
green battle, as it was called in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I have also heard about the brilliant comments he made when the 
War Measures Act was introduced and how he ferociously fought 
for democratic action instead of military intervention. The people 
of Quebec are grateful to him for this.
<P>
	Mr. Harding was an alderman for 20 years, an MLA from 1945 
to 1966 in his native province of British-Columbia, and then a 
member of Parliament here, in Ottawa, between 1968 and 1974, 
where he served his province, his constituents as well as his party 
with great know-how and stood up for the social democratic 
principles his party abode by.
<P>
	Today, the members of the Bloc Quebecois salute Mr. Harding's 
great contribution to our democracy and extend their most sincere 
condolences to his family.

behalf of the Reform Party I rise to give our condolences and our 
sympathy to the Harding family in the loss of its husband, father, 
grandfather and great grandfather.
<P>
	I did not know Mr. Harding personally but I was able to get some 
newspaper clippings and talk to some people who did know him 
well.
<P>
	Mr. Harding served his community by spending over 30 years as 
a member of the Silverton municipal council. He served the 
province of B.C. as an MLA, first elected in 1945 and re-elected in 
1949, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1960, 1963 and 1966.
<P>
	He served his country in the Canadian army during the second 
world war and served further as a member of Parliament, winning 
the seat of Kootenay West in 1968 and 1972.
<P>
	If I could quote a few of the tributes given to him from council 
recently when he retired as mayor last year. The mayor of New 
Denver said he was a great mentor in politics. George Cady, the 
chairman for the regional district of central Kootenay, said he set 
an example that was hard to follow. Bill King, former NDP cabinet 
minister and now B.C. hydro director, said everyone spoke of his 
high integrity.

	These kinds of tributes seem to go on and on and fill pages in the 
local papers.
<P>
	Obviously this man served the country and his community with 
pride. His family members can proud of his accomplishments in 
life but I know they will be sorrowful today.
<P>
	I extend our sympathies to his wife of 47 years, Francis, their 
sons, their ten grandchildren and their five great grandchildren who 
I am sure grieve his loss today.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the Liberals in the House, I am pleased to join in the 
expressions of sympathy being conveyed today to the family of the 
late Randolph Harding.
<P>
	I pay tribute to his exemplary career of public service. Not many 
people can say they had served as long as Randolph Harding in all 
three levels of government, the municipal government of the town 
of Silverton, the legislature of British Columbia and here in the 
House of Commons. Yet Ran Harding was able to serve in all three 
levels of government in a way that brought distinction and honour 
to himself and to his party.
<P>
	Therefore, I am pleased to join in the tribute to the late Randolph 
Harding and to extend my condolences and those of my party to 
Mr. Harding's wife, children, family and many friends. I am sure 
he will be long remembered by all.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government; the 
amendment and the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
question period a member asked that if we had implemented the 
Reform's zero in three program, whether would we have zero 
today.
<P>
	As I said in my speech, example in countries like New Zealand, 
provinces like Alberta and states like Massachusetts, Michigan and 
New Jersey show that exactly the opposite would have happened. 
We would be talking today about how to spend the surpluses today 
instead of witnessing the Liberals trying to introduce their new 
LST, the Liberal super tax.
<P>
	As I explained in my speech, business has explained how to 
create jobs. We have to cut the spending, run  surpluses and get 
taxes down so that there is more money in the pockets of 
consumers so that demand can be increased, which creates new 
jobs and investment. It has been proven to work all around the 
world. Cut spending, start running surpluses and the money will 
flow in through that method.
<P>
	Surely the member can see that his way simply does not work. 
Two decades of deficit spending; if it worked we would all have 
three jobs each by now. Instead we have continuing 10 per cent 
unemployment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Ordinarily it would be the Liberals' turn to have a 
speaker but I understand there has been agreement among the four 
speakers who have agreed to switch places. The members for St. 
John's West and York North who will share time will drop down 
one slot. It is my understanding that the members for Fraser Valley 
East and Delta will now be given the floor.
<P>
	Is that agreeable to the two members?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to make a few comments on the budget today. I begin 
by quoting the famous Yogi Berra, who summed it all up when he 
said: ``It is déja vu all over again''.
<P>
	I feel like I am having a déja vu experience here today talking 
about this budget. This is a budget that Canadians have already 
seen not once but many times before; the predictions of great things 
to come some distant time down the road. I remind the House that 
has been promised before and it does not give a lot of hope to 
Canadians who are looking for some kind of solution to our fiscal 
mess today.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Let me remind the House of a few things that went on before. 
When Mr. Trudeau took office in 1968 the total national debt was 
$17 billion. When he left it was $200 billion. Then Mr. Mulroney 
took the driver's seat and when he was finished with us the debt 
was $508 billion. Now the Liberals are at the wheel again and this 
year the debt is predicted to go to over $600 billion. Sometime in 
the next millennium we hope for a balanced budget, so say the 
Liberals, but then the debt will be possibly $650 billion.
<P>
	It is all talk and we have heard that kind of talk before. As it 
happened before, a balanced budget may be a dream despite the 
good wishes or the good hopes and dreams the finance minister 
puts into his predictions. The deficit this year will be almost $33 
billion. The Liberals hope to reduce it by $9 billion, half of which 
will be obtained through increased revenues from Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
	A rise of just one percentage point in the interest rates adds $1.3 
billion to the deficit. This year, who knows what will happen to the 
interest rates? Will they go up or  down? Who would have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="433"> 433 </A></B>
<P>
predicted a year ago that they would drop three points and save the 
bacon of the predictions of the minister in the last budget?
<P>
	If there is the slightest hiccup in the U.S. economy, if there is a 
slight problem in the elections coming up in Russia, if there is a 
problem of world turmoil in Taiwan as was mentioned in question 
period, or in Israel, who knows? Interest rates could jump. If they 
jump by only a couple of percentage points, the predictions of this 
minister will go down the drain.
<P>
	There has been just a small three point rise. If we go back to 
where we were a year ago, it would leave us once again with a $30 
billion deficit. There would be panic among investors, among 
small business people and among people who are trying to plan for 
their future. It would cause drastic cuts in health care, in welfare, in 
pension plans, plans that all Canadians have a right to expect from 
the Canadian government. That is how dicey the situation is.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about these interest payments on our 
national debt. The debt is the problem and the debt has not been 
addressed in this budget. Not only have the Liberals kept the deficit 
very much alive, they seem somehow to be proud of a deficit of $25 
billion. We have added $100 billion to the national debt since this 
government took office.
<P>
	The budget states that this year interest payments will be $48 
billion. These payments have risen even faster than the debt. They 
have jumped by 30 per cent since the government took office. To 
put this into perspective, what could we do with the $48 billion this 
government seems thrilled to be able to spend on the interest on the 
debt?
<P>
	We could build 25 high speed rail links every year in Canada for 
that much money. We could pay the entire budgets of B.C., Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories 
combined. We could give them a complete tax holiday, tell them all 
to take a vacation, that all of the expenses would be looked after 
just on the interest on the national debt. We could give a cash 
present every single year of $1,250 to every man, woman and child 
in Canada with that much money.
<P>
	Imagine, a person with three or four children could go home and 
say: ``It is tax time. The government gave me $8,000. Thank you''. 
But it will not happen. That dream will not happen because this 
government seems to be satisfied to run deficits, to build the 
national debt and to pay 35 cents out of every dollar collected in 
servicing that national debt.
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce made a prebudget 
presentation to the finance committee and said: ``The massive debt 
is choking our economy and hampering our international 
competitiveness''. It is not talking about long term projections. It is 
not talking about what may or may not happen to the interest rates.  
It is not talking about the wish list of this Liberal finance minister 
and the people who put out the budget. It is talking about the debt.
<P>
	This is not pie in the sky stuff for fabrication. It is the debt. 
While the finance minister seems thrilled that we will only have a 
$25 billion or $30 billion deficit next year, the debt has climbed by 
$110 billion under his management. He seems to be thrilled with 
this.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	As the Chamber of Commerce says, the debt is choking our 
economy, it is hampering our international competitiveness and it 
is costing us jobs, jobs, jobs. Until the government side of the 
House understands that concept, we are in a long tunnel with very 
few dim lights spaced out along the way. The light we will see at 
the far end will be an incoming train, which will be a fiscal disaster 
if this kind of policy continues.
<P>
	In the plan Reform has offered this would have been the last year 
with a deficit. Imagine. All of the pain would have been over. All of 
the cuts would have been over. All of the health care funding would 
have been restored and firm because there would have been no 
more deficit if the government would have followed our advice. 
Next year we would have started to pay down our debt. Next year 
we would have been able to look forward to tax relief. We would 
have wondered what to do with the extra money. However, that will 
not happen. We are looking at continuing cuts and increased tax 
burdens far into the future.
<P>
	The few good ideas that are in the budget-and I am happy to 
give the government credit for them-were stolen completely from 
the Reform Party's zero in three plan. There are no new major tax 
increases, which is good. We applaud the government for that, 
although tax cuts would have been better. The Liberals have raised 
taxes 22 times since they have taken office. Thankfully there are no 
new tax increases in this budget, but there were certainly plenty in 
the past.
<P>
	I will give the government credit that it has continued to hold the 
line on taxing the resource allowance, which is an area of my critic 
portfolio. I badgered the government in question period about it. I 
have tried to get confirmation on it and I am pleased to see that at 
least the taxes have not gone up on the resource allowance.
<P>
	However, it continues to fund government babies such as AECL, 
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the CBC, 
subsidies to business and of course the MP pension plan, among 
other things.
<P>
	The rise in tax deductibility for charitable donations is 
something with which I agree. It is a good move. Again, if we look 
at the taxpayers' budget, which is the budget we tabled a year ago, 
we will see that we said at that time: Give a break to charitable 
organizations. Allow them to come in and fill some of the void that 
will be there when  some of the cutbacks happen in government. 
Allow the charitable organizations to look after that. They will do 
that if they are given a chance. I am pleased to see the charitable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="434"> 434 </A></B>
<P>
donation idea. It was stolen from our budget but I am happy about 
it. If the government wants to steal more, I encourage it to do that.
<P>
	When can Canadians hope for a rise in their standard of living, 
lower taxes and more job creation with this budget? Certainly not 
in this century. Since January of this year 200,000 full time jobs 
have been lost. We heard about that in question period today. Only 
tax relief, lower payroll deductions and a light at the end of the tax 
tunnel will bring those jobs back. The finance minister has put off 
his political pain and in the meantime he has sacrificed jobs for 
Canadians.
<P>
	This budget is like an anaesthetic without an operation. It is like 
going to the dentist, getting ready, going through the fear, getting 
the needles and then the dentist saying: ``We have done all of that, 
but I am sorry, we are not going to drill today. It would be too 
unpleasant. I would like you to come back next year and I will 
continue to freeze your mouth. I will keep drilling your teeth, 
causing you pain and at some point I will fix the problem, but not 
today. I will just keep on giving you the pain''.
<P>
	The finance minister could be called Doctor Doolittle. I would 
say that Canada does have a major toothache. It is called the 
Liberal Party of Canada. It will not get to the root of the problem 
and that is something which will cause pain to Canadians for years 
to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciated my colleague's remarks. However, I was 
surprised that in congratulating the Minister of Finance for 
improving the opportunities for charitable donations, given the 
interests of his party, he did not make some remark with respect to 
the fact that charitable organizations need to be brought to a level 
of accountability and a level of competent management and 
openness which would justify the type of hand that the Minister of 
Finance is extending to them. As a Liberal member, bringing this 
level of accountability to the charitable sector is very near and dear 
to my heart.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I would ask the member if he would support me in that type of 
effort. This is the kind of suggestion that was made by the Minister 
of Finance and something we hope to see in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments on the question of charitable organizations. I have heard 
the member make presentations in committee and elsewhere about 
his desire for accountability in charitable organizations. I know he 
would agree with me that the huge majority of charitable 
organizations run a clean ship with good operations, that they keep 
the books well and are accountable, sometimes  within their own 
organizations, for the money they raise and how they spend it.
<P>
	I agree with the member. He has brought forward a bill on 
charitable organizations that specifically asks for the salaries and 
benefits paid to the public officers of those companies to be made 
public and to be available to people who are perusing charitable 
organizations in order to ensure they are accountable. I support him 
in that and other measures that will allow charitable organizations 
to prove their worth.
<P>
	If we are going to expect more from charitable organizations as 
far as filling the gap left by government services, then I think it 
only right that we expect accountability. In essence these are our 
tax dollars, deferred dollars that are given out in that manner. I do 
not think most charitable organizations are going to be too nervous. 
It is the ones that are sweating too heavily about not wanting to 
share what they get paid that need to be careful not to destroy the 
goodwill they are trying to build.
<P>
	I would urge him to continue that fight. I hope we can find a way 
to make charitable organizations accountable while maintaining 
the privacy they deserve, making sure they will not be targeted in 
some way.
<P>
	He has some good ideas and I support him in his efforts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to start by thanking the member. He complimented our budget 
more than he criticized it.
<P>
	In his criticism he said that we must address the debt problem 
and I agree. His party continues to refer to Alberta and Mr. Klein. I 
am very happy they have their finances in order. Mr. Klein has 
indicated that he has taken care of the deficit and will now take care 
of the debt. That is the direction we are headed in. As our 
borrowing needs decline steeply we will be in a position to attack 
the debt as well. Unless he has another alternative, at least this 
Doctor Doolittle is doing something. Maybe Doctor Do Nothing 
could improve on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what my nickname 
might be if I were finance minister. I could probably think of some 
choice ones.
<P>
	Everyone knows we cannot reduce the debt until we balance the 
budget. That is why we have been begging the finance minister to 
show us a balanced budget. If we could have a balanced budget 
sometime in this millennium, we could assure investors, taxpayers, 
people on fixed incomes, people in the health care system and 
elsewhere that we will be able to sustain social programs, offer tax 
relief, that we will be able to offer some light at the end of the 
tunnel. Until we balance the books none of it is possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="435"> 435 </A></B>
<P>
	Alberta has a wonderful problem. Does it spend more money 
on the social welfare program? Does it retire some more debt? 
Does it lower taxes? None of this is going to be in the cards ever 
in the life of this Parliament until we balance the yearly deficit. 
That is why there is such emphasis on it from this party. We want 
to preserve the things that Canadians are demanding and offer 
them some hope for the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start by 
acknowledging that the government appears on target with its 
deficit reduction program, which simply goes to show that if we set 
the bar low enough we should at least be able to crawl over it.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	The low targets set by the finance minister mean that our debt 
load is still increasing at a troubling rate. It will hit $602.7 billion 
or 74.8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996-97. This federal 
debt is one of the main culprits responsible for our ever increasing 
tax bill.
<P>
	To put it another way, the total tax bite has grown from 29.5 per 
cent of the gross domestic product in 1980 to 35.8 per cent of gross 
domestic product in 1994, a full 21.5 per cent increase. This 
growing tax bill directly impacts on our ability to maintain our 
commitments to Canadians.
<P>
	In the last election Reform's zero in three budget proposal called 
for the tax back of pension benefits to seniors to kick in if total 
family income exceeded $54,000. For this we were accused of 
attacking the poor. In this budget some single seniors and couples 
with total incomes between $40,000 and $45,000 will receive lower 
benefits and all seniors with incomes above $45,000 will receive 
lower benefits. In my part of the world with its high cost of living, 
$45,000 is not a high family income.
<P>
	The finance minister talked with some pride about cuts to 
department spending. Budget documents tell me that the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans budget has been cut by about 
20 per cent. A cut of 20 per cent may be reasonable. It may be the 
monetary target the minister is hoping to achieve, but is it allowing 
for the protection of the resource?
<P>
	DFO bureaucrats, like all bureaucrats, will maintain the 
bureaucracy at all costs. All the fish can be gone, but the 
bureaucracy will remain to prepare for the fishery of the future, I 
suppose, or at least that seems to be the drill on the east coast.
<P>
	Over the past 20 years we have witnessed a tremendous growth 
in the DFO bureaucracy on the west coast, while the number of 
staff who deal directly with fish and people have declined. 
Programs which impact fish have been cancelled.
<P>
	In the estimates which were delivered today it shows fisheries 
operations 1995-96 to decreased from $422 million to $295 
million. That is in large part where  services are delivered, the 
account from which services are paid. At the same time corporate 
policy and program support, largely bureaucratic in nature, 
increases from $247 million to $273 million.
<P>
	I have a letter from Don Roberts, chairman of the Nanaimo 
branch of the Pacific Trollers Association. Trollers are hook and 
line fishermen. They bring in a premium product from the high 
seas for which they can receive $4 and $5 a pound. The government 
has seen fit to take fish normally caught by trollers and give it to 
others who catch these fish in river fisheries and are lucky to get $1 
a pound. But that is a story for another day.
<P>
	Today Don's letter deals with the potential closure of the 
Nanaimo River salmon hatchery. I will read part of his letter. It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Today this hatchery produces 700,000 chinook fry, 450,000 coho fry and up 
to 1,000,000 chum fry annually. This is a far cry from the less than 100,000 
chinook and coho produced when the hatchery opened its doors in 1979. The 
adult salmon from these releases form an important part of our local fisheries, as 
well as playing a major role in the rebuilding of seriously depleted lower 
Georgia Strait chinook stocks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Several years ago the Pacific Salmon Commission identified lower Georgia 
Strait chinook as being a stock of extreme concern and made them a priority of 
the chinook rebuilding program embodied in the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The 
Nanaimo River, along with a few other systems, were recognized as major 
contributors to this stock and essential to the rebuilding program. As a result, 
the Nanaimo River hatchery received additional funding for hatchery 
expansion to accommodate a substantial increase in chinook production. Now 
that this capacity has been realized, it is shocking to discover that Nanaimo is 
one of the hatcheries being considered for closure to meet arbitrary budget cuts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Roberts goes on and he notes that one of the strengths of the 
Nanaimo River hatchery as it is linked to the community:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the years DFO funding has been complemented by financial, material 
and sweat contributions from numerous sources. The hatchery has earned the 
respect and support of the central island area. Some of the hatchery supporters 
are the: Community Futures Development Corporation of Central Island, city of 
Nanaimo, Nanaimo Fish and Game Club, Pacific Salmon Foundation, Pacific 
Trollers Association, School District No. 68, United Fishermen and Allied 
Workers, Nanaimo Harbour Commission, Harmac Pacific, B.C. Federation of 
Wildlife, MacMillan Bloedel, Nanaimo First Nations, Nanaimo Kiwanis Club 
and Gulf Trollers Association.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	These groups represent thousands of hours of volunteer labour. 
In reality, DFO merely provides the seed money which provides a 
focus for these community groups that have a keen interest in 
preserving B.C.'s fishery resource. The Nanaimo hatchery is not 
alone when it comes to attracting volunteers. This community's 
spirit is evident at most, if not all, hatchery sites in B.C.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="436"> 436 </A></B>
<P>
	There are other irresponsible cuts which save bureaucrats' jobs 
but threaten the fishery resource. The minister claims to have met 
his target but the result is the real job of the department is not 
getting done.
<P>
	I have here enforcement reports from the department received 
under access to information which support my contention. 
Enforcement officers in the field want the job done but cannot do it 
due to the lack of resources and personnel.
<P>
	Problem dated June 18, 1995 in the north coast division; staffing 
levels are at a critical level in the conservation and protection 
sector on the north coast. If we want to address enforcement 
programs on the north coast we need to address our staffing issues.
<P>
	Problem dated June 1995 at the Somass River; DFO staff levels 
are too low to monitor the fishery. The real problem will be the 
outside catches. It will be totally unmonitored.
<P>
	Problem dated March 4, 1996, Vancouver Island, a patrol ship's 
summary. August 26-29, complaints about sportees, staff 
unavailable. No patrols.
<P>
	Problem at Terrace, B.C., incident report. A summary for 
Kitimat area dated December 15, 1995; for this timeframe 
activities were sporadic due to changing staff and new officers. The 
full time officer worked alone for the most part until his departure 
in early August. During this period boat patrols were few and far 
between, making DFO's presence almost non-existent.
<P>
	Problem dated July 17, 1995, south coast division; numerous 
rumours of double limits being taken. Not investigated due to 
overtime constraints. Major closures throughout the Victoria field 
district. Cause for concern is lack of available officers and resulted 
in no shellfish patrols being conducted.
<P>
	Problem dated August 28, 1995, south coast division; troller 
fishery largely unmonitored due to staff commitments in Area 20. 
Poaching on river systems not patrolled due to lack of staff.
<P>
	Problem, Victoria district update, period ending September 4, 
1995. No staff available to patrol Cowichan River, Gold Stream 
River and Sooke River.
<P>
	I am all for slim government but I cannot support the mindless 
trashing of a department with a constitutionally mandated 
obligation to protect our fisheries resource. I cannot support 
mindless cuts to health care, education and social programs.
<P>
	Departmental spending cuts are a necessary objective, but 
simply meeting the target is not enough. The government must 
ensure essential departmental objectives are not undermined by 
wrong headed cuts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address my comments, not so much to the details of 
my Reform colleague's speech as I thought he put a good argument 
forward, but more or less to the  main message, that we need to cut 
faster, cut deeper and get to a balanced budget quicker.
<P>
	Reform Party members do a good job in identifying the costs of 
carrying a heavy deficit and a heavy debt. Unfortunately I do not 
think they do a bit in terms of identifying the costs of the cuts 
themselves.
<P>
	They use Alberta as an example of a government that has done a 
good job in getting its finances in order. They have failed to point 
out that in Alberta, for example, the rise of children coming into 
care with the Children's Aid Society has risen by 21 per cent since 
Premier Klein started to cut provincial spending. Why is that? Poor 
people. Their abuse rates did not go up but people simply could not 
afford to keep their children. Is that the Canada we want to live in?
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	In my province of Ontario, Michael Harris has cut welfare 
payments on the theory that it would encourage people to find 
work. When I checked with municipal officials after the welfare 
cuts, they were telling me that all it has done is force people to 
choose between feeding their children and paying their rent. Now 
they are being forced to move and live on the streets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
statement because it is not much of a question.
<P>
	The fact is that cuts can be made to bureaucratic overburden but 
the delivery of services must be preserved. We have maintained all 
along that we must try to make government lean and mean but 
efficient. That is the key word. We must continue to provide the 
services required.
<P>
	I tried to point out in my speech that while the cuts are being 
made, they are being made to the delivery of a service and the 
bureaucratic overburden remains intact. When one does that to a 
resource like the fisheries resource, which is a constitutionally 
mandated responsibility of the government, then the fisheries 
resource will disappear and our ability to continue paying for the 
kinds of services we want is going to go out the window with the 
fish. That is the problem.
<P>
	We must find a way to cut but we must do it wisely and smartly. 
Let us not just look at the bottom line and say: ``I will cut to the 
bottom line and if I achieve my bottom line I am fine''. It is not just 
the bottom line that counts. It is what is done with the money that is 
left. That is where the government has fallen flat on its face with 
regard to the fisheries resource. It is not doing its job of managing 
the money it has.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
particularly pleased today to rise first as the member for the riding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="437"> 437 </A></B>
<P>
of Outremont, but also as the  secretary of state responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development in Quebec.
<P>
	I am proud to speak on the third budget of the Minister of 
Finance, a budget that now allows Canadians as a whole to have 
hope for the future and to also understand that, when we act 
together in partnership, when we work together as Canadians, we 
can accomplish extraordinary things.
<P>
	When we took office in 1993, the fiscal situation of the country 
was disastrous. There was no vision for the machinery of 
government. Management of social programs also was obsolete. 
But despite that reality and despite the cries of Canadians for 
reforms, the government of the time refused to go forward, with the 
result that we inherited in 1993 a less than enviable situation, as 
Canadians, but also less than enviable when we looked at the issue 
of the debt and the deficit in terms of the G-7.
<P>
	Basically, the three budgets of the Minister of Finance revolved 
around cornerstones and these cornerstones were major reforms. 
Once again, the budget that was tabled yesterday is a budget that 
continues in the same direction, a budget that revolves around four 
main elements.
<P>
	First, we talk about the fiscal future, about making sure that we 
can have a better and prosperous future, that we can have a country 
that is fiscally healthy and that compares favourably with G-7 
countries as a whole.
<P>
	The second element is the role of the government. Again, the 
Minister of Finance is continuing the major reform of the 
machinery of government. The third element is making sure that 
we, as Canadians, who built this country, who based this country on 
principles and values, can continue to have social programs that 
meet our expectations and our needs.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The last element is investment in the future, the new generation 
and the leading sectors, an investment that will build on the 
progress that has been made on the economic front since this 
responsible government came to power in 1993.
<P>
	I am happy to address this House because the budget is fair, it 
shows some vision and proves that the government reached its 
objectives on all levels.
<P>
	We have talked and talked about the red book, but today, I think 
we can come to this House with a remarkable balance sheet 
showing real achievements, particularly on the fiscal front.
<P>
	It will be remembered that we had talked about a deficit at 3 per 
cent of the GDP. It is now a reality because the deficit is roughly 
$24 billion, and that is 3 per cent of the GDP. Now we are looking 
forward to a 2 per cent deficit for 1997-98.
<P>
	Also, there are no tax increases in this budget. As we reach our 
objectives of deficit reduction, this budget will make all of us 
Canadians and Quebecers proud, and much less dependent on 
foreign loans than we were before.
<P>
	This budget shows that the government did its best to generate 
economic activity that would lead to job creation. More than half a 
million jobs have been created since 1993, and I think we must do 
even better than that. The budget gives every indication that we 
will be able to create more jobs in partnership with all stakeholders 
in the communities and the private sector.
<P>
	The second element is the role of the government. As you know, 
we have launched a large operation which will make all 
government actions more equitable in the sense that programs will 
be better targeted.
<P>
	The results speak for themselves. Take the Federal Office of 
Regional Development for example. Before, it administered some 
forty different programs, but now there is only one single program, 
developed and refined in co-operation with business people and 
much more in tune with their needs and expectations.
<P>
	With this budget, we are showing that we keep on rethinking the 
role of the state; for instance, in the area of food inspection, we 
announced that we were going to better coordinate activities within 
the national context. With regard to the way we offer services to 
people, we are creating a special agency called the Parks Canada 
Agency.
<P>
	All these measures are aimed at ensuring that the government, 
even though it is more streamlined, and less costly for the people as 
a whole, is going to keep on offering them top quality services.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	With regard to social programs, the Liberal Party is the political 
party which provided Canada with a social system, a social safety 
net which is the envy of the rest of the world. Once again, I am 
proud to say in this House that the Liberal Party is the one which 
proved able to meet the true challenges by rethinking the social 
safety net for the long term, in order to provide security to those 
who will grow up in this country, to offer people in the 1990s a 
safety net meeting their expectations, and to ensure that our 
country is ready for the next century.
<P>
	We spoke about the famous Canada social transfer. The Minister 
of Finance announced that, in fact, we now had put in place a 
five-year plan under which we are stabilizing transfers to the 
provinces and which makes sure that there is a progression in the 
transfers to the provinces. It is so true that in its budget forecasts 
the government of Quebec underestimated these transfers. The 
transfers that we are going to make are more generous by far than 
what was expected by the province of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="438"> 438 </A></B>
<P>
	There is another issue which, I think, is important because the 
choices we made in the budget reflect not only the values of 
Canadian society, but also the principles that we stand for and that 
we have to defend as Liberals, as militants in a party which has 
always been generous, has always been able to take up challenges, 
and I am referring to the equalization question.
<P>
	You know, many provinces, including Quebec, benefit from 
equalization payments. The Minister of Finance announced that we 
are going to continue to pay these sums of money and even increase 
them. So it is an important element, something like the cornerstone 
of the values that we share as a society.
<P>
	Another thing also which shows the vision of the government, 
which is realistic, which proves that we have a greater vision for 
the future of our country, is the pension reform. We have 
announced a reform which will be discussed during the upcoming 
months and under which 80 per cent of Quebecers will be able to 
receive the same or greater benefits. The majority of women will 
benefit from this reform.
<P>
	Concerning the last item, which is the issue of investing in the 
future, we, as a government, have made choices that are aimed at 
creating a prosperous economic net, a viable economic net that will 
generate jobs, and choices that will ensure our businesses will be 
able to compete in the era of free trade that we live in and also be 
able to boldly face, with pride and ability, this era of global 
markets.
<P>
	We have centred our action on the economic front on young 
people, and also on high technology and international trade.
<P>
	As for young people, we, as the federal government, took action 
that will show the way. We will double for 1996-97 summer jobs 
available to students. We also made a considerable financial 
contribution of $315 million over three years, to ensure that we can 
take action in a more focussed way to respond to different problems 
facing young people everywhere in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	We are all familiar with the famous vicious circle: no 
experience, no job; no job, no experience. Through partnerships 
with the private sector and by making certain investments, the 
government will ensure that the next generations can face the 
future with confidence because steady jobs with a promising future 
will be available.
<P>
	High technology is another aspect, as it is essential to Quebec 
and also to Montreal. As the minister responsible for the Federal 
Office of Regional Development, I must say that I am quite pleased 
with the announcements made by the Minister of Finance, 
particularly as regards the creation of Technology Partnerships 
Canada, which should be announced shortly by my hon. colleague 
from Industry Canada. Under this program, $150 million will  be 
invested in 1996-97, and another $250 million in 1997-98, to 
support the high technology industry. This is excellent news for 
greater Montreal, considering how dynamic Montreal's economy is 
in that area. Just think of aircraft manufacturing, pharmaceuticals 
and the whole environmental issue, which is so close to the heart of 
the mayor of Montreal, whom we were fortunate enough to meet 
recently.
<P>
	In a sense, this budget is a convenient lifeline for Montreal's 
economy, whose expectations it meets to a T.
<P>
	The budget also talks about small business. Because regional 
development goes hand in hand with assistance to small and 
medium size businesses. As I mentioned on a number of occasions, 
and I like repeating from time to time, 85 p. cent of all jobs created 
in Canada are created by small business. The private sector made it 
clear that they wanted us to set up partnerships with financial 
institutions, so that additional sources of financing could be made 
available to high tech businesses. Well, $50 million will be injected 
into the Business Development Bank, also providing SMBs easier 
access to sources of financing.
<P>
	This it what it means to be able to recognize one's role as 
government, to take action in an intelligent and enlightened way in 
the interest of the SMBs that are growing in every region in 
Canada.
<P>
	There are also tremendous efforts being made on the information 
highway. I am referring of course to the famous program to connect 
numerous schools throughout Canada to the information highway.
<P>
	There is also the famous program to connect all rural 
communities to the information highway, and we are also seeking a 
way to connect Canadian SMBs as a whole to that highway. We all 
know that we are extremely lucky, in the present situation, to enjoy 
such access, given that we must now compete not only locally, 
regionally or nationally, but also internationally.
<P>
	Being in charge of the Federal Office of Regional Development, 
I was proud, because nowadays, when one hears about SMBs, when 
one hears of developing markets for the SMBs, one knows that 80 
per cent of all new jobs in SMBs are associated with international 
markets. So, it is important for our businesses gain international 
recognition and to be competitive, internationally. In that regard, 
we must praise the finance minister's decision to provide an extra 
$50 million to the Export Development Corporation, to enable it to 
study market development opportunities, as well as opportunities 
to export and gain access to international markets.
<P>
	That is quite a number of concrete measures and programs which 
show that the budget is beneficial to small and medium size 
businesses, while also maintaining the government's objective of 
creating a stimulating environment to help our economy thrive.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="439"> 439 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Here is another measure which shows that we also do something 
for our regions. Let us take only one example: the possibility, as 
regards mining flow-through shares, of spreading exploration 
activities over time. Again, this shows that the government is very 
sensitive to the needs of the regions. These needs may, in turn, 
generate various types of research, the establishment of new 
businesses and, ultimately, jobs.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think that we have eloquently shown that our 
Liberal government can maintain a balance in the fulfilment of its 
responsibilities. We can really tackle the debt and the deficit, while 
continuing to fulfil our obligations toward Canadians and new 
generations, and also promoting economic development. I am 
proud to say that, with the Minister of Finance's third budget, 
Quebecers and Canadians can now have great confidence in the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment for the hon. member for Outremont and Secretary of 
State. I heard him congratulate his great party, the Liberal Party, a 
great party that has existed for a very long time and has done 
wonders, and an extraordinary party that has set up many social 
institutions in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to point out to him that he is partly right, but he 
neglected to mention one thing. When the Liberal government 
decided to put in place great social programs in areas such as health 
care-and it interfered in education and many other areas-it 
neglected to tell Canadians that all these programs would cost 
money. If that great party had been honest, it would have told the 
population at the same time that it would cost $2 billion, $3 billion, 
$20 billion a year to provide those services. But the Liberal 
government did not say so.
<P>
	Between 1970 and 1984, Canada's debt increased by $175 
billion. Sure, the Liberals gave all these wonderful services to the 
population, but the member for Outremont neglected to say how 
they gave them: by borrowing on the backs of Canadians. The great 
Liberal Party neglected to tell them that the government was 
providing those services with borrowed money. This is the source 
of problems.
<P>
	I would like to remind him also that, in 1983, the finance 
minister, Mr. Lalonde, who was then the member for Outremont, 
his predecessor, ran a $45 billion deficit in his budget with 
revenues that were, at the time, less than $70 billion. This was 
unprecedented in the history of the world. No other political party 
in the world had created such a great disaster. Thus the member 
should remember that the current debt, a great disaster, was created 
entirely by his great Liberal Party. I know it, for I have been here 
for twelve years and I am very aware of what went on. Why are we 
still adding to that debt now?
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member forgot to mention another element in the 
comparison between Canada and other industrialized countries. I 
checked the tables in the budget, and I found them misleading. As 
the hon. member mentioned in his speech, annual deficits are 
compared as a percentage of the gross domestic product. Our target 
is 3 per cent.
<P>
	The hon. member neglected to mention that, in all the G-7 
countries, when the debt or the deficit is considered as a percentage 
of the GDP, the provincial and municipal deficits are taken into 
account. To be a member of the European Economic Community, a 
country should not have a debt that represents more than 60 per 
cent of its GDP. Canada's total debt is 105 per cent of its GDP. This 
country is bankrupt, nobody is saying it, and we go on spending 
huge sums of money.
<P>
	We are talking here about the Canadian debt, the federal debt, 
but we neglect to mention the accumulated debt of the provinces. In 
the other countries, the debts of states or provinces are included in 
the total debt. At this time, our real accumulated debt stands at 105 
per cent of the GDP, and the deficit at 5.7 per cent. That is much too 
high.
<P>
	If only the federal government decided some day to stop being 
stubborn and reorganized the way we run this country by 
decentralizing more powers to the provinces, it could be much 
more efficient, save billions of dollars and wipe out the deficit. But 
we are heading for a disaster because of this stubborn Liberal 
government, which wants to keep controlling everything from 
Ottawa. The hon. member for Outremont and secretary of state 
should be aware of that. He should openly tell the whole truth to 
Canadians, instead of half truths.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
comments made by my hon. colleague. Either the hon. member is 
not taking a very responsible attitude in this House or he has been 
out of this great democratic forum, which is the House of 
Commons, for the last two years.
<P>
	We talk about making major changes in the best interest of 
Canada and of the whole population, and that is basically what we 
have been doing since 1993. About the huge deficits we have, I 
would like to remind the hon. member that it was under the 
Conservative government, of which he was a member at the time, 
that Canada had its most outrageous deficits and went through the 
worst political situation ever in our country.
<P>
	When the hon. member talks about how much our social 
programs are costing the Canadian population, his comments seem 
anachronistic, to say the least. You know, we are talking about 
social programs which were implemented decades ago. Today, 
basically, we are acting as the responsible government that we are. 
We want to  review the social safety net we have developed as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="440"> 440 </A></B>
<P>
society, and which we are very proud of, to ensure that it is more 
responsive to the needs of Canadian society.
<P>
	That is what we are doing and we are going even further by 
taking action on the economic front and working with the small 
businesses. We have to increase the competitiveness of our small 
businesses and use a modern approach to do so. In saying that, I am 
reminded of course of the Federal Office of Regional 
Development, which has created a partnership and is working with 
all of the communities throughout the province of Quebec and 
providing what is called the SMB access centre, so that our small 
businesses can have access to world markets, which they did not 
have before, and can use the federal government's expertise in 
international development to gain access to a network open to the 
whole wide world.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal Party has always had the courage to make the 
appropriate changes, always keeping Canada's best interests in 
mind. We avoid partisanship, unlike the opposition parties, and we 
also avoid a doctrinaire approach, unlike the opposition parties. We 
always act in the best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the speech of the hon. member 
and the answer to the question to which he responded.
<P>
	I could not help but notice that he, like the Minister of Finance, 
put a lot of stock in the financial deficit of the country, the plans the 
government has put in place, the targets and the forecasting it has 
done with respect to the deficit.
<P>
	I cannot help thinking the hon. member has forgotten about the 
second deficit we have, the second problem we have to fight, the 
human deficit caused by the number of job losses that have 
occurred in Canada, the number of people unemployed from coast 
to coast, the number of people willing, ready and able to take up 
work to support the country, to pay taxes and to help reduce the 
financial debt of the country. However, those people have been 
denied jobs by the private sector and by the policies of the 
government and they will continue to be denied jobs.
<P>
	There are no plans in the budget to deal with unemployment. 
There are no targets set to bring down unemployment. There are no 
forecasts for what the rate of unemployment will be at the end of 
this budgetary period. There is a complete lack of understanding on 
the part of the government with respect to jobs.
<P>
	The government talks about its partnership with the private 
sector in creating jobs. I read a piece in the New York <I>Times</I> which 
talked about how the private sector in the United States has dealt 
with jobs over the last few  years, a time of prosperity. AT&amp;T has 
cut 123,000 jobs since 1990. Delta Airlines has cut 18,000 jobs. 
Eastman Kodak has cut 16,000 jobs. IBM has cut 35,000 jobs. 
Sears has cut 50,000 jobs. DEC has cut 20,000 jobs. Lockheed 
Martin has cut 15,000 jobs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret to interrupt the hon. 
member. I am extending ever so slightly the question and comment 
period. If there is a question or if it is simply a comment, I ask the 
hon. member to please bring it to a conclusion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, while the hon. member has dealt with 
the question of the deficit, I wonder if he is concerned about the 
human deficit which unemployment is causing the people of 
Canada. Is he prepared to talk to the Minister of Finance to deal 
with it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is amazing. The budget of the 
Minister of Finance is so good that opposition members are starting 
to switch from the question of the deficit per se to the human 
deficit.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party are very displeased with the 
result. They are displeased because we said in 1993 we would meet 
the target of deficit reduction and we did so. We did so in making 
sure we reached 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	With respect to taking care of people, three years ago we 
launched the reform of the social safety net to ensure that once 
people have access to the benefits of the social safety net they will 
be able to access a very active program in order to ensure 
Canadians will return to the workplace as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Since 1993 we have created more than 500,000 new jobs. I must 
tell the Reform members that we will keep on working with the 
private sector and people in the communities at the local level to 
create more jobs. We will make sure that our small enterprises have 
the same access to the international market all over the world. We 
will then be able to create jobs with a responsible government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for recognizing me; some people could go 
on and on and on.
<P>
	Needless to say, my colleagues will speak on the budget in the 
days to come, analyzing it thoroughly for Canadians because there 
is a lot to analyze in this budget. They will examine its impact on 
the Canadian health and social transfer, on government 
downsizing, on dairy producers, on regional development and on 
several other points.
<P>
	I think that all my colleagues will come to the conclusion that 
this really is a cosmetic budget which totally ignores the employ-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="441"> 441 </A></B>
<P>
ment growth. And although the  finance minister called it a ``job 
budget'' earlier, there is nothing in there to create jobs.
<P>
	As for me, I would like to focus my comments on a sentence on 
page 6 of the budget, which says simply this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-whatever the numbers might say, many do not see evidence of 
improvement in their own lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to direct my remarks specifically to those, and there 
are many of them, who will see no improvement in their day-to-day 
life in the next six to eight months, but who will instead notice a 
deterioration in their situation when they become 
unemployed-because I believe more and more people will lose 
their job-, who will notice that the funds on which they relied 
during their period of unemployment have been considerably 
cut-because of the coming unemployment insurance scheme 
reform-, and who will notice that social assistance payments, to 
which some of them will have to resort-because the reform of the 
unemployment insurance scheme will send them there faster than 
they thought-, have also been cut, because the transfers to 
provinces will be reduced. As we know, the cut amounts to $650 
million for Quebec alone in 1995; it will amount to $1.2 billion in 
1996, and will keep on increasing during the next three years.
<P>
	What the government has to say to them today can be found on 
page 8 of the budget speech, and this is the last time I will quote the 
budget speech, Mr. Speaker. It is a very short sentence which 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Chronic deficits put the disadvantaged at risk, because it is they who suffer 
when the financial strength of government is so weak it can no longer reach out 
to those in need.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This short sentence simply sends people the message that there 
are no more resources and that we have to cut, which is extremely 
debatable.
<P>
	First, what it says is that there are no resources in Canada, that is 
primarily what is said. What people really need-the Prime 
Minister himself admitted it on many occasions-is to have a job. 
There must be job creation. However, we are told that there are no 
resources in Canada. This is what the government wants people to 
believe.
<P>
	I want to say that there is no strong will to create jobs-and I will 
get back to that-because, fiscally, large corporations in Canada do 
not pay their fair share of tax. If there is a shortage of resources, it 
is precisely because the will is not there et because the tax system is 
inadequate.
<P>
	As far as Quebec's resources are concerned, it is even worse, 
because the second point I want to make is that the federal 
government is depriving Quebec of its whole economic 
infrastructure.
<P>
	So there is no strong will to create jobs. The central government, 
the federal government itself, tells us this: ``It is not my 
responsibility to create jobs. We will rely on the private sector for 
that''. However, companies are  indicating that they are not 
responsible for job creation either, not in so many words, but in the 
way they behave.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Companies are doing massive layoffs at a time when they are 
reporting record profits. I will quote a few figures, some of which 
were already mentioned by the hon. member for Roberval, the 
Leader of the Opposition, as well as by members of the NDP.
<P>
	General Motors of Canada reported record profits of $1.39 
billion, but still laid off 2,500 employees. The five big Canadian 
banks made profits totalling $4.9 billion but reduced their 
workforce by 2,800 employees. In 1995, Bell Canada's profits 
reached $502 million and the company cut 3,200 positions-and 
they are talking of creating a few summer jobs for students?-on 
top of the 8,000 that were cut since 1990. Petro-Canada recorded 
profits of $196 million in 1995 and cut 564 positions. Shell made 
$523 million in profits and cut 471 positions. Imperial Oil, with 
profits of $514 million, lais off 452 employees. And the 
government is talking about job creation.
<P>
	If the government does not create jobs because, as it says, it is 
not its business to do so and if big companies, the major players in 
the economic field-we know that jobs are created by small 
companies in Canada-lay off workers, who will create jobs?
<P>
	Yet, the government says on page 3 of its speech:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It will require the concerted efforts of individual citizens, their governments, 
business and others for our country to tackle these challenges effectively.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What we see is that businesses do not want to be part of that 
effort and that government considers that it is none of its business. 
These are nice words, but where exactly does that leave us?
<P>
	The truth is citizens and only citizens are asked to make an 
effort. That is what that means. Those words, on page 3, are a 
statement of principle:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It will require the concerted efforts of individual citizens, their governments, 
business-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Businesses do not want to make these efforts, the government 
says it is not its job, and Canadians will have to suffer the cuts.
<P>
	In December 1993, the Department of Finance, in a document on 
tax expenditures, identified 288 tax exemptions available to 
businesses. The department said it was aware of the cost of 176 of 
these exemptions, which amounted to more than $17 billion a year, 
and admitted that it did not know the cost of the other 112. The lack 
of precise information on tax expenditures leads us to call for a 
review of our tax system. That is what the Bloc has been asking for 
since we came to this House.
<P>
	Here is what the International Monetary Fund said, as reported in 
<I>La Presse</I> on December 8 of last year: ``Corporate taxes represent a 
smaller percentage of the  GDP in Canada. This indicates that it 
may be possible to reduce some of their tax benefits.'' There is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="442"> 442 </A></B>
<P>
International Monetary Fund adopting the same position as the 
Bloc. That is where we should look first.
<P>
	What is the greatest tax benefit used by large Canadian 
corporations? It is, of course, the use of tax havens.
<P>
	It is difficult to obtain precise information on the extent of the 
tax avoidance phenomenon through the use of tax havens because 
of the lack of available data and the confidentiality rule which often 
applies in this area. Companies that do business abroad are not 
required to declare here the profits they declare in another country. 
Therefore, since they do not have to declare those profits in 
Canada, they do not pay taxes in this country.
<P>
	There are several tax benefits related to tax havens. In 1987, the 
Minister of Finance made a commitment to study this issue; these 
studies have yet to be undertaken despite the insistence of the 
auditor general and the revenue department. However, it must be 
said that, in the 1994 budget, the Minister of Finance amended the 
Income Tax Act provisions related to foreign affiliates. These 
amendments were in accordance with the recommendations of the 
auditor general of the day and the Public Accounts Committee. But 
they will not prevent companies from using these tax havens.
<P>
	It is difficult if not impossible to calculate the amount of tax 
revenues lost by Canada in these tax havens. However, several 
indicators can give us an idea of the extent of these losses.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	For example, in his 1992 report on tax havens, the auditor 
general, although it was not necessarily in his mandate to do so, 
said that it could reasonably be assumed that hundreds of millions 
of dollars in tax revenues had already been lost et would continue 
to be at stake in the years to come. This was in 1992. We are now in 
1996 and it is still going on. The amounts lost have even increased 
considerably since then.
<P>
	Tax exemptions for businesses operating in foreign countries can 
have two major effects. Some countries considered as tax havens 
have very low tax rates, hypothetically, in the 2 to 3 per cent range 
compared to 40 per cent in Canada. This difference leads to an 
unfair tax treatment which can cost the Canadian government 
millions of dollars.
<P>
	The foreign affiliate can transfer its dividends tax free to the 
Canadian corporation, despite the fact that the income 
corresponding to those dividends was not taxed at a rate 
comparable to that in Canada.
<P>
	I have at least another five or six pages on tax havens I could 
read. The important thing is to realize that tax havens do exist and 
that more and more companies are using them. Some companies 
even specializing in helping  other companies use tax havens to 
avoid paying the Canadian government the taxes they normally 
should.
<P>
	To deal with that issue and because the Bloc Quebecois has been 
asking for a review of taxation for two and a half years, the 
government has finally decided to set up a technical committee on 
business taxation, which will examine business taxation. As the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, who is finance critic for 
the Bloc, has already mentioned, those who will examine the 
taxation of businesses are all Canadian tax experts and some of 
them-not all, but a good number of them, the best among 
Canadian tax experts, as it has already been said during question 
period-are themselves using these tax havens.
<P>
	The Bloc asked that a special parliamentary committee be set up 
to review taxation, but here we are with a technical committee. 
They have waited two and a half years before doing something. We 
asked for a public and open process and here we are with small 
groups working behind closed doors. We wanted a precise calendar. 
What we are told is that later this year, a report will be made which 
will be scrutinized by the public. This just puts it off indefinitely, 
just like the GST.
<P>
	We wanted MPs to look at this issue so as to be able, on behalf of 
citizens, to review taxation. This is a bit like putting the fox in 
charge of the henhouse. It is well known that those who are going to 
examine the tax rules are the same persons who are going to advise 
the government on the taxation system and the same persons who 
are going to tell companies how to apply these rules in order to 
avoid paying any taxes.
<P>
	This is the worst conflict of interest in Canada today. None is 
more serious. Those who make the tax rules are the same ones that 
help businesses take advantage of tax loopholes. By stretching the 
process out-if it takes one or two years as in the case of the family 
trusts-they give businesses time to review their tax strategy.
<P>
	I would like to send an urgent message to Canadians who are 
anxious to understand what is going on in this area, because the 
government is really up to no good.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A few years ago Linda McQuaig wrote the book <I>Behind Closed 
Doors: How the Rich Won Control of Canada's Tax System</I>. This 
book explains fully how in 30 years the rich people in this country 
have taken control of the Canadian fiscality and do not pay any 
more taxes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Linda McQuaig's book was also published in French under the 
title <I>La part du lion</I>. In it, she shows how rich Canadian families 
have used all tax loopholes available in order not to pay any 
Canadian income taxes.
<P>
	What I just said concerns all Canadians. Every time there is 
excessive use of tax evasion, it means a loss of revenue for Canada 
and, as we now know, it is the little  people, the future unemployed, 
<P>

who end up footing the bill. They will start paying in the middle of 
the summer with UI reform.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Things are even worse in Quebec. The employment situation in 
Quebec is worse than anywhere else in Canada, except 
Newfoundland. They are telling us-and they will continue to do 
so throughout the coming year-that all this is due to the political 
uncertainty in Quebec. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	There are all kinds of sovereignist movements around the world; 
some are even in power. There is a sovereignist party in Scotland, 
the Scottish National Party, which has long had elected members to 
Parliament. They advocate Scottish sovereignty; one of their most 
famous propagandists is Sean Connery, the actor who first played 
James Bond, whom we all remember very well. Yet no one calls the 
Scots racist or xenophobic.
<P>
	There is a sovereignist party in Taiwan, as I have said before in 
this House, the Democratic Progressive Party. In 1992, with 31 per 
cent of the vote, this party won 51 out of 161 seats in Parliament. 
No one in the world claims that political uncertainty in that country 
has led to economic uncertainty. On the contrary, everyone wants 
to do business with Taiwan, including Bombardier. Strangely 
enough, the President of Bombardier, who was complaining about 
insecurity in Quebec, has decided to invest in Taiwan, where the 
situation is exactly the same as in Quebec.
<P>
	There is even a new sovereignist party in British Columbia, 
which is being built around Roger Rocan and is apparently 
supported by 12 per cent of the population according to the polls. 
We will never hear the Prime Minister talk about the big, bad 
separatists in B.C. That is reserved for Quebec. They would never 
say this to the people of British Columbia. On the contrary, in its 
analyses, the Fraser Institute goes as far as saying that B.C. would 
benefit from sovereignty. So they conduct studies over there but 
when we do the same here, we are big, bad separatists.
<P>
	Since 1980, close to 40 new countries have joined the UN 
because it is the normal destiny of peoples to become nations and 
of nations to become countries. That is what the UN is for. There 
are even countries that have achieved sovereignty twice: 
Singapore, among others. In 1963, Singapore left the British 
empire to join Malaysia and, two years later, it seceded from 
Malaysia to become an independent republic.
<P>
	The population of Singapore is half that of Quebec and is very 
cosmopolitan-in no way can it be considered 
homogeneous-with 80 per cent Chinese, 15 per cent Malaysians, 
4 per cent Indians and 1 per cent people from other parts of the 
world, including a fair number of Canadians. All this in an area 
2,500 times smaller than  Quebec, that does not have any natural 
resources or energy resources. Anyone who travels to Singapore 
cannot help but notice that the leading foreign commodity is dirt on 
which to build by reclaiming land from the ocean. Singapore is a 
tiny country. No one denies that Singapore's economy is booming; 
economic success has nothing to do with the size or population of a 
country.
<P>
	Responding to a question yesterday, my hon. friend from 
Saint-Denis, who is of Greek origin, stated that the idea of Quebec 
becoming sovereign bothered her. I would like to remind her, not 
without some pride, that we all are more or less Greek. Greece was 
the birthplace of science and democracy and, as you know, Mr. 
Speaker-you studied the Classics-we were brought up on that. 
All this to say that, were we to ask the Greeks tomorrow morning if 
they would be ready to give up their sovereignty and become a 
minority in some other nation, the answer would be no. I think 
therefore that the Greek community should understand Quebecers 
for wanting to do just like them.
<P>
	Things are not going well in Quebec because our economic 
infrastructure is being drained away. A long time ago, it was 
decided to centralize all the economic activity in Ontario. 
Canadians did this for very good reasons. What were they? 
Geographically, Ontario is at the heart of the country. If you are 
going to centralize, you might as well do it in the centre, in the 
province with the largest population and which provides direct 
access to the heart of the U.S. market, cities such as Detroit, 
Chicago and Milwaukee, across the Great Lakes. The decision to 
empty Quebec of its economic infrastructure was made a long time 
ago.
<P>
	Let me just tell you when this decentralization process started, 
because I had prepared a longer speech, which I probably will not 
have the time to finish.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Somewhat surprisingly, our dear friend, Mr. Mordecai Richler, 
tells us in his book <I>O Canada! O Québec</I> when that 
decentralization started. He mentions it in a short sentence, on page 
107, which I will read in
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Once the St. Lawrence Seaway was in place, diminishing the 
importance of our port-il parlait bien sûr de Montréal-and the 
Toronto stock market was doing more business than St. James 
Street, Montreal's slippage was inevitable''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Once the St. Lawrence Seaway was in place, Montreal's slippage 
was inevitable. We are now witnessing the decline of Montreal. It 
started with the building of the St. Lawrence Seaway. We could go 
on about all the other decisions that were made concerning airports, 
the petrochemical industry, the Borden line, the  money spent in 
Quebec by the government which is less than the standard 25 per 
cent, and also the new areas in which the federal government is 
about to interfere, including the securities business, as mentioned 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="444"> 444 </A></B>
<P>
in the speech from the throne. Once again, the government will 
centralize all that.
<P>
	Given that Ontario's economic appeal was built from scratch, it 
is no wonder that foreign investors all want to move to that 
province.
<P>
	This is the current situation. We have a budget which does not do 
anything about employment. It merely maintains the measures that 
were decided last year, such as taking money from the UI fund, 
reducing assistance to individuals and cutting transfers to the 
provinces. There is basically nothing about employment. Within 
that structure, all Canadians lose, Quebecers in particular.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> First, I want to thank the 
hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies for reminding me of 
my studies at Cornwall's classical college. We now move to 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague has touched on several topics. He has spoken about the 
budget, and I will answer him on that, but first of all, let me reply to 
another point he has made. He made a comparison between Quebec 
and Greece, which did not want to be part of another country, 
whereas Quebec wants to be an independent country. This is too 
simplistic a comparison, because Greece has always been a country 
on its own, whereas Quebec has always been part of Canada.
<P>
	He also drew a parallel with Taiwan, which is the same thing. 
Here we have an entity called Canada, in which the provinces have 
the right to govern themselves as they wish.
<P>
	In 1867 there was the Canadian Constitution. There was an 
agreement delegating some responsibilities to the provincial level 
and others to the federal. In my opinion, our confederation is one of 
the world' finest. I am sure there are many countries that would 
gladly trade problems with Canada. We need only look at what is 
going on in Bosnia, Haiti, or other places where there are major 
problems to realize ours are relatively simple ones, readily solved 
if we make a concerted effort.
<P>
	My colleague has indicated that the separatist groups in B.C., 
Quebec or other countries will one day see the light and realize they 
live in the best country in the world.
<P>
	Now, for the budget. My colleague states that the government 
has not created any jobs. I would like to point out that, in 1995 
alone, this government created 263,000 jobs. I would also like him 
to know that governments in general set an atmosphere that is 
favourable for private sector job creation. Finally, it is the private 
sector that creates jobs, not the government. Often, the government 
works in a partnership with the  private sector in job creation, and 
that is precisely what this government has done. It has assigned a 
great deal of importance to the private sector so that it might create 
jobs. Among the examples of job creation I could offer my 
colleague, there is government investment in technology.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	There are, in fact, a lot of companies involved in research and 
development in the area of technology, which will receive direct 
benefits from the government. They will become direct and 
indirect partners of the federal government and will create even 
more jobs again in Quebec and across the country.
<P>
	Inflation here in Canada is fairly low. Interest rates are three 
points lower than they are in countries comparable to Canada. As 
with deficit control, all these initiatives by the federal government 
will help the private sector create jobs.
<P>
	I do not think my colleague was being fair in saying that the 
government is not helping create jobs. It is indeed distressing that 
Petro-Canada, Bell Canada and other companies have cut their 
staffs. However, we must not end up setting a quota for the private 
sector, requiring it to create a specific number of jobs. All we can 
do is ask and do what we have to to enable the private sector to 
create jobs.
<P>
	The performance of this government over the past two years has 
been extraordinary. It is time my colleague in the Bloc rose and 
congratulated the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister and the 
President of Treasury Board, because their efforts have been 
extraordinary.
<P>
	Now I would like to say a few words about provincial 
jurisdictions and transfers to the provinces. Once and for all the 
federal Liberal government has set up a program to ensure the 
provinces fair, balanced and long-term transfers in the areas of 
health, post-secondary education and social services. The 
provinces can finally enjoy some peace in these three areas.
<P>
	I must say my colleague in the Bloc Quebecois is perfectly right 
in saying that a lot more has to be done in job creation, but he still 
must rise and congratulate the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleague does not 
expect me to congratulate the government.
<P>
	To start with, I would like to set the record straight regarding 
some of his comments. He said that Greeks have always been 
Greeks. If they celebrate Independence Day in Greece, it is 
precisely because they had to gain their independence. He said that 
we have always been part of Canada, and yet we were here well 
before Canada became a country. Lastly, he tried to tell us that we 
do not have that many problems in Canada.
<P>
	I have been a sovereignist for a long time, but in Quebec, many 
became sovereignists in 1982. Why in  1982? Because that was 
when the basic agreement holding this country together was torn 
up; Quebec was excluded. And today we are told that it is not a 
problem. It is just as if two individuals had signed a lease and the 
owner had gone down into his basement to redraft every single 
clause of the lease, and the revised version became the real lease to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="445"> 445 </A></B>
<P>
be used by all parties. The tenant would have every right to 
consider this a breach of contract.
<P>
	In 1982, the Canadian Constitution was patriated, the terms were 
changed and no government in Quebec, even a federalist 
government, has agreed to sign it. Quebecers had some of their 
rights taken away. And today we are told that we should stop 
talking about it, that it is not important.
<P>
	I am sorry, but the basic agreement in this country has been torn 
up. Quebec did not refuse to go along with the Constitution, rather, 
it was excluded from the Constitution. What we are confronted 
with today is the result, the consequence of this Prime Minister's 
actions. We must not forget that the current Prime Minister is the 
one who brought the Constitution back from England, the same one 
who is now saying: ``Stop talking talk about the Constitution; let us 
talk about real issues. I changed your lease, but never mind that, we 
love you very much; let us talk about real issues''.
<P>
	I am very sorry, but that is exactly what we are planning to do: 
talk about real issues.
<P>
	To my hon. friend, who says that 263,000 jobs were created, I 
will reply as the people of my riding would. Quite simply put: 
Where? That is what they would say: Where?
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	People who go out for a stroll in downtown Montreal notice all 
the stores that are closed. I was a carpenter in a previous life. 
Today, there is nothing left for carpenters in Montreal, neither 
construction work nor retail stores. Half the stores are closing their 
doors. Where are these 263,000 jobs he is talking about? In light of 
the long list of businesses that have to lay off workers, I wonder: 
where are these 263,000 new jobs? I realize that this is what 
statistics say, but what the people want to know, however, is: 
Where?
<P>
	Finally, there is this nice initiative to stimulate job creation. We 
had one in place in Quebec: the RRSP of the FTQ investment fund. 
This was the only tax measure that promoted any real job creation, 
and they just chopped it to create, maybe, a few student summer 
jobs. I do not know how many exactly. Student summer jobs are 
being created, while at the same time, measures truly capable of 
creating employment in the long run are being chopped.
<P>
	On the one hand, they will be giving students a few jobs for the 
summer, but on the other hand, by cutting transfers to the 
provinces, they are making their school fees go up. Where is the 
logic in that? Personally, I can  see none. If the government 
deserves praise for anything, it is for helping us show the public 
that we no longer have our place in there. With 25 per cent of the 
voting shares, you have no power over the company. When this 
company is going bankrupt, it is time to pull out.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand there had been 
a change in terms of the rotation of speakers. Therefore the House 
will now be apprised of the rotation following consultation with 
our table officers. I will look to the government for speakers. I will 
then look to the government to bring the rotation back up to speed, 
return to the official opposition, then look to the government and, 
last but not least, to the Reform Party.
<P>
	Should there be any questions please raise them with our table 
officers so that you can organize your schedules accordingly. You 
get on my list only once you are on your feet and you are 
recognized. Ultimately the list is blank and we will start now with 
the hon. member for St. John's West. I ask her co-operation in 
indicating to the Chair who she might be splitting her time with.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Vaudreuil.
<P>
	It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the debate on the 
budget. The Minister of Finance last night presented to Canadians a 
budget that is fair, compassionate and visionary.
<P>
	Last night, as part of my budget night activities, I held a 
teleconference with representatives from industry, municipal 
governments, business, social services, education and health in my 
riding of St. John's West, all of whom wanted to convey their 
reaction to the budget.
<P>
	While these individuals had some concerns, the reaction to the 
budget was largely positive. While my colleagues on the other side 
of the House earlier mentioned that the Chambers of Commerce 
were not in favour of the budget, last night I had representatives 
from the Chamber of Commerce who were very positive about the 
budget and had nothing but good things to say about it.
<P>
	I will now touch on some of the key points raised during the 
teleconference and discuss the impact on my riding of St. John's 
West. As a government not only are we meeting our deficit 
reduction targets, we are surpassing them. The budget ensures that 
we will meet our red book commitment of reducing the deficit to 3 
per cent of GDP within our first three years in office.
<P>
	In addition, by 1997-98 we will be meeting our new interim 
target of 2 per cent. By 1997-98, due to the consistent efforts of the 
Liberal government, the economy will finally be growing faster 
than the debt, the first time since 1974-75.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="446"> 446 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	Program spending will be reduced by 12 per cent of GDP by 
1998-99, which translates in the lowest level in 50 years. Also, 
Canada's fiscal requirements will be cut by $6 billion in 1997-98, 
the lowest of all the G-7 countries.
<P>
	Earlier my colleague from the third party spoke about fishery 
violations and offences occurring and he went through a great 
litany of these violations taking place on the west coast.
<P>
	For his information, the department of fisheries raised its 
enforcement budget to provide greater enforcement. The 
government cannot possibly have enforcement offices at every 
location to control all the people who want to violate our fishery 
agreement.
<P>
	The residents of St. John's West are particularly pleased that 
there are no tax increases in the budget, no increases in personal 
income tax, no increases in corporate tax and no increases in excise 
tax. The government has not increased personal income tax since 
we took office three years ago.
<P>
	Canadians have told us they want the deficit and the debt 
reduced, but they also want to protect the most vulnerable, and the 
people of St. John's West are no exception.
<P>
	Again the finance minister has listened to Canadians and has 
safeguarded our social programs for the next century. Over the next 
five years the CHST, federal transfers to the provinces for health, 
post secondary education and social assistance, will be maintained. 
Funding will remain constant at $25.1 billion for the first two years 
and will actually increase over the three remaining years.
<P>
	Although the initial cash component in Newfoundland's CHST 
will decline initially, transfers will resume growth some time over 
the five-year arrangement. The federal government is guaranteeing 
that the cash component of the transfer will never be lower than 
$11 billion during this five-year period. Newfoundland will benefit 
from the tax component as well as from the cash guarantee.
<P>
	Also, by putting a floor of $11 billion under the cash part of the 
CHST, the federal government is ensuring the principles of the 
Canada Health Act can and will be enforced throughout Canada.
<P>
	A new seniors benefit will replace the existing old age security 
and guaranteed income supplement. This new system is designed to 
help those who need it most. In my riding of St. John's West there 
are many single seniors and many senior couples who live on 
incomes well below $40,000 a year. To these seniors I want to say 
they will be as well off, indeed better off, than they are under the 
current system.
<P>
	The new benefit will be tax free and fully indexed to inflation. 
The new system targets those who need it most and ensures the 
system is sustainable in the future.
<P>
	In keeping with our red book commitment, the federal 
government is introducing a new child support system. These 
changes were a long time coming and are long overdue. The child 
support paid under the orders or agreements made on or after May 
1, 1997 will no longer be taxed as income to the recipient, nor will 
it be tax deductible for the payer.
<P>
	The federal government will introduced guidelines to assist 
parents, lawyers and judges to see that fair and consistent child 
support is awarded in divorce cases. The federal government will 
introduce comprehensive measures to help provincial enforcement 
agencies ensure that support is paid in full and on time.
<P>
	The maximum level of working income supplement of the child 
tax benefit will double; it will increase from $500 to $750 in July 
1997 and will increase again to $1,000 in July 1998.
<P>
	Jobs and economic growth continue to be the government's top 
priority.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Since we took office in 1993 the Liberal government has and will 
continue to provide the private sector with an environment for 
growth. The economic climate in Canada is improving. Interest 
rates have declined three percentage points in the last year. 
Inflation is at its lowest level in 30 years and Canada's economy is 
more competitive now than ever.
<P>
	More than 500,000 private sector jobs have been created. With 
this in mind the Liberal government is investing in the future. No 
longer do we have the resources to do everything. We must make 
some strategic choices. We must invest in areas where we can get 
the biggest bang for our buck.
<P>
	The federal government therefore is reallocating existing funds 
into three areas, youth, technology and trade. We are providing an 
additional $165 million over three years to help students and their 
families deal with the increased costs of education. The 
government has increased education tax credits, raised the limits 
on the transfer of tuition fees and education credits, and increased 
the limits to contributions to RESPs. Also, the eligibility for the 
child care expense allowance will be broadened.
<P>
	The government will also provide $315 million over three years 
to create new youth employment opportunities. We will double 
funding for summer student jobs. We remain committed to Team 
Canada style partnerships between business and government in 
order to create entry level jobs for youth.
<P>
	I understand the Minister of Industry will soon announce 
technology partnership Canada, which will  encourage develop-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="447"> 447 </A></B>
<P>
ment of the environmental technologies, advanced manufacturing 
of material as well as biotechnology. In addition, funding to the 
Federal Business Development Bank will increase so that the bank 
will be able to provide more loans to knowledge based exporting 
and growth businesses.
<P>
	The government is assisting small business by bringing it all of 
the advantages of access to the information highway. We are 
introducing a program in which 2,000 computer students will 
connect to some 50,000 small businesses on the Internet.
<P>
	Canada's trade performance in the last few years has been 
nothing less than remarkable. Team Canada's approach has proven 
a major success with $20 billion in new business deals resulting 
from three major trade missions led by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Exports are vital to the creation of jobs. Every billion dollars in 
exports translates into 11,000 to 12,000 new jobs. Because export 
financing is so critical, the government will provide $50 million to 
the Export Development Corporation for further innovative types 
of export financing.
<P>
	I will briefly mention the measures taken in relation to RRSP 
and RPP limits to increase flexibility for individuals saving for 
their retirement. A seven-year carry forward for RRSPs is being 
removed to permit individuals to continue to save for their 
retirement. The age limit for maturing RPPs and RRSPs will be 
reduced from 71 to 69. RRSP limits will be frozen at $13,500 
through to the year 2003 and then increased to $14,500 in 2004, and 
$15,500 in 2005. These measures will limit the cost of the tax 
deferrals associated with retirement savings, while ensuring tax 
assistance is targeted at modest and middle income Canadians.
<P>
	This is a fair budget, a realistic budget and a compassionate 
budget. While the economy is finally improving, the government 
must continue to stay the course on debt and deficit reduction. We 
have made some tough choices to ensure the programs we cherish 
as Canadians will continue into the next century. This budget will 
ensure that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the honourable member. Quite 
frankly, I am getting sick and tired of the government's trying to 
brag about bringing the deficit down to 3 per cent or 2 per cent of 
GDP. I find that totally misleading for the general population. The 
government likes to quote that number because it is a small 
number, when in reality it should be talking about the debt and its 
percentage of GDP. That number is considerably higher. The debt 
to GDP ratio is more like 73 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member quoted statistics. She seemed to enjoy quoting 
statistics to tell us how wonderful Canada  is doing and how great 
the government is doing. She mentioned that Canadians want the 
deficit and debt reduced but they also want those who are the most 
vulnerable in society protected. It is interesting that she mentioned 
not only the deficit but the debt in that statement. Canadians want 
the deficit and the debt reduced.
<P>
	Let us talk about the debt for a minute. The debt under this 
Liberal administration has grown since 1993-94, when it was about 
$508 billion, to a projected figure for next year of $602 billion. 
That is an increase of almost $100 billion.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about revenue in her speech. She 
mentioned that there have been no increases in personal income 
tax. She might be right about that, but revenues have increased 
dramatically. Revenues have increased from 1993-94 when they 
were $116 billion to a projected figure in 1996-97 of $136 billion, 
an increase of about $20 billion of increased income from the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	Those are the real numbers that count, not the deficit but the 
debt. The fact is that the interest charges on the public debt have 
increased from $38 billion in 1993-94 when the hon. member's 
government took office to a projected $49 billion of interest 
charges for next year, an increase of $11 billion. Those are the 
numbers that Canadians should be concerned about. Those are the 
numbers that present the most serious threat to Canada's social 
programs.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to address those numbers when she 
is talking. I think it is totally irresponsible of the government to be 
talking about reducing the deficit when the debt continues to grow 
at an alarming rate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his comments and for the statistics that he quoted.
<P>
	If we were to listen to what the members across the way would 
do, they would reduce the debt to zero before the end of this year. I 
cannot help wondering what would happen to those people in my 
riding in particular who are dependent on the social programs, the 
elderly who are dependent on old age pensions, the young people 
who need to be able to get assistance to continue their education.
<P>
	This party earlier this year said that it should reduce social 
housing by $11 million. What would that do to the social programs 
in ridings like mine? These people talk a good talk, but they do not 
walk a good walk. I am afraid that their program is not acceptable.
<P>
	The program that we have under this budget is an acceptable one. 
It is fair, as I said before. It is a compassionate budget and it is one 
that will work for Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="448"> 448 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had 
several points that I wanted to make but I will restrict myself to 
one comment in respect to the speech of the member for St. John's 
West who is trying to tell us about this compassionate budget, this 
feel good budget and this budget that basically does nothing. I call 
it an economic statement.
<P>
	The hon. member says the government is trying to protect the 
seniors, the helpless and those in need, yet transfers to bankers, to 
foreign lenders and to rich people are going up by $12 billion. That 
is reality number one.
<P>
	With three million seniors that works out to $4,000 a senior that 
the government is going to transfer to lenders rather than 
transferring it to the seniors. My question is short. How can this 
government and this member say that this is a compassionate 
budget when the money is going abroad? It is going into the 
pockets of rich people and the government is ignoring the old, the 
poor and the helpless and the needy.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite did not 
hear what I said. The budget does address the needs of seniors. It 
addresses the needs of young people. It addresses the needs of the 
people who need it most. It addresses the needs of women who 
have been living well below the poverty line and who, for the first 
time, are seeing their incomes increase.
<P>
	This budget does take care of those who need it most.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud to take part in 
this debate on our third budget, and especially to point out that, in 
the last two and a half years, Canadians have relied on the 
government not to create jobs but to generate a social and 
economic climate conducive to economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	We are also proud of our achievements thus far. In fact, since we 
came to office, the unemployment rate has fallen by 2 per cent and 
some 500,000 jobs have been created, most of them in the private 
sector and almost all of them by small and medium size businesses, 
of which I am proud. That said, there is still much to be done. 
Unemployment is still too high and Canadians, especially young 
people, are concerned about future jobs.
<P>
	We intend to take lasting and meaningful measures. Rather than 
relying on short term direct spending programs, we will take a 
more productive approach by focusing on co-operation with our 
partners and strategic investments to give the forces of economic 
change an incentive to create jobs.
<P>
	But let us start at the beginning. To secure the sustained 
economic growth we need to create new jobs, we must first 
guarantee the basic elements of the Canadian economy by reducing 
and eventually  eliminating the deficit. Chronic, large deficits go 
hand in hand with high interest rates. High interest rates, in turn, 
discourage investment, borrowing and consumer spending. 
Ultimately, they have a detrimental effect on employment.
<P>
	We must also keep inflation low, since it reduces pressure on 
interest rates and results in lower overhead for companies. It goes 
without saying that keeping the operating costs of a Canadian 
company at a minimum level promotes investment. This, in turn, 
helps create jobs.
<P>
	Today, we are reaping the benefits of our efforts to tackle the 
deficit and control inflation, which is at its lowest level in 30 years. 
Short term interest rates have already gone down three percentage 
points since the last budget, and we have made major progress in 
terms of our competitiveness, as indicated by the unprecedented 
level of our exports. However, there is an obvious need to maintain 
and even increase our efforts in order to ensure the future of 
Canadians.
<P>
	In addition to providing a solid economic framework, we took a 
hard look at what more we can and must do. Some issues are so 
vital for Canada's future that they warrant a significantly greater 
effort on the part of the federal government. Our youth, in my 
opinion, is one such area.
<P>
	The unemployment rate for young people is around 16 per cent, 
which is one and one half times higher than the national average. 
The transition from school to the labour market must be looked at. 
Our young people are our greatest asset. They are the key to the 
future. They need higher education, since this is vital for any job. 
They also need more assistance in finding that all-important first 
job.
<P>
	We have a plan. The programs announced include Youth service 
Canada, Youth internship Canada, as well as the summer 
employment program for students. In addition to these initiatives, 
the student loans program, whose budget provides for an additional 
$556 million, will include the negotiation of loans totalling over 
one billion dollars and will help more than 360,000 students.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The 1996 budget also calls for new measures to enable young 
people to meet the challenge of the labour market, so that future 
generations will be able to keep pace with the remarkable changes 
in the world economy. To that end, we have inaugurated an 
apprenticeship program. As the result of rearrangements within the 
taxation structure, these new measures will make it possible to free 
up an additional $165 million in the form of tax assistance to 
students and their families.
<P>
	This program has three main components. First, there is 
additional tax assistance to students, through a 25 per cent increase 
in the education credit, that is to say from $80 to $100 per month. 
The budget also proposes a 25  per cent increase in the ceiling for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="449"> 449 </A></B>
<P>
transfer of tuition and education credits to family members who are 
supporting students.
<P>
	Second, savings to finance education over the long term are 
eligible for assistance, because the annual limit for contributions to 
registered education savings plans has been increased.
<P>
	Assistance is also available to single, low income parents, by 
authorizing the child care expense deduction from any kind of 
income when the single parent is also a full time student. This 
applies to secondary students. Two parent families are also eligible 
for this deduction if both adults are studying at the same time. The 
age limit for this deduction will also be raised to help parents of 
older students.
<P>
	Implementation of tax rules in favour of education is a first step. 
However, young Canadians need much more than educational 
opportunities in order to get a job on the labour market. They need 
professional experience.
<P>
	We first provided for on-the-job training by re-allocating $315 
million over three years to help create job opportunities for young 
people. These funds will combine with the $700 million we set 
aside for this year for youth internship Canada, youth service 
Canada and summer employment programs.
<P>
	As an initial intermediary stage, the budget will double our 
commitment to the summer employment program from $60 
million to $120 million.
<P>
	We are concerned not only about young people, but about the 
burgeoning technologies that are changing our universe. In short, 
innovation feeds productivity and growth, which underlie the jobs 
of tomorrow. We have a job to do to stimulate Canada's creative 
abilities.
<P>
	The initiatives currently in effect include changes in the type of 
work done by the National Research Council in areas such as 
biotechnology, telecommunications and the latest in manufacturing 
and infrastructure technology.
<P>
	We are working closely with the private sector in projects such 
as CANARIE, which is aimed at speeding up the establishment of 
high speed electronic networks. Furthermore, we are encouraging 
the expansion of new technologies in small businesses under the 
industrial research assistance program.
<P>
	Here again, we want to do more. We are re-allocating $270 
million worth of savings over three years to promote innovation 
and technology. This measure provides for the creation of 
technology partnerships Canada, a fund to stimulate the 
development of environmental technologies, high tech 
manufacturing processes and biotechnologies. It will also help 
maintain jobs in the aerospace industry, which is facing fierce 
highly subsidized foreign competition.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	We will give an additional $50 million to the Business 
Development Bank. This money will enable the institution to loan 
an additional $350 million to knowledge-based, and growth 
businesses.
<P>
	Moreover, we are creating a program under which 2,000 
computer students will help connect 50,000 small businesses to the 
Internet.
<P>
	Last but not least, trade, which is at the heart of the Canadian 
economy. We export a third of what we produce, providing work 
for millions of people.
<P>
	In this budget, we are allocating a further $50 million to the 
Export Development Corporation. We are reallocating resources 
from concessional loans to foreign borrowers to finance higher 
volumes of non-concessional financing under an improved system 
of risk management. This measure will permit an increase of up to 
$500 million of year in the financing available to Canadians 
exporters.
<P>
	To conclude, I will say that the private sector is our most 
important and most astute innovation mechanism. Young 
Canadians are our most solid hope for the future. And trade is one 
of the most powerful means to create wealth. We are investing in 
these three areas.
<P>
	The framework is in place. The economic situation is improving. 
The fundamentals to create partnership are in place. We are being 
true to our commitment to provide opportunities in the areas of 
education and modernization, as well as job opportunities for 
young people in the next century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague's comments 
on the budget that was tabled by our Minister of Finance late 
yesterday afternoon. Like many in this House, one of the things I 
have heard on many occasions is that the best social program in this 
country is an opportunity for a job. As the member across the way 
so capably mentioned, one of the things presented in this budget is 
that opportunity.
<P>
	I wonder if the parliamentary secretary has had an opportunity to 
speak to his business constituents in his riding. I had the 
opportunity this morning to speak to a number of key businesses in 
my riding and I will be speaking to others over the next few days to 
get their input and feelings on it. The business representatives I 
spoke with this morning indicated that it was a very positive budget 
and that it did set the tone. They were pleased to see that the 
government is getting our financial house in order, that the lower 
interest rates would certainly be beneficial and that they would be 
increasing their employee base. They agreed that with their 
additional exports there would be further employees coming.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="450"> 450 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder if the parliamentary secretary has had an opportunity 
to speak to some businesses in his constituency and what type of 
reaction have they provided.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to my colleague's 
question, I have the opportunity to point out that our job as a 
government is not to create jobs. I remember during the election 
campaign that when any politician stood up and said that he or she 
was going to create so many thousands of jobs, he or she was 
ridiculed by everybody because it is not our job to create 
employment. However, it is our duty as a government to create the 
appropriate climate to stimulate job creation measures, et cetera.
<P>
	If members look at what we have done over the past two or three 
years through the initiatives of our Minister of Finance and the 
support he has received from the Prime Minister and colleagues, 
we have put in place a firm foundation for companies through 
measures such as reduced interest rates for example.
<P>
	Last year alone I remember interest rates dropped by almost 3 
per cent. Inflation is quasi non-existent. If we analyse those 
companies that are making profits today, it is those companies in 
the new technologies and exporting that have been successful over 
the past three or four years. Therefore, when we can encourage and 
create the climate that is appropriate for job creation measures then 
I am confident that jobs will be created.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	We have been criticized by members of the Reform Party who 
say that we have not done anything. However, I would like to raise 
a point for the information of members. The measures we put in 
place in 1994, because of the compounding effect from year to year 
to year, by fiscal year 1998-99 will have a net effect of close to $45 
billion in savings. Compounded with the measures we have put in 
place in the second budget, there will be another $43 billion in 
savings.
<P>
	This is phase three of a fantastic, sound footing which I am 
convinced will put us into the 21st century hopefully with the 
elimination of the deficit. The strong footing will encourage 
investment in the country. If we could get the political stability, I 
am convinced investments would come and job creation would 
follow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians will not be left behind. There is no question the world 
around is changing. Fifty years ago fax machines, cellular phones, 
the Canada space arm and fibre optic surgery were only seen in 
science fiction movies. Today they are part of our everyday life.
<P>
	Fact: the world is changing. Fact: our lives are changing. Fact: 
some countries will be left behind. Fact: Canada will not be one of 
them.
<P>
	Certainly our labour market is changing. Machines are doing 
some of the jobs people used to do. However, people are doing 
some jobs we never thought would be possible. We are building the 
robots that now do the heavy lifting and exploration of mines. We 
are designing the fibre optic cables that allow people on different 
continents to conduct meetings and exchange ideas. We are 
developing the vaccines to combat disease that had previously 
wiped out entire populations. Certainly, the world is changing but 
we are leading the revolution.
<P>
	The 1996 budget tabled yesterday by the Minister of Finance 
will allow us to continue to set the pace for other countries to 
follow. This Liberal government recognizes that Canada is a rich 
country, a country rich in resources: natural resources, its people, 
its youth. We also recognize it is our responsibility to create 
opportunities for present and future generations of Canadians, and 
that is what we have done.
<P>
	The challenges that face our youth are clear. The youth 
unemployment rate is roughly double the national average. 
Roughly 45 per cent of new jobs created between the year 1990 and 
the year 2000 will require more than 16 years of training and 
education.
<P>
	What is the federal government doing to offer young Canadians 
a brighter future? More than any other government in Canadian 
history, we have been devoted to achieving positive change in the 
lives of young people. To quote the Minister of Finance: ``The 
economy of the future will belong to our young people. The success 
of our economy will depend on them, just as their success will 
depend on their ability to fully participate in all that the economy 
has to offer''.
<P>
	Post-secondary education is an important step toward achieving 
meaningful full time employment. Our government recognizes 
that. That is why the 1996 budget announced measures to increase 
Canada's investment in our youth. After all, if our future is to be 
brighter, we must invest in it. To that end we have introduced a 
learning package. These measures will provide an additional $165 
million in tax assistance to students and their families. However, 
getting the tax system to work in favour of education is just the 
beginning.
<P>
	In addition to these measures we have further improved access to 
post-secondary education by providing more flexible repayment 
terms for Canada student loans. That, plus our previous $2.5 billion 
increase in the amount of federal assistance available through our 
Canada student loans program clearly demonstrates our 
government's commitment to providing Canadians with the 
opportunity to pursue lifelong learning.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	As chair of the Liberal Party's task force on youth, as 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, as a member of the human  resources committee and 
as the member of Parliament for the riding of York North I have 
spoken to tens of thousands of young people across the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="451"> 451 </A></B>
<P>
	I spoke with high school dropouts who still have dreams to one 
day have good paying jobs. I spoke with a 19-year old single 
mother who wants to be an accountant. I spoke with a young man 
from Newfoundland who wants a job he can go to year round. The 
desire to work, to grow and to succeed is there. It just needs some 
help to flourish.
<P>
	How many times have we heard a young person say that he or 
she cannot find a job because he or she does not have experience: 
``How can I gain that experience if I do not have a job?'' That is the 
paradox in the lives of so many young people in our country. These 
are indeed tough questions. Our government has attempted to find 
some answers.
<P>
	In April 1994 our government announced the youth employment 
and learning strategy involving, among other initiatives, the youth 
internship program and Youth Service Canada. Our government is 
maintaining its $700 million in funding over the next three years 
for these programs. While past governments have run make work 
projects for young people, Youth Service Canada and the youth 
internship program focus on providing participants with tangible, 
hands on experience.
<P>
	Youth Service Canada provides employment skills built on 
community needs. Students gain valuable work experience that 
will help them make that very important transition from school to 
work. The community gains the energy and enthusiasm which only 
the young can bring to their work. The youth internship program 
works because it builds partnerships between employers and 
educators, teaching hands on skills to young people. The focus is 
on jobs and careers with a future. The theme is innovation.
<P>
	For example, last year I announced a special program for the 
automotive industry. When we look under the hood of a new car we 
see how technology has changed the industry. I read recently that 
the computers in new cars are worth more than the steel. This 
requires people with up to date skills. It requires a new generation 
of highly skilled workers. In turn, that requires a new partnership 
with the private sector.
<P>
	The youth internship program is an excellent example of 
partnership and co-operation. Chrysler Canada and other major car 
manufacturers donated engines and guaranteed on the job training 
spots to participants. We brought on board a major corporation to 
do its share to help tomorrow's workers.
<P>
	In addition to maintaining funding for Youth Service Canada and 
the youth internship program, this year's budget announced the 
government's plans to reallocate $315 million in budget savings for 
additional on the job training which includes doubling the funding 
for student  summer employment placements. It is a wise 
investment. In 1995 alone more than 52,000 jobs were created 
thanks to the student summer job action. Our Canada employment 
centres for students placed over 175,000 students in jobs during 
that summer.
<P>
	How does this Team Canada approach apply locally in my 
riding? I will tell the House about another effective partnership 
between government and the private sector which I announced last 
week.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	The government teamed up with Tetra Pac Inc., a forward 
thinking company in my riding. We each contributed $100,000 to 
an initiative called ``Completing the Circle''. The Career 
Foundation, an active training establishment in York North, is 
using these funds to match unemployed residents with available 
jobs in the riding. One hundred participants will receive 
pre-employment and on the job training, followed by a placement 
in a job with a future. This, my friends, is co-operation. This is 
team work, this is Team Canada in action.
<P>
	Speaking of jobs with a future, there is no greater growth area 
than high tech. Look in the career section of any paper. Where are 
the jobs? Computers. Look at page 76 of the budget plan and what 
do you see? Computers.
<P>
	The 1996 budget outlines a plan to enlist the help of 2,000 
students to help connect 50,000 small businesses to the Internet. 
What a great idea, students and small business owners helping one 
another.
<P>
	Another successful program I helped develop in my riding, one 
that I am extremely proud of, is VaughanTec. It is truly an 
employment strategy with a future. VaughanTec recruits young 
entrepreneurial residents of York North with an interest in 
technology and provides them with the skills and knowledge 
required to become successful high tech entrepreneurs.
<P>
	Through classroom training, skills development and concrete 
work experience, these young entrepreneurs develop the tools they 
will need to seek employment or create new businesses in this 
rapidly developing sector.
<P>
	As these local examples demonstrate, the private sector is our 
greatest and most appropriate medium for innovation. Canada's 
youth are our strongest foundation for our future. The framework is 
in place. The economic environment is improving. The 
partnerships are proving successful. We are following through with 
our commitment to providing opportunities. Canada will not be left 
behind.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree that jobs are necessary. I agree with the 
parliamentary secretary who spoke previously. He sounded like a 
Reformer. It is not the government's job to create jobs but rather to 
create an economy that is healthy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="452"> 452 </A></B>
<P>
	I am concerned, though, that the budget offers no tax relief. The 
hon. member for York North spoke very inspiringly about 
students, the desire for jobs, the desire of the government to create 
jobs, the desire of the government to make sure jobs are there, 
technology and everything like this.
<P>
	There is no tax relief and yet the government is trying to create a 
climate that will encourage businesses. I heard the Prime Minister 
say to businesses: ``Now it is your job. You go ahead and create the 
jobs, we have done what we can do''. I am a bit confused because it 
is very difficult for the market, for a health economy to exist if 
there is no tax relief.
<P>
	How will businesses have the finances, the will, the profits? How 
will they create these jobs? Where will the consumer confidence 
come from? I would like a realistic answer from the hon. member 
for York North.
<P>
	The budget did not create that confidence. It did not build the 
economy. It did not give us any indication that now there will be a 
lot of jobs for students. I feel it is the economy that has to have 
some kind of encouragement. I did not see that in the budget.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could please explain to me how, with no 
tax relief, businesses will suddenly get all this inspiration and turn 
things around in the economy and offer the jobs the government 
feels they should.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
finding my speech inspirational. One of the reasons I delivered it 
was to make sure people across Canada understand that when 
people come together and pool the resources available we can bring 
about positive change to people's lives.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	One of the things I do not agree with is that somehow Canadians 
are lacking confidence. I know that when I speak to Canadians 
from coast to coast what they are telling me about the government 
is that for the first time in a long time they believe our budgets.
<P>
	We are telling them we will reach 3 per cent of GDP on the 
deficit. We will be going down to 2 per cent. They also gain a lot of 
confidence from the more than 560,000 jobs that have been created 
since the election on October 25, 1993. That is good news for 
Canadians. They understand that we have low interest rates and 
that the fundamentals are there for small business to create those 
jobs.
<P>
	I agree with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and 
members of my caucus who are saying to the small business sector 
and to the business community that they have to join with the rest 
of the Canadian family to generate the jobs required, in particular 
for our young people.
<P>
	I cited a couple of examples of the type of work I have been 
doing in partnership with local stakeholders in my  riding which is 
are actually creating jobs for people. We live in an era of constant 
change. The old rules simply do not apply. We need to be creative 
and innovative to generate the type of job creation Canadians are 
calling for.
<P>
	I do not view this in a very self-defeatist way. The people in my 
riding of York North are quite excited about the change that is 
occurring. That is why initiatives like the Vaughan Technology 
Enterprise Centre, the York Region Strategic Alliance and the 
recent activities with one of our major corporations, TetraPak, are 
bearing fruits and bringing about change.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of all members of the House to join forces 
with local stakeholders to create those much needed jobs for the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this week's 
budget is nothing new. There is hardly anything to talk about, since 
this budget contains no measures that are really new. We realized 
that, for the next few years, the government has decided to ride the 
wave that brought it to power in 1993 and to stick with the 
measures that had been decided at that time-some of which, it 
must be said, were unpopular. The government has decided that, 
since these measures were announced two years ago, they did not 
have to be modified or supplemented by other measures.
<P>
	In other words, the government is thinking that the blows it dealt 
to Canadians-some of whom it even clobbered-have caused 
enough pain, since some of the measures will come into effect this 
year. Some of the decisions made in the 1994 and 1995 budgets will 
take effect this year and others next year.
<P>
	So, of course, the government is looking good, saying: ``We will 
not impose any drastic, unpopular measures this year''. No wonder, 
since those measures have already been announced in previous 
budgets.
<P>
	At the same time, the government has decided that, by adopting 
this new budget, it will still impose measures, although these will 
not take effect right away.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	These measures will be implemented in five years, so that 
taxpayers will not panic but think: ``This may be bad news, but at 
least we have five years to prepare for it''. We have five years to 
brace ourselves. It is as though people were saying: ``Who knows? 
Many things can happen in five years, so perhaps there will be a 
miracle and today's bad news will not materialize in five years''. 
This was the government's strategy in tabling this budget, which in 
fact is designed not to frighten anyone but which does not help 
improve the situation in any way.
<P>
	Let us examine some of the measures one by one and see what 
great plans the government has. Let us start with the national debt. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="453"> 453 </A></B>
<P>
When the government was first  elected, in October 1993, Canada's 
national debt stood at $508 billion. Today, in the 1996-97 
estimates, the federal debt is forecast to reach $602 billion. Next 
year, last year of this government's rule, the debt will have risen to 
$619 billion.
<P>
	For most people, it is difficult to imagine an amount of that 
magnitude. What does $619 billion represent? When you win $1 
million at the lottery for example, you know that $1,000,000 is this 
figure with six zeros. When you deal with billions, one billion 
equals one million millions. The government debt is 609 times one 
billion. Just in the past few years of Liberal government, since 
1993, this debt has grown by $110 billion or $112 billion. That is a 
lot of money.
<P>
	If the government managed to save, say, $5 billion-or five 
million times $1 million-every year by making sure that its 
income was $5 billion higher than its expenditures in its budget, at 
that rate, by putting $5 billion per year toward repaying the amount 
by which the debt has increased so far during the Liberal 
government's mandate, it would take 21 years to repay. This means 
that, in four short years, the Liberal government has moved us back 
21 years. And that is just for the debt incurred over the past four 
years.
<P>
	Now, if we were to apply this to the total debt, which is $620 
billion, or $619.7 to be more precise, and decided tomorrow 
morning to repay this debt, by managing wisely, at the rate of $5 
billion per year-That is a lot of money, you know. In the past 25 
years or more, we have never managed to save that much in just 
one year in Canada. Every year, for 20 or 25 years, we have 
accumulated budget deficits. Instead of accumulating surpluses, we 
accumulated deficits. This means that we spend more than we save.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Let us assume for a moment that the reverse is true and that, 
tomorrow morning, through sound management, we were able to 
save $5 billion and use that money to repay the accumulated debt of 
$620 billion. It would take, listen to this, Mr. Speaker, 120 years to 
pay off Canada's current debt. So, 120 years to repay the debt. 
Needless to say that none of us will be around to see that. I do not 
even want to think about it, because it would be so appalling. It just 
does not make any sense.
<P>
	Imagine how much hope and determination one needs to say that 
this country needs, for the next 120 years, budgets that will allow it 
to save $5 billion. Right now, we are not able to lower the debt. We 
barely manage to marginally lower the deficit. And we do so 
through artificial means. The government says: ``The deficit went 
down from $42 billion in 1993-94 to $24 billion in 1996-97, an $18 
billion reduction''. However, there is still an extra $24 billion 
added on to the debt. Next year, we will look at 1997-98. It is 
anticipated the deficit will then be around $17 billion.
<P>
	How did the government manage to achieve these deficit 
reductions? It did not do so by spending less but, rather, by using 
two main strategies. First, it gives the provinces less money than it 
used to for social programs and services, health and education 
being the main ones. This year, in comparison to previous years, 
the provinces will suffer a $2.5 billion shortfall. Next year, it will 
be $4.5 billion, for a total of $7 billion.
<P>
	For Quebec, this means a shortfall of about 25 per cent. In other 
words, this year our province will receive about $650 million less 
in transfer payments. Next year, the shortfall will be about double 
that amount, that is $1.2 or $1.3 billion.
<P>
	At this rate, I am not sure that many people would still say that 
Canada is the best country in the world, as is so often claimed by 
the Prime Minister. At the rate of $5 billion per year, it would take 
120 years to pay off our country's debt of $620 billion. If this is the 
best country in the world, I do not want to hear about the others. It 
must simply be terrible. Imagine, if that is what the finest and the 
best looks like.
<P>
	Clearly, the situation cannot continue as it is, and clearly the 
government's presentation of the budget in this form is what the 
leader of the opposition has most aptly called a cosmetic operation. 
It is an operation which seeks to disguise, to cover up, the 
magnitude of our economic ills. It is an operation aimed at making 
people forget that decisions were made two years ago from which 
there can be no going back. It is also an attempt to make people 
forget that decisions made to-day will kick in in five years time, 
whether we like it or not. Which ones are they?
<P>
	I am referring to the Canadian Social Transfer. This is $7 billion, 
and we know that implementation has begun. The government has 
not had to make any new statements; they know that there are $4,5 
billion that will not go out to the provinces this year. I had started to 
talk about how that was financed, as the government knows very 
well.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	I said that the government was financing this, financing the 
reduction of its deficit in two ways, but I gave just one.
<P>
	I spoke of the Canadian Social Transfer, where it recovered $7 
million, but there is another way. When the federal government 
decides to collect money, I do not think it can be trusted. As soon as 
it gets its grubby little hands on some money, you cannot be sure 
what it will do with that money. Think of what happened to 
Canadians' unemployment insurance contributions.
<P>
	There was a time when the federal government participated in 
the unemployment insurance fund, putting money into it to help out 
those who were unemployed. However, in recent years, the unem-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="454"> 454 </A></B>
<P>
ployment insurance fund has been fed only by  employee and 
employer contributions. Only those who work pay in contributions, 
with their employers. This money is what is will be used to pay 
unemployment insurance to those who, unfortunately, are out of 
work.
<P>
	Now in the past two years, the unemployment insurance 
situation has improved so significantly that a sort of unemployment 
insurance profit has been made. In other words, more money is 
coming in from workers and employers than is being paid out for 
unemployment-$5 billion last year.
<P>
	In all fairness, this figure of $5 billion should go to the workers 
and employers from whose pockets it all came. However, as 
employees and employers trusted the government, they have said: 
``You are a trustworthy body, you will collect this money for us and 
will keep it in reserve, in the bank, and when you need it, you will 
give it to us for the unemployed''.
<P>
	The government, which already had this responsibility, decided 
to keep it, of course, because that would also allow it, until the 
money was needed, to make whatever use of it it felt justified.
<P>
	When you put money into the hands of someone who needs it, is 
it not a great temptation for that person to use the money until the 
unemployed need it? Since the government is running a deficit, and 
needs money to look good, to be considered a good manager, when 
it sees $5 million not being used, it grabs it saying: ``I will pay it 
back later, if the unemployment insurance fund ever runs a 
deficit''.
<P>
	In other words, when employers and employees decided to put 
their UI contributions into the hands of the government, without 
reservation, it was as if the fox had been put in charge of the 
henhouse.
<P>
	The English have a another way of saying that. The Minister of 
Finance, who comes from Quebec, often uses the expression: ``Do 
not put the rabbit in charge of the lettuce''. For Quebecers who may 
not have understand, it means that to keep the lettuce, we should 
not give it to the rabbit or else, when time comes to eat the lettuce, 
there might be some missing.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	That is roughly what happened with the unemployment 
insurance fund: the government acted like a fox, or like a rabbit in 
front of a box full of lettuce. With its growing appetite-and we 
know how voracious the government can get-it took a large 
helping. Indeed, it took $5 billion paid by workers and employers 
and said: ``With this, I can reduce the deficit by $5 billion''. 
Adding $5 billion to $7 billion, we get the $12 billion that are not 
being transferred to provinces: ``Mission accomplished, we have 
reduced the deficit by $12 billion''.
<P>
	That is why, in the budget, the government did not change a 
thing in its approach, in the way it collects UI  premiums and in the 
way it pays UI benefits. If the government had wanted to, it had an 
ideal opportunity to take advantage of the situation to create jobs. 
Here is $5 billion paid by workers that are not used for 
unemployment insurance. It could have taken this opportunity to 
lower UI premiums, which would have left in the economy $5 
billion more that could have been used to create new jobs. The 
government should have jumped at this opportunity, if it had been 
sincere, having promised during the last election campaign to 
create ``Jobs, jobs, jobs''. It had the opportunity to create jobs, but 
it did nothing. It did not jump at the opportunity. Instead it jumped 
at the opportunity of making a good show.
<P>
	Why is the government trying to improve its image these days? 
Why does it need so much to improve it? Government members, 
from the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance on down, 
surely watch television. They must watch television. They must see 
what is going on in the other provinces. They must see what is 
going on in their own province, in some cities, when the 
government announces measures that will affect the 
underprivileged.
<P>
	I wonder if the government is not paving the way, just in case it 
might no longer be able to run the country in a few months from 
now. The Axworthy reform, which was withdrawn at prorogation, 
is a bill which the government is trying to reinstate right now. This 
reform is not all that popular. Thousands and thousands of citizens, 
people from the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, and 
Ontario, are complaining about this reform, calling it inhuman 
because it mostly picks on the less-privileged.
<P>
	Could it be that the government that is about to reinstate this bill, 
which will surely prove to be very unpopular, is trying to rebuild its 
image just in case it has to call an election? It could be. The 
government might have to call an election because of its unpopular 
measures, so it might be thinking: ``Maybe we should start 
preparing some ground work here.''
<P>
	It is a pity that I only have a few seconds left, Mr. Speaker, 
because I have so much more to say, but I will rely on my hon. 
colleagues to take part in this debate and decry not only the 
government, but also the budget, which, as I said before, does 
nothing to correct the disastrous debt and employment situation we 
have in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have an 
opportunity today to comment on the government's budget and to 
highlight its main components which, I believe, will benefit all 
Canadians in the short and long term.
<P>
	I would first like to commend the government-unlike my 
colleague from across the way-for respecting the voters' will, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="455"> 455 </A></B>
<P>
which was clearly expressed as regards  taxation. Canadians do not 
want any tax hike, because they believe that they are already 
paying their fair share of taxes.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The government has chosen to fit this tax freeze into an overall 
strategy which consists in guaranteeing our financial future while 
continuing to put our public finances in order. In this regard, the 
1996 budget is consistent with the 1994-95 budget, and this will 
enable us to reduce the deficit to $24.3 billion in fiscal 1996-97 
fiscal year, or 3 per cent of the GDP. This development shows that 
the Minister of Finance will undoubtedly meet his deficit reduction 
targets.
<P>
	Given the delicate state of the Canadian economy at the present 
time, the federal government could have opted for harsher 
measures. In fact, some provincial governments, such as the 
Ontario government, have chosen this path which, I think, does 
nothing but exacerbate the economic problems we face. The 
Liberal government rejects any solution based on ideologies that 
are narrow and prejudicial to Canadians. Our attitude toward the 
economic changes that have to be made is one of pragmatism and 
fairness to all levels of our society.
<P>
	I will give as an example the Canada Health and Social Transfer, 
which will benefit from secure, stable and increasing funding over 
five years, receiving $25.1 billion the first two years and an 
increase based on economic growth for the next three years.
<P>
	I will say that, contrary to what some sovereignists are saying, 
there is no new reduction of transfers to the provinces. This 
criticism is unfounded because it refers to the reductions 
announced in the 1995 budget. On that subject, I would like to 
indicate that those reductions from the 1995 budget represent 3 per 
cent of provincial revenues, not the astronomical amounts 
mentioned by our critics.
<P>
	The most disadvantaged in our society will not be forgotten in 
this budget and by this government. Budget cuts will not be made 
on the back of students. All Canadians can count on stable funding 
for health insurance.
<P>
	Do these measures aimed at securing the future of social 
programs come from a government that could not care less about 
the well-being of the community? Do these measures bear the mark 
of this economic laissez- faire, both unbridled and lacking in social 
conscience? No. These measures show the will of the government 
to guarantee the social programs that Canadians presently enjoy 
while allowing for fiscal consolidation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I was quite pleased by some of the measures announced by the 
finance minister. He announced two specific improvements that 
will benefit children. One  measure will see the child care 
deduction extended to passive income such as unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	I had proposed this amendment to the finance minister which 
was spurred by the experience of a co-operative education student 
and constituent, Ms. Janet Lewis, who worked in my office. She 
was on unemployment insurance at that time and therefore could 
not claim the child care deduction even though she needed child 
care in order to get her high school diploma. This inequity has now 
been addressed in the government's budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to mention that the new budget will give $250 
million more a year in supplementary assistance to some 700,000 
low-income Canadian families, a third of which are single-parent 
families.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	This is quite significant since the earned-income supplement 
under the child tax benefit will be doubled in the two next years, 
going from $500 to $750 in July of 1997, and to $1,000 in July of 
1998. Let us not forget that our children hold the future of our 
country in their hands and that child poverty represent a threat. I 
think that that initiative will bring more social and economic equity 
in Canada.
<P>
	I noticed with pleasure that the government dealt with the 
situation of youth on the job market by reallocating funds from 
other programs to the Student Summer Employment Program. That 
is a step in the right direction. Nonetheless, I hope that the 
government will take more initiatives to create more new jobs for 
all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In this regard several initiatives come to mind. The 
government's infrastructure program is a fine example of job 
stimulation, obviously benefiting the workers who obtain direct 
jobs from the project but also the economy as a whole. The future 
continuation of this program would, I believe, be beneficial to 
Canada's economy.
<P>
	A project to stimulate the construction industry would also go a 
long way on the job front. This project, apart from the creation of 
construction jobs and industry spin-offs, would also contribute to 
the social development of communities, allowing the government 
to kill two birds with one stone.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By bringing changes to old age pension benefits, the government 
is once more confirming its support of the principle of equity by 
better targeting benefits in order to give better support to low 
income Canadians and by reducing or eliminating benefits to high 
income seniors. Liberals have not forgotten the concept of a just 
society. They stand by it and have shown it in the budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="456"> 456 </A></B>
<P>
	Need I mention, as many hon. members already did, that the 
new seniors benefit will be tax free and fully indexed?
<P>
	This budget is based on a sense of moderation. It will allow the 
government to reach its goal of fiscal consolidation. In fact, the 
government acknowledges the need to put its fiscal house in order 
but not at the expense of a just society.
<P>
	Economy is only a means of making society work. It is not an 
end per se and should never be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not have 
time to say everything I wanted before and this gives me the 
opportunity to ask a question of my colleague opposite who praised 
the measures proposed by the government.
<P>
	He did not say much about the measures proposed by the 
government in its budget with regard to corporate taxation. For 
months and years now, the Bloc Quebecois has been asking the 
government to act to ensure that all profitable businesses pay at 
least a minimum tax. We are not talking about start-up businesses 
which are struggling and losing money, but there are thousands of 
businesses in Canada, some say between 60,000 and 70,000, which 
have been profitable for years and which are still not paying a cent 
in taxes because of the existing Canadian legislation.
<P>
	We learn in the budget that the government is creating a 
technical committee to review business taxation. It will carry out 
studies to determine the appropriate level of taxation. Should 
corporations be paying more taxes or less? Should tax shelters be 
revisited? Should they be eliminated or should new ones be 
created? What should become of tax havens, for example?
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The government announced the creation of that committee in its 
budget and said that seven or eight experts would be members of 
that technical committee. There will be university professors, 
chartered accountants, scientists and some experts who already 
manage funds in tax shelters because they have offices in tax 
havens. These people will be members of the committee and will 
advise the government on the approach it should use.
<P>
	The finance minister said, at lunch time today, that it is normal to 
consult people who know about tax shelters if you want to get some 
adequate recommendations. If we were to push the comparison a 
bit, we could say that it is like creating a Hell's Angels committee 
to help the government change the legislation on organised crime. 
We have almost gone that far.
<P>
	I would like to know my colleague's opinion on these measures 
his government wants to implement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for his question.
<P>
	I totally agree with him that businesses should pay their share of 
taxes to the government. In his question or comments, he indicates 
to us that he is not satisfied with the membership of the 
commission, but that is only a beginning. I am sure the government 
will try to find ways to settle its matters so that large businesses pay 
their share of taxes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sharing my time with the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The residents of Etobicoke-Lakeshore join me today as I stand 
to participate in the discussion of the 1996 Liberal budget. This is a 
budget which clearly demonstrates the government's ability, not 
only to listen but, more important, its ability to act.
<P>
	In my town hall meetings, in discussion with community groups, 
and my regular meetings with various community leaders, the 
message has been consistent: maintain vital social programs but 
reduce the deficit with spending cuts, not tax increases. This is the 
message that my constituents in Etobicoke-Lakeshore told me to 
bring to Ottawa.
<P>
	Without digging into the pockets of Canadians, the budget has 
managed to offer something for everyone. It reinforces a secure, 
stable and growing system of federal support for medicare, 
post-secondary education and social assistance. At the same time it 
re-emphasizes jobs and economic growth while creating 
investment in three priority areas; youth, technology and trade. 
These areas are essential to future jobs and future growth in my 
constituency.
<P>
	I invited 50 of my constituents to meet with me this morning to 
hear what they had to say about the 1996 budget. I held a forum in 
order that we may continue on in our important dialogue, 
addressing the needs and concerns of our community. We met and 
we will continue to meet because a budget is not an end in itself but 
a means to a better future for all Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to tell the House that my 
constituents were very pleased that the Liberal government, for the 
third consecutive year since its election, has not introduced 
personal income tax increases. Businessmen and businesswomen 
drew more encouragement from the fact that no new corporate 
taxes were introduced.
<P>
	Many of my constituents wrote to me and expressed their 
concerns about gasoline taxation. I remember letters from Mr. 
Victor Rowland, Mr. and Mrs. William and  Jean Christie, Mr. and 
Mrs. Andy and Theresa Manuel, about gasoline taxes. They were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="457"> 457 </A></B>
<P>
told this morning that their voices were heard. The government did 
not increase the price of gasoline or any other excise tax. Less taxes 
translate to more money in the pockets of individual Canadians. 
Etobians and other Canadians have every reason to be encouraged 
by the fiscal process the government is making on the national 
agenda.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance reaffirmed our deficit reduction plans in 
the House. We have delivered on the red book commitment to 
reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, down from the 6 per cent 
that existed when the government took office slightly over two and 
a half years ago. Over the horizon we can already identify evidence 
of the inevitability of the new 2 per cent goal.
<P>
	Fiscal progress should always be a means to greater public ends, 
to lower interest rates, to more jobs, to a more prosperous and 
secure Canada.
<P>
	Of equal importance, our fiscal progress will better enable us to 
move forward on other priorities and issues so important to our 
citizens. Clearly one of those high priorities must be the 
preservation of Canada's network of social programs. These are 
programs which offer life long protection to Canadians. These 
programs have helped established us as one of the most envied 
nations in the world.
<P>
	To achieve that end, as the Prime Minister promised, we had to 
provide a long term funding arrangement for health and social 
programs that is growing, stable, predictable and sustainable. The 
Canada health and social transfer was introduced in last year's 
budget as the single largest federal means of providing financial 
support to provinces for health care, for secondary education and 
social assistance.
<P>
	One of my constituents, Ms. Barbara Center of the Lakeshore 
area multiservice program, which in Etobicoke we fondly call 
LAMP, articulated her concerns on the effects of possible 
reductions in federal transfer payments for health care at my 
Etibocoke-Lakeshore prebudget consultation in early January of 
this year. She will be pleased to know that not only the present 
parliamentary secretary to finance but also the Minister of Finance 
heard her remarks.
<P>
	My constituents are pleased to hear that the 1996 budget now 
acts to extend the CHST, and furthermore that there will be no 
further cuts to the CHST. Following consultations with the 
provinces, the new budget sets out a new five-year funding 
arrangement for the CHST in which transfers grow and the cash 
component is stabilized and increased over time.
<P>
	The CHST entitlements will grow from $25.1 billion to $27.4 
billion over the next five years, an actual projected increase of $2.3 
billion higher than in 1997-98. This will mark the first time the 
federal government has  taken action to increase the growth in 
these transfers since the age of restraint instituted in the mid-1980s.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the government will legislate a 
floor to provide a sound guarantee that cash transfers will never fall 
below the $11 billion mark at anytime during those five years, and 
this is important for us. These proposals demonstrate the Liberal 
government's strong commitment to secure Canada's health system 
and social safety net and to build a renewed social and economic 
union. This is a system that many Canadian seniors have helped to 
build.
<P>
	In this light, the 1996 budget takes the necessary action to 
safeguard the public pension system not only for present seniors 
but also for our youth who will one day become seniors.
<P>
	Our system faces many challenges. Canadians are living longer 
and hence receive pension benefits over a much longer period. 
There will be fewer working Canadians to support the escalating 
cost. These factors and others will increase the cost of our public 
pension faster than our capacity to pay for them unless we act.
<P>
	The government in partnership with the provinces and territories 
has already launched a major public consultation program on 
changes needed to the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	The Ontario Coalition of Senior Citizens was also represented 
and did submit its concerns at the Etobicoke-Lakeshore 
prebudget consultation. The coalition will appreciate knowing that 
while the OAS and GIS programs have been subject to taxation, the 
new seniors benefits will be completely tax free. They will 
incorporate the existing age and pension income tax credits. 
Seniors will not have to report the benefit on their tax forms. 
Furthermore, payments to couples will be made in separate and 
equal cheques to each spouse. As the benefit will be fully indexed 
to inflation, a vast majority of seniors will be better off.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	It should be emphasized that savings will come from slowing the 
rate of growth in program cost, not at the expense of those in need. 
While the savings at first will be small, they will build year by year 
to about 11 per cent of program cost by the year 2030.
<P>
	Public consultations will be held on legislation which will be 
introduced in the future. We are ready to participate. The 
constituents of Etobicoke-Lakeshore can be assured that I will 
once again offer their input toward the construction of a more 
sustainable public pension system. Their participation is critical to 
us as we move forward with these changes.
<P>
	I end by underscoring my belief that the government is on the 
right track. In 1993 we ran on a balanced platform. We made a 
commitment to restore fiscal sanity to the country while focusing 
our efforts on protecting  vital programs and improving 
opportunities. The budget shows we are firm in our resolve. The 
federal deficit will continue to decrease and the economy will 
continue to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="458"> 458 </A></B>
<P>
grow. Most important, I am especially pleased that we are not 
cutting spending on the backs of those who can least afford it.
<P>
	I am confident that as I continue to discuss the budget with the 
residents of Etobicoke-Lakeshore they will support the measures 
the budget proposes to secure Canada's social and financial future. 
I therefore call on all of my colleagues in the House to join with the 
government in support of the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I remind the hon. member that the budget offered no tax 
relief. It was not a balanced budget, which we had hoped for, at 
least for 1997-98, which we certainly could have achieved.
<P>
	The debt is climbing at a tremendous rate. The debt was not 
mentioned. We keep talking about the deficit. The deficit may be 
decreasing but the deficit could also disappear if it were handled 
correctly. What about the debt? The debt is growing. What are we 
doing about the debt? That is the serious issue.
<P>
	In particular, the hon. member mentioned there were no tax 
increases. The new child support package, which will come into 
effect on April 30, 1997, raises some concerns which relate to what 
I call tax increases.
<P>
	One of the concerns is no deduction, no inclusion. That is the 
new role of the day. The parent paying support will no longer have 
an incentive and so they might default. It might be easier for them 
to default now. It probably will happen. Wonderful people that they 
may be, these are difficult times.
<P>
	If this is the case, we may see that it will be more difficult for 
them to find the money. If the incentive is not there for deductions, 
we may see this occurring. We may have a new social problem 
erupting before our eyes, or rather an increased one because some 
of that occurs right now. It may be an enlarged social problem 
which will come about. That will make it very hard on the parent 
trying to support a child and counting on that support.
<P>
	If the person paying support no longer receives a deduction, that 
is a tax increase. Therefore I disagree that there are no tax 
increases.
<P>
	Will this cause a present problem to become larger, requiring 
more taxpayer dollars to be spent as a watchdog or as a guideline to 
keep these people paying? That will be costly to the taxpayer. Who 
pays when the courts get involved? The taxpayer. That is a tax 
increase.
<P>
	The second concern with respect to the new rules announced is 
that the Minister of Finance can make it retroactive. I fear this will 
open the flood gates for more litigation. Either the payer or the 
recipient could sign and  file for change. That will lead to enough 
litigation among family law lawyers across the country to ensure 
that very few of them will be sitting idle. Who will pay the cost of 
the court cases or even of the new actions which may succeed with 
mediation only? That is another tax increase.
<P>
	Nothing in today's world is as costly and expensive as court 
cases. Courts are expensive and divorced parents have enough 
hardships to overcome. Do the children want to be reinvolved in 
more hassles this litigation will open up? They do not need to put in 
more time, more energy, wasted energy, that this new legislation 
will make possible.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	I realize we have a problem right now with the legal profession. 
The <I>Globe and Mail</I> the other day stated some lawyers are not able 
to pay their fees to the law society. I can see this being a major 
problem.
<P>
	However I am concerned that this almost seems like an attempt 
by the government to open up a flood gate, and so now we have all 
these new cases and for what purpose? I wonder if the member 
could comment on this. How does she feel this legislation will help 
people?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, the premise of the member's 
question underlies the point that divorce and the courts are really a 
way to accept responsibility for children.
<P>
	I ask the member to look very carefully that within marriage 
itself and within the responsibility parents have for their children, 
that responsibility has to be first and foremost, not looking at the 
legal system and the taxation system as the way and the means to 
bring about resolution to the responsibility parents have to support 
their children.
<P>
	It is also interesting that Reform members look at the budget, a 
budget that contains so much, a budget that speaks to so many 
issues, and focus on the negative aspects. Instead they should pull 
from it some of the things we need as Canadians, as a community 
and as legislators to work together and to move issues ahead.
<P>
	The budget provides the parameters. The legislation that will 
follow and the support through the taxation system will help 
confront the social problems that face us. We must focus on the 
problem of poverty among youth and among children, rather than 
seek to redress to every ill through the taxation system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to rise in support of the budget tabled by my colleague, the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In the 1996 budget we have tried to reflect the commitments we 
made during the 1993 election. To the House and to all those 
listening in Kenora-Rainy River and across the country, it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="459"> 459 </A></B>
<P>
continues to put our fiscal house in order and promotes our job and 
growth agenda.
<P>
	We all know and have to continue to emphasize that when we 
came to office we inherited a deficit of $42 billion, 6 per cent of 
GDP. We stayed firm in our commitment to reach an interim goal 
of 3 per cent of GDP within three years.
<P>
	To meet this goal we embarked on the most thorough review of 
government programs and spending ever seen in Canada. As the 
Minister of Finance pointed out yesterday, it would have been quite 
easy to balance the books in one year. We could have taken the 
Reform Party's approach and simply hacked away at the most 
vulnerable in society.
<P>
	Fortunately, though, we are not the Reform Party. It tries to hide 
its lack of ideas by irresponsibility and spouting out simple 
solutions to complex problems. We take our responsibility to all 
Canadians very seriously. We do not try to offer easy answers 
because there are not any.
<P>
	We have met our commitments to Canadians. Through our 
balanced approach we have brought government spending to its 
lowest level of GDP since 1949. At the same time we have 
maintained vital programs like health care which some members 
across the floor would be happy to abandon.
<P>
	We have not only met our deficit targets, we have exceeded 
them. This budget sets out a 2 per cent deficit target for 1997-98. 
We are on the way to a balanced budget. We will not stop, I assure 
the House, and the finance minister has reiterated this, until we get 
there.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	Cutting is not an end in itself. It is a means to an end. We on this 
side of the floor recognize that. Our management of the economy 
has seen interest rates fall dramatically, a vital component of job 
creation which some people seem to forget. As a result, more than 
half a million full time jobs have been created during our mandate.
<P>
	Some of us who are little bit younger may not be as wealthy as 
some of the folks across the way, but just think about this for a 
moment. If the average homeowner with a $100,000 mortgage 
were to factor in the changes in the interest rate for the last two 
years that have been possible by the changes that this government 
has made, the savings would be $2,400 a year. That is a significant 
amount of money for someone who has a mortgage. That is as good 
as any tax cut, the ability to say to the millions of people who have 
mortgages that they have saved a tremendous amount in interest 
payments because of the good fiscal management and policies of 
this government.
<P>
	We recognize that we can and should do more. The budget sets 
the wheels in motion after the first two budgets cleaned up the Tory 
mess. We are going full steam ahead to provide opportunities to 
Canadians.
<P>
	I do not have the time to go into the full details, but I want to 
touch on some of the key points in the budget that was presented to 
Canadians yesterday. The first point is youth. Young people today 
face great challenges both in financing their education and in 
finding their first job. The budget marks a major commitment to 
youth. Tax benefits for full time students are being increased. By 
doubling federal funding for summer jobs, an extra 30,000 young 
Canadians are being provided the opportunity to finance their 
education.
<P>
	The government is building on the successful youth internship 
program and committing an extra $315 million to work with the 
private sector to create youth employment. Some people across the 
way might think that is small potatoes and something to sneeze at, 
but for young Canadians who know how difficult it is to get their 
first jobs that kind of help is welcomed news. By investing in our 
youth I can assure hon. members that the government and most 
Canadians believe we are building a stronger future.
<P>
	We are also helping Canadian families, especially the working 
poor. Parents who want to upgrade their education and find better 
jobs will now be able to claim child care expense deductions. This 
includes parents who show the courage to return to high school. By 
changing the child support system, we are doubling the working 
income supplement of the child tax benefit. This will benefit more 
than 700,000 working Canadian families. This support for the 
working poor is one of the values that makes me proud to be a 
member of the government.
<P>
	It is very easy to say cut and slash until the budget is balanced. 
However, we all know and I am sure you know, Mr. Speaker, that in 
your riding there are many poor people who could not survive the 
kind of quick action that some parties in the House advocate.
<P>
	We are also showing a dedication to seniors now and in the 
future by introducing the new seniors benefit. By targeting 
resources to those most in need, benefits for seniors with incomes 
below $40,000 will be maintained and increased. Our seniors built 
this country and the government will fight to protect their 
independence, their benefits and their dignity from those across the 
floor who want to leave them twisting in the wind.
<P>
	I come from a relatively lower than middle class riding in 
northern Ontario. These kinds of changes are going to improve the 
positions of the vast majority of seniors who I represent. I would 
have thought that people across the House would have been quick 
to get up on their feet and say that this is a welcome change and 
something of which all parliamentarians should be proud, that we 
have made seniors more secure in their golden years.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="460"> 460 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	I am also proud that we have set out a plan which will not only 
stabilize but will increase transfers to the provinces for health care 
and post-secondary education. After all, our party created medicare 
and will not see it destroyed. That commitment is what differs 
members on this side of the House from other members.
<P>
	I would also like to touch on aspects of the budget that will 
directly affect rural Canada. As a rural member of Parliament I 
have spoken many times in the House and in caucus about rural 
Canada and its unique problems, as opposed to the problems some 
cities have.
<P>
	The community access program helps rural and isolated 
communities develop and expand Internet access. In northwestern 
Ontario it is a real opportunity for us to overcome our isolation and 
compete with the world. This program has already benefited 
several communities in my riding, including Ear Falls, Ignace, 
Sioux Lookout and Dryden. The budget provides an extra $30 
million to the vital program and I applaud the Minister of Finance 
for this.
<P>
	Sometimes the very basics of infrastructure that people from 
major centres take for granted do not exist in the rural parts of the 
country. For us in rural Canada to compete not only with our 
friends in some of the major centres in Canada but around the 
world we must have the tools.
<P>
	Private sector companies like Bell Canada will not put that kind 
of investment into rural Canada because there is no return on the 
investment. Therefore the government has a very legitimate role to 
play. I applaud the Minister of Finance and the government for 
recognizing that without government help these links would never 
take place.
<P>
	Another vital sector that members have heard me speak about on 
several occasions is mining. The rural caucus my colleagues and I 
belong to has spent many afternoons and evenings in meetings with 
various ministers trying to convince them of the need to help the 
mining sector.
<P>
	The new tax provisions concerning flow-through shares and 
capital cost allowances will spur exploration and investment. Rural 
Canada has been asking for these measures and the government has 
responded to the need.
<P>
	Finally, the budget allows a 2 per cent increase for Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development. I know the members of the Reform 
Party are going to criticize that increase. Before they do, they 
should learn a little history. They should visit some First Nation 
communities and have their blinders removed.
<P>
	There are 46 First Nations in my riding, more I believe than any 
other riding in Canada and I am proud to represent these First 
Nations in the House. I have seen firsthand the poverty and despair 
brought on by decades  of neglect and mistreatment by 
governments of all stripes. I have also seen the determination that 
First Nations have to take control of their destiny and break the 
cycle of despair.
<P>
	We cannot rewrite history, but we can and must help toward a 
better future. Through our commitment to aboriginal Canadians we 
are writing a better future. I quite frankly applaud the government 
for recognizing the poorest of the poor in our country.
<P>
	In conclusion, we have listened to the Canadian people. We have 
reduced spending. We have held the line on taxes. We have 
protected and enhanced the programs and benefits that provide 
opportunity for Canadians.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has lived up to his commitment and I 
want to congratulate him. Once again, I reconfirm that I support the 
budget and the government. We are on the right track and we are 
going in the right direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the 
distinguished presentation from my colleague from Rainy River. I 
thought I should seize the opportunity just in case the opposition 
did not see the wisdom of this budget and the wisdom of the 
member's presentation.
<P>
	We have to remind the opposition what the finance minister 
meant in his budget speech when he said: ``We must never let the 
need to be frugal become an excuse to stop being fair''. That sums 
up the essence of the 1996 budget. We have stayed the course of 
fiscal health while at the same time focusing attention on the needs 
of all Canadians. The government has demonstrated a caring 
sensitivity all along.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	I liked the creativity of the hon. member's presentation when he 
used a concrete example. He talked about the savings that each one 
of us have on mortgage payments. I still have a mortgage to pay. 
Maybe members opposite have fully paid for their homes but I, like 
most Canadians, have not. Savings like these are real savings to 
Canadians and we must not lose sight of that fact. That is a mark of 
the government's caring and compassionate commitment to 
Canadians.
<P>
	Speaking of another mark of the government, it was stated in the 
budget that there will be a health services research fund. That is a 
mark of the creativity of the government. It ensures that our health 
care system is the best in the world, not only in the quality of care, 
but in the efficiency and the effectiveness with which we deliver 
the system.
<P>
	The hon. member for Rainy River told us about the attention, the 
focus and the commitment to the youth, the students and the 
seniors of the government. All are hallmarks of its caring soul. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="461"> 461 </A></B>
<P>
compliment the member on  his excellent speech, seeing that the 
opposition hesitates to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his 
kind remarks.
<P>
	One of the things that has intrigued me the most about some of 
the comments members of the third party have made is that they 
keep saying the government did not cut taxes. Why did it not? They 
say it would stimulate the economy.
<P>
	I want to quote a politician that the opposition knows very well, 
Premier Klein of Alberta. He has given advice to another friend of 
ours, the premier of Ontario, on the issue of making major tax cuts 
as part of his overall game plan.
<P>
	I want to put it on the record because I think this must be the only 
group in Canada that thinks you can make these tremendous 
changes and reduce the deficit and get it under control while at the 
same time cut revenues by 30 per cent, as Mr. Harris has suggested.
<P>
	Let me read the advice that Mr. Klein gave to Mr. Harris the 
other day, as quoted in the <I>Toronto Star</I>. ``Harris is wrong to be 
planning to cut taxes at the same time as he is cutting government 
spending. I think he is going to have real difficulty doing both. 
Here in Alberta we never even contemplated a tax cut. Our focus 
was entirely on eliminating the deficit''.
<P>
	I concur with that. I believe that anybody who thinks that Mike 
Harris is going to give Ontarians a 30 per cent deal with his fiscal 
problems is smoking something that is illegal in Canada.
<P>
	I cannot believe that the members opposite keep suggesting to us 
that we have not done a good job with our budget because we did 
not give a tax cut. I just thought maybe the members would keep in 
mind that their friend in Alberta disagrees with them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate.
<P>
	Before I begin my comments I want to say this. I am sure that 
Premier Harris of Ontario will be delighted at the words of wisdom 
that have been passed his way by a member of the government 
which is running up the largest deficit in this country's history.
<P>
	The Liberals are running up a debt of over $600 billion. They 
talk about their concern for our children's future. They have just 
mortgaged it to the point where our children will not have the 
opportunities in their future years that we have had. I am sure Mr. 
Harris will take that remark on the basis of where it came from. I 
speak tonight on this budget with our country at a crossroads, a 
country in a fiscal and unity crisis. It is a time in our history when 
Canadians are looking for leadership, vision, hope.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	That was reflected in the year end poll that was reported in 
<I>Maclean's</I> magazine where Canadians' view of their future is at an 
all time low. That is after two years of the Liberal government. 
Canadians view their future with more pessimism than they have in 
20 years.
<P>
	After two years of the Liberal government we had a throne 
speech and a budget and hopefully a new beginning, a realization of 
the errors of the past and a move toward a new and brighter future. 
They both failed miserably in addressing that, unfortunately.
<P>
	The Prime Minister started out in the throne speech by declaring 
to the world that the back of the deficit has been broken. I do not 
know of any business organization that agrees with that comment. 
The only back that has been broken up to this point is the back of 
the taxpayer. We have not broken the back of the deficit.
<P>
	I will read from a letter that came from the president of the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce. The Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce is a group of entrepreneurs, an organization that creates 
jobs in this country, an organization that wants to get this economy 
moving. On December 6, 1994 a letter to all members of 
Parliament and the Senate stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Last year through the aim for a million jobs survey our members told us in no 
uncertain terms that elimination of the deficit and reduction of the debt must be 
our number one priority if Canada's entrepreneurs are to create new jobs. The 
next federal budget will be crucial to the future of our country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Tough choices will be necessary and despite the overwhelming consensus 
that the deficit must be cut, we fear that the cuts will not be deep enough. The 
finance minister's promise to meet his target of a deficit that is 3 per cent of GDP 
by 1996-97 is simply not good enough. The deficit must be reduced to zero by 
1997-98. The consequences of the government not following through on this 
are unthinkable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a survey of 6,000 entrepreneurs, the people who create 
the jobs we are looking for and which the government is failing to 
create. That is what the business community is saying.
<P>
	There is nothing in this budget that will create jobs, jobs, jobs. 
There certainly is no hope for tax relief. There is no vision. There is 
no future that Canadian taxpayers can see in it.
<P>
	This is not the first budget. This is the third budget this 
government has brought forward. The first budget did absolutely 
nothing. It was a stand pat, feel good, we do not really have a 
problem budget. That is after nine years in opposition. The Liberals 
were nine years in opposition. They finally come into power and 
they are not ready for it. They do not know how to deal with it. 
They do not even understand the magnitude of the problems the 
country was facing.
<P>
	Along comes the second budget in 1994 and finally we get some 
realization that we do have a problem. They  finally come to realize 
that there is a relationship between these deficits and this huge debt 
and job creation. In that budget we started to make some modest 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="462"> 462 </A></B>
<P>
cuts, not nearly deep enough but at least we saw some hope that 
there is now a move in the right direction, that the government has 
made the connection that it we want to create jobs, if we want to 
offer tax relief to Canadians, we have to do something about our 
overspending and get our budget in balance.
<P>
	This third budget has just dashed all those hopes that Canadians 
had. What we have in this third budget is time out, no more cutting. 
We will stand back now and just let things roll along. We are in a 
battle to save Canada, the most crucial budget in Canada's history, 
and what does the government do? It calls time out.
<P>
	The government can call time out. It will quit the battle at this 
point but the clock keeps ticking. At $1,000 a second, $100 million 
a day we are deeper and deeper in debt while the government stands 
back and tries to decide what it will do. It just is not good enough.
<P>
	This budget fails to deal with two main election promises. Those 
are jobs, jobs, jobs and the GST.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	The infrastructure program was to be the answer to job creation. 
For month after month we heard what the infrastructure program 
has done to create jobs. It has been an absolute failure. Worse than 
that, it has put us $6 billion deeper in debt. If it were half as good as 
the Liberals claimed it to be, I would have thought they would have 
reintroduced it. It has been deep sixed, as it never should have been 
introduced.
<P>
	In the budget speech the finance minister delivered there was not 
a word about the GST. There is not a word about it because the 
Liberals are embarrassed about their inaction with respect to the 
GST. A lot of Canadians voted for the government on the 
understanding that it was to scrap the GST, not sugar coat it and not 
have it reborn under another name.
<P>
	At least one member of the government has had the courage to 
stand up in public and say: ``We were not true to our word. We did 
not do what we said we would''. I applaud the hon. member for 
York South-Weston for saying that. A few other members have 
indicated their embarrassment. I hope they have the courage to 
stand up and say the same thing.
<P>
	What we will not find in the budget speech but which is in one of 
the documents is a reference to the federal sales tax being 
harmonized. There was never any talk of harmonizing it, but that is 
what is coming down. That means we will have what is known as 
the LST, the Liberal super tax. We should mark our calendars. It is 
not far down the road. Canadians will not be fooled by the LST; a 
tax is a tax is a tax.
<P>
	Let us take a look at exactly what was in the speech presented by 
the finance minister yesterday. On page 3 he very clearly outlined 
the problem. In his opening remarks he told us that he understood 
the problem under ``Securing the Future''. It is as clear today as it 
has ever been that Canadians do not want rhetoric from their 
governments. What they want is action. What they seek is real 
progress.
<P>
	Seldom in our history have so many experienced such anxiety. 
Canadians feel their very way of life is at risk. They look at 
medicare and feel it is threatened. They look at the pension system 
and wonder if it will be there in future years. They consider the 
economy and worry that the gale force winds of competition and 
change will carry their jobs away. Canadians think about their 
children and ask what kind of opportunities will be left for them.
<P>
	If there is one obligation before government today it is to do its 
part to address these deep concerns. It has to do what it must so that 
confidence can overcome anxiety and hope can replace the despair 
in the country today. The budget does not deal with those deep 
concerns.
<P>
	Let us move on to page 4 under ``Securing Our Financial 
Future''. Here we get into the 3 per cent of GDP they keep 
heralding in speech after speech. I do not know who set that 
yardstick. It is no yardstick. The IMF and Moody's have both said 
it is no yardstick, that it is too low, it is not a realistic objective. 
What the government is saying by aiming so low is that it does not 
really understand the magnitude of the problem and it is not 
prepared to deal with it in a realistic way.
<P>
	Page 6, paragraph 4, talks about getting budgets in balance:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No matter their political stripe, every single province and territory has as a 
primary goal the return to fiscal health. In fact, eight are expected to report a 
balanced budget-or even a surplus-for the fiscal year ending this month and 
the results are striking.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Striking results. It is right there. Why have the Liberals not 
received the message? There are striking results from getting the 
books in balance. They still have not committed to do that.
<P>
	What he is saying in this document he is not prepared to do. 
Obviously he does not really believe it. However, it is right there. 
This is the blueprint.
<P>
	On Page 7, ``Principles for Securing the Future'', paragraphs 4 
and 5 state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Second, our fiscal strategy will be worth nothing if at the end of the day we 
have not provided hope for jobs and for growth. We must focus on getting 
growth up at the same time as we strive to get spending down.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is not happening.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Third, we must be frugal in everything we do. Waste in government is simply not 
tolerable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="463"> 463 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	We are about to spend $675,000 advertising the $2 coin, as if 
Canadians had any choice. If that is not a colossal waste of 
government spending I do not know what is.
<P>
	On page 8 under the heading ``A Measured, Responsible Pace'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Chronic deficits put the disadvantaged at risk, because it is they who suffer 
when the financial strength of government is so weak it can no longer reach out 
to those in need.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, that does not mean that we share the view of those who think we 
should be going to zero deficit overnight.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	No one said that. No one said we will get to deficit reduction 
overnight. We had a plan to do that in three years and it was 
achievable, but the government failed to realize it.
<P>
	I will jump to the real tragedy in this document. It is on page 28 
under the summary statement of transactions. The first line is the 
budget revenues. We show budget revenues going from $116 
billion to $141 billion, an increase of $25 billion. We then drop 
down to the deficit. The deficit declines from $42 billion to $17 
billion, a drop of $25 billion. The government is reducing the 
deficit on revenues, not on cost cutting, which this document is 
attempting to tell the Canadian people it is.
<P>
	However, the real shame here is this net public debt. The 
government in its mandate is going from $508 billion to $619 
billion of federal debt. I say shame. That is mortgaging our 
children's future and as a government it should be ashamed of 
itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
the pleasure on behalf of the Reform Party of rising to speak to the 
budget. In doing so I will try to keep my remarks brief and to the 
point.
<P>
	In the 1993 election the Reform Party ran on a proposal to cut the 
deficit in order to create jobs and to cut nearly $20 billion in 
government spending over a period of three years. The Liberal 
Party ran on a program to create jobs by ignoring the deficit.
<P>
	Let us look at what we actually have from the government after 
three years. I draw the attention of any Canadian who is interested 
to the budget speech. Skip through the first 27 or 28 pages, which is 
all bafflegab. One thing we notice about this minister is that the 
less he has to say, the longer his budget speeches.
<P>
	There were fewer proposals in this one than in the last two but it 
must have been the longest budget speech in history. When you get 
to the end, look at the four pages at the back because they provide a 
statistical summary of the budget that has most if not all of the 
relevant information for most Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	From 1993 to 1998 the deficit is projected to fall from $42 
billion to $17 billion, a drop of $25 billion. How is  that achieved? 
Revenue will rise in the same period by $25 billion. This is the 
government saying it has no tax increases but revenue is rising as a 
percentage of the economy.
<P>
	However, if we have a $25 billion revenue increase and a fall in 
the deficit of $25 billion, why do we have any spending cuts at all 
from the government? Why do we not have a balanced budget?
<P>
	We have an increase in interest payments of at least $11 billion. I 
say at least because most of that has already been achieved and it 
will continue to rise. One of the ways the government makes the 
deficit look like it is to continue to fall is by insisting that interest 
payments will taper off, that we will have lower and lower interest 
rates, but that is the best case scenario.
<P>
	Interest payments have already risen $11 billion, and so the 
government has been cutting over this period. By the end of 1998 it 
will be cutting $23 billion in programs and will still have a deficit 
of $17 billion. That is an interesting figure, $23 billion, because 
that is more than the Reform Party had proposed to cut in the 1993 
election. It is because the $100 billion in debt the government is 
adding, it is the cost of its delay and the cost of fiscal 
mismanagement. By the way, the debt at this moment and in the 
next year at least and probably the year after will continue to grow 
faster than the economy.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	Now the Liberals tell us they have targets. The targets are 
outlined in the budget. We just had a deficit of $32 billion. It will 
be $24.3 billion next year and the year after it will be $17.7 billion. 
This all sounded very familiar, so I asked one of my researchers to 
get me the 1991 Tory budget presented three years into the 
Conservatives' last term of office. Guess what the 1991 Tory 
budget stated. The deficit that year was $30.5 billion; for the fiscal 
year beginning in 1992, the projection was $24 billion; in 1993 it 
was $16.6 billion. It all sounds familiar.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> And did they get there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> The parliamentary secretary asks 
if they got there. No, they did not get there. And there is no 
guarantee we will get there this time either.
<P>
	The last government did not get there because it did not have a 
plan and because everything it did was eaten up by increased 
interest payments. But I will say that this government does have a 
partial plan to get there. What is that plan? Very simply it is to 
attack the slash and burn Reform Party while slashing in particular 
social programs far deeper than the Reform Party ever proposed.
<P>
	In the 1993 election we said to cut unemployment insurance by 
$4.5 billion. There were howls of outrage from the Liberal Party. 
The Liberals have already cut the program which was at $20 billion 
at its peak under the  Tories and which is now paying out $13.5 
billion today with more cuts to come as proposed in the bill the 
government tabled in the last session and will table again.
<P>

<P>
	We said to make old age security based on income and not to pay 
it to anyone with an income above $53,000. The Liberals now 
propose exactly the same policy. No more universality. Make old 
age security based on income. Except now it is based on $40,000 
instead of $53,000.
<P>
	We said to cut the Canada assistance plan by roughly 10 per cent, 
$750 million. The Liberals have done exactly that and there are 
more cuts to come in the next two or three years.
<P>
	In our 1993 election proposals we said we did not need to cut 
post-secondary education at all to balance the budget. The Liberals 
have already cut it 10 per cent and there is more to come.
<P>
	We said not to cut health care funding. It is the most important 
priority of all Canadians. The Liberals said they would not. They 
said they would preserve the five principles of the Canada Health 
Act. They have cut health care by 10 per cent and there is more to 
come. There are still the five grand principles; there will just be no 
money to implement them.
<P>
	In fact, in these last three areas, the Canada assistance plan, 
health care and post-secondary education, in the next two to three 
years the Liberal Party will cut over $7 billion in cash payments to 
the provinces. This will be the principal means by which the 
Liberals will reduce the deficit.
<P>
	What is still there that we have proposed to cut that the Liberal 
Party has not cut? The Liberals have not cut the regional pork, the 
regional development programs. They did not cut the funding to the 
special interest groups. All those programs are still there. And of 
course, they still have their gold plated MP pensions.
<P>
	What happened to the other promise, the one about jobs? We 
were told we did not have to worry about the deficit because we 
were creating jobs instead. Well, there is no jobs plan in the budget. 
There is not even an estimate on jobs in the budget. It is 
unprecedented in my 10 years of experience in federal politics to 
not even provide employment estimates.
<P>
	The Liberals say cutting is not an end in itself. Cutting is 
apparently not an end in itself. Cutting is done by the government 
not as an end in itself but in order to protect friends, in order to send 
out political messages, in order to attack the Reform Party, in order 
to mask fiscal incompetence. In other words, the government cuts 
spending in order to make programs, in order to make taxpayers 
and in order to make jobs the targets of our policies instead of the 
winners; to make them the victims instead of the winners.
<P>
	The Liberals were elected in 1993 by telling people what they 
wanted to hear: there would be no GST, no free trade, no distinct 
society, lots of jobs, universality of pensions and do not worry 
about the deficit.
<P>
	Canadians have to make a very serious decision next time of 
whether they will be fooled again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
has been very critical of some of the things he says are in the 
budget. He has not recognized the programs for youth.
<P>
	The theme of my speech when I give it next week is to 
compliment the government on two main things: the government 
has maintained its deficit targets and there are no new taxes. In my 
opinion it is reassuring to see that it is possible for a government to 
make a budgetary plan, as was outlined in the Liberal red book, and 
then stick to that plan budget after budget.
<P>
	I did acknowledge the member opposite saying the government 
did have a plan. That plan projected certain deficit targets. Not only 
will we meet those targets, we will exceed those targets.
<P>
	The main objective of the Liberal platform, the point I want to 
make, was job creation. There is a recognition of that. That is what 
we are doing by creating the proper economic climate.
<P>
	The member would acknowledge that there is a direct link 
between deficit reduction, interest rate reduction and job creation. 
That is the aim of the government. That is what it will continue to 
do as it not only meets its targets but exceeds its targets on its way 
to a zero deficit over the next number of years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the youth 
employment initiatives, I guess all I will say about them is the 
youth of Canada will be paying the interest on the borrowed money 
for those for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	A comment was made of importance of lower interest rates for 
young people. Let me say something about the lower interest rates 
of the government.
<P>
	When I was elected I was married just after that in 1993. Being 
an economist by training and watching what was planned in the 
fiscal policies of the government, my wife and I took out a 
mortgage. I said lock that mortgage in today for five years because 
under the government we will not get interest rates this good for the 
next five years. Today even with the low interest rates the 
government is talking about one cannot lock into a mortgage at the 
interest rate I locked into in late 1993.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 7.09 p.m., the House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.09 p.m.)
