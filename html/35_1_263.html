	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
the honour to present, in both official languages, the fifth report of 
the Standing Committee on Government Operations.
<P>
	Pursuant to an order of the House dated Wednesday, November 
8, 1995, the committee studied Bill C-101, an act to amend the 
National Housing Act, and has agreed to report it without

associate membership on the Standing Committee on Agriculture

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-357, an act respecting restriction on foreign aid.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill is designed to stop the flow of 
financial or other aid to any foreign country that refuses to accept 
re-entry of its nationals or former nationals deported from Canada.
<P>
	Far too often when foreign born criminals are ordered deported 
from Canada, deportation is hampered because some countries do 
not want to take back their nationals. The foreign aid restriction act 
addresses this issue by freezing aid to countries that frustrate the 
Canadian deportation process.
<P>
	The bill is a strong measure to ensure effective deportation 
policy in Canada. If a country will not take back its citizens who 
have committed criminal acts in Canada or who have 
misrepresented their past involvement in organized criminal 
activity, terrorism or other activities as noted under section 19 of 
the Immigration Act of Canada and are ordered deported, the bill 
would then direct the Department of Foreign Affairs to suspend all 
foreign aid to that country.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition which 
has been circulating across Canada. This petition has been signed 
by a number of Canadians from Estevan, Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society.
<P>
	They also state that the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families that make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

	These pensioners believe that Bell Canada, which was 
responsible for the choice of Confederation Life as an

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour today to present a petition concerning the 
``On to Ottawa'' trek.
<P>
	These petitions are historically important in that they bear the 
signatures of some of the original 1935 ``On to Ottawa'' trekkers, 
including Mr. Robert Savage, the last living member of the 
delegation of eight to meet with the then Prime Minister R. B. 
Bennett.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	Sixty years ago Prime Minister Bennett ordered the arrest of the 
``On to Ottawa'' trek leaders at a public meeting, hence provoking 
the Regina riot. The trekkers, citizens of Regina who witnessed the 
riot, family members and other Canadians draw the attention of the 
House to the ``On to Ottawa'' trek and its abrupt end in Regina on 
Dominion Day 1935, and the then federal government's role in the 
police riot in Regina.
<P>
	These petitioners call on Parliament to extend to the 1935 
trekkers, the Regina citizens and their families its unequivocal and 
official apology for its part in provoking the police riot.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHUMANRESOURCESDEVELOPMENTACT">DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES 
DEVELOPMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 21 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-96, an act to establish the Department of Human 
Resources Development and to amend and repeal certain related 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak on 
Bill C-96.
<P>
	The bill has a single and fairly simple purpose, integration. The 
government is setting out a solid legislative process for integrating 
Canada's social and labour market programs. With these changes, 
the Department of Human Resources Development brings under 
one roof all of our efforts to help Canadians achieve their full 
potential in society and in our economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16699"> 16699 </A></B>
<P>
	Within this single department are all the programs and services 
that help people looking for work find and keep jobs, help 
employers find workers they need, help workers and employers 
under federal jurisdiction to maintain fair labour standards and a 
safe working environment, help people between jobs, Canadian 
seniors, families with low incomes and people with disabilities to 
get the income support they need.
<P>
	It will help people get training and develop new skills for a 
changing economy. As well, it will help local businesses, 
communities and entire industries to target the skills for the future 
and build a skilled workforce that will help Canada be competitive 
and prosperous in a changing world.
<P>
	By bringing all of these different programs into one department, 
we have taken an important first step toward ensuring programs 
work together, providing meaningful, co-ordinated solutions for 
the real world.
<P>
	By taking this step the government has helped set the stage for 
real integration in the way programs and services are delivered to 
Canadians. Let us face it, when people come looking for service, 
they could care less which program branch delivers that service. 
The last thing they need is to be sent running around from one 
office to another.
<P>
	One of the most fundamental goals of the government's 
approach is to ensure that integration takes place at the local level. 
To do so we must focus on locating the decision making and design 
of services at the local level. Instead of highly centralized decision 
making, we need to allow a much greater degree of discretion and 
judgment in the field.
<P>
	Having been in the field of psychiatry and mental health for 30 
years, I know what it means to tailor programs to individuals; it is 
very important and this bill accomplishes that.
<P>
	Over the last two years I have developed a close working 
relationship with the Canada Employment Centre in my riding of 
Annapolis Valley-Hants. I have had many opportunities to meet 
with the employees, listen to their ideas and watch these 
professionals do their jobs. I am convinced more than ever that 
decision making power must rest with the local level.
<P>
	Decisions about what kinds of programs make sense in a 
community should be made by the community, in partnership with 
local businesses, trade unions, community and municipal 
organizations. If it is going to work we have to completely rethink 
the way we define programs and services.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Burin-St. George's stated, we 
cannot say to communities across Canada: ``Here is a program and 
here are all the rules you have to follow. Do it our way or not at 
all''. He also went on to say that  individuals need programs and 
even though it is not what they need, this is the only program we 
have money for so take it or leave it.
<P>
	Instead, we want to say to communities and individuals: ``Here 
are some basic tools that we know have worked. Here is the money 
and the available resources. Now you the client decide which tools 
make sense and how you can use these resources most effectively''. 
Just do what needs to be done. That is the motto of this bill.
<P>
	That is what integration means, bringing it down to the local 
level. That is what we are trying to do with Bill C-96. The 
government is also bringing this approach to the largest single 
social program in Canada, unemployment insurance.
<P>
	For years now, we have had two separate tracks going for people 
who are unemployed. On the one hand there is the UI system, an 
absolutely vital program providing temporary income support for 
people between jobs. On the other hand we have developed an 
increasingly sophisticated and effective set of employment 
programs, a set of tools to help people develop new skills, gain 
work experience and in the end find jobs.
<P>
	Our challenge in this bill is to integrate these two components, to 
build a single integrated employment service that people can turn 
to, not just for a cheque but for help to get back into the workforce. 
This means finding a way to combine that essential system of 
income protection provided by UI with an active system of 
employment, a system that gives people the resources and the 
opportunity to make choices about the kind of skills that are 
required, the kind of future they want to build for themselves.
<P>
	For example, we are experimenting with a form of internship 
with small businesses. There are companies that desperately want 
to hire new workers but cannot afford to provide the training new 
workers require. With this program we help them hire young 
people, older workers and women returning to the workforce. We 
provide some support to pay for the learning curve, the time it 
obviously takes for new workers to become fully productive in 
their new jobs. The experiment is getting good results. Small 
businesses are creating jobs for unemployed Canadians, real 
permanent jobs.
<P>
	Over the past year we have developed a program for 
self-employment under unemployment insurance. We want to give 
people a choice. Rather than simply collecting benefits while they 
look for a new job, we want to give people the opportunity to create 
their own jobs. The department provides some financial support, 
monitoring and counselling to help participants get their businesses 
started.
<P>
	Over the past year 30,000 people have started their own 
businesses this way through the unemployment insurance system. 
They have not created just 30,000 jobs  but rather 60,000 jobs. That 
is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16700"> 16700 </A></B>
<P>
kind of positive initiative that can happen when we think in terms 
of integration.
<P>
	Another example of integration can be seen in our government's 
strategic initiatives program. This program is important since it 
provides the government with the unique opportunity to 
experiment with program design that will support future policy 
development.
<P>
	In September 1994 the government in partnership with the 
Government of Nova Scotia announced the launching of such a 
program. Success Nova Scotia 2000 will assist 3,000 young Nova 
Scotians to gain valuable work experience in leading industries 
using internships as an important part of their learning culture.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	It is part of our commitment to find better ways for young people 
to secure jobs. By bringing together a full range of Canada's social 
and labour market programs, we are setting a new course and 
making a positive difference in Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-96 provides a strong basis for this new direction. It 
ensures the structure that is in place for the federal government 
continues bringing programs and services together while working 
with our partners in the provinces and the communities across the 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, ever since the Bloc Quebecois arrived in the 
House of Commons, Ottawa has treated us to power plays of every 
description. First, it created the Department of Canadian Heritage. 
In so doing, Ottawa denied the existence of the Quebec people and 
the government gave itself a mandate to defend and promote 
Canadian culture and Canadian identity.
<P>
	Then came power play number two: the Department of Health. 
With this decision, the government expanded and consolidated its 
control over an exclusively provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	And now for Ottawa power play number three. This time, it is 
about human resources. I am referring to the bill before the House 
today, the act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development and to amend and repeal certain related acts. With 
this bill, the department blatantly ignores the existing consensus in 
Quebec on manpower training and directly intrudes in this 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	A fourth power play is now looming, and I am referring to 
reforms in programs connected with income security for seniors. 
Of course for the past two years, every time he had to field a 
question in the House, we saw the Minister of Human Resources 
Development rise indignantly and play the same tape over and over 
again: ``The document is wrong, you misread, and you do not 
understand''.
<P>
	However, there is every indication that Ottawa will use this 
reform to save money, again at the expense of the seniors, and the 
minister responsible seems to be the only one in this House who is 
misinformed.
<P>
	In the February budget that was supposed to reshape Canada, 
using a Tory recipe with a Liberal label, the Minister of Finance 
announced a reform of programs relating to income security for 
seniors. This reform was to take effect in 1997. According to the 
Minister of Finance, it will be based on the following five 
principles: first, undiminished protection for all seniors who are 
less well off, which means there will be no increase in benefits but 
payments to the less well off will be maintained at present levels.
<P>
	Second, a continuation of full indexation of pensions. Third, 
eligibility for OAS benefits will be based on family income. People 
should realize that this will significantly change the present 
system. In fact, OAS has always been universal, but after the 
Chrétien government's reform, the amount of the OAS cheque will 
depend on family income.
<P>
	Fourth, benefit levels will be reduced as income levels rise. 
Ottawa's so-called positive approach careful conceals its plans to 
lower the ceiling for the clawback.
<P>
	Fifth, control of program costs. In other words, administration of 
the OAS system will have to cost less.
<P>
	This sketchy outline of Ottawa's intentions received a stinging 
response from Ms. Blackburn, Quebec's income security minister. 
In a press release dated March 2, the minister commented that the 
federal government was launching another attack on the incomes of 
seniors and that the reform announced in the Martin budget would 
permanently destroy the balance of the current OAS system.
<P>
	The minister also pointed out that the decision to provide OAS 
benefits on the basis of family income would mean that more 
seniors, mainly women, would have to turn over their benefits to 
the federal government. The minister went on to say that women 
had won recognition of their independent status in society, but now, 
because of budgetary cutbacks, once they were retired their status 
would depend on that of their spouse and their family income and 
that, considering the measures proposed by Mr. Axworthy andMr. Martin, one wondered if women's rights meant anything at all 
to the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The minister's final conclusion is that such a change in 
calculating old age pensions makes them no longer a foundation for 
financial security in retirement but a social assistance program.
<P>
	Seniors will be entitled to an old age pension if their income 
places them in the category of persons with modest means. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16701"> 16701 </A></B>
<P>
must therefore acknowledge that the  federal government did not 
have the courage before the referendum to clearly and precisely 
inform Quebecers of what was really in store for them in 
connection with old age pensions, because it knew what an impact 
that knowledge could have had on the final outcome of the vote.
<P>
	Jean-Robert Sansfaçon, an editorial writer for <I>Le Devoir, </I>saw the 
announcements of old age pension cuts by the Minister of Finance 
in more or less the same light as Mrs. Blackburn. In his editorial 
last February 28 he wrote as follows: ``If Ottawa goes ahead with 
this, it will mean an end to universal old age pensions, which might 
end up being reserved only for households with modest incomes. 
This is a really new concept, one more closely related to social 
assistance than to a pension plan, and would encourage everyone to 
save money during their working years''.
<P>
	In another editorial on March 4 he wrote: ``Although this was not 
in the least what was expected of it, the present Liberal government 
is preparing to axe the plan-As early as 1997, we will see the end 
of basic benefits for everyone regardless of income. The amount 
received will no longer be the same for everyone but will be 
calculated according to total household income. Instead of being 
the base of the retirement income pyramid as it was in the past, the 
old age pension would become a kind of welfare payment. This is 
more than a reform, it is more like a revolution''.
<P>
	Before the House adjourned for the scheduled parliamentary 
recess, my colleague for Mercier got hold of a document called 
<I>Serving Canada's Seniors.</I>
<P>
	This document confirms the government's intentions of 
changing the old age pension into a plan reserved for only the 
poorest in our society. Page 5 of this document states: ``The old age 
pension system, the guaranteed income supplement, the spouse's 
allowance and the senior citizens' tax credit will be combined into 
a single new program requiring an income test''.
<P>
	In short, all programs will be rolled into one and the pension will 
be paid to seniors according to family income.
<P>
	After she obtained this document, the member for Mercier asked 
the Minister of Human Resources Development how he could 
reconcile what was revealed in this document with the Prime 
Minister's statement that the best way to protect our social benefits 
was to vote no. With his now legendary arrogance, the minister 
replied that the document in question was a mere invention by the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I would like to inform the people of Canada and of Quebec 
officially that no one within the Bloc has time to waste in writing 
such a document. And let me particularly point out that, if it were 
really a document from the Bloc, it would have been available in 
both of this country's official languages, and not just English.
<P>
	If the minister sincerely believes that the Bloc authored this 
document, I must reach the conclusion that, on the one hand, he 
does not know what is going on in his own department, and one of 
two things on the other hand. Either he has not read the budget of 
his finance colleague, or he read it without understanding it, for the 
document <I>Serving Canada's Seniors</I> contains the income security 
program reform promised in the Minister of Finance's budget last 
February. I would add that I am amazed that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development would point the finger at our party, when 
it is the Bloc which has been trying to cast some light on the 
coming changes to the various programs relating to income 
security for Canada's and Quebec's seniors.
<P>
	I would like to conclude with an invitation to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development to re-examine his old age pension 
strategy. To pay off the deficit at the expense of seniors, especially 
women seniors, is an unacceptable decision. When there is a 
budget in excess of $160 billion, one is entitled to think that all of 
our social benefits could be preserved, including old age pensions. 
The government must have the courage to make decisions that will 
enable all citizens to do their part to improve the collective 
well-being, and not make the least well off among us pay the price 
on their own.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Thalheimer (Timmins-Chapleau, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak on Bill C-96, 
which seeks to establish the legislative framework for the 
Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	I have been somewhat amused throughout the course of the 
debate on this issue by the comments of some opposition members, 
which suggest either a misreading of the bill or an overactive 
imagination. For instance, some members of the official opposition 
claim to detect a sinister plot by the government to usurp areas of 
provincial responsibility. Indeed, some have even gone so far as to 
suggest that we might seek to sabotage existing educational, 
training, and manpower programs in the province of Quebec. This 
rather odd scenario was perhaps best articulated by one Bloc 
member who suggested that this legislation might be part of some 
hidden agenda by the government to demolish all the educational 
tools Quebec has developed.
<P>
	Members of the third party seem equally confused. Many 
Reform members have expressed disappointment that the bill will 
not usher in the millennium and solve all the country's problems in 
one fell swoop. This would be a miracle were it to occur, since the 
bill from its inception was designed simply to take care of some 
legislative and administrative issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16702"> 16702 </A></B>
<P>
	It is difficult to determine whether such opposition concerns are 
real or simply represent mere political gamesmanship. However, 
it seems only fair to give these members the benefit of the doubt.
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to address some of the 
misconceptions clearly plaguing some opposition members and 
explain why passage of the bill is so important for assuring further 
progress in providing even higher levels of service to Canadians.
<P>
	To begin with, let me state what this bill is not designed to do. It 
is not, as some opposition members have suggested, a power grab 
or an attempt to raid areas of provincial jurisdiction. This should be 
clear from even the most cursory reading of this bill, which makes 
no significant changes to the statutory elements of the founding 
departments that are being brought together under this legislation.
<P>
	Equally important is the fact that this bill does not change the 
powers of the federal government or the provinces. Nor does it seek 
to grant new powers to the federal government, as some have tried 
to suggest. The department's mandate is clearly limited to just 
those matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction. Nor will 
there be any new powers granted by clause 20, which empowers the 
minister to sign contracts with agencies and institutions other than 
the provinces. This authority already exists and therefore 
represents no change whatsoever.
<P>
	If such concerns are unfounded, what does this bill really seek to 
do? Simply put, it seeks to recognize in a legislative, unified way 
the restructuring already under way, which is bringing together 
under one umbrella organization portions of the former 
departments of employment and immigration, health and welfare, 
secretary of state, and all of labour.
<P>
	This consolidation is critical, since it will allow us to take a more 
holistic approach to the social, economic and training issues that 
have traditionally been addressed by these departments. It will 
allow us to provide better service at lower cost and develop the 
flexible, imaginative, and highly targeted approaches needed to 
adequately address the challenges facing Canadians now and in the 
future.
<P>
	Of course this process of renewal has been under way for some 
time. I am pleased to say that this new department has had a 
number of successes in developing new approaches so Canadians 
can better cope with an increasingly demanding labour market.
<P>
	As gratifying as this is, more remains to be done. That is why the 
changes contained in the bill are so important. To begin with, it will 
help us build on these initial successes by clarifying the role of the 
department and the responsibilities of the minister to both 
Parliament and Canadians generally. It will simplify the current 
complex trail of statutory powers, many of them going back to the  
original pieces of legislation that set up the founding departments, 
by providing one act that sets out the mandate and powers of the 
department. Such a change will clarify the identity of the 
department by laying out for both employees and clients the 
department's goals and the resources it will have to achieve them.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	As well, the legislation will give people and organizations 
working with the department a clear idea of just who it is they are 
working with. As incredible as it may seem, many departmental 
officials still use old letterhead bearing the names of their former 
departments for legal and contracting purposes. This is confusing 
for partners, since in their minds those old departments no longer 
exist.
<P>
	Of course these are not the only administrative problems to be 
addressed. For instance, without the proper enabling legislation 
simple tasks such as transferring personnel can be costly and 
time-consuming. This is also the case with large and detailed 
contracts, which often involve a number of former departments.
<P>
	Most important of all is the need to bring the current transitional 
phase of restructuring to a close and then move forward. We need 
to build on our recent successes and undertake exciting new 
initiatives aimed at investing in our most important asset, people. 
To do this we need to clear away administrative obstacles so we can 
further undertake new initiatives such as UI reform, develop new 
programs and services under the human resource investment fund, 
and improve programs for our most vulnerable citizens, including 
seniors and the disabled.
<P>
	Finally, this legislation will improve service to Canadians while 
at the same time ensuring taxpayers' dollars are spent in the most 
cost effective manner possible.
<P>
	The bill before us will allow us to achieve all these goals. It will 
create the architecture required to implement the reforms needed to 
support Canadians with the job training opportunities they need to 
enter the next century with confidence. I would encourage 
members to support Bill C-96.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, Bill C-96, an act to establish the Department of Human 
Resources Development and to amend and repeal certain related 
acts, is basically just reorganization of the department and does not 
offer any substantive changes.
<P>
	It amazes me that with the number of people who are currently 
dependent on HRD for their welfare, some legitimately and some 
not, with the country in economic doldrums, with the debt 
increasing, with the IMF recently downgrading our country's rating 
by 50 per cent six weeks ago, the government persists in serving up 
bills that nibble around the edges of these problems, which affect 
us all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16703"> 16703 </A></B>
<P>
	Here is another opportunity lost. Never at any other time in 
recent history has this country required strong leadership in so 
many different areas. HRD is no different. In fact HRD affects 
the lives of those who are in the lowest socioeconomic situations 
within our country.
<P>
	We sympathize with the government in the position it faces. 
Indeed it is a difficult one. However, it is not an excuse for inaction, 
particularly since we as a party have put forward strong solutions to 
address these very important areas. Our HRD areas are in critical 
shape. They are in effect ready to fall apart.
<P>
	On the one hand, we have an increase in demand. On the other 
hand, with an increasing debt we have less money to spend on 
social programs. An important fact is that by the year 2010 the 
combination of payments on the interest and all the payments on 
social programs will consume every single dollar and every penny 
that comes into the federal coffers. What is the government going 
to do when that day comes? It is only 15 years from now. What is it 
going to do?
<P>
	We need intelligent plans in order to put social programs on a 
firm fiscal footing. The consequence of not doing that is to face 
collapse. Those who are going to suffer the most are those who are 
in greatest need. It is not the people in this room who are going to 
suffer; it is the people in soup kitchens, the people who cannot feed 
their children anything but macaroni and cheese, the people who 
are unemployable and the people who are not making ends meet. 
They are the ones who are going to hit the wall. They are the ones 
who are going to have to pick up the pieces, but they will not be 
able to pick up the pieces.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party has been accused of being a slash and burn 
party. I would not have joined this party and my colleagues would 
not have joined it if that were the case. I believe that every member 
of Parliament is committed to ensuring that social programs will 
continue in the future. We do not want to see people suffer. 
However, to sit around and do nothing is the single greatest threat 
to social programs. Inaction threatens social programs. It is causing 
them to implode. Health care is being rationed. Social programs are 
being rationed. There have been cuts across the board in welfare. 
That is what is preventing the people who truly need the programs 
from being able to live a healthy life.
<P>
	Those who suffer the most are the children. They are not 
receiving the proper nutrition. They do not have the ability to grow 
up to be healthy and strong.
<P>
	We spend $19.1 billion on old age security. The cost of that is 
increasing rapidly. It is out of control. Within the next 15 years the 
number of seniors will increase by 40 per cent. How will we pay for 
this? There is absolutely no plan for providing OAS to these 
people.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is $500 billion in debt. This is not 
accounted for in the debt figures. It is not actuarially sound, and 
there is no plan to change it.
<P>
	The Reform Party has put forward a plan for super RRSPs. I 
hope the government will seriously look at that plan and work with 
us on the program to ensure that the people who need it will receive 
both the OAS and the CPP.
<P>
	I would like to make some constructive suggestions. First, we 
have to decrease duplication and decentralize. It was a tragedy that 
the referendum was based in part on decentralization, because that 
is going to have to happen in every province across the country. For 
the country to be carved up partly over decentralization is a 
tragedy, because it is inevitable.
<P>
	In fact clause 6 of the bill does the opposite. It strengthens the 
hand of the federal government rather than decentralizing powers. 
Decentralizing powers does not mean that people will suffer. By 
doing that, duplication will be decreased and more money will be 
provided to the end user.
<P>
	The government can take a leadership role by working with the 
provinces in providing a minimum standard across the board to 
create similar standards for the provinces and ensure that those 
provinces that are the most impoverished will not suffer. It is a 
challenge, but it can be met.
<P>
	Second, we have to prioritize spending. It makes no sense to me 
that when we are prioritizing spending we cut across the board. 
That cuts from everybody, those who are abusing the program as 
well as those who are not.
<P>
	In British Columbia they looked at welfare. They looked at 780 
people. Of that number, 280 were flagrantly abusing the system and 
did not need to be on welfare. They stopped after looking at 780 
people; it was too inflammatory for them to continue. That is a lot 
of people. That money could be better spent in bringing down the 
debt and also in ensuring that the people who need it will get it. 
Cutting across the board only makes those who are the poorest 
suffer more.
<P>
	We should focus on skills training. Let us make sure there is 
enough money in the pot to provide skills for the unemployed.
<P>
	We also need to decrease the tax load. We have heard much 
about taxing the rich and corporations. However, the reality is that 
small and medium sized businesses are creating the jobs in our 
country.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	What are these businesses telling us? They say that we cannot 
compete with other countries with our existing tax load. Many of 
the closed shops and closed industries and much of the exodus of 
companies south are in large part due to the fact that their tax load 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16704"> 16704 </A></B>
<P>
is too great. Who suffers? It is mostly the people who are employed 
by them. Therefore our unemployment rates go up.
<P>
	We need to decrease government red tape which is severely 
restricting the ability of companies to function properly. We must 
also decrease the debt.
<P>
	We are not a slash and burn party. We have put forward 
constructive plans to enable us to decrease the debt, to get the 
deficit to zero, to priorize social programs, to provide alternatives 
to social programs, to priorize spending and to give people the 
skills to take care of themselves.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I too should like to speak to Bill 
C-96.
<P>
	The bill is simply a housekeeping bill that brings together a 
number of departments under one roof. Yet it has inflamed the 
emotions of both opposition parties. Their criticisms are so 
completely unjustified that I must wonder if in making the 
accusations both parties are really speaking to their not so hidden 
agenda.
<P>
	Some members opposite see Bill C-96, particularly clause 6, as a 
power grab. I have no idea how they came to this conclusion 
because clause 6 simply states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction and relating to the development 
of the human resources of Canada not by law assigned to any other Minister, 
department, board or agency of the Government of Canada, and are to be 
exercised with the objective of enhancing employment, encouraging equality 
and promoting social security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Any reasonable objective analyst not fixated on a separatist 
agenda or decentralist ideology would see that clause as a 
statement of purpose. It lists clear and legitimate limits for the 
minister, whose mandate is and always has been to devise policies 
that enhance employment, encourage equality and promote social 
security.
<P>
	Bill C-96 does not change federal or provincial powers at all. It 
does not tip the balance one way or the other. It neither increases 
nor reduces the minister's range of authority. The statutory powers 
of the department in place now are unchanged. I am sure members 
of both opposition parties who have basic reading comprehension 
skills must know that.
<P>
	The bill does not establish new initiatives or alter existing ones 
in any way. Only those members opposite who have chosen to play 
the victim role to the hilt and who apparently see a potential 
humiliation in every act of the federal government would see a 
power grab in the bill.
<P>
	The three objectives set out in clause 6 of the bill, enhancing 
employment, encouraging equality and promoting social security, 
have always been key objectives of the federal government, 
especially of Liberal federal governments.
<P>
	If a national government is not in the business of creating jobs, 
promoting equality of opportunity and establishing a social safety 
net, what is its business? Any federal government on the globe that 
is not totally anaemic, corrupt or viciously insensitive must have 
these fundamental objectives, especially the government of a 
country that has been named for the third year running the best 
country in the world in which to live. If the Canadian government 
were to drop these objectives, the official opposition would be the 
first to scream unjust and declare yet another humiliation of 
Quebec.
<P>
	The Canadian government is constitutionally responsible for 
unemployment insurance and for creating and operating programs 
that help unemployed Canadians find employment no matter where 
they live in the country. In my riding in British Columbia COAST 
and FOCUS YWCA have provided and continue to provide 
invaluable services, especially for single moms on welfare. 
Currently many of these programs do not receive funding from the 
B.C. government when they are actually saving tens of thousands 
of dollars in welfare payments.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	The federal Government of Canada has an international 
obligation under a convention of the International Labour 
Organization to provide national labour market information and 
exchange for all Canadians. The federal government is responsible 
for national economic growth and development. Therefore it is 
common sense that it must be involved in training.
<P>
	If we have learned one thing over the past decade it is that a well 
trained workforce is absolutely essential if we want to remain 
competitive in the global marketplace and to maintain our standard 
of living as number one in the world. The strongest most innovative 
economies in the world today, Japan and Germany, have become 
what they are largely because of their national policies that 
emphasize training.
<P>
	The federal government must be able to assist those affected by 
special situations that go beyond the jurisdictions of any one 
province, such as workers in the fishing industry, older workers 
displaced by restructuring of the economy or the dispossessed 
youth of Canada. In my riding Youth Service Canada projects have 
benefited youths very directly.
<P>
	The federal government has absolutely no interest in having 
powers just because it wants them. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development said it very well when he said that we 
must combine resources across the country so that when one area is 
facing high unemployment another area helps to support it.
<P>
	That is the Canadian way. That is why we have a federal country 
and a federal government. One part of the country supports another 
when it is undergoing trouble. It is a family in which we all help 
each other in  times of need, because we know one day we may in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16705"> 16705 </A></B>
<P>
turn be in times of need. That is the fundamental concept of 
sharing. The more we fragment the country as the third party 
opposition would have us do, the more we divide it, separate it, 
decentralize it and balkanize it into a series of fiefdoms, the less 
capable we are of helping individuals that no longer have the 
benefit of that sharing. That is why the federal government must 
continue to play an important role in this area.
<P>
	We have always been open to discussions with provincial, 
territorial and municipal governments about who is the best suited 
to deliver certain programs. We have negotiated that because we 
know we do not always deliver the best programs and that things 
must be done at the community level.
<P>
	Because clause 6 of Bill C-96 sets out the department's mandate 
in terms of general objectives, we must have the flexibility to serve 
Canadians better. I do not want to sidetrack the debate by raising 
non-issues and reading into clause 6 things that are there. It is 
really a disservice to the thousands of Canadians in all provinces 
who benefit from job creation and training.
<P>
	The other clause in Bill C-96 about which concerns have been 
raised is clause 20. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of facilitating the formulation, co-ordination and 
implementation-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Words like co-ordination mean that we work together to make 
something work. It is so simple and fundamental to a clear 
understanding of how teamwork is accomplished, of how we pull 
together, that I cannot understand the problem. Anyway the clause 
continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Minister may enter into agreements with a province or group of 
provinces, agencies of provinces, financial institutions and such other persons 
or bodies as the Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Any reasonable objective observer would see in this clause no 
hidden agenda to intrude. It merely provides a way to formulate 
co-operation with all groups with which we must form partnerships 
if we are to make the changes.
<P>
	Without the authority that clause 20 gives the minister the 
department would have difficulties conducting its simple mandate 
and its simple business. However the Bloc is bent on getting more 
power for the political elite in Quebec, while the Reform Party is 
bent solely on getting more power for the provinces and 
fragmenting and balkanizing the country.
<P>
	In 1994-95 the department of human resources signed more than 
50,000 labour market related contracts in Quebec which were 
worth $700 million. Among those 50,000 contracts were 9,600 
contracts with non-profit organizations, 9,300 contracts with 
private sector enterprises and 25,000 contracts under the fee payer 
trainee program, all in Quebec. It is the authority granted to the 
minister under clause 20.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	It allows us to enter into agreements with financial institutions 
for student loans. How are we to create a country of young people 
who can take over from us and carry on if those who cannot afford 
to go to school are not allowed student loans?
<P>
	It enables the federal government to sign agreements with 
provinces to help displaced older workers. When 45 or 50 year old 
people lose their jobs, especially in the emerging communication 
technology era, they need training.
<P>
	This kind of section empowered Ottawa to enter into a 
partnership with Quebec to help entrepreneurs and to help workers 
affected by the closing of the Hyundai plant in Bromont last March. 
The whole bill helps the department of human resources to create a 
national vision for Canada. It is not for British Columbia alone. It 
is how we work together as a country to achieve the kinds of things 
that make us the envy of the world.
<P>
	We are a unique country. I continue to hear people talk about 
how another country does it and why we are not doing it the same 
way. Wherever we go we hear people saying that Canada is a 
unique country. We have learned how to work together in peace. 
We have learned to do what we are supposed to do, that is to create 
peace, order and good government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, Bill C-96-and this may surprise you-seems to 
me to insult Quebec federalists. A lot of federalists in Quebec still 
felt, in the last referendum, that the federal government deserved 
one last chance to demonstrate its desire for change. Bill C-96, 
which was tabled before the referendum and which the federal 
government is still having debated in the House simply as if 
nothing had happened, represents the federal government's 
decision to interfere more systematically and with a basis in 
law-a new approach.
<P>
	The bureaucratic powers in Ottawa have now decided to 
incorporate into legislation the intrusions by the federal 
government over the past years in the area of manpower through its 
control over the unemployment insurance fund. This is particularly 
significant and a bit of a blow to Quebec federalists and to the 
consensus in Quebec on the question of manpower.
<P>
	There is, for example, Ghislain Dufour, the spokesperson and 
chief executive officer of the Conseil du patronat du Québec, who 
is not exactly considered a separatist or a sovereignist in Quebec. 
He says that now is the time, following the close result in the 
referendum, for the federal government to make it clear it is in 
favour of change and therefore acknowledge the consensus in 
Quebec on training and manpower. It is time the federal 
government agreed to give Quebec full responsibility for  
manpower to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16706"> 16706 </A></B>
<P>
put an end to the duplication and unnecessary expenditure in this 
sector.
<P>
	We hear the same message from Gérald Ponton of the 
Association des manufacturiers du Québec. In the days that 
followed the referendum, he said it was absolutely vital that one 
level of government withdraw, if manpower practices were to be 
effective. For this to work in Quebec, it is the federal government 
that will have to withdraw. We must not forget that the whole 
matter of training is part of government activity, it does not simply 
come out of thin air.
<P>
	As Quebec is already responsible for the labour code, which 
covers the vast majority of Quebec workers, for occupational 
health and safety, for minimum labour standards and for all 
regulations on professional qualifications, professional conduct 
and mass layoffs, giving Quebec responsibility for the entire area 
of training is like giving it an extra piece of equipment in its tool 
box. The Government of Quebec already has the networks, like the 
education network, for it to get involved in occupational training, 
among other areas, in order to ensure that young people coming 
along and workers needing retraining receive what they need 
efficiently and appropriately.
<P>
	The auditor general, in his latest report, concluded that employee 
training costs were highest in Quebec in terms of the money spent 
by the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	This is further proof, with the numbers to support it, that the 
federal government should withdraw from this sector.
<P>
	But, instead, it forges ahead with Bill C-96; it insists on 
interfering everywhere, and on signing agreements with municipal 
governments, various agencies, and even the provinces. But 
nowhere does it say that these agreements will be in keeping with 
the provinces' policies.
<P>
	In a way, this is the continuation of the monolithic state, and this 
is the terrible insult to Quebec federalists who want to see the 
Canadian Constitution and the Canadian structure revamped so that 
the federal government assumes only those responsibilities which 
come under its jurisdiction and which would be acceptable to 
federalists.
<P>
	I also believe that this is the proof that, after all, sovereignists 
are right. Even with the warning it was served on October 30, the 
government is unable to shift gears and proceed with the 
adjustments that would allow it to meet Quebecers' aspirations; the 
only way for Quebec to have the tools it needs will be for the 
province to hold another referendum and separate.
<P>
	What could be said to get the government to reverse its decision 
to pass this bill? What could make the government withdraw from 
this sector? I believe it would take two conditions which will be 
easily attainable. First,  the federal government must stop using the 
unemployment insurance fund as a cash cow; now that it can no 
longer borrow money abroad, it has discovered a domestic market, 
namely employee and employer UI contributions. As a result, this 
year, in 1995-1995, it has accumulated a five billion dollar surplus, 
while it cut the number of weeks during which beneficiaries are 
entitled to UI benefits and increased the number of weeks of work 
required to qualify for UI. It has some nerve.
<P>
	This is quite a message for the workers of Quebec and Canada, 
especially seasonal workers; it says that in order to be able to 
encroach on a field of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, the federal 
government is going to squeeze money out of those who need it the 
most. Let us take a worker in peat production, forestry or 
agriculture in general; because of those measures, instead of 
becoming entitled to unemployment benefits after 12, 13 or 14 
weeks and receiving them for the rest of the year if his job is to 
continue the following year, the worker will have to find work for 
14 or 15 weeks; otherwise, he will not be able to fulfil the 
requirements and receive a full year's income either from work or 
unemployment.
<P>
	We know that unemployment insurance is not financed by the 
government, but exclusively by employer and employee 
contributions. Let us try to transpose this situation into another 
type of insurance program. You pay premiums, but you have no 
control whatsoever on the contract which determines how you will 
obtain insurance benefits; the decision is entirely up to the 
government. Instead of being eligible for benefits during 30 or 35 
weeks, you will receive them for 25 or 30 weeks only, and there 
will be a four or five-week waiting period during which you will 
have to go on welfare. That is what is happening in Quebec this 
year. Between September 1994 and September 1995, the number of 
welfare recipients increased by 20,000 because of changes made by 
the federal government and now they are announcing, for next 
week, a new reform which will raise eligibility requirements yet 
again.
<P>
	This also sends a message to federalists who believe there can be 
a difference between Canada and the United States. This 
government keeps trying to copy the American model, but that will 
never give the expected results. Canadians, particularly those of the 
Maritimes and Eastern Quebec and all those who really want more 
balance in our society and an adequate distribution of wealth and 
expenses, will have to stand up and say: ``No; we will no longer 
accept that kind of action on the part of the government. It will 
have to restrain its activities to its own constitutional jurisdiction 
and withdraw once and for all from such areas as manpower 
training.''
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	That is why I think the government should listen to the 
provinces, take note of the consensus in Quebec and withdraw Bill 
C-96 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16707"> 16707 </A></B>
<P>
completely, because it already has  rejected our amendment which 
would have given the provinces an opting out option.
<P>
	Since that they have rejected the amendment, the only other 
solution is to withdraw the bill itself so that we can clarify the 
situation and so that Quebec can have sole jurisdiction in the area 
of manpower training and take all the necessary measures to face 
the challenges of our changing society.
<P>
	Given the arguments presented, I hope the government will have 
the decency to withdraw that bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
Tuesday we dealt with the amendment proposed by the member for 
Mercier, a motion that had nothing to do with Bill C-96. Now 
perhaps we can move forward.
<P>
	As I look back over the various statements by members on this 
bill, it seems to me there are really two basic questions we have to 
answer. First, does Bill C-96 represent any change in statutory 
powers that would allow the federal government to interfere with 
the provinces? Second, is the department created by Bill C-96 the 
kind of department we want, a department that will provide the best 
possible service and the right kind of service to Canadians?
<P>
	We can deal with the first question very quickly. It has been 
answered clearly by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and it is answered clearly by the bill itself. There are 
no substantive changes to existing statutory powers. The bill itself 
in clause 6 limits the powers of the minister to matters under the 
jurisdiction of Parliament, so there can be no intrusion on 
provincial areas of responsibility.
<P>
	That really is the end of the discussion. Some people may say 
otherwise. They may say the bill is a secret plot to invade 
provincial territory, but saying it is so does not make it so, no 
matter how many times you say it. In the end we have to base any 
conclusions on what is really in the bill in black and white, not 
what is in other people's imagination. What is there in black and 
white is very clear: There is no interference with the provinces, 
possible or intended, in Bill C-96.
<P>
	The second question deserves more comment. Is this the kind of 
department we want to create?
<P>
	Fundamentally, this bill draws together all the different 
elements, programs and policies of the federal government related 
to human resources development into one integrated, coherent 
system. It is the basis for a new approach to helping Canadians as 
they deal with some of the incredible changes in the workplace and 
in the economy. It also provides a basis for new relationships 
between the federal government and individual Canadians, 
between different levels of government, between governments and 
local  communities. As the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said when he moved second reading:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is not a defence of the status quo or what it used to be. It is an attempt to 
provide a new, innovative way of governing-.The old ways are simply not 
relevant to the kinds of conditions we now face. That is one reason the 
government has undertaken to provide a new set of instruments, brought 
together with a single focus on policy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister went on to say that the single focus was there so we 
can tackle the real deficit problem, which is not just the fiscal 
deficit, but the human deficit, a deficit as corrosive and 
undermining to the well-being of individuals as anything we face 
on the fiscal side.
<P>
	How can this new department help tackle the problems we have 
with the human deficit? I say it is by providing a single focal point 
in the communities across the country, drawing together all the 
resources of the federal government and the community to help 
people find and keep jobs. It is by providing the opportunity for 
working more closely with the provinces to draw all of this 
country's resources together to help people find jobs. This is the 
priority of this government. It is the number one priority for 
Canadians. We know that.
<P>
	Throughout this debate we have heard many examples of how 
this approach is already working. We have heard how the 
department is building a new integrated, decentralized service 
network moving from 450 to 750 points of service reaching smaller 
communities 24 hours a day. It is providing four times as many 
offices where seniors can get service in person. It is using the best 
technology available to speed up service, cutting UI processing 
time by two days, cutting old age security processing claims from 
eight days to one-half day.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	We have heard how major changes have made student loans 
more accessible, flexible and sustainable. This has helped more 
than 300,000 students this year alone and has provided special 
grants to more than 13,000 high need students. We have heard how 
our new youth internships are leading to real jobs for some 24,000 
young Canadians and how 130 Youth Service Canada projects 
across the country are helping young people serve their 
communities while getting valuable work experience. We know 
this is essential.
<P>
	We have heard how the department is building new stronger 
partnerships with the private sector. There is increased funding for 
sector councils, partnerships where every federal dollar generates 
an additional $1.50 from industry to help Canadians adjust to the 
new economy, and we all have to realize it is here.
<P>
	We have heard how the federal government is developing new 
partnerships with the provinces through joint federal-provincial 
initiatives. This is helping some 60,000 single mothers, older 
workers, aboriginals and young people to get new skills and new 
jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16708"> 16708 </A></B>
<P>
	We have heard again how this department is reviewing and 
distilling its 39 programs into a streamlined decentralized set of 
re-employment tools, tools that respond directly to the needs of 
Canadians where they live. Decisions can be made in the local 
communities instead of many miles away in some centralized 
bureaucracy. The provinces, municipalities, local businesses and 
organizations can be part of those decisions. They can tailor how 
federal service will be used to help people in their communities 
get back to work.
<P>
	This may sound abstract, so I am going to talk about my city, 
London, Ontario. In the city of London, Ontario there is a 
wonderful example of these policies in action. Last month the 
minister sat down with community groups and political leaders in 
London to discuss the creation of a new learning and life centre 
there.
<P>
	The London Learning and Life Centre will provide a centralized 
location for employment preparation, skills training and adult 
education. It will house a job search centre, an interactive lab for 
computer training and office space for community service 
professionals. Even an on-site child care service is planned.
<P>
	An estimated, and I think this is conservative, 8,000 to 10,000 
persons will utilize its services annually in London. The centre 
began as a community initiative, bottom up, not top down and has 
enormous community support. Its partner organizations include 
groups representing women, youth, adult learners, aboriginal 
people, immigrants and educators. Recognizing the real concerns, 
the real common sense of enabling local communities to work 
together for social development, the federal government 
contributed $700,000 to the initial stages of the centre's creation.
<P>
	We heard the minister make clear commitments to build on the 
success of this decentralized approach, inviting the provinces to sit 
down and devise new solutions, new ways of working together. 
This is what the Canadian public wants. We want governments to 
work together with communities and individuals, new ways to 
deliver the best possible services, the most effective services to 
Canadians where they live, not here in Ottawa. This is clearly the 
right direction. This is clearly the kind of change and the kind of 
department that we need as Canada prepares for a new century.
<P>
	The basic philosophy behind the new department, the vision 
behind Bill C-96, represents something new and very exciting. It is 
already making a difference in my community and in the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians every day throughout this 
country.
<P>
	It is up to this House now to ensure that the department can keep 
moving forward and that Canadians can count on this government's 
commitment to provide the best possible help in today's economy. 
Bill C-96 creates the department that can deliver what Canadians 
need. It creates the kind of department that can make a difference 
and the kind of department that makes sense.
<P>
	We have every reason to move forward, not backward, and to put 
this legislation in place as quickly as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I stand today in this House to address Bill C-96, an act to 
establish the Department of Human Resources Development and to 
amend and repeal certain related acts.
<P>
	The bill gives a legal basis to the Department of Human 
Resources Development in order to extend the powers of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Thus, by this bill, the minister is given the power to circumvent 
provincial powers in order to establish direct links with local 
organizations or such other persons as he considers appropriate. 
With increased federal intrusion in social and employment 
programs, and most particularly, in manpower training, all social or 
employment related sectors are likely to be affected by federal 
action. Consequently, by getting new powers, the minister is 
interfering with provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In the powers, duties and functions of the minister outlined in 
clause 6, it is specified that he exercises his power
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-with the objective of enhancing employment, encouraging equality and 
promoting social security-</BLOCKQUOTE>
in matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction.
<P>
	Clause 20 provides that the minister, within his powers, duties 
and functions,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-may enter into agreements with a province or group of provinces, agencies of 
provinces, financial institutions and such other persons or bodies as the 
Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the old legislation, the minister only had the power to enter 
into agreements with a province or group of provinces.
<P>
	In clause 31.3,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Commission may authorize any person or body-to exercise powers or 
perform duties and functions of or delegated to the Commission.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the old legislation, it could only delegate them to ``officers or 
employees or classes of officers or employees of the Commission 
or, where the Minister approves, of the Department'', in section 
18.3. It thus has a delegation power equal to the minister's.
<P>
	Quebec partners in the labour market have long recognized the 
need to repatriate to Quebec federal responsibilities and budgets 
for manpower.
<P>
	The 1989 employment forum was a major step concerning this 
claim. In December 1990, the Quebec Liberal government official-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16709"> 16709 </A></B>
<P>
ly demanded that all federal  budgets, including UI funds, allocated 
to manpower programs be transferred to Quebec.
<P>
	The Quebec government hastened to create the Quebec 
manpower development society or SQDM so that labour market 
partners could work together to manage all manpower development 
programs in Quebec.
<P>
	Bill C-96 increases the federal presence and encroaches on 
provincial jurisdiction by allowing the federal government to 
approach organizations, municipalities and individuals directly, 
without going through an intermediary.
<P>
	The bill gives the minister, among other things, greater powers 
to intervene in income security matters for children and seniors. 
This opens the door to the privatization and contracting-out of 
certain programs, including unemployment insurance and the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
	As spokesman on seniors organizations for the official 
opposition in the House of Commons, I am outraged by the June 12 
tabling of the document from the Department of Human Resources 
Development, which questions the universality of old age pensions.
<P>
	On Thursday, October 26, my colleague, the hon. member for 
Mercier and official opposition critic on human resources 
development in the House of Commons, said this: ``The old age 
pension plan, the guaranteed income supplement, the spouse's 
allowance, the pension income tax credit, and the age tax credit 
will be combined into a single assistance program. Seniors' 
eligibility for this program will be based on their income''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mercier also had this to say about the 
reform: ``It is not only the end of universality for the old age 
pension that is at stake. What this government wants is to base the 
amount of the pension cheque on family income. This will affect 
mostly women and threatens their financial independence. The 
planned reform would also affect those who already receive their 
pensions, despite what the Prime Minister of Canada had 
suggested''.
<P>
	It is obvious that the end of universality for old age pensions 
marks a significant setback for Canadian and Quebec society, for 
women, and for all those who have a right to expect a minimum of 
financial security in the future.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Quebec also has the dubious honour of having the highest rate of 
poverty among seniors over 65 years old in all of Canada. This 
analysis was made by the senior citizens council. The old age 
security pension remains the main source of income for seniors, 
and elderly women in particular. I spoke many times in this House 
to denounce the federal government's planned cuts to old  age 
pension, especially those to be announced after the October 30 
referendum in Quebec.
<P>
	When we put questions to the HRD minister in the House, he 
laughs them off and always seems to have all the answers. To listen 
to him, you would think that he is graced with papal infallibility. 
On September 26, as the official opposition's critic for seniors 
organizations, I asked Prime Minister of Canada if he could 
confirm for Quebecers and Canadians in general that his 
government's old age pension reform was actually ready but being 
put off until after the referendum so seniors would not know how 
extensive the cuts awaiting them were.
<P>
	At the same time, I pointed out to the Prime Minister that his 
Minister of Foreign Affairs had clearly stated that the federal 
government would definitely not touch old age pensions, which is 
in total contradiction with his finance colleague's announcement, 
in his February budget, of an old age pension reform.
<P>
	Of course, as could be expected, the federal government did not 
announce any cuts before the Quebec referendum. I must point out 
that the federal labour minister and minister responsible for the 
government's no campaign in the referendum also departed from 
the tradition federal Liberal line in reassuring a concerned lady by 
saying that the pension system would also be maintained under the 
Quebec sovereignty bill.
<P>
	On September 21, I had questioned the Minister of Finance 
about the review of the Canada pension plan, pointing out to him 
that it was obvious that he and the HRD minister were waiting until 
after the referendum to let the axe fall on the old age pension 
program.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois made a firm commitment to maintain the 
old age pension program in a sovereign Quebec. In fact, clause 11 
of the draft bill on Quebec's sovereignty states that pensions and 
supplements payable to the elderly shall continue to be paid by the 
Government of Quebec according to the same terms and 
conditions.
<P>
	Unlike the federal government, Quebec will be able to fund this 
program through tax moneys recovered from Ottawa. It should be 
pointed out however that the old age security program is funded 
through taxes levied by the federal government in Quebec and 
across Canada. On the other hand, the Quebec pension plan, QPP 
for short, is funded through premiums paid by Quebec employers 
and workers. With the QPP, Quebec already has all the 
administrative structures needed to keep providing the old age 
pensions currently paid by Ottawa out of Quebec taxpayers' taxes 
when Quebec becomes sovereign, which should not be long in 
coming.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is the federal government's way of interfering in and 
creating more overlap with provincial jurisdictions. Areas coming 
under the responsibility of  the minister would include old age 
security programs, and the Bloc Quebecois cannot support such a 
bill.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
we have heard many fine words about Bill C-96 over the past two 
weeks. I will quote some words said on Monday because they sum 
up one of the main reasons we need to proceed with the bill.
<P>
	One member said: ``The key to the future is a good training 
program based on the manpower requirements of the region in 
which they live. It is certainly not here in Ottawa, far from my 
region and others, that public officials can determine the best 
training programs for my constituents. They are too far away and 
they do not know about our specific needs. Therefore the decision 
making process regarding manpower training must be closer to 
those concerned''.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Bringing decision making closer to those concerned is perhaps 
the simplest way to describe the principle underlying Bill C-96. 
What is interesting is that the person who described it in this way 
was none other than the member for Chicoutimi.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that the Bloc Quebecois, despite all its 
rhetoric, agrees with the basic intention of the bill. The government 
is decentralizing labour market programs more than ever before so 
that individuals and communities are empowered to make real 
decisions that affect their lives.
<P>
	If the member truly believes this is the right thing to do, and it is, 
he has every reason to endorse the bill. Of course the member goes 
on to describe the bill as unacceptable to Quebecers. His colleague, 
the member for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, goes so far as to 
described Bill C-96 as a steamroller of centralizing and anti-social 
legislation. I can only assume this is merely a lapse into the Bloc's 
more picturesque rhetoric.
<P>
	I urge the member for Chicoutimi to trust his first instincts and 
recognize the bill for the ground breaking decentralizing legislation 
it is.
<P>
	Everyone in the House recognizes there is a need to forge better 
partnerships, better working relationships between the federal and 
provincial governments. This is precisely why the federal 
government has invited the provinces to talk about new 
arrangements for labour market programs. We have made it clear 
that we fully respect the integrity of provincial jurisdiction in the 
area of training. We want to find a better way to work together.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is a concrete illustration of this desire. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development said on November 9: ``One of the 
direct results of the department will be to give far more space for 
provincial governments to begin to make decisions at their level of  
responsibility and jurisdiction. The time has come for us to take a 
much closer look at the respective roles and to build bridges to 
bring us together''.
<P>
	Our actions as a government, the initiatives taken with this 
department over the past two years, also demonstrate this desire to 
work with the provinces and address their concerns. Surely the time 
has come for all levels of government, federal, provincial and 
municipal, to rise above the old-fashioned turf wars and start 
finding ways to work together, to bring our resources together and 
to help the people we serve.
<P>
	The Bloc, on the other hand, seems intent on blocking the very 
progress it professes to believe in. Instead of urging us on, instead 
of supporting positive, constructive action, it throws up this wall of 
words. Under the banner of jurisdiction the Bloc says we should do 
nothing. In the name of progress and change I say let us find better 
ways to do our job.
<P>
	We cannot do a better job by building walls that keep us apart. 
We need a better philosophy. We need the kind of philosophy the 
minister outlined when he spoke of the need to empower 
communities and individuals to make more choices. What does the 
Bloc Quebecois saying response? No. Individuals should not be 
empowered to make more choices. That is the philosophy of the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	We need the kind of philosophy the minister outlined when he 
spoke of new partnerships: government with the private sector, 
government with the school boards, government with the 
provinces. What does the Bloc say in response? No. We do not 
want to work together for change.
<P>
	Is it any wonder so many people in Quebec feel abandoned? The 
member for Chicoutimi speaks with concern for his riding, which 
has the highest unemployment rate in Canada. How can he expect 
to help Canadians in his riding with a do nothing philosophy?
<P>
	How can we hope to help the people of Chicoutimi by saying: 
``You cannot have this awful federalist Bill C-96. You cannot have 
a system that gives you the power and resources you need to build 
better lives and get good jobs. It is not the Bloc Quebecois way.
<P>
	This is plain nonsense. Quebecers and all Canadians deserve 
something better than that. The one million Quebecers who turn to 
HRDC for help each year deserve the best help they can get. The 
more than 164,000 Quebecers we helped find jobs last year deserve 
that help. The 44,789 students who found employment last summer 
deserve those jobs.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16711"> 16711 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	The 700,000 Quebecers who use provincial social assistance 
programs deserve to see the federal government's contribution, 
almost $3 billion each year, used in the most flexible and 
productive way possible.
<P>
	The half million UI claimants in Quebec each month deserve the 
best possible service in their quest to get back into the workforce.
<P>
	The 400,000 Quebecers who benefited from the department's 
employment programs and services deserve to see those programs 
become more effective, more flexible, more focused on their needs.
<P>
	The 850,000 Quebec seniors deserve to benefit from improved 
access and service that will be available as the department builds 
its new service delivery system.
<P>
	Every Quebecer deserves more than the status quo. Bill C-96 is 
about moving beyond the status quo to something better, to more 
responsive programs and services, better programs and services 
designed and delivered at the community level, where they can 
make a difference.
<P>
	Bill C-96 will strengthen partnerships and decentralize power 
even further and let Quebecers make the decisions about what 
kinds of programs and services make sense in their communities.
<P>
	We have made enormous progress over the last year in the 
pioneering of this approach, fundamentally rethinking and redoing 
the way HRDC works in communities in Quebec and across 
Canada. We are making enormous progress in working with the 
provinces to provide the most flexible services possible to all 
Canadians. Consider, for example, the Canada health and social 
transfer, which will replace the old Canada assistance plan. The 
whole point of this CHST is to help the provinces deliver the kinds 
of social benefits and services they want to deliver but cannot 
because of the inflexibility of existing arrangements.
<P>
	We are making real progress, showing that we can work together 
in putting solid progressive social programs in the hands of 
Quebecers. Bill C-96 is about continuing this momentum. It is 
about continuing to work together to clarify the roles of different 
levels of government and it is about building bridges. Surely this is 
a better way than talking about imaginary power grabs. Building 
bridges together is the philosophy. This vision underlies the new 
Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Bill C-96 provides the basis for the new department. With the 
accord and support of the House we can put this legislation in place 
and move forward.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to address once again Bill C-96, this time at 
second reading. This act to establish the  Department of Human 
Resources Development has an extremely negative impact in my 
riding, since it involves, among other things, a restructuring of the 
employment centre network across Canada, including in Quebec.
<P>
	Following that restructuring, there will be 28 regional 
management centres in Quebec, as well as 78 local centres or 
suboffices. What is disturbing for Trois-Rivières and its 
surrounding region is that the government, in its wisdom, has 
decided to establish the regional operation centre in Shawinigan, 
instead of Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	From now on, Trois-Rivières will be served by a suboffice of the 
regional centre in Shawinigan. You can understand that this 
decision is unpopular and also illogical. We strongly hope this is 
just an idea, but there is every indication that a final decision has 
been made at the departmental level. That decision is unpopular. 
Indeed, already, more than 25,000 residents from the 
Trois-Rivières region have signed a petition, in which they express 
their disagreement and their discontent. Moreover, all the major 
stakeholders, including MPs and MPPs, the mayor of 
Trois-Rivières, various community groups, as well as 70 
organizations, including some 40 municipalities, have also 
expressed, in writing or through resolutions, their opposition to the 
government's intention.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	In addition to the employees' union, which is being disregarded 
in this process, two other organizations, the Fédération de l'âge 
d'or and the Fédération des caisses populaires of the Mauricie 
region, co-operated to ensure the success of that petition.
<P>
	Not only is that decision unpopular, it is also illogical. It is so 
illogical and it makes so little sense that it even contradicts the 
criteria defined by the department regarding the selection and the 
location of these regional management centres. The main criteria, 
which were based on plain common sense, took into account the 
number of people concerned, including UI beneficiaries, income 
security recipients and seniors, because they are greatly affected by 
this project. These criteria also took into consideration the number 
of companies and employers hiring people who are UI 
beneficiaries, at least we hope this is the case, and which are 
concerned by such a decision and by the current role of the 
employment centres.
<P>
	Given the numbers for these groups in the Shawinigan and 
Trois-Rivières regions, that decision does not make sense and goes 
against established criteria. Indeed, in terms of numbers, the ratio 
is two to one in favour of Trois-Rivières for just about every group, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16712"> 16712 </A></B>
<P>
whether it is the overall population, the number of companies, the 
number of UI beneficiaries, etc.
<P>
	This shows just how illogical that decision is. It is a decision 
which goes against the department's own criteria.
<P>
	That operation is upsetting for Trois-Rivières residents, because 
it has to do with the establishment of regional centres. Yet, the 
government wants to go to Shawinigan and just keep a local centre 
in Trois-Rivières, in spite of the fact that the latter is recognized as 
the main centre in the region. This is totally unacceptable and we 
will continue, along with the other stakeholders, to denounce that 
situation.
<P>
	We have to know what it will mean in the ordinary run of things. 
People will come to apply in Trois-Rivières, since the role of 
sub-offices, like the one intended for Trois-Rivières, is to receive 
applications for benefits, only recording facts without making any 
analysis nor any ruling, and then pass on that information to the 
regional management centre, which will from then on keep the 
actual file of the claimant's application. When the application will 
need, as is the case in three out of four applications, a 
supplementary, subsequent operation and a special analysis, that 
will mean that the whole operation, any action, any movement will 
come from Shawinigan, in a ratio of two to one because of the 
population pool.
<P>
	At present, for unemployment insurance, the department's 
investigations, which are routine in some cases, are made in 
Trois-Rivières, as are complaints made to the board of referees, 
since the actual file is in Trois-Rivières. In answer to the letter we 
wrote to make the appropriate representations about the intended 
move, the minister indicated that services will not be altered in any 
way for the people of Trois-Rivières. However, from now on, 
contrary to what the minister said in his letter, the department's 
investigations and the appeals to the board of referees will be made 
in Shawinigan and from Shawinigan, which substantially alters, to 
use the minister's word, operations as they now stand.
<P>
	We therefore question the good faith of the minister who, in our 
opinion, is trying to fool the population when he says such things.
<P>
	You have to be aware that this project has been developed, or this 
decision made, without any consultation. It was announced just 
before the House recessed, or just before the change of rhythm that 
occurs in our society at the beginning of the summer holidays, 
since the announcement was made on June 22 and later confirmed 
in late July or early August, at a time when it is practically 
impossible to mobilize the population. What a nice approach, 
somewhat in keeping with the minister's image.
<P>
	I remind you that this was done without any consultation, both 
locally and regionally, and regardless of the regional dialogue that 
goes on in our area, the Mauricie.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	I remind you also, as was confirmed to me yesterday by reliable 
sources, that there has been no comparative analysis of the impact 
of keeping that centre in Trois-Rivières, which used to be the focal 
point, instead of moving it to Shawinigan. They did not study the 
impact on the population, users or costs. I will deal with that later 
on.
<P>
	One of the impacts is that Bécancour, a community traditionally 
and naturally linked with Trois-Rivières, particularly as regards the 
manpower operations at the regional office in Trois-Rivières, will 
now have to deal with Drummondville, a choice that is arbitrary 
and inconsistent with the practices in our region, and makes no 
sense.
<P>
	Anyone with the slightest acquaintance with this area would 
know things do not work that way. That is one of the reasons why 
my colleagues for Richelieu and Champlain and I agreed to a joint 
position and condemned that move, because our ridings are 
affected in various ways. This is a good example of the kind of 
co-operation that can come about when people want to co-operate.
<P>
	Another aspect, which is just as revolting, is that this move will 
be detrimental to those most in need, people who have just lost 
their job and find themselves in a state of vulnerability they had not 
experienced before.
<P>
	These people will feel increasingly uncomfortable in dealing 
with a system decreasingly at their service. Besides, what we have 
here is technological change of a type that will dehumanize 
relations between the department and people in need like the 
unemployed, seniors-who will feel the impact of that move-, 
people on welfare and community organizations which, as we 
know, rely heavily on volunteers and government assistance. 
Things have been made more difficult for them, and that is why this 
move should be condemned.
<P>
	The government can choose one of three solutions if it wants to 
mend its ways. First, it could maintain the status quo, deal with 
existing circumstances, respect the wishes of the local population 
and users, and keep the centre in Trois-Rivières. Everybody would 
be happy.
<P>
	A second alternative would be to have a regional office in 
Trois-Rivières for the whole area, including Bécancour, and give 
Shawinigan the status of a regional centre for the north shore, 
including Saint-Tite. The situation would be similar to that of 
Gaspé or Sept-Îles, something that could make sense. It would be 
up to the hon. member for Saint-Maurice to demonstrate that such 
an alternative makes sense.
<P>
	Third, the most absurd alternative would be to set up a regional 
management centre in Shawinigan to serve the whole region, a 
decision we will always condemn.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, let me first start by saying that our worst nightmare has 
come true. What we feared when we embarked upon the last 
referendum campaign was that the central government would 
disregard one of the most solid consensus we have ever seen in 
the province of Quebec.
<P>
	This most solid and deep-rooted consensus is that we will never 
be able to do anything about the employment situation if we do not 
give the levers required to deal with labour market-related 
problems to the most capable level of government to do so.
<P>
	Right now, the best government to give Quebec a labour market 
policy to efficiently fight unemployment is not the central 
government, but rather the National Assembly of Quebec.
<P>
	Why are we saying that it is not the central government? Because 
the central government has to make decisions about a labour 
market that covers five regions, and we know that the labour 
market situation in New-Brunswick is nothing like the situation in 
Quebec.
<P>
	This is why several, if not all, of the major stakeholders on the 
Quebec labour market are opposed to Bill C-96.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Let me remind the House of some of the organizations that are 
against Bill C-96. There is the Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre, the Institut canadien de 
l'éducation des adultes, the FTQ, the CLC, and despite this 
coalition of organizations representing tens of thousands of 
citizens, the central government has the nerve, the gall to introduce 
in this House a bill that would allow the federal to interfere in an 
area without any mandate to do so.
<P>
	I hope that the government whip and his team will finally come 
to their senses and realize that they are doing something irreparable 
by submitting Bill C-96.
<P>
	Yet, when you think about it it is obvious that everything which 
concerns the labour market comes under provincial jurisdiction. 
Surely, no member of this House is unaware that the labour code, 
the CSST, orders respecting collective agreements and mass layoffs 
are areas of provincial jurisdiction and that it is perfectly natural 
that labour market-related policies are the specific and exclusive 
business of the provinces.
<P>
	Let me remind the House of a fact: unemployment is not innate. 
One is not born unemployed. Unemployment has nothing to do 
with genetics. Nor has it anything to do with the language one 
speaks. A person's language does not bear on his or her working 
skills. How is it, then, that within the federation the unemployment 
rate has always been higher in Quebec than in Ontario? Workers in 
both provinces have about the same qualifications and live in about 
the same social and economic environment. How is it that for the 
last 20 or 25 years Quebec has had a  higher rate of unemployment 
than Ontario? And I am sure we could give very concrete examples 
of countries where unemployment was successfully eliminated. 
They have what is called a frictional unemployment rate of about 3 
or 4 per cent, reflecting the number of people who quit their job for 
a very particular reason and are looking for another one.
<P>
	How is it that we are unable in our system to create conditions 
allowing all those who want to work to find a job? Naturally, there 
are those who cannot work because they are handicapped and those 
who are momentarily out of work and those who do not want to 
work. But how is it that in 1995 qualified and competent people 
who truly want to work find themselves in a system where the 
government is unable to create conditions leading to their 
employment? You do not have to be a rocket scientist or have three 
doctorates to understand that if unemployment is not a matter of 
heredity or of language, there must be political reasons to explain 
why the unemployment rate is at 11, 12 or 13 per cent.
<P>
	These political reasons are very clear: we have two governments 
which impede each other's initiatives regarding labour market. The 
best example of this inefficiency, my colleague the member for 
Trois-Rivières referred to it, is of course the existence of two 
manpower centre networks which cancel each other's initiatives.
<P>
	Let me just remind you that Ottawa administers just as many 
programs as Quebec does. Quebec has approximately 25 programs 
to put people back to work and so does Ottawa. What this means is 
that if the people that we, as members, meet in our constituency 
office, and I am sure that this happens to you too, are UI recipients, 
they are eligible for some programs, but if they receive income 
security benefits, they are eligible for some programs but not for 
others.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I believe we are mature and lucid enough as parlementarians to 
say that the situation we must aim at is having only one 
government that will control all powers and levers in order to help 
put people back to work, away from that unacceptable situation 
called unemployment.
<P>
	This decision, this wish is incompatible with the existence of 
two governments and it certainly is incompatible with the fact that 
two governments can each have 25 programs without any 
coordination between them. Instead of proposing what all 
important stakeholders in Quebec are asking, that is that the federal 
government pull out of the labour sector, this government has the 
nerve, the irresponsibility and the irreverence to give us a bill, Bill 
C-96, which increases the powers of the minister in labour matters.
<P>
	Can you imagine such a situation where all Quebec stakeholders 
are asking for one thing and the Government of Quebec, speaking 
as one, is incoherently  saying the exact opposite? We must not 
forget that the social cost of unemployment was estimated and I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16714"> 16714 </A></B>
<P>
convinced that all parliamentarians are concerned about this 
situation.
<P>
	I would like to remind you that we have, in Quebec, a very 
respectable and respected organization called the Forum pour 
l'emploi. Of course, this employment forum expressed the wish to 
see all manpower policies transferred to Quebec, but it also 
analyzed the social cost of unemployment. It estimated that-I 
know this will give you quite a shock, so I will say it slowly-the 
economic cost of unemployment for 1993, that is 1993 A.D., not 
200 years ago, was about $30 billion.
<P>
	This means that, because the government is perhaps considering 
maintaining a duplication of structures, our society has to put up 
with a shortfall of $30 billion. That is the reality. That is what is 
unbearable with Bill C-96. Not only will the government not 
respect the consensus that exists in Quebec, it included in the bill 
dispositions that will allow it to disregard the authority of the 
Quebec government and give direct funding to organizations like 
CDECs or direct it through other channels for the delivery of 
manpower related services, all this without going through the 
principal stakeholder, the Quebec government.
<P>
	But that will not last long. Something will happen soon. There 
will be a grass-roots movement. People will take to the streets 
when they realize that we cannot support inefficiencies, that there 
is no reason to tolerate unemployment rates of 11, 12 or 13 per cent 
when other western societies are able to give work to everybody.
<P>
	Since you are telling me that my time is up, Madam Speaker, I 
will conclude by saying that this bill in unacceptable and that we 
hope that the government will see the light and respect Quebec's 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to make this speech 
immediately following the remarks of the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. I listened very carefully to his remarks 
and now I would like to rectify a few things. I would like to show 
all our colleagues in this House, particularly members of the Bloc, 
that the adoption of Bill C-96 is part of a process that favours 
change and that supports the concept of partnerships with the 
provinces.
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc said himself a while ago that he favoured 
change but wanted an agreement with the other provinces. I think 
this bill is very much in line with this idea. There is a partnership 
between the federal government and the provinces and, of course, 
there is change.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Any motion aimed at delaying the adoption of this bill seems 
negative to me and, unfortunately, opposition members sometimes 
take a negative and very partisan  attitude. This is the opinion I 
have of the members opposite. They are not as objective as some of 
us are. The bill we are proposing is about greater openness towards 
the provinces and a better sharing of responsibilities.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, the member for Parkdale-High Park, said so eloquently in 
the House and I quote: ``Bill C-96 is not changing any statutory 
powers''. Listen to this, Mr. Speaker. It comes from an authority on 
the subject. ``It is not taking any powers away from Quebec or from 
any other province. This bill seeks to enable us to work together in 
order to deliver programs and services more efficiently at less cost 
to the taxpayers''.
<P>
	And now the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is saying 
that the bill is useless unless it gives new legislative powers to the 
federal government. How can a member of the Bloc who favours 
decentralization oppose a bill because it does not centralize 
enough? He just told us that the bill is useless unless it provides for 
more centralization. The member may be a centralizing separatist, 
but not me.
<P>
	We, in the Liberal Party, are in favour of a flexible federalism 
and, in this bill, we simply want to confirm the fact that there is 
now a minister who is responsible for several federal departments. 
This does not take any powers away from the provinces. Quite the 
contrary, this bill gives no power to the federal government that it 
did not already have, except that from now on these powers are in 
the hands of one minister instead of several.
<P>
	Our government is deeply committed to reducing spending and 
this is why we wanted to reduce the number of ministers and 
consolidate some of the existing powers and federal departments. 
The powers transferred to the minister of Human Resources 
Development are not those of provincial ministers but they are part 
of powers that other federal departments already had et they are 
being consolidated.
<P>
	I know that the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
wishes to hear what I have to say and that he will listen carefully to 
my speech, so that he can be well informed and can vote for Bill 
C-96. I know that after hearing what I have to say he will be able to 
change his mind. As I look at the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve at this very moment I have no doubt that 
he is in the process of changing his mind. He may even be off to 
reconsider his position on the bill.
<P>
	So, to put the excellent words of the parliamentary secretary I 
referred to earlier in a perspective even closer to reality, he 
declared that the Bloc members began by saying that the 
referendum had sent a clear message to the federal government. A 
very clear message indeed. It showed that a majority of Quebecers 
do not want separation. The parliamentary secretary went on to say 
that this was the clear message we received and that we had to work 
with that in mind.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16715"> 16715 </A></B>
<P>
	This is what we intend to do and therefore we will respect, as 
we always have, the will of the people of Canada and, in particular, 
of Quebec. This is why we continue to offer good government to 
Canadians-those who live in Quebec and those who live 
elsewhere, of course.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	A few days ago, on November 20, 1995, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said: ``I draw the 
attention of the official opposition to recent post referendum polls, 
which state that 61 per cent of Quebecers want to remain in Canada 
and 78 per cent of Quebecers want to see major changes to the way 
the Canadian federation works''. People want functional changes 
while remaining in Canada. That is what Quebecers want and we, 
of course, intend to respect that.
<P>
	Today, we have before us a bill whose purpose is not to 
centralize but to consolidate into one department the work being 
done by different federal departments in order to improve 
government operations and to cut costs. ``It is through bills such as 
this that hopefully through provincial federal co-operation we can 
get more people to work'', said the hon. member for 
Parkdale-High Park.
<P>
	On November 9, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
clearly addressed one of the essential impacts of this bill. He said 
and I quote: ``- one of the direct results of the department will be 
to give far more space for provincial governments to begin to make 
decisions at their level of responsibility and jurisdiction. The time 
has come for us to take a much closer look at the respective roles 
and to build bridges to bring us together''. That is what the minister 
said.
<P>
	The opposition saw or pretended to see in Bill C-96 a move by 
the federal government to take over new powers. According to 
them, it is an intrusion in a provincial jurisdiction. In fact, the 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve spoke to it earlier, and I 
know he is listening carefully.
<P>
	The reality is quite different. For instance, one must examine the 
exact wording of clause 6 of the bill, which is in fact a restrictive 
clause. It sets limits to the powers vested in the minister by the bill. 
It clearly says that the only issues concerned are those under the 
jurisdiction of Parliament. Again, the only issues concerned are 
those under the jurisdiction of this Parliament, period.
<P>
	This clause applies to everything under the authority of the 
Department of Human Resources Development. Any existing 
statutory power will remain exactly the same after this bill is 
passed. I repeat for the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, the 
same.
<P>
	There is definitely no intrusion on areas of provincial 
jurisdiction: the bill forbids that. It is crystal clear. That being said, 
I am sure-maybe not sure, but I hope-that  the Bloc members 
will change their mind and vote for the bill. I already see in the eyes 
of some of them that they are tempted to change their mind and 
suddenly vote for such a good bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I 
hear the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell telling us that 
it is crystal clear and explaining things at great length, with a 
certain sense of humour, I feel that, after all, the problem might lie 
in the very objective way he is looking at the situation, a liberal and 
objective way, I might add.
<P>
	I will use the next few minutes to explain to my ``objective'' 
colleague a number of facts which might help him understand our 
huge reservations-I am quite sure that he is listening very 
carefully to my remarks and that he will take them into serious 
consideration.
<P>
	Instead of being part of the solution, Bill C-96 makes the 
problem worse.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, far from heralding the withdrawal of the federal 
government from manpower training, Bill C-96 reinforces the 
federal presence in this area. Duplications and inefficiencies 
resulting from this bill will grant the minister new powers, whether 
the objective member opposite likes it or not, new powers to 
negotiate directly with local governments or agencies, bypassing 
the provinces, which will enable him to set directions, standards 
and outcomes unilaterally.
<P>
	The honourable government whip told us that clause 6 did not 
provide for new powers and that it defined and restricted them. 
Well then, let us have a look at clause 6. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The powers, duties and functions of the minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Tell me, Mr. Speaker, is there any matter over which Parliament 
does not have jurisdiction, and which would not come under the 
laws of the land? Whatever goes on from sea to sea is regulated by 
this country's legislation and, consequently, is a matter over which 
Parliament has jurisdiction one way or another.
<P>
	Not only are they not restricted, but they are incredibly 
increased. In fact, the powers, duties and functions of the minister 
are quite broad. Moreover, contrary to the present legislation, they 
are not specified, and we know that the federal government has a 
habit of intruding on matters of provincial jurisdiction. Therefore, 
there is cause for concern when you see the numerous jurisdictions 
of Parliament.
<P>
	Let me quote the description of Human Resources Development 
Canada which is found in the Budget Plan tabled on February 27, 
1995. It says: ``Human Resources Development Canada 
administers unemployment insurance, income security programs 
for children and the elderly, the current federal programs of  
support to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16716"> 16716 </A></B>
<P>
provinces for post-secondary education and welfare, labour market 
adjustment and social development programs, and student loans.''
<P>
	What we see today, with Bill C-96, is a strengthening of the 
federal government's hold on each of these areas and on all of them 
collectively. I was listening earlier to the member who expressed 
some deep feelings about this. I remember that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development has told us repeatedly that we 
simply did not understand that things would be better. It seems the 
only ones who are optimistic about Bill C-96 are the government 
party and the minister.
<P>
	I would like to refer to a press release issued by the Institut 
canadien d'éducation des adultes on October 5, 1995. It says that 
the Board of directors of the ICEA, formed of academic, labour and 
community representatives, is unanimously opposed to Bill C-96. 
The organization invites all its partners to mobilize and denounce 
that bill which undermines the equity principle governing our 
social security system in Canada and denies the exclusive 
jurisdiction of provinces over manpower training and development.
<P>
	It is not a sovereignist institute from Quebec which says that, it 
is the Institut canadien d'éducation des adultes. It seems that only 
the minister and the cabinet believe that Bill C-96 is a good thing. 
No, it is not a good thing. The same press release says: ``Bill C-96 
is, for the most part, one of the worst scenarios, something that our 
Institute denounced last fall, during the hearings of the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development.'' This indicates 
not only that the minister consulted, but that he was told that this 
was the worst thing to do. And yet, he went ahead and did it.
<P>
	I would also like to mention the position of the Quebec 
government, because I believe that our viewers should know what 
Quebec thinks of this intrusion.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Mrs. Harel, the Quebec Minister, said: ``When you read Bill 
C-96, you understand why the federal Minister of Human 
Resources Development did not respond, last spring, to my 
pressing demand for a federal-provincial conference on that 
reform. The bill is the opposite of the Quebec consensus on 
manpower. The opposite of the single window principle. This is 
proof that the federal government is committed to continuing and 
even increasing the costly duplication and overlap in the area of 
manpower in Quebec''.
<P>
	So, when the minister tells us, as he did during Question Period, 
``I consulted, I went to see my counterparts in the other provinces'', 
we can only say that as far as the Quebec minister is concerned this 
was not the case. Once again, we have a minister who is intruding 
on provincial areas of jurisdiction and in particular Quebec 
jurisdiction, in a dangerous manner.
<P>
	I would also like to mention the SQDM. Yesterday during 
Question Period, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
said that during the summer he met, through officials, with 
representatives from the SQDM and that agreements had been 
signed. He implied that everything was fine. Yet, nothing could be 
further from the truth. On October 4, 1995, the SQDM stated its 
position on Bill C-96 in a press release and I quote: ``The board 
members of the Société québécoise de développement de la 
main-d'oeuvre ask the federal government not to set up a parallel 
structure of partnership and not to take initiatives overlapping 
Quebec jurisdiction in the area of manpower development''.
<P>
	Bill C-96 has catastrophic consequences. Starting withMr. Valcourt, a former minister in the previous federal government, 
and now with the present minister, we are headed toward disaster in 
the area of manpower management.
<P>
	In fact, in his recent report, the auditor general mentioned that 
job creation through the manpower development programs of our 
Canada Employment Centres was more costly in Quebec than 
elsewhere. Why? Why is it that the federal government is less 
efficient in Quebec than elsewhere? Simply because it stubbornly 
refuses to give Quebec all of the powers in this area.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to give specific examples affecting 
ordinary people. We are not talking about a piece of paper called a 
bill, but about real people suffering through real unemployment.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, a woman who wanted to start her own business 
dropped by my office. There is a program called Self-Employment 
Assistance which would have allowed her, because she was 
receiving unemployment benefits, to start a business, to create 
jobs. Believe it or not, there is just enough money in this program 
to satisfy a handful of individuals in my own riding, and she was 
told to look for a job rather than to create one since, if she created 
one, she would no longer be eligible for unemployment insurance 
benefits. That is the great way unemployment is being perpetuated 
in Quebec. We prefer to give money to people to do nothing rather 
than help them create jobs for themselves and for others.
<P>
	I will conclude on this note: I look forward to the day where a 
minister will have the courage to tell his or her civil servants that 
the federal government will no longer interfere in the manpower 
area in Quebec and that it is going to give the province all of the 
powers in this field, which will result in huge savings. We will, at 
last, be able to create the jobs that everybody needs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
saying goes, the proof is in the pudding. Let me tell you that I 
believe this hold true for what the Chrétien government intends to 
do with regard to social program reform, especially unemployment 
insurance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16717"> 16717 </A></B>
<P>
	Contrary to the fine promises which were uttered with a hand 
on one's heart, contrary to the statements of love and respect made 
in a none too subtle way in Montreal, the federal government is 
preparing to circumvent the will of Quebecers in a vital sector, 
that is to say training and labour programs.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Once again this government which claims to be in favour of a 
decentralization of powers is preparing to grab greater powers by 
means of the administrative restructuring of the Department of 
Human Resources Development Canada, which is the purpose of 
Bill-96.
<P>
	Unfortunately this is not a coincidence since the same thing 
happened with other departments. This is the case for example of 
the Department of Health and the Department of Canadian 
Heritage. I have already condemned the same underhanded tactics 
used by the government in those cases.
<P>
	In the bill before us, that deals with the Department of Human 
Resources Development, the minister gives himself an enormous 
power that will extend to all areas relating to manpower.
<P>
	As we are now able to really identify the government's huge 
appetite, members of the Bloc Quebecois want to alert public 
opinion in both Canada and Quebec. Bill C-96 contains a key 
section, that is, section 6, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the development of 
the human resources of Canada not by law assigned to any other Minister, 
department, board or agency of the Government of Canada, and are to be 
exercised with the objective of enhancing employment, encouraging equality 
and promoting social security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This section contains all the potential sources of major conflict 
between the provinces and especially between Quebec and the 
federal government. Indeed, it is important as this moment to go 
back in time and to point out clearly that the federal government, 
after some unfortunate procedures before the Privy Council and to 
the great displeasure of the provinces, obtained constitutional 
jurisdiction only over unemployment insurance. It is because of its 
strange and omnipotent spending power that it has invaded 
manpower training and that it now wants to get into the field of 
equality and social security.
<P>
	I am not making this up; it is clearly set out in section 6 of the 
bill. This further intrusion is very badly orchestrated and has been 
denounced by many stakeholders, both sovereignist and federalist, 
such as the Société québécoise de développement de la 
main-d'oeuvre, the Canadian Labour Congress, the Canadian 
Institute of Adult Education and the Quebec Minister of 
Employment.
<P>
	I would also remind the House that, historically and constantly, 
all Quebec spokepersons on this issue have denounced federal 
interference in manpower training. What will provincial 
organizations and governments think of this new federal intrusion 
in an exclusively provincial jurisdiction? I am sure that reactions 
are currently negative, will be negative and will soon be made 
known. They will follow Quebec's claims. Will they have the good 
fortune of influencing the direction that the current government has 
set for itself? I have my doubts about that. This is a very 
unfortunate situation because this new constitutional snag goes 
against the interests of the population.
<P>
	In a document called ``Un Québec pour l'emploi'', which he 
published this year, Pierre Paquette analyzes the requirements for a 
full employment policy in modern Quebec. Mr. Paquette, who has 
been secretary general of the CNTU for five years, has also sat on 
the board of directors of the Economic Council of Canada and on 
committees to kick-start the economy and stimulate employment in 
the southwest and east end of Montreal. He identifies three major 
elements of a comprehensive employment strategy.
<P>
	The first element is all the actions that have a bearing on 
economic growth factors, including both individual corporate 
policies and social economic policies affecting all of society as 
well as the international community. The second element is the link 
between sectoral and regional development policies as part of an 
industrial policy. The third and last element stresses the importance 
of implementing a whole series of active manpower initiatives 
including professional training, placement, specific measures for 
disadvantaged groups and regions, and reducing the number of 
hours of work in all its forms.
<P>
	You may have noted that all these areas come under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. Mr. Paquette goes on to say, ``Effective 
implementation of a comprehensive full employment strategy 
requires a strong social consensus. In this regard, it is hard to 
imagine how the various social stakeholders across Canada could 
agree on the implementation of a full employment policy''.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	This conclusion is clear and explicit. As we have said a thousand 
times in this House, there is a consensus in Quebec that this 
government persists in ignoring with impunity.
<P>
	The people of Quebec reject Bill C-96. They reject this 
counterproductive approach, which, far from giving them 
concerted access to the work place, keeps them a little further 
away.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to make a suggestion to the government, 
which, until the next referendum on Quebec's future, will at least 
allow the people to benefit from their contributions to both levels 
of government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16718"> 16718 </A></B>
<P>
	I would suggest that the federal government should withdraw 
completely from all employment, manpower, social assistance and 
training matters. At the same time, I would suggest that the federal 
government should transfer to the government closest to the 
people, the provincial government, the money needed to put in 
place a real full employment policy, as the Quebec government 
wishes. This will demonstrate concretely the government's 
commitment to the equality and social security it refers to in 
clause 6 of its bill. I thank you and I hope that this government 
has heard my message.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal 
government promised Quebecers that many things would change if 
they voted no in the October 30, 1995, referendum.
<P>
	A mere three weeks after the referendum, Quebecers are already 
getting a taste of changes to come as the Minister of Human 
Resources Development presents Bill C-96 to merge four 
departments into a single one. But at the same time, as could be 
expected, he gives himself broader powers, continues to invade 
provincial jurisdictions and goes against the quasi unanimous 
consensus in Quebec on this issue.
<P>
	Back in 1991, the Bourassa government was asking that Quebec 
be responsible for all expenditures relating to manpower 
development, including training. At the time, Mr. Bourbeau, the 
minister responsible, had written his federal counterpart a very 
clear letter on this subject.
<P>
	Time and time again, the Quebec national assembly requested 
almost unanimously that Ottawa withdraw from this provincial 
area of jurisdiction. After this bill was introduced, several major 
stakeholders in Quebec made representations against the HRD 
minister's centralizing designs. For example, the Société 
québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre takes issue with 
the government repeatedly trying to interfere in provincial areas of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	According to the SQDM, clauses 6 and 20 of Bill C-96 would 
empower the Minister of Human Resources Development to enter 
into agreements with a province, a group of provinces, agencies of 
provinces, financial institutions and such other persons or bodies as 
the minister considers appropriate, to improve the labour market 
and promote equality and social security.
<P>
	In so doing, the minister blatantly violates provincial 
jurisdiction and goes directly against Prime Minister Chrétien's 
promises of decentralization during the referendum campaign. 
These promises were short-lived. When questioned on this by the 
Bloc Quebecois, the minister said, with rare degree of arrogance, 
that the opposition had obviously not even bothered to read the bill.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Not only must this bill be read line by line, it must also be read 
between the lines. One must do more than read  the bill, and when 
that happens, one realizes that it is totally different from what it 
appears to be, because it allows the federal government to interfere 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In response to another question from the Leader of the 
Opposition, the minister answered that he felt that the hon. member 
had strayed substantially from the line of logic and reason. That 
attitude shows clearly that the minister does not understand the 
issue and that he insults every Quebec stakeholder opposed to the 
new bill.
<P>
	Even the Conseil du patronat, and this is quite something 
because that staunch supporter of federalism rarely agrees with the 
Bloc's philosophy, is asking the minister to amend, if not withdraw, 
Bill C-96.
<P>
	With the rapid development of new technologies and the 
globalization of markets, Quebec industry must quickly adapt to 
meet the new challenges of the world economy. Manpower training 
plays a vital role in ensuring that our workers are familiar with 
state-of-the-art technology and can meet the needs of the Quebec 
labour market.
<P>
	Currently, there are close to 70,000 jobs which are available in 
Quebec but remain unfilled because adequate occupational training 
was not provided. The Quebec government recently introduced 
legislation to encourage companies to offer more in-house training.
<P>
	However, a lot remains to be done and, without total control in 
that sector, the provincial government cannot adequately meet the 
expectations of the Quebec labour market. The federal and 
provincial governments are always competing to show workers 
which of the two levels of government can best meet their 
expectations and aspirations.
<P>
	When that happens, it costs millions of dollars in unnecessary 
duplication. Such duplication costs several hundreds of millions in 
the manpower training sector, and that is a real shame. For 
example, in the Eastern Townships, for every dollar spent on 
manpower training, 42 cents go to administrative costs. Over 40 
per cent, more specifically 42 per cent, of the amount which should 
be used for manpower development is used instead to pay for 
course organization, promotional efforts and course delivery. This 
is an incredible waste of energy and money.
<P>
	Unfortunately, Quebec workers are the ones who are affected by 
the stubbornness of the federal government and of its Minister of 
Human Resources Development. Moreover, since the 1990 UI 
reform, the federal government has been making extensive use of 
the UI fund for training purposes.

<P>
	In 1994-95, $531 million were spent for that purpose. The 
federal department now offers 27 initiatives or programs, most of 
which create duplication with the 22  programs offered by the 
SQDM and others offered by various departments.
<P>
	In 1994, the federal government announced the creation of Youth 
Service, at a cost of $175 million. This program is entirely 
comparable to the Volunteer Youth Action Program which is 
efficiently run by the SQDM. In spite of repeated demands by the 
Quebec government, the federal government keeps refusing to 
transfer funds into the provincial program, thus wasting money 
because of duplication.
<P>
	Another equally pathetic example is the federal program that 
matches another similar Quebec program called Jeunes stagiaires. 
The 50 Canadian sectorial skills council, set up in 1992, are another 
case of duplication, considering the 15 Quebec manpower sector 
committees which have been in place for more that five years. The 
federal government will spend more that $250 million to set up its 
own councils. Finally, because of the rigid standards for POWA, 
the federal government has failed to compensate many garment 
sector workers.
<P>
	In view of the difficulties some workers were experiencing, the 
Quebec government, through the SQDM, had to step in to make up 
for the federal government's shortcomings. There again, we have 
duplication. What a waste of money and time. The cost of all this 
duplication is estimated at $250 million a year. That is poor 
management and poor efficiency.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that federal intrusion in the area of 
human resources development since 1942 is one more example of 
its abuse of the spending power and of its disregard for the 
exclusive jurisdictions of the Quebec government. 
Constitutionally, the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over 
manpower training, but, to this day, the stubbornness of the federal 
government still undermines the development of the Quebec 
economy.
<P>
	Vocational training is the cornerstone of competitiveness and 
availability of highly skilled workers, two assets that are essential 
if we are to develop a high technology economy, attract many 
investors and produce value added goods.
<P>
	This minister and his government should stop all this nonsense 
and give back to Quebecers all the tools they need to deal with after 
manpower training. Bill C-96 should therefore be withdrawn, and 
the Prime Minister should start to deliver on his decentralization 
promises in areas where a strong consensus exists in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, not long 
ago, I read the speech the Minister of Human Resources 
Development made during second reading of Bill C-96. This bill, 
entitled an Act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development and to amend and repeal certain related Acts, 
certainly stems from a noble intent.
<P>
	When I read this speech, I got the feeling that we were taking 
part in a huge change operation, a bit like the  edifying 
commitments the Liberals make to try to make us swallow the pill. 
The minister said, and I quote: ``a new, innovative way of doing 
government, to get people to begin to think differently about how 
government can relate to individuals, to provide a much more 
effective way of enabling people to respond and make choices 
themselves and not have choices made for them, to share, to create 
partnerships, to get away from the top down command system and 
to turn that into a Canadian Tire philosophy based in the local 
communities with tools and instruments customized and tailored to 
the needs of those communities.''
<P>
	One could think that the minister is talking about real 
decentralization and is about to comply once and for all with the 
repeated and urgent requests of the province of Quebec for control 
over the policies and programs concerning manpower and training.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	However, the minister warned us right from the start. ``It is, he 
said, decentralization of a very different kind.''
<P>
	The minister then said: ``There has been a lot of talk about 
decentralization. So far it has been a somewhat restricted debate as 
it talks only about decentralization in terms of transferring from the 
federal government to provincial governments.'' And this is very 
significant. The message here is clear. The kind of decentralization 
the minister is bragging about has nothing to do with Quebec's 
expectations and ignores the consensus that was reached in Quebec 
over manpower training.
<P>
	Let us look at this a little bit closer. Even though the prime 
minister told us, in answer to our questions, that the official 
opposition had obviously not bothered to read Bill C-96, we have to 
conclude that several individuals, institutions and organizations in 
Quebec are really ignorant, according to the prime minister. 
Unfortunately for him, the people of Quebec also know how to read 
between the lines.
<P>
	It is appalling but not really surprising to see that Bill C-96 goes 
totally against the large consensus reached in Quebec over 
manpower issues. For several years now, all those involved in 
Quebec's labour force have agreed to demand the repatriation to 
Quebec of all manpower training programs and of the related 
budgets.
<P>
	Far from abiding by this unanimous consent, the federal 
government has announced its intent to continue with and even 
increase all of the costly duplication and overlap. Once again, the 
Liberal government ignores its own basic rule. Yet, the Canadian 
Constitution 1867 recognizes clearly and explicitly the areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. But for years now the federal government 
has been using its spending power and its authority to impose 
national standards and to infringe upon the jurisdictions of the 
provinces. All that Bill C-96 does is legalizing a de facto situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16720"> 16720 </A></B>
<P>
	Whatever the Prime Minister says, we did read this bill, and 
it was easy for us to grab its real intent. For example, clauses 6, 
20 and 21 are unequivocal.
<P>
	Clause 6 aims at extending federal jurisdiction by expanding the 
powers, duties and functions of the Minister. Clause 20 provides 
that the Minister may negotiate and enter into agreements with, and 
I quote: ``such other persons or bodies as the Minister considers 
appropriate.''
<P>
	In the same vein, clause 21 reiterates that the Minister may 
authorize any other person or body to exercise any power or 
perform any duty or function of the Minister.
<P>
	All that to make sure we understand that the Minister has no 
obligation to consult or agree with the provinces in precise areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Indeed, from now on, according to Bill C-96, the department of 
Human Resources Development will be authorized to by-pass the 
provinces and impose manpower standards and policies. It will be 
able to develop a parallel federal structure to intervene on the 
Quebec labour market.
<P>
	The federal government is empowering itself to by-pass the 
provinces and to intervene directly with bodies, municipal 
governments and individuals. While the Constitution gives 
provinces power over manpower development and vocational 
training, the federal gouvernment has chosen to ignore it.
<P>
	So history repeats itself. It will be remembered that, in 1991, the 
previous Conservative government tried to encroach upon 
provincial jurisdiction and directly interfere in matters regarding 
vocational training and manpower. Once again, Quebec 
unanimously denounced these centralizing and unconstitutional 
moves by the federal government.
<P>
	The Quebec Liberal Party and the Conseil du patronat du Québec 
added their voice to this denunciation. The same centralizing 
designs, which are spelled out in Bill C-96, are now giving rise to 
the same denunciations everywhere in Quebec. The initiative is, 
however, more subtle this time, because it comes a few days after 
the referendum.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	While the Liberals spoke of nothing but change during the 
referendum campaign, there are now, with Bill C-96, attempting 
further intrusion in the area of training.
<P>
	The Canadian provinces have different labour markets. A 
centralized and uniform approach would hardly help anyone. The 
result would be more red tape, as my colleague for Joliette clearly 
demonstrated earlier.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Quebec already has established manpower 
networks. The Société québécoise de développement de la 
main-d'oeuvre is a special form of partnership involving all 
Quebec stakeholders in manpower matters, whether they are 
employers, unions,  co-operatives, educators or community groups. 
Quebecers know better than anyone else what is good for them. 
Quebecers must decide what their manpower policies should be 
and set their own priorities.
<P>
	This is not a symbolic demand or the confirmation of a historic 
right. It is only a matter of good old common sense for those who 
take to heart the promotion and the support of manpower 
development. If there really is a will to change and to decentralize 
in Canada, as we were told during the referendum campaign, this is 
the time for the winds to blow.
<P>
	If Bill C-96 is a proof of the flexibility the Liberal government 
boasts about, if it is indicative of the rejection of, and I quote the 
minister of Human Resources Development, ``the old top down 
centralized hierarchies of governmental organization, which have 
been really a product of the old industrial age'', then, it is a total 
failure.
<P>
	Bill C-96 sends a clear message to the Quebec Liberal Party, to 
the Conseil du patronat and to all other partners in the field of 
employment in Quebec, and it is that the federal government will 
never accept that Quebec assume sole responsibility for manpower 
training within its territory. Ottawa will never accept either that 
Quebec repatriate the funds that the federal government allocates 
to manpower training programs. Quebecers will clearly see that it 
is impossible to develop a Quebec manpower policy suited to its 
realities and administered by Quebec if they stay in Canada. That 
will only be possible in a sovereign Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, I urge all members of Parliament who really care for 
the improvement of relations between the two founding peoples of 
this country to support the amendment proposed by the hon. 
member for Mercier and to vote against Bill C-96.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in fact, the bill has 
nothing to do with jurisdictions. It has everything to do with 
people. It is aimed at helping Canadians and, of course, Quebecers 
in remote areas to find jobs.
<P>
	The bill is designed to allow young people, older workers, single 
mothers and low income individuals to acquire the skills they need 
in our ever-changing economy. It is also aimed at bringing 
communities, businesses and all levels of government together to 
look at the human aspect of regional economic development.
<P>
	This means that other forms of agreements and partnerships 
between the federal government and the provinces are possible. 
Quebec talked a lot about partnership during the referendum 
campaign and we are willing to go in this direction. As a matter of 
fact, partnerships with local and regional economic development 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16721"> 16721 </A></B>
<P>
authorities in the area of social and labour  programs are highly 
desirable. That is certainly the way to go.
<P>
	If we really want to pursue this discussion in a positive manner, 
it is important that we adopt this bill now and start working towards 
establishing new and improved partnerships with one another.
<P>
	While some members are worrying about the federal 
government taking powers away from the provinces, the 
Department of Human Resources Development is doing its job 
with Quebecers and, of course, with the Quebec government. Using 
jurisdictional considerations as an excuse, members of the Bloc 
would want us to do nothing. Let us say this: in the name of the 
progress and of the changes that are obviously wanted in Quebec, 
let us find better ways of doing our job.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Canadians, as well as Quebecers, are well aware that the federal 
government has a legitimate role to play in development and 
manpower. So let us get things straight.
<P>
	We had a case, the other day, that showed the urgent need for 
federal involvement, through its agencies, its community 
development organizations which play an active role in every 
regional county municipality and through the Federal Office of 
Regional Development, which is always there to give a welcome 
and desirable helping hand to stimulate small businesses in 
Quebec. There are other examples, such as the Federal Business 
Development Bank. When there is a need for a partner, to set up a 
small business in Quebec, especially in remote areas, this 
additional financial help from the federal government is always 
welcome.
<P>
	I would like to talk about a particular case that occurred in my 
county a few weeks ago. Throughout the referendum campaign in 
the riding of Bonaventure, the minister of agriculture, who happens 
to be my provincial MNA in Quebec City, asked for the 
participation of the federal government in order to stimulate, or 
create if you will, a dairy industry in Gaspésie. Following pressure 
from that minister, it was agreed that the federal government would 
invest in the establishment of a cheese-making operation in that 
region. Now, the day after the referendum, that very same minister 
who had challenged us to invest reneged. He decided, on the basis 
of provincial programs and on the advice of his provincial 
bureaucrats, that the agreement was no longer valid. I find that 
most unfortunate, but fortunately the federal government remains 
present even if the Government of Quebec went back on its 
commitment to develop an important industry in Quebec, and 
especially in my region which is said to be a depressed area.
<P>
	The federal government is also committed to helping people who 
are victims of particular circumstances that do not apply only to 
one province. This is the case of senior workers whose jobs are 
being jeopardized by the restructuring of the economy. It is also the 
case of some  workers in fisheries. We have all heard about TAGS. 
In Quebec $100 million was spent to support those who were hard 
hit by that moratorium. There are still considerable investments 
being made to find new markets for underdeveloped species. As we 
know, however, fortunately it is the federal government that 
manages fisheries in the Gulf and elsewhere, but once the fish gets 
to the docks it is the responsibility of the province from then on. It 
is then up to Quebec to issue fish processing plant operating 
permits, but unfortunately Quebec is still refusing to invest the 
amounts necessary to give our local entrepreneurs a chance to 
diversify, particularly into underdeveloped species such as 
mackerel and herring.
<P>
	There are lots of similar examples in Quebec, unfortunately 
demonstrating Quebec's intransigence and the fact that it is not 
necessarily attuned to the true needs of the population. When I 
heard the opposition saying ``All we want is decentralization, all 
we want is for Quebec to make a final decision'', were they 
referring only to the SQDM? Mention has never been made of the 
fact that there are people who are what the Bloc would probably 
call ``Quebecers of the majority'', old-stock Quebecers, working 
for the federal public service, who come from the Magdalen 
Islands, Bonaventure of course, or elsewhere in Quebec, and that 
these people are seeking, not only as federal employees, but as 
concerned individuals, to provide the public with proper services.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	And in all the speeches I have heard this morning, there was not 
a single member of the Bloc, not a single member of the 
opposition, came forward with a good idea. The only thing that was 
said is that everything that happening in Quebec at this time is the 
federal government's fault. What I find regrettable, however, is that 
no one is listening to the voice of the people. There is already talk 
of a third referendum in Quebec. Mr. Speaker, let me state here to 
you, here before my constituents, before eastern Quebec, before all 
Quebecers, that the winning side this past October 30 was the no 
side.
<P>
	I believe that what will be expected of the outgoing Leader of the 
Opposition, when he is premier of Quebec as he surely will 
be-and let me, in passing, wish him luck-is a commitment. He 
must make a commitment. In fact, he did, and people in the PQ 
government have announced they are prepared to work together 
with the Canadian government. I think Quebecers are fed up with 
constitutional discussions that fail to provide any answers. We 
want to put Quebecers back to work, and this will happen within 
the Canadian federation.
<P>
	Throughout the referendum campaign, we made it clear that if 
Quebec left Canada, it would lose several billion dollars worth of 
federal investment. Losses would be considerable and would be felt 
by everyone, but especially by the most vulnerable people in the 
province  of Quebec. I think we have reached a point in our history 
where we should look at what we have in common, instead of being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16722"> 16722 </A></B>
<P>
divided and dwelling on the past like the Leader of the Opposition 
did throughout the last referendum campaign.
<P>
	I challenge the future Premier of Quebec and members of the 
opposition to lay down their arms and say: ``We are willing to work 
with everyone. We are willing to work with the federal 
government, the municipalities and, of course, the other 
provinces''. I think it is really too bad that the Quebec government, 
which claims to be anxious to promote regional economic 
development, tends to boycott agreements and federal-provincial 
meetings and conferences.
<P>
	I think that is too bad, and it is unfortunate that in several 
sectors, including fisheries and agri-food and agriculture, we see 
this refusal to meet Minister Tobin and officials and ministers from 
the other Canadian provinces. I think the Quebec government and 
especially members opposite will have to consider that people want 
development, but not if it means Quebec has to separate, not if it 
means breaking up and destroying the country.
<P>
	I think that people, especially in Quebec, want to build a fair and 
credible society, and this will happen within the Canadian 
federation. In concluding, I would urge opposition members to 
suggest alternatives, to work with us, but even more important, to 
work with and for their constituents. I am convinced and confident 
that their constituents feel it is up to them to work with us to 
strengthen the economy of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before he leaves, I 
would like to congratulate the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine for having successfully 
enlivened the debate this morning to some extent on that side of the 
House, because, up to now, things were pretty quiet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> True. True.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> He encouraged us to pay attention to and analyze the 
outcome of the referendum. I would like to return to his 
recommendation, and look at the outcome of the referendum in his 
riding. In his own 
riding-Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine-as he knows, it was 
not the no vote that won, but the yes. So, if he truly spoke for the 
people of his riding, he would be saying something different. It 
appears he did not listen carefully. Too bad for him.
<P>
	I, however, remember. I have listened carefully to most of the 
speeches by the member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. I 
remember him from when I was a brand new member. There was a 
debate on the famous ferry that would run between the Magdalen 
Islands and Prince Edward Island. The solutions proposed by the 
Government of Quebec were not particularly to his liking. He said: 
``I will listen to  what my people have to say, and, you watch, we 
will come up with a solution''.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The solution the federal government came up with was to buy a 
secondhand boat from somewhere else, rather than have a new boat 
built. Since then, the president of the Société de transport des 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine has been running around after secondhand 
boats, with $30 million of federal money. Recently, someone said 
on his behalf, a representative of the Société said: ``Unfortunately, 
the federal government took so long in the matter, I missed an 
opportunity. The boat was sold elsewhere. There are no more 
secondhand boats for sale''.
<P>
	Meanwhile, I know, because we are talking about real problems, 
we are not talking Constitution, we are talking jobs, I am the 
member for Lévis, where the Chantier maritime de Lévis is 
located, and where workers at MIL Davie remember what the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine said: ``A second 
hand boat rather than a new one''. Hundreds of unemployed 
workers remember that.
<P>
	I listen to them and I say to the member, because sometimes we 
have to raise our voices so the member opposite understands: Not 
only did you not listen to the people of Lévis, you did not even 
listen to the people of the Magdalen Islands.
<P>
	Before you warn me about the relevance of my remarks, Mr. 
Speaker, I will return to Bill C-96.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I simply want to put you at 
ease. It has nothing to do with relevance. You should, however, 
always address your comments to the chair, and not directly to each 
other.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You understand that we 
cannot always resist temptation. I have every intention of following 
your rules, which I graciously accept because of my great respect 
for your position.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, for 
example, wonders what the official opposition is worried about, 
arguing that this bill will not broaden the human resources 
development minister's jurisdiction.
<P>
	Not only is the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine not listening, but he has 
apparently not read the bill. What does the bill do? It expands the 
Department of Human Resources Development. It must be realized 
that, if we take away the money allocated to debt servicing, it 
almost exceeds 50 per cent of the federal budget. That is quite 
something.
<P>
	It includes the old employment department, the labour 
department. It is responsible for old age pensions. On this subject, I 
simply wish to remind the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine about the debate  surrounding 
the replacement of many employment centres with computer 
terminals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16723"> 16723 </A></B>
<P>
	As one who listens to citizens and to seniors in particular-and I 
know that all members on this side of the House have heard 
them-, I can tell you that they are concerned. They are not used to 
typing on computer terminals to get information. They are very 
concerned about this. The government is saying that they are 
moving their services closer to the people, but installing a 
computer terminal in a municipal location is not the way to go.
<P>
	My main concern-and that is clear from the debate today-is 
that Bill C-96 will enable the federal government to deal directly 
with agencies and individuals in matters coming under the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces like postsecondary 
education, security and manpower training. It is certainly not a case 
of jurisdictions being unclear.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
suggested that we look ahead not back. I would actually encourage 
him to go back to the Canadian Constitution and read it over. The 
Constitution states that these areas are indeed areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The hon. member closed by saying: ``Let the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois, the people of Quebec and 
the Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre 
come and help us, the federal government, to do what we have set 
out to do, so that it can be better done, in partnership''.
<P>
	He got it all wrong. It should be just the opposite. The federal 
government should be the one trying to help provincial 
governments in exercising their exclusive jurisdictions. That is 
what decentralization should be about. It should not be about the 
federal government decentralizing its action by going over the 
heads of the provinces to deal with agencies, businesses and 
individuals. This is not decentralizing. It is by-passing, going over 
the heads of the provinces. That is not the same thing, and it 
certainly does not qualify as decentralization.
<P>
	On the contrary, that is centralizing. You keep the money, spend 
it according to certain rules or national standards and go over the 
heads of the provinces to deal directly with businesses and 
individuals in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The past often gives us an indication of what the future holds. I 
will not go very far back in time. I will focus on the past couple of 
years. As the opposition's critic for training and youth, I would like 
to remind the House of a bill I mentioned a number of times 
already to give you an idea of what the minister has in mind when 
he talks about decentralizing. I am referring to the infamous Bill 
C-28 that the House passed on June 23,  1994. What is so special 
about this bill that the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is responsible for? Subsection 3(1) states that, from now on, the 
HRD minister will designate himself appropriate educational 
authorities for the provinces, which flies in the face of the 
Constitution. I say it again because people have to understand. 
Over time, people may forget the connection between certain 
legislative measures passed by the government. Bill C-28 is an 
example of a case where the federal government ignored the 
provinces.
<P>
	Subsection 14(7) states that Quebec can opt out, with financial 
compensation, like before, provided that its program meets every 
requirement and that each of its components is similar to that of the 
federal program.
<P>
	The Quebec government is free to do what it wants and, yes, will 
even get money. However, that money, which, incidentally, comes 
from Quebecers who pay 24 per cent of their taxes to Ottawa, will 
only be paid provided certain conditions are met. In other words, 
Quebec is free to do what it wants, but if it does not do this or that, 
the federal government will cut funding. What a nice way to view 
decentralization, this in a field of provincial jurisdiction. Such is 
the spirit that guides this government.
<P>
	I followed every initiative of the minister regarding his 
employment development strategy for young people. One must 
admit that, in the two-year period, it has not met with much 
success. The figures for the last two months show that the 
unemployment rate for the under-25 group is exactly the same as it 
was two years ago, when the minister took office. This is quite the 
strategy.
<P>
	My limited studies in political science have taught me that a 
political or administrative strategy was good to the extent that it 
produced results. Otherwise, the strategy was not good and had to 
be changed. I invite the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to change his strategy for helping young people find 
jobs. At the moment, he is in the process of trying to duplicate 
Quebec provincial programs at the federal level. For example his 
Youth Service Canada is identical in every respect to the Quebec 
program Jeunes Volontaires. He has tried something involving 
work placements as well, but these are things that have already 
been done by the Government of Quebec and the Société 
québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre.
<P>
	During the referendum campaign, Quebecers heard and saw all 
this, with training and employability enhancement programs that 
change daily, but the last time I looked there were 102 federal and 
provincial programs. The total has even gone as high as 108, but a 
few were combined after that. It is still a huge number, and people 
cannot find their way around all these programs.
<P>
	A number of stakeholders in the Société québécoise de la 
main-d'oeuvre, including Mr. Béland, the president of  the 
Confédération des caisses populaires et d'économie Desjardins du 
Québec, the FTQ, labour federations, and the Conseil du Patronat 
as well, have been unanimous in demanding that the federal 
government pull out of this area. Despite their repeated demands, 
however-and this is where there is a danger when it comes to 
public opinion-there is a certain fatigue setting in and the strategy 
of the government across the way, apart from answering questions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16724"> 16724 </A></B>
<P>
asked during question period, is to pretend that everything is rosy. 
No reaction. Total silence. No problem. With time, people are 
saying, ``Maybe the Bloc MPs will get fed up. Anyway, it is a 
temporary party only''. They are aware that we are in existence for 
a limited time, but that time is a bit longer than planned, and we 
continue to keep our shoulders to the wheel, to be vigilant, 
tenacious, persevering, keeping on our toes, and it is our intention 
to remain that way. We will continue until the Quebec consensus 
concerning manpower is satisfied with the federal government's 
actions.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to join my fellow Bloc members in speaking to 
Bill C-96, an act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development and to amend and repeal certain related acts.
<P>
	As my colleagues explained earlier, this is an important bill. Last 
week when we were debating the amendment of the hon. member 
for Mercier, government members said that the bill simply grouped 
certain components without introducing any new elements. They 
told us not to worry. They said that the federal government would 
keep up the good work in the provinces and municipalities for the 
benefit of Canadians, and that basically, there was very little to get 
upset about. They assumed that the referendum was partly to blame 
that it was nothing very serious.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the opposition of the Bloc 
Quebecois to this bill is fundamental. This bill goes to the very 
heart of a certain definition, a particular vision of Canadian 
federalism. First of all, the Department of Human Resources 
Development. As the hon. member for Lévis said earlier, this is a 
very important department. It is responsible for unemployment 
insurance, old age security, education and transfers to the provinces 
for social assistance, and it has a budget that is probably second 
only to the budget for servicing Canada's debt.
<P>
	This department is a giant that is able to intervene in areas which 
it assumes are under its jurisdiction. It can intervene effectively 
because it has the resources. Over the years, the department has 
developed a mandate for intervention. Consider unemployment 
insurance, which required an amendment to the Canadian 
Constitution. Consider old age security, family allowances and 
federal assistance to the provinces for post-secondary education.  
Gradually, over the past 15, 20, 30 or 50 years, this department, or 
should I say its predecessor departments which it has now 
absorbed, have spearheaded a Canadian vision of social policy.
<P>
	If we recall what happened when Canada was founded in 1867, 
simply put, there was a division of powers, as is normal under a 
federal system. The federal government had its powers and the 
provinces had theirs, and anyone who bothers to read the 
Constitution will see that areas with a more immediate impact on 
people, such as health, education, and social assistance, were a 
provincial responsibility, while foreign affairs, the economy, the 
armed forces and other areas of a more financial or economic 
nature were the responsibility of the federal government.
<P>
	As I just said, over the years we have seen the federal 
government increasingly invade the jurisdictions of the provinces. 
So much so that today, we are considering a bill that will provide a 
rationale for the federal government's presence in provincial 
jurisdictions. I realize some people will say this may be normal, 
that federalism has evolved and change is necessary, that certain 
problems must be dealt with and that this should be done by the 
level of government best equipped to do so.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	This is a bit what the bill says. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development may, at his pleasure, intervene, according 
to clause 6, in: ``-all matters over which Parliament has 
jurisdiction relating to the development of the human resources of 
Canada''. Admittedly, this is very broad. The department may enter 
into agreements involving employment, encourage equality and 
promote social security. In the present context, members will agree 
that this is very broad indeed.
<P>
	We in the Bloc feel that the department is using this bill to 
acquire legislative jurisdiction to define policy in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. What is the effect of the federal 
government's approach? It could be dramatic, given that Quebec, 
Ontario and the other provinces also operate in these areas.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec is involved in health, education, 
social and employment matters in these jurisdictions. It has defined 
its programs. It has set up departments. It has activities planned in 
these areas. We note, in the bill before us, that the federal 
government is giving itself the right to intervene in these areas.
<P>
	Perhaps it wants to intervene with the best of intentions, but, in 
practical terms, two levels of government are operating in the same 
areas with programs that often compete with or overlap each other. 
My colleague mentioned there are currently more than 100 
programs, either federal or provincial, aimed at meeting objectives 
in the social, educational or employment fields.
<P>
	So we end up with two levels of government that, in a way, 
knock each other out of commission, not out of ill will, but because 
of the very nature of the political structure defining the programs 
and objectives. What we see in Quebec, what I have noticed in my 
riding, is that there were provincial policies, co-ordinated primarily 
by the SQDM, the Société québécoise de dévéloppement de la 
main-d'oeuvre, and there were federal policies from the 
employment centres and the Department of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16725"> 16725 </A></B>
<P>
	When we think about the section 25 program from 
unemployment insurance, the job readiness programs and the 
special programs of certain agencies to help specific clientele, we 
realize that everyone's intentions are good. However, we also 
realize there is often inefficiency, which the Minister of Human 
Resources Development himself admits. Yesterday, during 
question period, he in fact said that he wanted to make changes in 
Canada and in his policies, because he could see over the past two 
years that the policies were ineffective.
<P>
	So we end up with two levels of government that, in a way, 
pursue ineffective policies, precisely because these policies 
overlap and cancel each other out. The Bloc Quebecois's argument 
against this bill is that there should be a single level of government 
dealing with these issues.
<P>
	If we look at the Canadian Constitution, we see that these 
programs should come under provincial jurisdiction. So we in 
Quebec asked the federal government to withdraw from these 
programs and transfer responsibility to the Quebec government. 
The other provinces do not, of course, want these powers, but we in 
Quebec want to be in charge of these programs because of our 
history, because the Quebec government is the government of a 
people, a nation distinct from Canadian society.
<P>
	This has been a Quebec demand for 30 years, going back to Mr. 
Lesage, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bourassa, Mr. Lévesque. This is a 
constant demand. We have always come up against a brick wall. If 
the federal government had acted in good faith, Canada might have 
achieved some form of asymmetrical federalism allowing Quebec 
to put forward its policies and to feel respected, while the other 
provinces could have enjoyed greater centralization and carried out 
programs benefiting their labour force, something that we do not 
have in Canada at the present time.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	This is the brick wall we have come up against in recent years, 
whether at the Quebec government or the federal government level. 
This situation has come about because the federal government has 
refused for 30 years to accommodate the specific demands made by 
all Quebec governments for 50 years, going back to Maurice 
Duplessis.
<P>
	I call on all members to reject this bill at second reading so that 
the jurisdiction of each level of government in the Canadian 
federation can be respected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> What a pleasure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> If the hon. member opposite will give me a chance, I 
would like to take part in this debate today on Bill C-96 to legally 
establish the Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	As I said in my remarks on November 20, this bill accentuates 
the federal presence by giving the minister new powers, including 
the power to bypass provincial authorities and negotiate directly 
with local authorities and agencies. I denounce, once again, the 
federal government's centralizing designs. As you know, there is a 
strong consensus in Quebec on the need to have control over 
manpower training programs. This is an area where there is a great 
deal of duplication and overlap, which is proving to be extremely 
costly and inefficient.
<P>
	Just to show how inefficient the federal government is, and this 
department in particular, the report tabled by the Auditor General 
of Canada two days ago, on November 21, is very critical of the 
manpower training programs, describing these programs as 
ill-suited to industry's needs. An estimated 300,000 positions 
remained vacant every year between 1988 and 1990 because 
suitable incumbents could not be found, but the training programs 
offered by the department related to only 5 per cent of these vacant 
positions. To be facing that kind of a problem when unemployment 
is on the rise is incredible. The federal government's inefficiency 
and squandering in this regard has to be denounced. The 
Department of Human Resources Development spends $2 billion a 
year on manpower training.
<P>
	The auditor finds that there is no systematic or global measure to 
deal with the situation.
<P>
	I also want to point out that clause 6 of Bill C-96 authorizes the 
minister to bypass provinces and establish direct links with 
financial institutions, local organizations and such other persons or 
bodies as he considers appropriate, ``with the objective of 
enhancing employment, encouraging equality and promoting social 
security''. Moreover, the minister may authorize ``any other person 
or body'' to exercise his powers. That provision opens the door to 
the contracting-out and privatization of employment services, 
something which is already illustrated by the streamlining of the 
federal network of employment centres.
<P>
	The bill also provides that the Canada Employment and 
Insurance Commission may ``authorize any person or body-to 
exercise powers or perform duties and functions of the 
Commission''. Under subsection 31(3) of the former act, the 
commission could only delegate its powers to members of its staff 
or, subject to the  minister's approval, to members of the 
department. Thus, the commission will enjoy a power to delegate 
similar to that of the minister. This is the same minister who is 
about to announce 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16726"> 16726 </A></B>
<P>
additional cuts of $1.25 billion in the UI program. That is a lot of 
money.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that the public service, the crown corporations 
and the private sector are all experiencing cuts, closures and 
massive layoffs, Bill C-96 is silent on job creation.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Let me give a few examples of such cuts. First, by 1997, Bell 
Canada will have closed nine regional offices in Quebec alone. It 
also intends to close three auditing offices.
<P>
	That company, which employs 46,000 people, hopes to layoff 
10,000 of them over the next three years. A large number of these 
people are members of the Communications, Energy and 
Paperworkers Union of Canada. This is a 22 per cent reduction of 
the company's staff. Bell has 28,606 employees in Ontario and 
17,300 in Quebec. It intends to reduce its staff through voluntary 
termination of employment, early retirement and outright layoffs. 
It should be noted that Bell cannot justify such major cuts, given 
the huge profits generated last year. Moreover, during the first six 
months of 1995, the company paid $35 million in dividends, which 
is as much as it did for the same period last year.
<P>
	Recently, a group of Bloc Quebecois members, including 
myself, met with officials from the company and the union, here in 
Ottawa. We heard both sides. Following these meetings, I 
personally feel that these massive layoffs are totally unjustified, 
particularly since Bell is among the telephone companies 
employing the smallest number of people per line in North 
America. Bell has always made substantial profits. I salute the 
courage and the determination of the employees of that company 
and also of their union, which seeks to protect the rights and 
benefits of its members against a management strategy designed to 
produce massive layoffs.
<P>
	I would also like to salute the 2,000 delegates who are attending 
the Ontario Federation of Labour convention which has been going 
on in Toronto since Monday night. Yesterday, they marched down 
Bay Street, where Canadian banks and large corporations have their 
headquarters, to protest against Mike Harris' right wing policies, 
especially against the first piece of legislation his government 
enacted, which repealed the anti-scab act and makes the creation 
and certification of trade unions more difficult.
<P>
	I would like to quote a statement made by an American, the 
Reverend Jesse Jackson, who told the convention delegates: ``Do 
not allow the right to destroy all the accomplishments of many past 
generations''. I could not agree more.
<P>
	The Harris government has decided to dismantle the Ontario 
Labour Code. Moreover, it wants to reduce the size of the labour 
ministry by 46 per cent, which will mean fewer occupational health 
and safety inspectors, fewer air quality technicians, fewer officials 
to enforce minimum work standards, etc.
<P>
	I an concerned about all these cuts and these attacks against 
workers in Ontario, the richest province in Canada.
<P>
	The federal government, and the provincial governments of 
Ontario and Alberta, which are going after the poorest members of 
society in an attempt to put their financial house in order, are on the 
wrong track. They will only increase poverty. I believe that the way 
to go, instead, is job creation initiatives, tax fairness, a better 
redistribution of wealth, and increased social security.
<P>
	Both at the provincial and federal levels, anti-scab legislation is 
not only essential, but urgently needed. I was very disappointed by 
the vote taken the day before yesterday by the members of this 
House who rejected by 144 against and 104 for the bill presented by 
my Bloc colleague, the member for Manicouagan. However, I 
salute the courage of a great number of Liberal members who 
supported the bill and who were in agreement with it, under the 
previous Conservative government. On the other hand, I denounce 
all the ministers, especially the labour minister, who voted against 
it.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Following the example of Quebec and British Columbia, such an 
act at the federal level would avoid the worsening of labour 
conflicts, as was the case at the Ogilvie flour mill, in Montreal, 
where the strike lasted for 15 months.
<P>
	Finally, I will say that I support the FTQ's request for the 
strengthening of the present succession rights of workers, should a 
Crown corporation be privatized or a private company under 
federal jurisdiction be disposed of. This problem has arisen mostly 
with the sale of Canadian airports.
<P>
	To conclude, I stress that I will vote against Bill C-96.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
like my colleagues, I welcome the opportunity to speak about the 
Act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Bill C-96 establishing the Department of Human Resources 
Development flows from the June 1993 reform and is another 
demonstration of this government's desire to centralize. The 
Liberal Party of Canada, faithful to the objectives established by its 
guru of the last decades, Pierre-Elliott Trudeau, took office at the 
House of commons in October 1993 with the clear intention of 
giving government in Canada a more centralized structure. Right 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16727"> 16727 </A></B>
<P>
from the beginning, there was a major offensive action against the 
autonomy  Quebec was aiming at. During the two years of the 
present administration, we have seen countless examples of this 
thrust towards centralization.
<P>
	Bill C-96 is but another step in the invasion, by the central 
government, of Quebec's jurisdictions in the area of social and 
economic development. Clauses 6 and 20 of that bill reveal the 
federal government will to limit the freedom of action of the 
Quebec National Assembly.
<P>
	Clause 6 defines the powers, duties and functions of the minister 
which now extend, and I quote: ``to include all matters over which 
Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the development of human 
resources of Canada-with the objective of enhancing 
employment.'' The clause is unequivocal; it allows for the creation 
of a vast federal Human Resources Development department where 
the minister will have considerable powers and will be free to act 
without the approval of the provinces. In fact, this bill contains no 
provision on provincial jurisdiction, let alone on honouring this 
jurisdiction; on the contrary, it denies Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction over manpower training and development.
<P>
	Clause 20 lists the organizations with which the minister may 
enter into agreements. It reads as follows: ``For the purpose of 
facilitating the formulation, co-ordination and implementation of 
any program or policy [-]the minister may enter into agreements 
with a province or group of provinces, agencies of provinces, 
financial institutions and such other persons or bodies as the 
minister considers appropriate''. So the minister may put anyone 
he wants in charge of managing his department's policies and 
programs without having to justify himself in the House or 
worrying about the Quebec government's directives.
<P>
	In other words, he would have full discretion to contract out. The 
minister would have the power to enter into agreements with 
regional and local organizations, including municipalities, thus 
bypassing the provinces. This bill will allow the federal 
government to disregard Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction over the 
design of manpower training and development programs.
<P>
	Quebec has always denounced the federal government's 
intention to put in place its own parallel manpower programs in 
Quebec. Quebec's Minister of Employment, Mrs. Harel, says that 
this bill is the antithesis of the Quebec consensus on the manpower 
policy, the antithesis of the single window.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995, is another example of 
the Liberal federal government's relentless denial of Quebec. 
Under this bill, the Minister of Human Resources Development can 
use the money saved through UI reform to set up a human 
resources investment fund.
<P>
	This fund will be spent on manpower training programs, among 
other things, thus allowing for massive federal intervention-on a 
discretionary basis and with a centralizing effect-in education, an 
area over which Quebec has exclusive jurisdiction, with total 
disregard for Quebec's policies in this sector.
<P>
	Interprovincial trade is another area in which the federal 
government likes to impose its centralizing vision.
<P>
	In Bill C-88 regulating interprovincial activities, the federal 
government assumes powers that were never discussed when this 
agreement was negotiated and signed in June 1994. Clause 9 of the 
bill stipulates that if a party is found to be in violation of Article 
1710 of the agreement, the federal government, whether or not it is 
a party to the dispute, takes it upon itself to impose retaliatory 
measures against any province without distinction.
<P>
	This bill shows, once more, the federal government's 
determination to act as judge and jury in interprovincial trade and 
to give itself, through this bill, a power of enforcement under 
orders issued by itself to extend the application of any federal law 
to the provinces, as stated in clause 9(1)(<I>c</I>).
<P>
	This unitary state attitude of a centralizing federal system is in 
contradiction with provincial identities and, as such, impedes the 
development of the people of Quebec. This attitude is also reflected 
in Bill C-46 establishing the Department of Industry, whose clause 
8 states specifically that the Minister of Industry is responsible for 
``economic development in areas of Ontario and Quebec''.
<P>
	This legislation only goes to show that there is overlap with 
respect to regional economic development by confirming the 
federal industry minister's right to interfere in an area of 
jurisdiction over which Quebec has been demanding control for a 
long time.
<P>
	Bill C-91 to continue the Federal Business Development Bank 
under the name Business Development Bank of Canada is the last 
example of the centralizing federal legislation that I will give you 
here.
<P>
	Clauses 20 and 21 of this act are totally unacceptable to Quebec. 
Clause 20 suggests that the Business Development Bank of Canada 
may enter into agreements with, and I quote: ``and act as agent for, 
any department or agency of the government of Canada or a 
province, or any other body or person, for the provision of services 
or programs to'' them or on their behalf.
<P>
	This act also flies in the face of the economic development 
policies being implemented within Quebec. Under this clause, the 
Liberal federal government pursues its strategy of centralization, a 
political strategy to substantially restrict the Quebec government's 
ability to act in the area of economic development, ultimately 
preventing it from achieving political autonomy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16728"> 16728 </A></B>
<P>
	By usurping the power to act as an agent for any department 
or agency of Quebec, through the bank, the federal government 
completely ignores the authority of the Quebec National Assembly 
and its legislation on the executive council, which states that no 
department or agency of the Government of Quebec may deal with 
the federal government without prior consent. The new Federal 
Business Development Bank, the Business Development Bank of 
Canada, has become the instrument of federal interference in 
regional economic development in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The totally demagogic approach developed by Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau, who claimed that Canada is the most decentralized 
country in the world, is an insult to intelligence and reflects the bad 
faith now being displayed by the current Prime Minister. Such an 
attitude is a major impediment to finding a solution regarding 
Quebec's place in North America. In spite of the incessant pleas of 
the Quebec government to develop its own economic and social 
policies, the Liberal Party of Canada always said no and used every 
available legislative means to restrict the decision making power of 
Quebec's national assembly.
<P>
	In the late sixties, Trudeau became Prime Minister and imposed 
a national vision which resulted in a series of federal interventions 
in fields of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. Since then, the 
primary objective of the federal government has been to streamline 
government activity and strengthen federal authority over the 
political economy. For example, in the area of manpower 
development and training, the federal government has over the last 
fifty years assumed increasing responsibility regarding the 
definition of the framework and conditions relating to government 
intervention in that area of Quebec economic activity. As a ``policy 
definer'', the federal government has given itself the role of 
direction setter and harmonizer, as opposed to that of a service 
provider for the provinces.
<P>
	The patriation and review of the Constitution were opportunities 
for the federation to affirm the authority of the central government 
over the economic and social management of all the provinces. 
Regardless of what Pierre Elliot Trudeau and the current Prime 
Minister may say, the 1982 Constitution Act confirms Ottawa's 
dominating role as the place where power is exercised. This is why 
2,308,266 Quebecers voted for sovereignty on October 30.

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (for the Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Environment) </B>moved that Bill C-83, an Act to amend 
the Auditor General Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-83 at 
third reading and to support this legislation which will establish for 
the first time within the federal government the position of 
Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development.
<P>
	Not so long ago, maybe 20 to 25 years ago, the environment was 
not among the major concerns of the government. In fact, most of 
the environment departments, at the federal and the provincial 
levels, were only set up during the 1970s. At that time, the 
environment was considered a self-contained issue. It was dealt 
with within one department, as were all the other areas, such as 
health, education, finance or revenue. Each department saw to its 
own business, without thinking about integrating elements from 
other departments.
<P>
	Little by little, we realized over the last 25 years that everything 
that relates to one area, such as environment,  taxation, transporta-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16729"> 16729 </A></B>
<P>
tion, health, is also interrelated with other areas. Nowadays, we 
cannot talk about the environment without addressing the issues of 
health, economy, energy, taxation, public transportation. 
Everything is linked together.
<P>
	In fact, all things are interdependent. The whole environmental 
issue hinges on ecosystems and biodiversity. We need something to 
support all forms of life, our natural resources and everything that 
is essential to the wealth of any country, of any community.
<P>
	We realize today that the only way for us to protect the 
environment and to ensure that sustainable development is a 
constant concern in our lives is to integrate the environment with 
all other aspects of government. That is why it is becoming 
increasingly important to talk not only about the environment, but 
also about sustainable development, biodiversity and 
interdependence.
<P>
	That is why, in an ideal world, we would not even need an 
environment department. In an ideal world, such a department 
would not be needed because every department, whether it be the 
Department of Health, Finance, Transport or Fisheries, would in 
itself be a sustainable development department, an environment 
department.
<P>
	But we are far from this ideal world. We still need a Department 
of the Environment to act as a watchdog and to ensure that 
environmental protection becomes an integral part of the agenda of 
all other departments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is the central objective of Bill C-83. The central objective is 
to ensure that each ministry of the government, whether it be 
finance, transportation, health, or any other ministry, will be 
convinced that the way to promote the environmental cause is to 
make each ministry's activities and actions sustainable in the long 
term.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	The reason for the bill is to ensure sustainable development 
strategies within the aegis of each ministry of the federal 
government. We have now constituted Bill C-83 to install a 
commissioner of environment and sustainable development within 
the office of the auditor general to monitor and inspire sustainable 
development strategies to be installed in each ministry of 
government, subject to public scrutiny through the office of the 
commissioner; the commissioner being installed within the office 
of the auditor general with all the autonomy and independence the 
office implies and sanctions.
<P>
	The idea will be for these sustainable development strategies to 
be public in scope and accountable to the people of Canada through 
Parliament. They will have to be filed in Parliament and will be 
monitored by the commissioner who will have to report on them.
<P>
	Bill C-83 will require the sustainable development strategies to 
be upgraded on a systematic basis so that the commissioner will 
have a benchmark starting in two years on the progress of these 
sustainable development strategies, considering the evolution of 
society in all its forms.
<P>
	The office of the commissioner for environment and sustainable 
development is a key development in the governance of federal 
institutions. Besides the very important task of monitoring the 
sustainable development strategies of the ministries, another 
extremely important element of the commissioner's duties will be 
to be accountable to the public at large so that the public will have 
access to the commissioner's office to inquire, to complain if 
necessary, about the activities of the various ministries with regard 
to their sustainable development strategies and their environmental 
consciences.
<P>
	The second element of public participation, that of 
accountability to the public, is a feature of the act which is almost if 
not as important as the first because the two are intertwined. This 
will provoke a transparent act, a bill that opens the scope of 
government to the public to ensure the government not only preach 
the preservation and enhancement of natural resources and the 
ecosystems that sustain all activities, but put the theory, the 
concept and the principles into practice in the every day governing 
of the various ministries of government.
<P>
	Bill C-83 in that sense is a great step forward for the 
government, a clear achievement for the Minister of the 
Environment, in having recognized the necessity for the office in 
the red book which was the flag ship of the Liberal Party of Canada 
during the last election and, more important, to have carried out 
this key commitment at an early stage in its evolution as a 
government.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	I am very pleased to have been part of the standing committee 
that examined and reported on the concept and office of a 
commissioner of environment and sustainable development. We 
are the first industrialized country of our size to have implemented 
such an office. We followed the lead of a very small country, a 
leading country of the world in this sense, New Zealand, which 
seven years ago installed an office of commissioner of sustainable 
development.
<P>
	During the course of our hearings we were fortunate to have had 
the benefit of the experience and the advice of the commissioner 
for New Zealand, whose trail blazing work today has been the 
source of inspiration for ourselves. It is our hope that now that 
Canada has gone forward with the red book commitment and 
installed a commissioner for environment and sustainable 
development, this will become a practice that hopefully will be 
followed by the other nations of the world.

	All of us are in this together. The environment is the most global 
issue of them all. Today we are committed as a nation to many 
international treaties such as the conventions on climate change 
and on biodiversity.
<P>
	We are committed to the commission on sustainable 
development. We are committed to so many international 
instruments concerning environment and sustainable development 
that as we act, as we move forward, we set a tone, a benchmark 
which I firmly hope in this case will be followed by others in 
Canada and beyond.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope that all of the political parties 
represented in the House of Commons will consider this bill a 
positive, constructive and trail-blazing piece of legislation.
<P>
	We may not have gone as far as the committee wanted to go at 
first, but I do think that our final resolution, the conclusion we have 
come to, is realistic and constructive, and is a huge step forward, 
not only for the federal government, but for all of Canada. This bill 
will show that the government is now firmly committed to 
sustainable development, not only through its environment 
department, but through all of its departments, all of the machinery 
of government. It will be up to us, as members of Parliament, and 
up to the people to ensure that the Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development not only follows up on 
the sustainable development strategies, but also voices our 
concerns and puts pressure on all the governments, the current one, 
the next one and all the others after that. All this will mean that, for 
the government and the population, sustainable development will 
become one of our concerns and part of our daily lives.
<P>
	I think Bill C-83 is a big step in the right direction for all of us. I 
am pleased to see today that it has come so far and that it will 
become a reality very soon, and I hope it will be passed by the 
Senate very fast so that it can come into effect as soon as possible.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will take a moment to 
clarify a matter we dealt with earlier with reference to Bill C-96, 
following an intervention of the chief government whip, on vote 
deferrals.
<P>
	It is my understanding the recorded division on second reading 
of Bill C-96 is deferred not to the ordinary hour of daily 
adjournment but to the end of government business on Tuesday, 
November 28.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SENIORS'SAFETYWEEK">SENIORS' SAFETY WEEK</A></H3>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
week is Seniors' Safety Week. While growing old is as inevitable 
as taxes we know that seniors should remain active and stay in their 
own homes for as long as possible. It is integral to their good 
health.
<P>
	Ironically the home is one of the least safe places for seniors. In 
Canada accidental death or injury leading to hospitalization that is 
often permanent is three times higher for seniors than for any other 
age group. These injuries exact high psychological and social costs 
on seniors. They lead to loss of independence and mobility, and 
fear and anxiety lead to isolation.
<P>
	Therefore making home and consumer products safe is the best 
health promotion for seniors. Health Canada promotes increased 
safety awareness among seniors and their care givers. Access to 
devices and home improvements that ensure safe living 
environments for seniors are a priority for the government, which 
is why we support the Canada Safety Council's national safety 
week campaign.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to work toward safer 
communities for seniors. We will all be living in them eventually.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Senate has now passed the infamous firearms 
legislation. For some it may be considered a victory but it is a very 
hollow victory at best.
<P>
	The government has made some vague promises of safer streets 
and safer homes by introducing mandatory registration of rifles and 
shotguns. The Minister of Justice has never explained how 
cracking down on law-abiding citizens is going to prevent the 
criminal misuse of firearms. Obviously, criminals are not going to 
register anything they own.
<P>
	I believe the legislation is nothing more than a very thin smoke 
screen to offer a false sense of safety to Canadians who are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16731"> 16731 </A></B>
<P>
concerned about the growing crime problem in this country and to 
take pressure off a  government that seems unwilling to do anything 
meaningful about it.
<P>
	There is a tremendous cost involved in the legislation. The 
set-up cost is $118.9 million by the minister's own figures, and 
registration itself will cost hundreds of millions more.
<P>
	At a time when we are seeing federal cutbacks in transfer 
payments for health care, post-secondary education and various 
social programs, should the government not be reconsidering its 
priorities and refocusing the spending of what money it has in areas 
more meaningful than the registration of firearms belonging to 
law-abiding taxpayers in this country?

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, studies in 
the U.S. show that smoking causes 415,000 deaths in a year and 
$50 billion in medical care costs.
<P>
	Smoking is the most important preventable cause of premature 
death. The immediate causes of death are a wide variety of cancers 
and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Yet 48 million young 
Americans still smoke. Twenty-four billion packs of cigarettes are 
purchased each year. Every pack sold causes $4 of expenditures on 
smoking related health care.
<P>
	As 70 per cent of smokers begin before the age of 18 years, 
discouraging smoking among the young is essential if we are to 
cope with this problem. It has been shown that the young prefer the 
most heavily advertised brands. Here in Canada we must 
discourage our children from smoking.
<P>
	These facts are from the 1994 issues of the morbidity and 
mortality weekly report of the Massachusetts Medical Society, 
1440 Main Street, Waltham, Massachusetts, 02154. I would be glad 
to provide extracts to anyone interested.

Speaker, on Thursday, November 16, I attended the local kick-off 
for the Mothers Against Drinking and Driving red ribbon campaign 
in the town of Kentville in my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants. 
The red ribbon project is this organization's most visible grassroots 
campaign. Each red ribbon serves as a reminder for motorists to be 
safe and sober drivers during the holiday season and throughout the 
year.
<P>
	In 1994 over 1,700 people were killed in alcohol related 
accidents. That works out to 4.6 people per day. By working to 
raise awareness on this issue, we can all help to prevent the 
senseless deaths and injuries that result from drinking and driving.
<P>
	I have a red ribbon tied to the antenna of my car. I would ask that 
all members of the House support this very worthwhile campaign 
by doing the same.

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on June 
14 the government tabled Bill C-98, the Canada Oceans Act. This 
legislation is structured to provide a legal framework for the 
implementation of a new ocean management strategy. The Canada 
Oceans Act is needed to enable nation-wide management of our 
oceans on an ecosystem basis while ensuring that economic 
opportunities are achieved.
<P>
	The province of Newfoundland is unique in its location and its 
dependency on intelligent oceans resource management. For this 
reason, the Canada Oceans Act is a landmark piece of legislation 
and is directed at the promotion of sustainable development and the 
protection of ocean resources.
<P>
	With the Canada Oceans Act came the merger of the Canadian 
Coast Guard and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. One key 
role for this integrated fleet will be fisheries conservation inside 
the 200-mile limit. Groundfish and other species will be protected 
while nature rebuilds these resources and shellfish will be 
protected from over-exploitation.

<P>
	Medicare deserves a federal health minister who can adapt to 
major inevitable changes, like new technology, which will be 
expensive; like a population that is aging, which will also be 
expensive; and like government debt, with a federal Department of 
Health spending $1,200 per person per year on debt service and just 
$268 per person per year on health.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	We need a keen, adaptable minister with fresh ideas. What do we 
have? We have a minister out of her depth, who is fining the 
provinces for the delivery of health care that does not match her 
interpretation of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Medicare deserves better. Canadians deserve better. Federal 
fines for medicare mean failure.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last month the Liberal government reduced federal transfer 
payments to Saskatchewan by a further $244 million. With a stroke 
of a pen, Saskatchewan's budget surplus has been wiped out.
<P>
	Saskatchewan was the first province in Canada to produce a 
balanced budget without hurting those in need. This latest Liberal 
action will hurt those in need most.
<P>
	Provinces have been under constant attack from the Liberal 
government's cutting of transfer payments. The Liberals' slashing 
of post-secondary education funding means higher education will 
only be available to wealthy families.
<P>
	The reduction in transfer payments to the provinces is damaging 
to Canada's inter-generational and inter-regional sharing. Forcing 
young Canadians to pay more for their post-secondary education 
could cause them to lose sympathy for their elders. We ought not be 
surprised if soon these young people in turn demand that other 
generations, such as seniors, finance their own social and economic 
needs on a pay as you go basis as well.
<P>
	Is this the Liberal vision for Canada, pitting one generation 
against the other?

	By hosting Winter Cities '96, those of us who live and work in 
Winnipeg will be able to demonstrate to the rest of Canada and 
indeed to the rest of the world that we are immensely proud of our 
city and delighted to share it.
<P>
	Winter Cities '96 is also a tremendous chance for Canadian 
businesses to showcase and promote their talents. At the moment, 
over 200 volunteers are hard at work preparing to welcome visitors 
from over 60 cities and 26 different countries.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister made a shameful 
remark, taking dangerous liberties with reality.
<P>
	By linking the departure of CP Rail from Montreal with the 
sovereignist movement, and even having the colossal nerve to state 
that the sovereignists are intolerant of cultural minorities in 
Quebec, the Prime Minister sidestepped the question and added 
fuel to the fire.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister listened to CBC a little more often, he 
would have known that Mr. Ritchie, the President of CP Rail, has 
denied any connection between moving the headquarters and 
Quebec's move toward sovereignty. Mr. Ritchie simply pointed out 
that 80 per cent of CP activities were in the west. And this is the 
result of federal policies.
<P>
	Rather than seeking to exacerbate the differences between the 
various groups making up Quebec society, the Prime Minister 
ought to be working to bring them closer together. This is another 
of the real problems the Prime Minister ought to be addressing.

to the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the government is preparing to reduce 
maximum insurable earnings for unemployment insurance.
<P>
	This decrease will constitute the most important tax cut by this 
government, but essentially the ones to benefit will be high income 
earners who will therefore be paying less into the unemployment 
insurance fund, while people with unstable and seasonal work will 
get less money in benefits.
<P>
	The minister himself has stated in the past that raising the ceiling 
would improve income distribution. He knows what he is doing.
<P>
	We are anxious to see this long awaited unemployment insurance 
reform. This government, which claims it is addressing people's

perpetuate the oppressive political system of handouts and rampant 
patronage. The truth hurts.

	All this being said, the Canadian sugar industry still has one very 
key irritant that needs to be resolved. Canadian sugar exports to the 
U.S. were drastically reduced last year when the Americans 
implemented new trade restrictions which lowered our export 
quota. As a result, the Lantic Sugar refinery in Saint John, New 
Brunswick, had to lay off many employees. These tariffs are

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
when the Prime Minister backed out of the promises he made to 
Quebecers six days before the referendum and said that reopening 
the Constitution was out of the question, Quebecers all 
remembered the promises made by Pierre Elliott Trudeau on May 
14, 1980, promises on which the government at the time 
immediately proceeded to renege.
<P>
	Since six days before the referendum the Prime Minister clearly 
referred to the Constitution as a way to bring about change, does 
yesterday's retreat signify that Quebecers were tricked once again 
as they were in 1980, when they were promised so-called 
satisfactory constitutional changes and the government did not 
deliver?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>On the contrary, Mr. Speaker. The Prime 
Minister's statement in Verdun on October 24 was as follows, and I 
quote; ``We will keep open all the other roads to change, including 
administrative and constitutional means. Any changes in  
constitutional jurisdiction will only be made with the consent of 
Quebecers'', while the Leader of the Opposition said, and I quote: 
``While he talks about the Constitution, we will look after jobs''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When asked whether he would sign any deal he said: ``No, it is 
not possible. I am a sovereignist''. The person who is off the wall 
on this is not the Prime Minister; it is the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a 
fine way of passing the buck. This government blames 
unemployment on the previous government, and when there are 
problems with the Constitution, it blames them on the opposition.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister made these promises to Quebec a few 
days before the referendum, he knew there was a sovereignist 
government in Quebec City. He knew that perfectly well. He made 
certain promises. So how can he use the sovereignist government in 
Quebec City as an excuse to back out of the promises he made so he 
will not have to deliver the goods?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will repeat the promises 
made by the Prime Minister, which will be kept, and I quote: ``We 
will keep open all the other roads to change, including 
administrative and constitutional means. Any changes in 
constitutional jurisdiction will only be made with the consent of 
Quebecers''.
<P>
	If anyone is saying no, it is not the Prime Minister but the Leader 
of the Opposition, who the day after the referendum dismissed the 
option of constitutional change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> How delightful, Mr. 
Speaker. What is the world coming to? Now for my question, and I 
hope we manage to understand each other.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada-not Joe Blow but the Prime 
Minister-comes to Quebec six days before a referendum. Without 
anyone asking, he promises the changes the Deputy Prime Minister 
just mentioned.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	And then we have the same Prime Minister, and since I am going 
to quote him, I will quote exactly what he said two days after the 
referendum in this House: ``This I have promised and this I will 
do''. And yesterday, he told us: ``I will not do it''. What is going 
on?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on the contrary. The Prime

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, two days ago, the Prime Minister made a suggestion to 
extend the deadline of the phoney committee chaired by the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, whose mandate, according 
to its chairman, is to save Canada by reviewing all the options to 
renew federalism.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tell us if he still 
intends to table the report of the phoney committee before 
Christmas or if he will grab the line thrown by the Prime Minister 
to gain a little more time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I should first set the record straight. As I said before, the 
perfect example of a phoney committee is the Parti Quebecois's 
regional commissions, in which the Bloc Quebecois took part.
<P>
	I would like to remind them that there are five million voters in 
Quebec, not 50,000, and that their commissions were not 
representative and did not try to find conclusions that would help 
Quebec and Canada, while our committee is looking at all the 
options and seeking solutions to our problems.
<P>
	Once again, we are holding out our hand in good faith to the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois and urging them to soften their 
stance and negotiate a renewed federalism, as 80 per cent of 
Quebecers are asking them to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must admit that the minister has a vivid imagination. He 
said that his committee's mandate was to review all the options in 
order to honour the Prime Minister's referendum promises, 
because the Prime Minister did make promises. But the Prime 
Minister is now turning his back on constitutional change. This is a 
remake of 1980, an old movie that we have seen before, but we 
have since gained 10 per cent. Soon we will gain even more in less 
time.
<P>
	In this context, can the minister tell us what the phoney 
committee still has as a mandate? Should he not dismantle it 
instead, since the Prime Minister has decided as usual not to offer 
Quebec anything?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, once again, the hon. member's statements are wrong. As 
the Deputy Prime Minister said, the Prime Minister clearly stated 
in Verdun that we would keep open all other avenues of change, 
including administrative and constitutional changes.
<P>
	Yesterday in the House, the Prime Minister said this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I never said we were going to change the Constitution-I said we were going 
to make changes to the federation, constitutional changes, if necessary-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is no contradiction between the two sentences. It is the 
official opposition that will not abide by the results of the 
referendum, which showed very clearly that Quebecers want 
change, but within Canada.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are being reminded again today by the Bloc Quebecois that in the 
referendum campaign the federal Liberals made a couple of 
constitutional offers to Quebec. Despite the referendum loss the 
Government of Quebec and its future premier have already made it 
clear that they reject these offers and further that they would reject 
any offers of renewed federalism.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Will the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs make it clear 
today for all Canadians that the Government of Canada will not 
make further constitutional offers to a PQ government that has no 
intention of accepting them and that Canadians are sick and tired of 
playing this game with the separatists?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately it is true that the Leader of the Opposition, 
thinking about his future role as premier of Quebec, indicated that 
he would not consider any offers to renew federalism.
<P>
	However, in saying that the leader was refusing to recognize the 
result of the referendum where the majority of Quebecers told him 
that they wanted changes to be made within Canada. He was also 
refusing to respect the majority of Quebecers who have expressed 
their views.
<P>
	We will not do the same thing to Quebecers. We will be in a 
position to offer ways in which the present problems can be solved.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister avoided answering my question on constitutional offers, 
but in any case I will proceed with my supplementary question 
for the same minister.
<P>
	As he pointed out, the Government of Quebec has made it clear 
that it will seek another referendum on sovereignty in spite of the 
fact that in the last referendum it never did make a detailed 
proposal on sovereignty and the proposed economic partnership.
<P>
	Before the next referendum will the federal government 
formally request that the Government of Quebec table its detailed 
proposals for sovereignty and future economic relations with the 
rest of Canada so that Quebecers and other Canadians can evaluate 
the credibility of the ideas?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will respect the current referendum which indicated 
that Quebecers want changes to be made and that they want the 
changes to be made within Canada.
<P>
	I will repeat what the Prime Minister said yesterday in the 
House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``I never said we were going to change the Constitution. I said we 
were going to make changes to the federation, constitutional 
changes, if necessary''.
<P>
	That is what we are working on. We will make recommendations 
to the Prime Minister, and we hope to be able to find solutions that 
will ensure, once again, that Canada remains as we know it, a 
united country, a country where we can all make our dreams and 
aspirations come true, whether we live in Quebec or in another 
province.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these 
are good words but they continue to miss the point, which is that 
the Government of Quebec is not interested in such plans and will 
proceed with another referendum at some point.
<P>
	Let me go back to the Government of Canada's own 
commitments. On October 25, 1995 in a speech to the entire nation 
the Prime Minister said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All governments, federal and provincial, must respond to the desire of 
Canadians everywhere for greater decentralization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was a commitment to all Canadians that the Government of 
Quebec simply could not reject on behalf of everybody.
<P>
	As the government has done nothing but bash decentralization 
since the referendum, what specifically do the Prime Minister and 
the government have in mind in making this kind of a 
commitment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on this very important question I can only repeat what our 
line has been. It has been that decentralization would happen only 
when it is shown very clearly that it is more efficient to transfer 
responsibilities from one level of government to another.
<P>
	It will be decentralization if it well serves Canadian citizens who 
pay taxes, but there is no doubt that decentralization for its own 
sake is not a remedy to any of the problems we now have.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In his budget speech, the Minister of Finance announced that 
compensation packages for laid-off public servants would cost 
approximately $1.3 billion. But the annual financial statement 
tabled by the government shows a huge cost overrun, with costs up 
to $2.3 billion.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	How can the government explain the fact that its public service 
downsizing programs have cost $1 billion more than anticipated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the President of the 
Treasury Board were here, I am sure that, in response to the 
member's question, he would say that this increase can be 
attributed, first, to the pension funds that were not factored in when 
preparing the budget since they were not included in budget 
projections and, second, to the fact that more employees have 
accepted the offer earlier than expected. These costs will be 
recovered in time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is surprising to 
say the least that the President of the Treasury Board never 
mentioned anything about this to the Minister of Finance. In view 
of the finance minister's answer, I might add that one of these 
public service downsizing programs, the early retirement program, 
which was supposed to affect 4,000 employees and cost $300 
million, attracted 1,500 more people than expected and ended up 
costing $800 million instead of the original $300 million, or almost 
three times more than expected.
<P>
	How can the government explain that its early retirement 
program will end up costing almost three times more than 
expected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional  
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>First of all, Mr. Speaker, as I just 
said, this is explained, in the one hand, by the fact that some

registered opposition to the registration component of Bill C-68.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of

I am glad the hon. member has noted that Parliament has now 
adopted a bill designed to ensure that we have peaceful 
communities-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> -and designed to ensure we have increasingly safe 
homes and safe streets in this country.
<P>
	I am sure the provincial governments will take note of the strong 
support for this measure across the country which will inspire their 
co-operation.
<P>
	In any event, the Minister of Justice has announced today the 
appointment of a user group on firearms, composed of people from 
across the country who are responsible firearms users. This will be 
a very important way to make sure we have a cost effective, user 
friendly system of firearms registration which takes into account 
the concerns of responsible firearms users.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member would have us believe that the provincial governments do 
not have any consideration for the safety of their communities and 
their streets and that only the federal government can see that kind 
of safety within the bill.
<P>
	The federal-provincial financial agreements for the 
administration of gun control programs expired on March 31, 1993. 
I ask the government, what is the status of these financial 
negotiations with the provinces? Have these agreements been 
renewed and if not, why not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will have to get further information on this for my hon. friend. It 
is the desire of the government to have agreements with the 
provinces which  respect their concerns and at the same time ensure 
the safety of Canadians.
<P>
	I hope my hon. friend will finally realize the support of 
Canadians for this bill and cease his opposition, which is certainly 
not well founded in light of the facts and in light of the support of 
Canadians who want safe homes and safe streets. They do not want 
an American style gun culture anywhere in Canada.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has got it all wrong. You do not deal 
first with the budget and then with the mandate. You start with the 
mandate and then look at the budget. This is exactly what we are 
doing.
<P>
	A committee will make recommendations to us regarding CBC's

and then decide on a long term financial plan.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, given that the French network is already performing a lot 
better than the English one, does the minister realize that any 
additional cut would have a greater impact on the French network

<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, there is one aspect regarding CBC's mandate which, I 
think, will not change. It is the fact that the CBC must respect the 
linguistic duality of our country. This is a public institution. It is an 
institution which will continue to reflect that basic reality of our 
country.
<P>
	If the hon. member has opinions on the budget cuts made by 
CBC's president and board of directors and looks to me, it may be 
that she wants me to manage that corporation. That will not

	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.
<P>
	Last March the minister announced that he had instructed the 
Farm Credit Corporation to turn over the Crow payout to producers 
who lease land from the FCC. Last month the FCC stated that the 
minister's benevolent government corporation would increase the 
producer's share from a very generous 10 per cent up to a 
whopping 25 per cent.
<P>
	Why did the FCC defy the minister's instructions? Farmers want 
to know who is in charge: the minister or his good Liberal friend 
and party contributor, Mr. Don Jackson?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what party 
affiliation Mr. Jackson has. I have never discussed it with him and I 
do not intend to.
<P>
	On the substance of the issue, it is obviously not up to me to offer 
instructions to the FCC in terms of how it manages its business 
affairs. When the announcement was made in the budget with 
respect to the $1.6 billion capital payment in the wake of the 
cancellation of the WGTA, the FCC itself took the initiative to 
announce that it would find a way to equitably share that benefit 
with its leasing clients. It offered one particular formula. A number 
of the clients indicated to the FCC that in the opinion of the clients, 
they did not think that formula was sufficiently generous. As a 
consequence, the FCC more than doubled the formula.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister and the general manager for the FCC are 
saying one thing and doing another. The minister has stated that the 
balance of the payment would be reflected in lower lease and sale 
agreements, yet documented cases in Saskatchewan show that FCC 
leases and asking prices have risen by as much as 20 per cent.
<P>
	Will the minister finally take a stand on something and address 
this paradox before it is too late?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman is obviously 
being a bit inconsistent. He invites me to take a stand and every 
time I do that he criticizes it because it is not the Reform Party 
position. I would remind him that I was elected as a Liberal, not as 
a Reformer, and I do not intend to adopt his party's position.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	With respect to the arrangements made by the FCC, it anticipates 
that in the first year of the adjustment to the loss of the Crow rate it 
will pass through to its tenant  clients 12.5 per cent of the value of 
the Crow payment that it will receive. In the second year it will 
pass through another 12.5 per cent. It is fully expected by the third 
year that the impact of the freight rate adjustment will have worked 
its way through the land pricing system in western Canada and the 
benefit of reduced land costs will then be adjusted into the capital 
base.

<P>
	Will the parliamentary secretary please explain to the House and 
to Canadians why the government rejected the Reform amendment

instead of intentionally selling 40 per cent to 50 per cent to foreign 
investors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

wanted to maximize the price for CN was the reason it wanted 
maximum exposure not only in Canada but in the United States and

<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one can speak to 
virtually every mayor of every municipality. One can speak to the 
executives of the mayors in municipalities. One can speak to the 
provinces. They will say the infrastructure program has been a 
tremendous success all across the country.
<P>
	If one reads the auditor general's report, what he does is level a 
series of statements as to defects in evaluation, the vast majority of 
which occurred under the previous government and have been 
cleaned up by this government, which is why the auditor general 
congratulated the regional agencies under the Liberal government, 
and we are very proud of it.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not 
find the congratulations. First we had the national unity cabinet 
committee and now we have the job creation cabinet committee 
being struck. This is talk, talk, talk and more money flushed down 
the drain for a top down, borrowed money, government directed job 
creation program that we know will fail.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance recognize and acknowledge that if 
he wants a serious job creation program he has to get the 
government off the backs of the private sector, reduce the deficit 
faster than he has been doing and reduce taxes? Each of these 
things is opposite to what the government has been doing so far.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if one looks at the 
trend of interest rates since the last budget, one would see those 
interest rates have come down and will understand the very clear 
linkage between deficit reduction, lowering interest rates and job 
creation. That is more than likely one reason that over the course of 
the  last year and half there have been over 500,000 new jobs 
created in Canada.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board told me that the proof the 
infrastucture program has been such a great success is that the 
member for Simcoe Centre keeps writing to him for more money.

<P>
	On November 21, with the historic signing of the peace accord in

would the Minister of Foreign Affairs comment on any new role

congratulate all of the participants who had anything to with 
helping bring about this peace accord.
<P>
	The peace accord is one thing but a lasting peace, the post-peace 
accord period, is sometimes as important or more important than 
the peace settlement itself. There will now be a period of 
reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation. We will be 
monitoring this post-accord period very closely to see what part 
Canada can play together with its allies.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. Last July, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development announced a major restructuring 
of his employment centre network and decided that the regional

Shawinigan, in the riding of Saint-Maurice, instead of 
Trois-Rivières, the regional capital.

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	The <I>Irving Whale</I> salvage feasibility study submitted to the coast 
guard in 1992 noted the presence of a heating fluid called Mansanto 
MGS 295S. Had someone read the report carefully they would have 
discovered that the fluid was Monsanto MCS 295S, a substance 
comprised of 80 per cent PCBs.
<P>
	When the minister asked the RCMP to investigate a possible 
cover-up of the knowledge of PCBs, did she ask it also to 
investigate her own department to find out who made the mistake? 
It was obvious that cover-up was on her mind.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In the formulation of a question we always give 
the widest latitude, but we should be very careful not to impute 
motive in any way, especially in this particular context. I ask the 
hon. member to withdraw the last words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the words. I was not 
imputing motive.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Thank you. The hon. Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on July 6 of this year I 
ordered an investigation into the circumstances as to whether and 
why the Canadian Environmental Protection Act was violated in 
that information regarding PCBs had not been forwarded to my 
department.
<P>
	That preliminary investigation was concluded last week and the 
results were serious enough that I have turned the matter over to the 
Attorney General of Canada and to the RCMP for further 
investigation.
<P>
	With the investigation in the hands of the RCMP it has the full 
latitude to investigate everybody, including me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister needs to accept ministerial responsibility for 
the actions of her own department.
<P>
	On March 18, 1994 the minister tabled the 1992 report to which I 
referred. I would think if the minister tabled the material she is 
responsible for its contents. She has known since the tabling that 
PCBs were on board the <I>Irving Whale</I> barge.
<P>
	It is amazing that the environment minister calls for a police 
investigation when the fault lies with her. Will the minister accept 
the responsibility for the report which she tabled and take the 
blame for the mishaps of her department, an open ended cost so far 
of $12 million with still no results?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will accept my full 
responsibilities. Under the law of the people of Canada I was 
required in July to turn this matter over to an investigation because 
there was a possibility that evidence on the presence of PCBs had 
been withheld from the department specifically.
<P>
	If the hon. member is suggesting I should break the law and 
ignore the requirement under CEPA to inform of the presence of 
PCBs by law, I will not. If he is suggesting I am attempting to 
deflect responsibility or am participating in a cover-up I will 
categorically deny that.
<P>
	When I asked for the further investigation of the preliminary 
results by the attorney general and the RCMP, I made no bones 
about the openness of the RCMP to investigate everybody, 
including the actions of all departments of government.

<P>
	The CBC, one of the few remaining ties helping to keep our

warned that any further cuts would so drastically reduce the CBC 
that a change to its legislated mandate would be necessary. The 
minister, however, earlier today in the House guaranteed that the 
budget will fit the mandate, not the mandate the budget.
<P>
	Does the government really want the CBC to continue to exist? 
If it does, will the government rescind the further $123 million in

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
looking forward to speaking on third reading of Bill C-83 because 
of the debate we had last Monday on an amendment we tabled that 
would have deleted paragraphs (a) to (h) in clause 21(1) of the bill. 
I very much wanted to clarify a fundamental difference between 
members of the Bloc Quebecois and other members in this House.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois are sovereignists and we come from 
Quebec. In other words, we support Quebec's sovereignty and are 
opposed to any form of intrusion in its jurisdictions, while seeking 
to expand those jurisdictions until Quebecers decide to have their 
own country.
<P>
	Obviously we do not have the same outlook as the other 
members of this House, who are federalists. When a bill is tabled, 
we do not consider or analyze the bill in the same way the Liberals, 
Reform members and the remaining Conservatives do, who are 
federalists. They still believe in federalism but we do not. They 
believe in intrusion and imposition but we do not.
<P>
	It is only normal that we should see bills like the one we are 
discussing today as potential for encroachment on Quebec's 
jurisdictions, while the other parties do not see it that way.
<P>
	The deep-seated convictions of each and everyone of us mean 
that our points of view are different. We always try to assess the 
short and longer term impact of legislation on the prerogatives of 
the provinces. And when we consider the longer term effects, we 
feel that Bill C-83 will have a negative impact on the prerogatives 
of Quebec and thus on the environment.
<P>
	From our point of view, the environment must be a provincial 
responsibility if we are to protect it, preserve it and, in many cases, 
restore it. We think it is clear the provinces have come a long way 
and today have most of the responsibilities in this area.
<P>
	It is up to them to respond to their people and to pass effective 
legislation and set up programs and projects to preserve the 
environment. Many are already doing so, with good results. 
Quebec has assumed its responsibilities and done its homework. 
Furthermore, Quebec has led the way in a number of areas, 
including environmental assessment.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Looking at the federal side, there is not much to get excited 
about. The environmental effects are very watered down, and 
interest in the environment is not all that high and is a relatively 
recent thing. On the other hand, what is most remarkable about the 
federal government, the Liberal government in particular, is its 
great desire to become the saviour of the environment and to push 
aside the provinces more and more. It does this by riding over them 
roughshod, duplicating legislation, regulations, programs. The 
effects of this desire to interfere and to take over the helm at any 
price are very harmful to both the environment and the economy.
<P>
	Bill C-83 has not escaped this constantly increasing desire by the 
feds to throw their weight around in the environmental area, as in a 
number of others. I wanted to explain this fundamental difference 
between us and the other members of this House because of what 
the hon. member for Davenport said about me last Monday. He 
wondered, and I quote: ``-is it perhaps that the member for 
Laurentides badly needs a psychiatrist to remove her obsession 
with federal-provincial relations, her obsession with seeing under 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16744"> 16744 </A></B>
<P>
every chair a federal  monster, a federal presence which may 
disrupt the quiet life of the people in her riding?''
<P>
	I personally feel that the member for Davenport has defined our 
fears very well. I could not have depicted the federal government as 
well myself. And if he defines himself in that way, then surely the 
definition must be an apt one. Thank you, dear colleague, for that 
revealing definition.
<P>
	You will understand that following such a definition, we will see 
the federal monster not under the chair, as you said, but on the 
chairs in front of us.
<P>
	I am rather in a jocular mood today. I have to be, otherwise I 
would probably have to see a psychiatrist as the hon. member for 
Davenport suggested. As for me, I would never dare to suggest that 
my colleague from Davenport consult his geriatrician because of 
his retarded and old-fashioned ideas. I respect him to much to make 
such a suggestion. Yet, it is obvious that he looks at Bill C-83 with 
the eye of a federalist while I see it as a sovereignist.
<P>
	However, the hon. member goes a bit too far when he accuses us 
of being against the health of Canadians, against the integration of 
environment and economy, against the protection of ecosystems 
and against the prevention of pollution. This is getting close to 
demagoguery and intellectual dishonesty.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, you used the expression 
``intellectual dishonesty''. Perhaps you could consider using words 
that are more appropriate. I wish you would. I a not asking you to 
withdraw but simply to reconsider.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you wish me to 
withdraw that part?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Very well. Thank you.
<P>
	We, sovereignists are as much if not more interested in ecology 
than most Liberal, Reform and Conservative members, the 
federalists in this House. To say that we are against the 
environment, in particular against sustainable development, 
because we do not support bill C-83 is going a bit far.
<P>
	We are the ones who initially proposed the creation of a position 
of environment auditor within the auditor general's office. The 
minister took up the Bloc's idea and introduced the bill.
<P>
	Besides, the auditor general, Denis Desautels, said in committee 
that he was already performing this role and could continue do to so 
if given more resources.
<P>
	This seemed to us the best solution, the most efficient, the least 
expensive and the most logical. But the Liberals went overboard on 
this. They stuck doggedly to the promise they had made in the red 
book and suggested the creation of an independent office of the 
Commissioner of the Environment.
<P>
	They suggested furthermore to renew the mandate of the auditor 
general in this area, even to give him additional resources. In other 
words, the Liberals wanted two independent offices, two auditors 
to perform the same task. What a fine way to manage. The Liberals 
wanted to create expensive and inefficient overlaps within the 
federal machinery itself.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	So, if they are advocating creating duplication in their own 
house, one can certainly understand our reluctance and concern as 
to the commitment of these same people not to interfere in 
provincial jurisdiction. One can imagine the chaos and the 
administrative mess created by two environmental auditors. Such a 
situation would have been intolerable, and detrimental to the 
environment itself.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment-the best we ever had 
according to the member for Davenport, who is very humble since 
he himself has been a Minister of the Environment before-was 
clever enough to follow through. She introduced Bill C-83 at first 
reading stage on April 25. At that time, we were in favour of the 
bill.
<P>
	Later on, in committee, everything changed completely. Eager to 
lay it on, the Liberals suggested amendments that clearly 
demonstrated their annoying tendency to think that environmental 
protection is an exclusive federal role. When these amendments 
were tabled, for that matter, they were in for a bumpy ride, in fact it 
almost degenerated into a farce. At first, the Liberals moved 
amendments and voted on them. Next, relying on a rule rarely 
invoked, they cancelled these same amendments only to move new 
ones and take another vote. I want to point out that no amendment 
moved by the Bloc Quebecois carried.
<P>
	So, the whole amendment stage was marked by confusion and 
turmoil. It seemed that the Liberals themselves could not 
understand each other; they appeared to be torn between publics 
servants and politicians. That resulted in the Liberal amendment 
that modifies the bill by adding section 21.1, from (a) to (h). This 
added clause is what had led us to fear increased federal 
interference in provincial jurisdiction, and that is why we reject 
this bill. Liberals and Reformers are doing their best to convince us 
that this is not the case, but we see things differently.
<P>
	We have been called obsessed, paranoid, we have been told we 
have a phobia against federalism. Fine. We have every right to feel 
that way, considering the environmental record of the federal 
government. We would not want the government to do more when 
it cannot even reach its own objectives in its own jurisdiction.
<P>
	There are examples. The issues dealt with by the Liberals in the 
last two years and more clearly demonstrate that they are far from 
keeping their red  book promises and that the minister, whom the 
member for Davenport has been praising for the last few days, 
failed on all counts. Indeed, criticism levelled by environmentalists 
at the Minister of the Environment, who is so very comptent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16745"> 16745 </A></B>
<P>
according to the member for Davenport, has been getting harsher 
and harsher, lately.
<P>
	Environmentalists, the provinces, experts and reporters are 
forthright in their assessment of the minister's work and action. 
Disappointment is felt everywhere. The minister's abilities are 
regularly called into question. Bill C-83 is itself a telling example 
of the government's weakness. The red book proposed an 
independent auditor. Liberals in the standing committee proposed 
the same. The result is that the minister is meeting them halfway: 
half result, half failure. And now the Liberals are bragging about 
their minister's accomplishments.
<P>
	One would have to be really blind or totally soft in the head to 
congratulate the minister on this issue. The least we can say is that 
the Liberals are a spineless lot.
<P>
	Another issue is endangered and threatened species. If I were a 
Liberal, a federalist, I would find that the minister's position on 
this is very poor, and that her plan of action leaves much to be 
desired. In fact, the member for Davenport himself has tabled a 
private member's bill, Bill C-275, which is aimed at protecting 
species. Is the very competent minister supporting this bill? Why is 
that legislation not part of the government agenda?
<P>
	We, Quebec sovereignists, are very happy with the minister's 
half measures in this area. In Quebec, we are quite capable of 
taking care of our species. But if I were a Liberal, a federalist, I 
would not find that the minister's performance in this area is not 
very good. The greenhouse gas issue? Another issue where the 
minister is incapable of reaching her objectives. The provinces 
seem increasingly to want to distance themselves from the minister 
on this issue. The same holds true for the whole issue of 
harmonization with the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The provinces do not seem to like the minister's 
heavyhandedness, as she is more intent on imposing the federal 
will than harmonizing. That is another failure of the Liberals and 
their very competent minister.
<P>
	As for the CEPA, the Canadian Environment Protection Act, we 
are still waiting for an answer from the minister. She is late, and 
that in spite of the fact the committee clearly asked that she meet 
the deadline. Is the minister really looking after her 
responsibilities? I will let you answer that question. However, to 
ask the question is to answer it.
<P>
	The <I>Irving Whale</I>, MMT, federal BCPs, etc., all these issues 
have something in common. Of course, they fall under the 
responsibility of the environment minister, but mainly they stand 
out as failures or as very sensitive issues whose management can 
only be described as  incompetent and dominated by petty politics. 
Are the members opposite asleep? Are they not aware of all the 
mistakes their minister is making and of her inability to run her 
department? How distinguished Liberal members, true 
environmentalists albeit federalists, unfortunately, can lavish such 
praise on the minister is beyond me.
<P>
	From a sovereignist perspective, Bill C-83, as explained earlier, 
poses a very real threat of federal intrusion into a provincial area of 
jurisdiction. Looking very closely at clause 21.1, one can see this 
clearly.
<P>
	Dealing at first with sustainable development, this clause refers 
further on, through subclauses <I>a</I> to <I>h</I>, to several items that are under 
provincial jurisdiction. True, the Liberals claim that these are 
merely general goals related to sustainable development. We think 
there is more to it than that if you look beyond the words and this 
list of goals. Over the long term, these goals will encourage federal 
departments to intrude upon the jurisdictions of other government 
levels. The fact that a commissioner will measure the performance 
of departments against these goals in their programs or projects 
will be an incentive for them to do more and to get better results, 
even if they overstep their own area of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Thus, under clause 21.1, a department encroaching on an area of 
provincial jurisdiction will get a positive appraisal from the federal 
commissioner. There was certainly nothing else to be expected 
from the Liberal committee members. True to themselves, they 
repeated the same arguments they had put forward when we were 
studying the CEPA, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	Sustainable development, a concept which the Liberals use a 
great deal to crowd out the provinces, is an ideal all societies 
should strive for.
<P>
	Let us be clear. What is at stake here is not the validity of this 
principle, but the way it is implemented.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois not only recognizes the validity of the 
principle, but also the need, not to say the urgent need, to translate 
it into concrete measures.
<P>
	We believe this principle should be implemented by the 
provinces because they have the overriding jurisdiction over the 
environment. It is up to the provinces to promote the conditions 
needed for sustainable development.
<P>
	In a federal system, the principle of sustainable development 
takes on a new dimension, that is respect for jurisdictions and areas 
of authority. Obviously, the squandering of both financial and 
human resources in order to maintain a dual structure, is in no way 
sustainable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16746"> 16746 </A></B>
<P>
	However, clause 21.1 provides for the commissioner to monitor 
the progress of the various departments, by taking into 
consideration criteria which clearly come under areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Clause 21.1<I>(a)</I> deals with the integration of the environment and 
the economy. In fact, this part of the commissioner's mandate can 
turn into subsidy programs for suppliers or targeted purchase 
programs. For example, the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services can set so-called ``environmental'' standards 
for some very specific purchase programs.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Let us say that the department wants to buy 10,000 sheets of 
plywood, but that the award of this contract is subject to some 
sustainable development standards stipulated in the purchase 
program. The commissioner comes in, does his job, examines the 
purchase program and realizes that the program does not meet 
some objectives, such as maintenance of the resource, the wood 
fibre used, or that the process used causes too much pollution.
<P>
	In other words, the environment commissioner assesses the 
purchase program and concludes that the standards do not promote 
sustainable development. In his report, he then urges the 
department to upgrade its criteria.
<P>
	But, in this case involving the purchase of sheets of plywood, the 
whole industry comes under the provincial jurisdiction, thus under 
provincial criteria. What will happen if the federal criteria are not 
compatible with the Quebec criteria? What will industries do in 
such a mess? Who is better able to impose criteria and standards? 
The federal minister, under the guidance of the commissioner, or 
the Quebec minister?
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that the provinces, which already 
have jurisdiction in this matter, are in a better position to manage 
their own affairs, that is, in this case, the forest industry and its 
pollutants.
<P>
	This situation could occur in each and every department. One 
can easily imagine the jurisdictional problems that such situations 
could cause. This kind of back-door underhanded interference is 
unacceptable. I would like to hope that federalists will be bright 
enough to understand this situation and recognize that it is quite 
probable.
<P>
	Other examples show that the federal government has used its 
spending power several times to launch programs or projects in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. In many cases, after a few months, 
the federal government withdrew and let the provinces, especially 
the province of Quebec, foot the bill or assume responsibility for 
cancellation.
<P>
	Item <I>(b)</I> is about protecting the health of Canadians. That makes 
the people on the other side jump and rant on about us, saying that 
the Bloc is against protecting the health of Canadians and 
Canadians being in good shape.
<P>
	What we want is for Quebecers, Ontarians and Albertans to be in 
good health. Health is a matter of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
It incumbent upon the provinces to prevent environmental 
degradation from threatening public health.
<P>
	How far could the federal government go with this clause? It is a 
question the Liberals should answer.
<P>
	Once again, duplication of standards and competition with 
provincial standards are inefficient and costly, for governments as 
well as for businesses and individuals. Again, the federal 
government opens the door to further jurisdictional quarrels.
<P>
	Considering the crystal clear position of provinces on this issue, 
it is difficult to understand the attitude of the federal government. 
This is further proof that the Liberals have completely failed to 
grasp the repeated requests for change made by Canadians and 
Quebecers.
<P>
	Clause 21.1(c) deals with the protection of ecosystems. As 
owners and managers of the land, the provinces have jurisdiction 
over the management of ecosystems. For example, to support this 
role, Quebec has created 17 national parks. It also adopted 
legislative tools to ensure the protection of biodiversity.
<P>
	Provinces that have not done this must take action and meet the 
demands of the international community, which, for example, has 
criticized, in the OECD report, the environmental performance of 
Canada in the protection of ecosystems.
<P>
	Bill C-98, an act respecting the oceans of Canada, is an object of 
concern for the protection of ecosystems. With this bill, the 
minister of Fisheries and Oceans, the saviour of our nation and of 
our turbot, strips the Minister of the Environment of her 
jurisdiction over this area.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	He says that he wants to take full responsibility for the protection 
of ecosystems. We can well imagine the commissioner asking the 
minister of Fisheries to impose standards on a municipal waste 
water treatment plant because it pollutes an ecosystem where 
specific species of fish live. But municipal waste waters fall under 
the exclusive jurisdiction of provinces. Is it not a direct 
interference with provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	Paragraph (<I>d</I>) is about meeting Canada's international 
obligations. The majority of these international commitments were 
made on behalf of the provinces, which are sometimes the last to be 
informed of Canadian positions. That goes to show the contempt in 
which the provinces are held by the federal government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16747"> 16747 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, Canada made serious mistakes by committing to 
reduce greenhouse gases to an extent far  greater than what some of 
the most directly concerned provinces would have accepted. These 
are a few things that make us doubt the will of the federal 
government to respect the provinces. Section 21.1 of Bill C-83 is 
evidence of the contrary.
<P>
	Under the guise of environmental protection objectives, the 
federal government is encroaching further on provinces' 
jurisdictions. I would also like to say a few words about the 
opportunity this bill gives individuals and groups to put pressure 
through petitions. Allow me to be sceptical about the effectiveness 
of these petitions, which will be treated the same way they are 
treated now by the government: they will simply be tabled in the 
House. Obviously petitions do not change anything and do not 
influence anybody, including ministers.
<P>
	As I have said before, lobbyists and ministers go hand in hand 
and petitions are an exercise in futility. It is ridiculous to claim that 
the petition tabling process provided for in Bill C-93 will be a 
formidable weapon for the protection of the environment. The 
minister has not reinvented the wheel with this idea.
<P>
	To conclude my remarks, I will say this: the commissioner of the 
environment must not encourage or even support this offhand 
attitude that characterizes federal interventions as a whole. I would 
like to read to you an excerpt from a document on the impact of 
federalism, published by the Quebec government in August 1995, 
and I quote: ``Quebec's effectiveness and its ability to meet its 
objectives are increasingly hindered by the intransigence shown by 
the federal government in areas such as environmental assessment, 
the inconsistency of its interventions in relation to those of Quebec, 
including the sudden elimination of grant program funding and 
regulatory duplication in the pulp and paper and mining industries, 
the derogatory remarks contained in the report of the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development, and the fact that the federal government is forcing 
the adoption of its strategies in areas that should largely be under 
provincial jurisdiction, such as toxic substances, pollution 
prevention and sustainable development.''
<P>
	The role of the commissioner of the environment is not to 
promote duplication. On the contrary, he should encourage the 
various levels of government to respect each other's areas of 
jurisdiction. By giving so explicitly to the commissioner of the 
environment the mandate to monitor the extent to which 
sustainable development objectives are met, members of the 
committee have unduly politicized the role of the commissioner. 
We hope that, in the medium term, the use he will make of this 
mandate will have no impact on his credibility and his impartiality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, for the first three intervenors 
there will be no questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on 
Bill C-83, which will amend the Auditor General Act.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	Should this bill go on from this House to the other place and be 
given royal assent, Canada will be the proud owner of a brand new 
environmental commissioner, so it is said. The commissioner will 
have all the bells and whistles of the limousine, yet little gas to 
drive the wheels. The hands of the commissioner will be tied to the 
auditor general, who will ultimately have the final say on 
everything the commissioner does.
<P>
	I want to read a promise from the Liberals' red book on page 64:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our second task will be to appoint an Environmental Auditor General, 
reporting directly to Parliament, with powers of investigation similar to the 
powers of the Auditor General.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I want to briefly compare this promise to what is proposed in Bill 
C-83. The red book promises that the environmental auditor 
general would report directly to Parliament. Bill C-83 has the 
commissioner reporting to Parliament through the auditor general 
under his office, which is hardly what one would call direct.
<P>
	Reformers believe that the environment should be protected. We 
believe there is a place for critical review of what the government 
is doing with respect to the protection of the environment. It is our 
wish that this person be objective and independent as well as 
critical. It is also our wish that this person fit within fiscal reality.
<P>
	Some Liberal members across the floor may think I am referring 
to exactly what is in Bill C-83, but I suggest that they read the bill a 
little more closely.
<P>
	The commissioner cannot be an independent figure. In fact the 
commissioner might as well be a clerk of the auditor general. In 
other words, the commissioner is simply a staff member of the 
auditor general's office and subject to the larger pressures and 
priorities of that office.
<P>
	I want to reassure members of the House that Reform is not 
opposed to the internal structure of the bill. We are simply opposed 
to the fact that money is being spent on a lot of status building 
trappings for a person whose job is already performed by the 
auditor general.
<P>
	During the environment committee's clause by clause 
consideration of the bill, the Reform Party proposed that any 
reference to the word ``commissioner'' be dropped and replaced by 
the term ``auditor general''. I was not surprised to see that our 
amendment was voted down. It would be a cardinal sin, would it 
not, for any government member to vote in favour of an opposition 
amendment. We know how the petulant Prime Minister likes to 
punish his members.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16748"> 16748 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe our amendment would have strengthened the bill in 
efficiency as well as cost effectiveness. Allow me to explain that 
point.
<P>
	We all know that the auditor general makes reports on how the 
government is undertaking certain environmental initiatives. Most 
recently, in his 1994 report, the auditor general reported on the 
environmental partners fund and the ice services branch of the 
Atmospheric Environmental Service. In the 1995 report Mr. 
Desautels reported on environmental management systems and 
environmental hazardous wastes. Allow me to briefly go through 
the report on hazardous wastes from the May 1995 report. The 
auditor general cites background information, audit objectives, 
observations and recommendations on the storage and destruction 
of PCBs.
<P>
	It is no secret to Canadians that as a country we have a 
tremendous problem with PCB waste. We have been stockpiling 
the contaminated wastes for years. Now we are trying to get rid of 
it at the lowest possible cost. I read recently that Canadian 
companies hold a total of 127,025 tonnes of PCBs at 3,216 storage 
sites across the country. This number includes 495 federal sites 
containing 5,206 tonnes.
<P>
	This is outrageous. What is even more scandalous is the fact that 
the government continues to do little about it. The minister may 
talk of studies that are being done, but studies are not going to help 
the people of Sydney, Nova Scotia, home of one of Canada's most 
polluted industrial wastelands. The Sydney tar ponds are presently 
contaminated by over 700,000 tonnes of toxic chemicals, including 
PCBs, coal tar, volatile aromatics, acid drainage and raw sewage. 
The minister says that progress is being made. Yet to date less than 
90 tonnes of waste have been incinerated, not even 1 per cent.
<P>
	We are not talking about storage sites holding newspapers or pop 
cans waiting to be recycled. These are sites holding a substance 
banned in Canada in the late 1970s. It is a dangerous toxic site and 
it is harmful to health.
<P>
	In many communities laden with a PCB problem, a steady rise in 
the cancer rate is not uncommon. In fact Sydney is now known as 
Canada's cancer capital, with a rate almost three times the national 
average.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	The auditor general's report on managing hazardous waste 
outlines the role Environment Canada should play in the 
management of PCBs. It states the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Department provides the federal voice at CCME and federal leadership 
in the development and implementation of federal-provincial initiatives to 
regulate the use of PCBs and the storage and destruction of PCB wastes. The 
Department also spearheads the federal part of the national initiative by 
co-ordinating the activities of federal owners of PCBs and providing advice to 
both headquarters and regional levels on the storage, transportation and 
treatment of PCB waste.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In May 1994 the auditor general put forward his report on the 
management of hazardous waste. Now, one year and six months 
later, what has the federal government done to improve the PCB 
problem? Nothing. What is the government going to do? I am open 
to hear all the answers; however, I believe they will perhaps 
maintain the status quo. Again, the status quo really is nothing. I 
doubt that a commissioner will make much difference.
<P>
	The auditor general clearly spelled out for the government that 
PCB sites need to be cleaned up. How much more can I stress the 
point the auditor general made? He did not say it would be simply a 
good idea to clean up the sites. Rather, he stated that it was 
essential in order that the health of Canadians would not be put in 
jeopardy.
<P>
	The government did not respond to the report. Therefore, if the 
government is clearly not acting on the auditor general's reports, I 
want to know what will be so special about the reports that will be 
written by the commissioner that will make the government act. 
Perhaps when we have time for questions and comments some hon. 
members from the government benches will be able to enlighten 
me on how they would be more apt to follow the warnings of the 
commissioner when they do not now follow those of the auditor 
general.
<P>
	Bill C-83 will give us an environmental commissioner, which we 
are told will whip the government into shape with respect to 
environmental issues. That is something the auditor general has 
apparently been trying to do.
<P>
	The bill outlines that the commissioner will have several tasks to 
undertake. One of those tasks is the handling of petitions. A 
resident of Canada will now be able to file a petition concerning an 
environmental matter in the context of sustainable development. 
The commissioner would then forward it to the appropriate 
minister for whom the petition was intended. The recipient 
minister would then be required to acknowledge receipt of the 
petition within 15 days. In addition, that same minister would be 
required to respond to the petition within four months. In the bill it 
notes that the four-month period might be extended by the minister 
if the petitioner and the auditor general were both notified that it 
would not be possible to respond within the allotted four months.
<P>
	What the bill is really saying is that we need legislated 
permission for someone to write a complaint letter. Maybe with 
this new wrinkle the minister might even answer the mail.
<P>
	Another duty of the new commissioner will be to monitor 
whether or not federal departments have met the objectives set out 
in their sustainable development strategies. The bill's amendment 
to section 24 would require that each federal department prepare a 
sustainable development strategy and table it in the House of 
Commons. Departments will have to table their strategies within 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16749"> 16749 </A></B>
<P>
two years of the bill coming into force.  After that, strategies would 
have to be updated every three years.
<P>
	In a nutshell, this will be the job description of the new 
environmental commissioner within the auditor general's office. In 
my opinion, the tasks themselves are reasonable. The monitoring 
of departments in terms of sustainable development makes sense, 
especially when the Ministry of the Environment has failed to do 
its job on this score. The accepting and passing on of petitions is 
good as well. It is essential that constituents know that the petitions 
they file are being reviewed and acted on. However, there is a 
fundamental flaw in the bill. While the bill creates this high profile 
commissioner, it gives the person no independent power. That 
option was rejected by the government.
<P>
	I mentioned that the job description in the bill was reasonable, 
and I believe that monitoring may make a difference. However, 
there is no need to create a commissioner to follow through on 
these objects when the auditor general still has the final say, and his 
officials have been doing the job for some time.
<P>
	I believe that all of the above mentioned responsibilities could 
be taken on by the auditor general and be performed effectively and 
efficiently on a regular basis if he were given the resources. 
However, I can clearly see why the Minister of the Environment 
chose to go the route she did. It makes it look as if the government 
is moving ahead with its environmental responsibilities and 
fulfilling this longstanding promise. I believe we call this window 
dressing.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	We are in a time of fiscal crisis. The deficit is out of control and 
things appear to be getting worse instead of better. We need to be 
tightening our belts instead of loosening them. Government 
departments need to be amalgamated and consolidated to 
streamline services. We need to save money at every turn.
<P>
	The same applies to the issue we are discussing today in the bill. 
While the ideas are reasonable, the process is not. The duties of the 
environmental commissioner should be part of the auditor 
general's regular duties. The auditor general could easily expand 
and juggle his staff to help in the monitoring of government 
departments and the transferring of petitions from constituent to 
minister.
<P>
	Such a small ordinary solution would not make the minister look 
environmentally green among her international cohorts. The 
Liberals overreaching undeliverable promises are now revealed. 
This is exactly the fundamental problem with the thinking of the 
government. Image seems to be everything.
<P>
	Let me inform the Minister of the Environment of what I am 
hearing from my constituents about how governments should run. 
They want government to function without the flare and the 
Cadillac style. They  want a government that is fiscally responsible 
and accountable. They also want an environment minister who puts 
environmental results at the top of the agenda within a fiscally 
responsible framework.
<P>
	The bill creates redundancy. I have never heard where 
redundancy was a synonym for responsibility.
<P>
	In May 1994 the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development tabled a report entitled ``The 
Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development''. 
This was the result of many long hours of hearing witnesses and 
reviewing documentation. I have highlighted some very interesting 
observations, primarily some from the comments made by the 
auditor general, Mr. Desautels. He told the committee that his 
office has for many years ``been carrying out much of what would 
be the main audit responsibilities of an environmental auditor 
general''.
<P>
	The auditor general also stated that the office, referring to the 
current auditor general's office, will ensure that in carrying out its 
responsibilities it makes a positive contribution through audit to 
the protection and improvement of the national and global 
environment.
<P>
	In my reading of the standing committee's report my conclusion 
was that the auditor general also thinks that his office could handle 
the increased responsibility and assume the role of monitoring the 
sustainable development strategies of federal departments.
<P>
	I want the House to hear the six points the auditor general made 
when he appeared before the committee on why his office could 
continue to audit environmental sustainable development issues 
without any commissioner.
<P>
	First, there would be no need for a new bureaucracy as an audit 
infrastructure already exists in the office of the auditor general. It 
would be less costly to the taxpayer as the office already has the 
structure in place to provide appropriate training, carry out 
research, develop methodology and carry out audit work.
<P>
	Second, the independence, objectivity and credibility of the 
office of the auditor general are already established.
<P>
	Third, there would be no confusion or duplication of roles as 
there might be with a new office of the environmental auditor 
general.
<P>
	Fourth, the principles of sustainable development would be 
reinforced in that the environmental issues are audited together 
with economic and social ones.
<P>
	Fifth, one auditor would create less disruption in the 
organization being audited if an additional external audit were also 
at work.
<P>
	Sixth, the auditor general's office through its existing 
relationships with provincial legislative auditors can promote 
concurrent and/or joint federal-provincial audits of 
multi-jurisdictional environmental issues. This could  help to 
overcome some of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16750"> 16750 </A></B>
<P>
problems related to the division of federal and provincial powers 
concerning environmental matters.
<P>
	There is no question that the auditor general could undertake a 
more expansive role. He has said it to members of the standing 
committee. More important, if we were to ask the average person 
on the street we would discover that the vast majority is totally 
opposed to new levels of bureaucracy.
<P>
	My constituents in New Westminster-Burnaby feel there is 
already far too much bureaucracy in government. When they find 
out that the government is passing legislation to add another level, 
my office phone might ring off the hook.
<P>
	I refer to another important statement in the committee's report 
which reflects exactly what the Reform proposed in clause by 
clause consideration in committee:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-it would appear that the Auditor General Act does not need to be amended 
in order for the auditor general, on his own volition, to expand his audit 
activities in the areas of environmental and sustainable development 
auditing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On the other hand, the act will have to be amended if the government wishes 
to make environmental and sustainability auditing a mandatory activity. The 
committee members were of the opinion that the Auditor General Act should be 
amended to this effect.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party believes in sustainable development. We 
believe that through responsible economic development and the 
economic capacity that results, the environment will be sustained 
for all Canadians to enjoy.
<P>
	Let me also say that the Reform Party supports the federal 
government taking leadership in developing a new discipline of 
integrating economics and the environment. However, while we 
support the truest definition of sustainable development we also 
support going about change in the most economical and pragmatic 
way possible.
<P>
	Bill C-83 is definitely not cost effective. The installation of the 
environmental commissioner could cost upwards of $5 million in 
the next few years. We should consider the amount that was spent 
by the auditor general's office in 1993. In this year $4.5 million or 
7.5 per cent of the entire auditor general's budget was spent on 
audits of programs and activities of the federal government.
<P>
	I do not believe that the activities of the commissioner will need 
$5 million to operate. If the auditor general's office were to get just 
a portion of that amount, I am sure it would be able to hire the 
appropriate staff and perform the functions of the commissioner 
very admirably. However, we know it is about prestige and status. 
Prestige will be bought with a huge no cut contract  for some 
so-called superstar and his or her appropriate entourage.
<P>
	I cannot support a bill that does not take economic matters into 
consideration. If the government were serious about doing the right 
thing, it would have accepted Reform's proposal to get rid of the 
aspect of commissioner and hand over the responsibilities to the 
auditor general. Unfortunately such was not the case.
<P>
	The environmental community and the Liberals when in 
opposition wanted a completely independent watchdog of the 
government concerning environmental matters. They saw the 
policy need and the need related to control, lines of accountability 
and the reporting structure. The independent commissioner was to 
have meaningful investigative powers and was intended to 
embarrass and expose laxity, rule breaking and poor administration 
on environmental matters. Now that the Liberals are in government 
the red book's high sounding phrases are only phrases. The bill it 
has now brought forward as a government is much less than what it 
promised.
<P>
	The decision has been made: no independent commissioner or 
environmental auditor general. If we are not to have one, why not 
facilitate the auditor general's office with a little more resources 
and some enhanced legislative mandate and encourage him to get 
on with it? Not the Liberals; they want it both ways.
<P>
	There will be business as usual but the bill also creates a new 
title under auditor general who has a position identified and set out 
with legislative status. With a magic wand we have an 
environmental commissioner. There are great press release 
opportunities, a high profile appointment and international 
advertising for the position. I wonder if the superstar contract will 
be larger than the boss to whom he reports, the auditor general.
<P>
	If we have to spend more on environmental auditing, it should 
give the auditor general some resources and an enhanced mandate. 
It should not try to fool the public into thinking that it has 
something that was promised. The government should do one or 
the other. I can imagine the morale problems these new favoured 
environmental kids will cause in the regular office of the auditor 
general.
<P>
	The bill does not make sense from a public administration point 
of view. The whole exercise as constituted is not likely to be good 
dollar value. The bill tries to take things both ways, but no one is 
fooled. Either we have a real auditor general for the environment or 
we do not.
<P>
	If it is to be a subset and a listed function of the current auditor 
general, let us be forthright about it. The expensive optics game of 
the bill is out of sync with what the country wants and needs. 
Whom are we trying to impress? Is it the public or maybe the 
senior deputy ministers of various ministries of the crown who 
have  failed so far to fulfil their environmental duty under the law?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16751"> 16751 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not buying it and I do not think the public will either. When 
Reformers are the ministers, the auditor general report will be 
regarded and acted on quickly and there will not be any overpaid 
superstar commissioner.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in support of Bill C-83. The Liberal Party red 
book stated that the government would provide national 
environment and economic agendas. We also said that one of our 
priorities would be to appoint an environmental auditor general 
who would report to Parliament directly and would have powers of 
investigation similar to those of the auditor general. Bill C-83 
fulfils this commitment and does even more.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-83 demonstrates that the government is serious about 
environmental and sustainable development, that we are willing to 
change the way government does business, and that government is 
not afraid to be held publicly accountable for what it does or does 
not do.
<P>
	Federal government policies and operations have an impact on 
the decisions of Canadians, on the economy and on the 
environment. It is critical therefore that environmental and 
sustainable development considerations are integrated in 
government decision making. By getting its house in order the 
federal government can actively promote the shift to sustainable 
development throughout Canadian society. This is what Bill C-83 
is all about.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development deserves a large share of the credit for the bill. The 
committee examined the government's red book commitment to 
establish an environmental equivalent to the auditor general. It 
recommended the establishment of a commissioner of environment 
and sustainable development. It provided valuable input at report 
stage when it made several recommendations to improve the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-83 explicitly incorporates environmental and sustainable 
development in the Auditor General Act. It would also give the 
auditor general the explicit legal mandate to include environmental 
effects alongside the traditional considerations of economy, 
effectiveness and efficiency among the considerations he uses to 
determine the observations he will bring to the attention of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	Bill C-83 will also provide the federal government with 
leadership in making the shift to sustainable development. The 
amendments will proactively promote sustainable development 
across all federal departments.
<P>
	Under the act ministers will be required to table in the House 
sustainable development strategies that include their departments' 
activities and plans of action to  further sustainable development. 
Departments will also be required to update their strategies every 
three years and ministers to table updates in the House.
<P>
	Bill C-83 will authorize the auditor general to forward petitions 
on environmental matters from the public to the responsible 
ministers. These ministers must respond within a specified 
timeframe.
<P>
	The amendments I have just mentioned are significant in and of 
themselves but the bill goes much further. It creates a truly 
independent commissioner of environment and sustainable 
development. The commissioner will be established within the 
office of the auditor general. This will strengthen the role of the 
commissioner, ensuring independence and greatly enhancing the 
auditing of the government's environmental performance. The 
office of the auditor general has clout. It is independent from 
government. It is well respected and has solid expertise that can be 
put to use at once.
<P>
	There is another advantage to the innovation. Within the work of 
the auditor general issues of environment and sustainable 
development will be integrated directly with economic 
considerations. This kind of integration is what sustainable 
development is all about.
<P>
	To ensure his independence as an effective critic of government 
the commissioner will be appointed by the auditor general. The 
commissioner will be the auditor general's right hand person, 
helping him perform all his duties in so far as they relate to 
environmental and sustainable development.
<P>
	The commissioner will monitor and report annually to the House 
on any aspects of sustainable development, environmental, 
economic or social, where they merit attention. These issues would 
include the extent to which departments are implementing their 
sustainable development action plans as set out in their strategies; 
the extent to which these action plans are effective and departments 
are achieving their sustainable development objectives; and the 
number, subject matter and status of petitions received by 
ministers.
<P>
	The annual green report of the commissioner will not be the only 
report to the House on the government's sustainable development 
and environmental performance. The auditor general, assisted by 
the commissioner, may also report on environmental matters in his 
traditional reports to the House.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	These amendments are historic and unprecedented. They will 
have far reaching implications for the way the federal government 
does business. They ensure that no matter who the auditor general 
happens to be, environment and sustainable development will have 
a high profile in the work of the office. They will provide 
leadership on sustainable development by proactively promoting 
and operationalizing sustainable development across federal 
departments and across economic sectors  of the country. They will 
hold the government fully accountable to the public for its 
leadership and progress in making the shift to sustainable 
development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16752"> 16752 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has taken a red book commitment and engaged 
Parliament and Canadians in fulfilling it. Contrary to what the Bloc 
member who spoke said, it was a commitment in our red book and 
not one of their ideas.
<P>
	I look forward to Bill C-83 becoming law and to the appointment 
of a strong and independent commissioner.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, It is with great pleasure that I rise to address Bill 
C-83, an Act to amend the Auditor General Act.
<P>
	This bill seeks to achieve five specific objectives:
<P>
	First, to ensure that environmental considerations in the context 
of sustainable development are taken into account in the auditor 
general's reports to the House of Commons.
<P>
	Second, to provide for the appointment-as suggested by the 
Bloc Quebecois-of a Commissioner of the environment and 
sustainable development.
<P>
	Third, to impose requirements for responding to petitions 
received by the auditor general about federal environmental 
matters in the context of sustainable development.
<P>
	Fourth, to provide for monitoring and reporting to the House of 
Commons on the activities of departments and the extent to which 
they have met the objectives and implemented the plans set out in 
their sustainable development strategies, and for reporting to the 
House of Commons on petitions.
<P>
	Fifth, to require that each department's sustainable development 
strategies be prepared and tabled in the House of Commons.
<P>
	From a technical point of view, if this bill is passed, a number of 
measures will have to be taken.
<P>
	First, an adequate definition of what is meant by ``sustainable 
development'' will be necessary.
<P>
	Second, the mandate of the Commissioner of the environment 
and sustainable development will have to be properly defined.
<P>
	Third, we will have to ensure that the process for responding to 
petitions will adequately meet the requirements of the citizens who 
submit these petitions.
<P>
	Finally, we will have to ensure that all departments have 
sustainable development strategies and that they meet the 
objectives set therein. This means that a major structure to monitor 
the activities of all departments will have to be put into place.
<P>
	I said earlier that the first objective of Bill C-83 was to ensure 
that environmental considerations in the context of sustainable 
development are taken into account in the auditor general's reports 
to the House of Commons. In order to achieve this goal, all 
stakeholders must agree on a single definition of what sustainable 
development really means.
<P>
	Bill C-83 includes such a definition; it says that sustainable 
development means ``development that meets the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of future generations to 
meet their own needs''.
<P>
	It is surprising, to say the least, that the Minister of the 
Environment decided to include this definition in the bill to amend 
the Auditor General Act, but that she has not yet included it in the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act itself.
<P>
	In her speech to introduce this bill in the House of Commons on 
September 18, the Minister of the Environment said this: ``[-] one 
of the first departments the office of the commissioner will be 
looking at is my department, the Department of the Environment. 
We welcome the opportunity of independent public review because 
we believe it will accelerate the integration of the two key 
objectives of sustainable development and their integration into the 
economy''.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I hope that, during this review of the department's operations, 
the commissioner will have the opportunity to set the Minister of 
the Environment straight about this, because it would indeed not 
make much sense if the basic respecting the environment in Canada 
was not the first to include a definition of sustainable development.
<P>
	The only possible explanation for this is the minister's inability 
to carry out her responsibilities properly. Several examples come to 
mind. The <I>Irving Whale</I> case is a well-known example, where the 
minister proved to be unable to deal properly with such a major 
issue and such a dramatic one, under the circumstances.
<P>
	In that case, the office of the auditor general would obviously 
have much to do to meet the first objective of this bill.
<P>
	The second thing that Bill C-83 does is provide for the 
appointment of a commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development. To this effect, the duties that the future commissioner 
to the environment and sustainable development is expected to 
perform are described in clauses 22 and 23.
<P>
	The following information can be drawn from reading these 
sections. First, the commissioner in question will report directly to 
the auditor general, assist the auditor general in the performance of 
his duties with respect to the environment and sustainable develop-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16753"> 16753 </A></B>
<P>
ment. For instance, the commissioner will assess the effectiveness 
of  action plans in meeting the objectives set out in departmental 
sustainable development strategies.
<P>
	Second, the commissioner will follow up in the prescribed 
manner any petition received from a resident of Canada about an 
environmental matter in the context of this so-called sustainable 
development.
<P>
	Third, the commissioner will make any examinations and 
inquiries that he deems necessary to monitor the extent to which 
each department has met the objectives set out in its own 
sustainable development strategy.
<P>
	Finally, he will, on behalf of the auditor general, report annually 
to the House of Commons on the extent to which each department 
implemented its sustainable development plan and on anything in 
relation to the environment that he considers should be brought to 
the attention of the House.
<P>
	I think it is important at this juncture to repeat to this House the 
comments made by Auditor General Denis Desautels when he 
appeared before the Environment and Sustainable Development 
Committee on October 3.
<P>
	At that time he said the following-and I shall quote him 
extensively because I think that the Auditor General has put his 
finger right on the fundamental problem in this matter.
<P>
	I shall be quoting from several pages of Mr. Desautels' 
testimony. He said: ``When I last appeared before this Environment 
Committee, I also spoke of the expectations of the interested 
parties concerning what it was agreed at that time to call the 
`auditor general of the environment', as no name had been found at 
that time. The extent of those expectations continues to be of 
concern to me'' he continued. ``I feel that there might be a gap 
between what interested parties such as the environmentalist 
groups want the commissioner to do, or hope that he can do, and 
the reality of the mandate and the available funding. In the coming 
months, it will be important to take care to reduce that gap as much 
as possible. I would, however, like to speak briefly of three areas in 
which such a gap might exist''.
<P>
	``When I came to speak to this Environment Committee in 
March of 1994, I stressed the importance of the office's 
independence and objectivity, which have justified its credibility 
since its creation in 1878''.
<P>
	``I pointed out that the responsibility for issues such as policy 
examination and environmental conflict resolution ought not to be 
a mandate of my office, since this might quickly and seriously 
endanger the long-standing independence, objectivity and 
credibility of the Auditor General''.-I think that we can agree 
with Mr. Desautels on that.
<P>
	``It is generally accepted in Canada that legislative auditors do 
not comment on the justification of policies. They concentrate on 
the application of  policies''-policies defined by others, including 
this House.
<P>
	``I might also add that our contacts with other auditor generals 
throughout the world indicate that the majority of my counterparts 
elsewhere interpret their mandate in the same way. ``The proposed 
amendments to the Auditor General Act contain no provision 
authorizing the office to comment on policy, and we will not do 
so''.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I would like to intervene at this point. We see that the auditor 
general made it clear that he will not be involved in formulating 
policies but in enforcing policies formulated by others.
<P>
	Mr. Desautels continued to discuss his role as ombudsman or 
what that role would be expected to be: ``Similarly, neither the 
proposed amendments nor the current mandate of the office 
provide that the office should play the role of ombudsman. To play 
that role would be costly and might have an adverse effect on the 
credibility of the Auditor General's Office and the commissioner of 
the environment and sustainable development''.
<P>
	He also talked about jurisdictions, saying: ``Finally, the mandate 
of the Auditor General's Office, including the proposed duties of 
the commissioner of the environment and sustainable 
development, is limited to what falls within the purview of the 
federal government. Neither I nor the commissioner have or will 
have the authority to deal with matters that are a provincial or 
municipal responsibility. I think it is important to mention here that 
the mandate and duties of the office, including those of the 
commissioner''-and I underlined what Mr. Desautels said in my 
text- ``cannot be a substitute for firm leadership by the 
government and consistent management and accountability on the 
part of the department. And this applies both to environmental and 
non-environmental programs and activities''.
<P>
	``It will be up to the department's senior management to 
carefully scrutinize programs, and to determine whether they 
achieve their objectives, whether they remain relevant, and also 
whether there are more efficient ways to achieve the same results. 
Such analysis is essential to sound program management and 
proper communication of audit information''.
<P>
	``A Guide to Green Government' published in June this year 
indicates that departments are to report annually on progress made 
on sustainable development in Part III of the Main Estimates. The 
guide also indicates that this regular progress report in the Main 
Estimates will require on-going monitoring and self-evaluation. As 
part of its responsibilities, senior departmental management, will 
have to monitor and evaluate its own progress. This is a 
fundamental managerial responsibility, both in the public and 
private sectors''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16754"> 16754 </A></B>
<P>
	``The results of our work assessing programs indicate how hard 
it is for the government to implement good ways of measuring 
efficiency and to communicate practical information in this 
regard''. 
<P>
	I think Mr. Desautels explains himself here and will indicate the 
thrust of his interpretation of this bill: ``At a time of employee cuts 
and restructuring, I fear the challenge may not been taken up''. The 
auditor general goes on to say: ``In our experience, for departments 
to act positively, they must be given leadership, support and 
direction''. ``I think there may be some expectation that we will be 
the ones to establish reference points or criteria on which to 
measure the government's progress. We would become part of the 
day to day business of the government, and thus the traditional 
independence of the legislative auditor from operations would 
disappear. This could also be seen as a potential conflict of interest, 
because we would have to audit something we had developed''.
<P>
	This is the end of the auditor general's text. I have taken the 
liberty of reading much of it, because it is in fact the response of 
the auditor general to this bill, which establishes his guidelines and 
determines his responsibility. In his opinion, they do not seem to 
correspond to people's expectations, and the auditor general 
himself says in fact: ``I fear the challenge may not be taken up''.
<P>
	In short, the auditor general is telling us he cannot meet 
Parliament's expectations on the monitoring of activities of the 
departments covered by this bill.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	What in fact are these expectations the auditor general refers to? 
During debate at second reading, the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of the Environment said the following, and I quote: 
``Beyond the significant powers of the office, the very existence of 
the office of a commissioner of environment and sustainable 
development sends a powerful signal not only within the 
government itself but beyond the government into the reaches of 
Canadian society. They now know there will be somebody there, a 
monitor, an ombudsman, who will devote his or her duties to the 
environment and sustainable development in making sure the 
government itself practices what it preaches''.
<P>
	The remarks by the parliamentary secretary are somewhat at 
odds with those of the auditor general. This is made even more 
worrisome by the fact that, in the same speech, the hon. member 
for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis goes on to say, ``The key issue here 
is if this commissioner of environment and sustainable 
development will be truly independent and have the necessary 
powers, autonomy, independence to ensure that he or she is listened 
to and that the public feels that through this office it has a voice and 
a say''.
<P>
	The auditor general's own description clearly shows that his role 
depends essentially on the government's real leadership and not on 
his own qualifications.
<P>
	But, as we heard, the auditor general did say that playing the role 
of ombudsman could have a negative impact on the credibility of 
the auditor general's office and of the sustainable environment 
commissioner. During the same debate, the hon. member for 
Davenport had this to say about Bill C-83: ``This is not a minor 
step. It is a remarkable one. It inserts in the mandate of the auditor 
general the importance of monitoring sustainable development 
strategy and implementing the meaning, significance and the 
interpretation of sustainable development. That is no minor feat''.
<P>
	Yet, the auditor general himself went to the trouble of toning 
down this interpretation of the role that will be played by the 
commissioner of the environment and sustainable development. 
The auditor general himself said that the proposed amendments to 
the Auditor General Act contained no provisions allowing the 
auditor general's office to comment on the validity of policies, and 
that they would not do so. That is what Mr. Desautels said.
<P>
	I also want to point out that, in his September 18 speech, the 
member for Davenport said: ``The role and the funding of the 
commissioner must be ensured so that they do not suffer in times of 
budget cuts. I am certain that this matter will be taken into account 
fully''.
<P>
	Let us hope that the reassuring words of the member for 
Davenport, who is surely full of good intentions, will be heard by 
the Treasury Board Secretariat, because the auditor general 
expressed concern in that regard, following his discussions with 
TBS. Mr. Desautels said: ``I want to point out that, in spite of the 
additional resources made necessary by the amendments to the 
Auditor General Act, in 1997-98, the office will have reduced its 
budget by some $7 million per year''. Again, there is a 
contradiction.
<P>
	There is another provision in the bill which should be looked at, 
namely the requirements to be imposed for responding to petitions 
received by the auditor general about federal environmental 
matters in the context of sustainable development. Clause 22 of the 
bill states how these petitions will be dealt with. That clause reads 
as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Where the Auditor General receives a petition in writing from a resident 
of Canada about an environmental matter in the context of sustainable 
development that is the responsibility of a category I department, the Auditor 
General shall make a record of the petition and forward the petition within 
fifteen days after the day on which it is received to the appropriate Minister for 
the department.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Within fifteen days after the day on which the Minister receives the petition from 
the Auditor General, the Minister shall send to the person who made the petition an </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16755"> 16755 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>acknowledgment of  receipt of the petition and shall send a copy of the 
acknowledgment to the Auditor General.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) The Minister shall consider the petition and send to the person who made 
it a reply that responds to it, and shall send a copy of the reply to the Auditor 
General, within</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) one hundred and twenty days after the day on which the Minister receives 
the petition from the Auditor General; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) any longer time, when the Minister personally, within those one hundred 
and twenty days, notifies the person who made the petition that it is not 
possible to reply within those one hundred and twenty days and sends a copy 
of that notification to the Auditor General.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) Where the petition is from more than one person, it is sufficient for the 
Minister to send the acknowledgment and reply, and the notification, if any, to 
one or more of the petitioners rather than to all of them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I would have much more to say on petitions, Madam Speaker, 
but you are signalling that my time is up.
<P>
	To sum up, I would like to say this. We will be voting against this 
bill for very specific reasons, in spite of the fact that we had 
originally requested that a position of commissioner to the 
environment be established.
<P>
	The auditor general tells us that his basic problem is that he does 
not believe that he will be able to fulfil this mandate adequately. He 
also tells us that the government's leadership in this matter is more 
important that his. And so far, on every issue-whether it is the 
<I>Irving Whale</I> or the Berlin agreements on greenhouse effect-the 
Minister of the Environment has failed to show the leadership 
required to allow us to believe with any degree of certainly that the 
commissioner of the environment would have any real power.
<P>
	Third and last, I note also the very clear picture that my 
colleague the hon. member for Laurentides has painted for us in her 
quite accurate analysis of clause 21.1, which does invade areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Brampton-unemployment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, the speakers on this bill from 
here on in will speak pursuant to Standing Order 43(2). In other 
words, they will be sharing their time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
truly delighted to rise to speak in support of Bill C-83, an act to 
amend the Auditor General Act. This act will create for Canada a 
commissioner for the environment and sustainable development.
<P>
	I am particularly delighted in this case because this is a clear 
example of us fulfilling a commitment we made to Canadians in 
the red book, which was the basis of our  election campaign. We 
said then that we would move Canada toward sustainable 
development. This bill is a very concrete step in that direction.
<P>
	In the red book we recognized that there is no separation 
between a national environmental agenda and a national economic 
agenda. Since assuming office we have tried to implement that 
belief wherever possible. We have implemented it in our approach 
to planning and decision making within government. We have tried 
to integrate economic matters, social matters and environmental 
considerations. We understand that all these aspects of sustainable 
development can and must be co-ordinated to give Canadians what 
they want: a prosperous and healthy country in which we, our 
children, and our children's children can work to achieve our 
aspirations.
<P>
	Environmental sustainable development must be an integral part 
of decision making in all federal departments. That means that 
decisions on new policies, programs, regulations, and laws as well 
as decisions on existing ones, must take that into account. It also 
includes decisions on how departments manage their buildings, 
facilities, and operations.
<P>
	Strategies of sustainable development are a key part of Bill 
C-83. These strategies will take sustainable development from a 
concept to a real practice across all federal departments. Each 
minister will be required to table a sustainable development 
strategy for his or her department in this House within two years of 
the coming into force of this legislation.
<P>
	By legal definition, sustainable development strategies must be 
results oriented. Each strategy will include the department's 
objectives and plans of action to obtain those objectives. Every 
minister will in fact become a sustainable development minister.
<P>
	We all now realize that sustainable development is not the sole 
responsibility of the environment minister. It is the responsibility 
of all ministers and indeed of us all as Canadians. As the 
parliamentary secretary said earlier, in an ideal world we would not 
need a Ministry of the Environment to monitor sustainable 
development in Canada because it should be the concern of all of us 
and of all ministries.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	These departmental strategies will also assist the new 
environmental and sustainable development commissioner in 
monitoring and reporting on the government's performance. The 
stated objectives and action plans will serve as meaningful and 
measurable benchmarks against which to assess each department's 
performance in making the shift to sustainable development.
<P>
	Departments are committed to developing their sustainable 
development strategies and establishing their goals and action 
plans in an open manner, working with  all interested parties. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16756"> 16756 </A></B>
<P>
will help to ensure that the departments establish meaningful and 
challenging targets.
<P>
	In June the government released a guide to green government, 
which was endorsed by the Prime Minister and all ministers. The 
guide will assist federal departments and their stakeholders in the 
preparation of their sustainable development strategies.
<P>
	Federal government departments differ in their mandates and in 
their abilities to influence Canada's sustainable development 
prospects. As a result, their strategies will differ, but clearly 
together they must present a coherent and consistent government 
approach to sustainable development.
<P>
	Sustainable development is an evolving concept. Indeed, our 
understanding of sustainable development has evolved 
considerably in the past few years and it will continue to evolve as 
we grasp a further understanding of what it means as we move to 
operationalize it.
<P>
	The guide I mentioned provides core concepts and principles 
underlying sustainable development as a starting point. The 
concepts and principles will likely continue to evolve over time and 
perhaps new concepts and principles will emerge.
<P>
	Bill C-83 requires departments to update their sustainable 
development strategies and requires responsible ministers to table 
the updates in the House every three years. This allows the 
evolving nature of sustainable development and the lessons learned 
from operationalizing it to continually be incorporated into the 
strategies.
<P>
	Another key aspect of Bill C-83 is the appointment of a 
commissioner of the environment and sustainable development 
within the office of the auditor general. The commissioner will 
assist the auditor general in performing general auditing duties. He 
or she will also report annually to the House on any matter 
concerning sustainable development that he or she considers merits 
the attention of the House. The commissioner will not only 
strengthen the work of the office of the auditor general on the 
environment and sustainable development, he or she will also 
enhance the federal government's accountability for its actions or 
its inaction on the environment and sustainable development.
<P>
	We are the first major country to build sustainable development 
into our economy in this way. It is becoming increasingly clear that 
those economies that take environmental costs into account are in 
fact the most efficient of modern economies.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-83 establishes a framework for 
sustainability across all federal departments and enhances the 
government's accountability to the House for its progress on 
sustainable development. We are not afraid of being held 
accountable in this way because we are building a record of 
accomplishments, a record of which we are proud.
<P>
	Bill C-83 will have far reaching implications within the 
government and within our society as a whole. It will move Canada 
forward along the path from talking about sustainability to acting 
sustainably. I look forward to the speedy passage of this important 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-83.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development took on the task of examining the government's 
commitment to establish an environmental equivalent of the 
auditor general. This was in fact a key red book commitment. It is 
an idea that has been discussed and debated for many years. It is 
also an idea the government is making a reality in short order.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The committee heard from many stakeholders representing a 
wide range of interests and opinions. Their testimony provided 
important insights into what must be done for Canada to achieve 
sustainable development.
<P>
	The committee in preparing its report and the government in 
proposing Bill C-83 have paid careful attention to the message of 
stakeholders. The committee submitted its report in May of last 
year and the government responded just over a year ago. Its 
response was aimed at integrating economic, environmental and 
social factors in federal planning and decision making across all 
departments, just what the stakeholders had asked for.
<P>
	Key aspects of that response include the amendments to the 
Auditor General Act with which we are involved today. The 
amendments would provide openness, transparency and leadership 
by government on sustainable development and continued action to 
make sustainable development a real practice throughout the 
federal government. Bill C-83 is central to integrating the 
environmental and sustainable development in government 
planning decisions across all federal government departments.
<P>
	Last year I had the pleasure of being part of the Special Joint 
Committee for the Review of Canada's Foreign Policy. For the first 
time as part of a review of foreign policy one of the areas we 
looked at was sustainable development and the environment. We 
can see more and more these days how much environmental issues 
are international matters.
<P>
	The hon. member for Peace River is here today. He was also a 
part of that review. It was a very interesting process. I was pleased 
that for the first time as a committee we recognized in our report 
that the federal government should include as a major plank of its 
foreign policy the promotion of sustainable development around 
the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16757"> 16757 </A></B>
<P>
	Why is it important for us to make environmental matters and 
sustainable development more of a priority in government? One 
reason is that we live in a world of limited measurable natural 
resources.
<P>
	I asked a friend of mine, a professor of geography in Halifax, if 
we could measure the atmosphere, the amount of air around the 
world. He checked with a friend in a specialized area who was 
more knowledgeable on the particular topic and told me there were 
approximately five quadrillion tonnes of atmosphere around the 
world. That is about one one-millionth of the total mass of the 
earth. Twenty-one per cent of the atmosphere is oxygen.
<P>
	It is measurable and finite which means that it is limited. There 
is not always lots more where that came from. We have to 
recognize therefore that if we can measure it and if we can limit it, 
we can also destroy it. We can damage it. That is a very important 
point to realize in thinking about the environment and the world we 
live in.
<P>
	This is the only planet we know of that will sustain and support 
life. That is an important point too. If we damage this one we do not 
have another one to go to. It is unrealistic to think we can choose 
some other world or that we will have some way to transport 
billions of people to some other planet where we can survive if we 
damage this one.
<P>
	There is a very narrow range of conditions in which life can 
exist, particularly human life. Is it possible for us as human beings 
to actually alter or change the conditions which sustain human life? 
It seems to me the answer to that question is yes. We now have 
solid evidence that we actually have changed the conditions. We 
are having an impact on the conditions.
<P>
	This year 2,000 leading world experts on climate change came to 
the conclusion and agreed, after years of debating it and not being 
ready to agree, that human activity contributes to global warming. 
We are affecting climate change. We are moving in the narrow 
range within which we can actually sustain human life. We should 
be aware of that very important point.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The planet has a limited ability to support human life. 
Researchers at Cornell University in the U.S. determined in a study 
that the earth's biosphere could only produce enough renewable 
resources, food, fresh water and fish, to sustain about two billion 
people at European standards. That is not North American 
standards and we should know the difference. If members know 
much about how Europeans live, they will know they are less 
wasteful of resources. They tend to follow the three <I>r</I>s of reducing, 
reusing and recycling a little more than we do. They have done it 
for quite a while. They have a head start on the three <I>r</I>s that are so 
important for the environment. I hope we can follow their example 
and catch up quickly.
<P>
	Not only in Europe but in North America we have to change our 
practices to try to follow the three <I>r</I>s of reducing our consumption; 
reusing our receptacles for pop, bottles of various kinds and other 
containers; and reducing the amount of packaging of products. 
Often we buy products with a lot more packaging than is required. I 
understand marketing problems but somehow marketers have to 
take into account environmental issues and find ways to market 
with less packaging.
<P>
	The whole issue of sustainable development is a new issue in 
foreign policy and newer one in domestic policy. Today it must be a 
core issue in our domestic as well as foreign policy. Sustainable 
development is about integrating environmental, economic and 
social values into decision making. That is very important for our 
future. If we do not include all three in deciding what will be 
sustainable for us in the future, how we will live in a sustainable 
manner and how we will support social and other programs in a 
sustainable manner, we have big problems. We need to think about 
how much we value the environment, society and the people in it 
and the economy. We must consider all these points and not one at 
the exclusion of others.
<P>
	When thinking of the environment we must think about how 
much are interests are endangered. If we realize that we live in a 
very narrow range of conditions that can support human life and 
that we can actually affect those conditions, change them and move 
them outside that range, we realize our interests are in danger.
<P>
	One great problem for us is to determine how to move toward 
goals of greater employment that are so important and at the same 
time deal with tremendous challenges in the environment. That is a 
major challenge of the next 50 years but I hope we manage to deal 
with it sooner than that.
<P>
	Should we increase our emphasis on sustainable development? 
Clearly the answer is yes. We have done it in foreign policy. We are 
now doing it by creating a role within the auditor general's office 
for a commissioner who will report directly to the auditor general 
and will file a report annually on how the government and all 
departments are doing in environmental matters. It is very 
important to keep the government's feet to the fire on 
environmental matters to make sure it lives up to its 
responsibilities to promote sustainable development in every 
aspect of its activities.
<P>
	I was very pleased to speak on the bill and I urge all members to 
give it speedy passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	A while ago I invoked Standing Order 43(2). It is my 
understanding that the member for Davenport would perhaps like 
to speak slightly more than 10 minutes, if the House has no 
objection, with the understanding that it would conclude the 
speakers on the government side.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16758"> 16758 </A></B>
<P>
	Perhaps he will speak more than 10 minutes. On the other hand 
there will be no other speakers so the effect will be the same, if 
the House agrees.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
debate this afternoon has developed along five major areas of 
discussion as raised by opposition members.
<P>
	The first area is whether the independence of the auditor general 
is in question as a result of the bill. The answer to that question is 
that it is not. The independence of the auditor general is 
maintained, is reinforced and is in full tradition developed by the 
House over the decades.
<P>
	The second area concerns whether the bill adds an additional 
layer of bureaucracy and a cost that is unwarranted. Again the 
answer is no. It is actually a recommendation. As some members of 
the opposition have indicated, the bill reflects the 
recommendations made in committee by several members of the 
opposition to the effect that the measures should be as tight and as 
task oriented as possible with no unnecessary bureaucracy added to 
the existing one.
<P>
	The third area is whether there is intrusion into provincial 
jurisdiction. This concern has been raised by different speakers this 
afternoon. The answer is simply no, there is no intrusion 
envisioned. No passage of the bill can be interpreted as an intrusion 
into provincial jurisdiction. I will elaborate on that later.
<P>
	The fourth area raised deals with whether there is an ombudsman 
role for the proposed commissioner of sustainable development. 
The answer is probably yes for reasons I will elaborate in a 
moment.
<P>
	The final area is whether the bill is in harmony with 
federal-provincial relations. The answer is also a very positive yes.
<P>
	The member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies referred to the 
appearance of the auditor general before the committee. He did us a 
good service because he reminded us of the important and delicate 
role the auditor general has to perform. He has to examine the way 
in which policies are implemented but he does not comment on the 
policy. We fully agree with that interpretation of the role of the 
auditor general, as the hon. member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies has stressed. The bill correctly 
provides for the power to check on the manner in which policies are 
carried out but not on the content of the policies. The distinction is 
extremely important and we all agree on it.
<P>
	What will this commissioner do? The commissioner will 
measure the performance of each federal department's plan. The 
commissioner will seek and request that the plan be updated every 
three years.
<P>
	Who will prepare the plans? It will be the departments 
themselves. Some will prepare advanced plans. Presumably the 
Department of the Environment will want to prove that it is the 
best. Others will produce less ambitious plans. However the role of 
the commissioner will be to measure performance against the plan 
prepared by each federal department.
<P>
	The word federal cannot be underlined a sufficient number of 
times. We are talking here about federal jurisdiction and no other 
jurisdiction. As I said, the plans will be updated every three years 
to improve their quality. We will learn to walk before we are able to 
run.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary was quoted by the member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies as having said in the earlier debate 
that the commissioner would act as an ombudsman. The answer is 
yes. The commissioner will monitor the minister's replies to 
petitions. In that sense the commissioner will perform the role of 
ombudsman. The commissioner will also monitor the extent to 
which departments implement the action plans and departmental 
strategies, as I mentioned before, and report annually to the 
Chamber.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	In that sense alone the commissioner on behalf of the public will 
report to the public through the Chamber; a beautiful role and the 
quintessence of democratic accountability.
<P>
	The member for New Westminster-Burnaby started his 
intervention by saying his party supports the general concept but 
criticizes it because ``this will be money spent on status building 
trappings''.
<P>
	The reality of Bill C-83 is that it is exactly the opposite. This 
commissioner will not be a status building bureaucrat. This 
individual will be the right hand of the auditor general and will 
report to the auditor general. The commissioner will be functioning 
on all matters related to sustainable development within the office 
of the auditor general. Therefore the commissioner will be 
performing in the best sense of the word by doing the most with the 
least possible budgetary requirements. Instead of creating a 
separate office the commissioner will be performing and expanding 
a role which the auditor general has initiated in recent times.
<P>
	When he appeared before our committee the auditor general did 
say that some 7 or 8 per cent of his activities and budgetary 
resources are already devoted to environment and sustainable 
development matters.
<P>
	The commissioner will somehow strengthen, widen and build on 
this role that evidently needs to be given statutory recognition and 
some resources in order to perform a job which the auditor general 
cannot perform with the resources available at the present time.
<P>
	We have somehow come up with a very clever solution that does 
accommodate the desire to keep budgetary  expenses to a minimum 
and at the same time permits us to assume an additional role, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16759"> 16759 </A></B>
<P>
ensuring the federal jurisdiction does implement its commitment to 
the sustainable development goal we all have heard about.
<P>
	Does Bill C-83 add new levels of bureaucracy? The answer is no. 
Is Bill C-83 a cost effective piece of legislation? Most definitely 
yes. Will the commissioner be as independent as he or she should 
be? The answer is yes because the commissioner operates within 
the independent office of the auditor general. Therefore political 
pressures are out of the question.
<P>
	The criticism, which we always take seriously, saying Bill C-83 
tries to add bureaucracy and is costly and politically oriented is not 
founded. Therefore it is important we set the record straight.
<P>
	Then we come to the member for Laurentides, evidently 
preoccupied with federal-provincial relations. I do not know 
whether I could convince her, even if I were to repeat until 
midnight that there is no provincial interference in this bill. 
Evidently we have reached the point at which this argument can no 
longer follow a logical path.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	I assure the hon. member for Laurentides there is no danger of 
interference. There will be neither short term nor long term 
negative effects on Quebec. There is no danger to the environment 
of Quebec.
<P>
	The government does not want to impose itself on provincial 
jurisdiction. The province of Ontario, which has already an 
equivalent commissioner for sustainable development, not only did 
not object to this initiative, it sent its commissioner to appear 
before the committee. She gave the committee good advice.
<P>
	If Ontario does not object, why should Quebec? No other 
province has objected. No other jurisdiction has said anything. I do 
not recall receiving a letter from the Government of Quebec 
objecting to Bill C-83 not only during the debate but since the bill 
was introduced in the House.
<P>
	The hon. member for Laurentides said her party was far more 
concerned with the environment than the Liberal Party. I am glad to 
hear that. If that is the case, I invite the Bloc Quebecois to support 
the bill, a bill to protect the environment. A good member of 
Parliament from the province of Quebec should be glad to see any 
measures which improve the overall quality of the environment 
because, as we know, environmental issues know no boundaries. 
The better the entire North American continent performs in 
economic and environmental matters and in their integration, the 
better will be the health of the entire population. There is 
everything to be gained.
<P>
	With respect to duplications, to my knowledge there is no 
duplication to be afraid of. On the contrary, there can  be a very 
substantial and significant integration between the role of a 
provincial commissioner for sustainable development who 
operates within provincial jurisdiction and the federal 
commissioner.
<P>
	Evidently the hon. member for Laurentides is blind to the fact 
that there is a federal territory. There is the north. Therefore the 
commissioner will be responsible for what happens on federal 
lands. Federal lands are quite extensive north of 60.
<P>
	It is unfortunate both members of the Bloc Quebecois could not 
resist the temptation to launch personal accusations against the 
Minister of the Environment. It has now become a permanent habit. 
I do not want to comment further on the matter except to say what I 
said on Monday, that we have the best environment minister we 
have ever had. She has taken very courageous stands. She is the 
first environment minister who has taken the matter of the <I>Irving 
Whale</I> to heart and begun to do something about it. I do not recall 
an initiative by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois when he was 
Minister of the Environment with the previous Conservative 
government.
<P>
	I found it amusing when the hon. member for Laurentides 
objected to section 21(1). She went over each of the points which 
outlined the purpose of the commissioner. When she reached point 
(d), meeting international obligations, she said the provinces are 
never consulted or told about Canada's commitments. That is not 
true. The provinces are always consulted before the government 
makes an international commitment. Not only that, in almost every 
Canadian delegation travelling to an international gathering there is 
a representative of Quebec or representatives of more than one 
province. In almost every international delegation the member for 
Laurentides will not be able to prove that Quebec is not 
represented.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The amusing part on the point she objected to so much about 
international obligations, which has to do with the question of the 
commitment taken by Canada on carbon dioxide, is that it was her 
leader, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois in 1991 in Bergen, who 
committed Canada to the question of reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions. It was he who did it on behalf of Canada.
<P>
	Today we have this absurdity of the hon. member for Laurentides 
objecting to an initiative taken by her own leader in 1991. What a 
sham.
<P>
	Let us move to point (a) of 21(1). The member for Laurentides 
says the integration of the environment and the economy will work 
against the provincial jurisdiction because of procurement policies. 
This is quite an acrobatic leap of logic, if it can be described that 
way. The integration of the environment and the economy will be 
measured within the performance of that particular department.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16760"> 16760 </A></B>
<P>
	The member for Laurentides was not a member of the 
committee when we wrote that report, that is true, so one cannot 
expect her to know the report well. At least she should know how 
the bill applies in practice. It will be applied within the 
performance of a plan prepared by the department. That plan will 
be submitted to the House of Commons every year for comments. 
To bring in this red herring of procurement policies is an unusual 
feat of imagination.
<P>
	The member for Laurentides also objects to the second principle, 
the one of protecting the health of Canadians. The health of 
Canadians is not just a provincial responsibility. We protect the 
health of Canadians at the border. We protect the health of 
Canadians in interprovincial matters. No one has the monopoly, 
and the role of the provinces is extremely important and 
complements the federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is quite interesting that three weeks ago in Jakarta, Canada 
managed to obtain the acceptance of Montreal as the winning city 
in a competition for the biodiversity commission, a remarkable 
breakthrough in relation to the acceptance and the reputation of 
Canada abroad in matters related to the environment.
<P>
	Time is running out and therefore I am not able to deal with the 
other items that have been objected to by the member for 
Laurentides in sustainable development. I can only confirm that 
from preventing pollution to promoting equity, these are not the 
monopoly of the provinces. These are not the monopoly of the 
federal government. These are broad concepts that can be adopted 
by any level of government for the benefit of the public and for the 
long term benefit of the population, no matter where people live.
<P>
	Let me put on record, since our international reputation was 
criticized earlier, what the OECD said in its report a couple of 
weeks ago. It praised the environmental assessment process. It 
praised the environmental analysis of legislation we carry out from 
time to time. It praised the round tables on the economy and 
environment. Last but not least, it praised the proposed 
commissioner of environment and sustainable development.
<P>
	This bill has made it as far as Paris and it has received the 
support of the international community. It cannot be that bad.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	If the Bloc Quebecois members want to live with their heads in 
the sand and ignore the reality of life in the larger world, that is 
their choice, but it certainly does not project a proactive, open, and 
intelligent aura.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45(6), the division on the question now before the House 
stands deferred until Monday, November 27, at the ordinary hour 
of daily adjournment, at which time the bells to call in the members 
will be sounded for not more than 15 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I believe you 
would find unanimous consent to further defer the said vote until 
Tuesday, November 28, at the conclusion of Government Orders.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, if you were to seek it I believe 
you would find unanimous consent to call it 6.30 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENT">EMPLOYMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
government's foreign policy includes the commitment to create 
jobs for Canadians through international trade.
<P>
	From time to time the government grants export credits to other 
countries in order to promote investment in Canada. This is a very 
aggressive means of creating  Canadian jobs through international 
trade. Such a bold policy must be carefully monitored.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16761"> 16761 </A></B>
<P>
	As Edmund Burke once wrote, ``It is the nature of all greatness 
not to be exact, and great trade will always be attended with 
considerable abuses''. It is the role of government to identify and 
minimize these abuses. My purpose today is to identify one aspect 
in the administration of Canada's trade policy that has led to the 
loss of many valuable Canadian jobs.
<P>
	Through the Government of Canada Canadian taxpayers gave an 
export credit in the order of $200 million to Guangdong province 
during a visit by a delegation to Ottawa in April 1993. In November 
of 1994 Nortel announced that it had finalized an agreement with 
Guangdong province to manufacture and install switching 
equipment in China. The value of the contract was $200 million. 
The impact of this agreement was swift and devastating. In March 
of this year Nortel announced that it was laying off 580 Canadians 
at its Brampton plant, which brings the total number of jobs lost 
since 1994 at that plant alone to 1,300. At the same time, Nortel 
announced it would add 3,000 manufacturing jobs to its plant in 
Guangdong province over the next three years.
<P>
	I want to be clear that my quarrel is not with Nortel. Although I 
am not at all happy that 1,300 jobs have been lost in my riding, I 
recognize that Nortel's concern is ultimately the bottom line. Its 
present circumstance confirms it is reacting to market conditions, 
as Canadian sales have declined while export sales have increased 
dramatically.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	A recent issue of ``Report on Business'' described the countless 
hours Nortel invested in winning this contract. Even the first 
challenge faced by Nortel was a difficult one.
<P>
	After signing a memorandum of understanding in December 
1992, Chinese officials became upset that Canadian 
parliamentarians were expressing their concerns about human 
rights violations by the Chinese government. Chinese officials 
threatened to walk away from further negotiations. Nortel 
responded by telling Chinese officials that they were with Nortel 
U.S., not Nortel Canada. Having distanced themselves from 
Canadian parliamentarians, Nortel finalized this deal a little less 
than two years later.
<P>
	This is a valuable case study for parliamentarians. It clearly 
demonstrates that export credits must be accompanied by 
assurances that jobs are created in Canada rather than in low wage 
economies. The focus of job creation through international trade 
must remain fixed on Canada. The government must move swiftly 
to ensure strong Canadian labour content in export assistance 
programs. A strong first step would be to  reverse the recent 
reduction in the Export Development Corporation's Canadian 
labour content requirements.
<P>
	We made a commitment to Canadians that we will promote job 
creation through international trade. This is a commitment we must 
keep.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> The 
Canadian telecommunication equipment industry is one of the 
shining stars in Canada's high technology galaxy. It accounts for 21 
per cent of business enterprise research and development 
undertaken in Canada and is a major employer of university 
scientific technology graduates. It is a major earner of export 
revenues. Typically, the small to medium sized enterprises in this 
business export 90 per cent of their products.
<P>
	World wide, the industry is dominated by a small number of very 
large corporations that were established on the basis of serving 
national or regional markets. With the fundamental changes that 
are taking place in the provision of communications services world 
wide, the equipment industry is undergoing massive changes of 
globalization and restructuring. Canada is fortunate that one of 
these developing global players is based in Canada and maintains 
its headquarters and large portions of its research and development 
and manufacturing here. A consequence of these benefits is 
constant restructuring.
<P>
	I am certainly sympathetic with the plight of the workers being 
displaced by Northern Telecom's decision to transfer 
manufacturing out of its Bramalea facility and convert it into the 
corporate world headquarters. I know the important role these 
workers played in building the product that was responsible in large 
part for the modernization of the Canadian telecom infrastructure 
and for taking Canada's reputation as a source of quality advanced 
telecom equipment around the world. I wish them the best as they 
adjust to their new circumstances. I am pleased that much of the 
work done in Bramalea is staying in Canada and that job growth is 
continuing in other areas of the industry.
<P>
	Sustained success in this business for Northern Telecom and for 
other firms that comprise the Canadian telecom equipment industry 
is through access to foreign markets. It is important that we in 
Canada provide a competitive environment from which to supply 
the world market.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), a motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have 
been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until
