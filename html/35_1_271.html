SOUTHWEST-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I am now prepared to make a ruling 
on the admissibility of the amendment, moved last Wednesday, 
November 29, by the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, to 
government business Motion No. 26 relating to Quebec as a 
distinct society.
<P>
	I have reviewed the interventions of the chief government whip, 
the chief opposition whip and the hon. member for Calgary West, 
and I would like to thank them for their helpful comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bourinot's <I>Parliamentary Procedure and Practice in the 
Dominion of Canada</I>, fourth edition, at page 321 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is an imperative rule that every amendment must be relevant to the question 
on which the amendment has been proposed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This idea is also repeated as citation 568 in Beauchesne's sixth 
edition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<I>Beauchesne</I> also notes in citation 567 that
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>567.-the object of an amendment may be-to modify a question in such a 
way as to increase its acceptability-</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his presentation the chief government whip quoted citation 
579 of the same work, arguing that the proposed amendment would 
introduce a foreign proposition and would raise a new question 
which could only be considered as a distinct motion after proper 
notice. He also referred to the 1923 and 1970 Speaker's rulings on 
which this citation is based. I have reviewed these decisions, and 
while it is indisputable that these are accurate references, they are 
not germane to the case now before us.
<P>
	The Chair has reviewed the terms of the main motion and has 
taken into account the nature of its wording. The wording of the 
proposed amendment is linked directly to the text of the main 
motion and touches on various concepts found therein. It appears to 
the Chair that the proposed amendment does not stray beyond the 
scope of the main motion but rather aims to further refine its 
meaning and intent.
<P>
	Thus the Chair is of the opinion that the requirements for 
amendments outlined in Beauchesne's citations 567 and 568 have 
been met.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I therefore rule that the amendment is procedurally acceptable 
and will be proposed by the Chair when next this government order 
is called.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17198"> 17198 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for choosing to reform 
unemployment insurance in a way that maintains overlap and duplication in the 
manpower sector and thus prevents the government of Quebec from adopting a 
true manpower development policy of its own.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	-She said: Mr. Speaker, I am proud to present this motion here 
this morning. I would like to read to the House a motion that was 
adopted yesterday by the Quebec National Assembly: Yeas, 96; 
Nays, 0; Abstentions, 0; it was therefore unanimous, with the 
clearest possible consensus.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the National Assembly reaffirm the consensus expressed in this House 
on December 13, 1990, on the occasion of the ministerial statement on 
manpower adjustment and occupational training, to the effect that Quebec must 
have sole responsibility for policies pertaining to manpower adjustment and 
occupational training within its borders and patriate accordingly the funding 
allocated by the federal government to these programs in Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Within the current constitutional framework and in order to improve services 
to customers, Quebec must take over the control and management of various 
services pertaining to employment and manpower development and all 
programs that may be funded through the Unemployment Insurance Fund 
within Quebec's borders, and must therefore receive the funding appropriate to 
such responsibilities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The motion adopted unanimously by the Quebec National 
Assembly goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government of Quebec and representatives of business, labour and the 
co-operative sector agree to oppose any initiative by the federal government 
that would constitute an invasion of Quebec's prerogatives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, it asks the government and the Minister of Employment to 
immediately undertake formal discussions with the federal government in order 
to ensure the respect of the consensus and the promotion of the interests of the 
Quebec people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Especially after the referendum vote on October 30, it is 
important for the government to be aware of this consensus and 
realize it cannot be satisfied with the guidelines in this new bill, 
Bill C-111, in part II under the heading ``Employment Benefits and 
National Employment Service''.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	In fact, throughout part III, what predominates is not Quebec's 
right to control, develop and take responsibility for its manpower 
policy but a renewed affirmation of the central government's 
primacy in this area over which Quebec has jurisdiction. All the 
federal government's noises about being prepared to negotiate and 
being open to suggestions cannot obscure a very important side to 
this question. Today, money collected from Quebec workers and 
businesses in the form of unemployment insurance premiums goes 
to and is controlled by the federal government.
<P>
	The federal government determines under what conditions it 
would be prepared to agree that the  government or, as 
appropriate-and this is something we will find in another bill we 
will discuss later on- agencies, individuals or any other intervenor 
the government may consider would be called on to implement the 
measures provided in the bill.
<P>
	Primarily for the sake of efficiency and also from a cultural 
standpoint, Quebec insists on being in charge of implementing this 
manpower policy, on being the only one in control and in charge of 
this policy. Culture is basically a demonstration of differences. And 
we know that as far as the implementation of manpower policy is 
concerned, countries have different ways of doing things, different 
objectives and different priorities. In Quebec, we do not proceed 
the same way they do in France, Japan, the United States and the 
rest of Canada.
<P>
	We have this consensus in the National Assembly which was 
expressed in the past and confirmed again yesterday, so it is a 
matter of efficiency and our own culture. Why efficiency? So we 
can stop this endless bickering which prevents us from improving 
the circumstances of ordinary people whose needs are tremendous, 
with the unemployment rate still around 11 per cent. Of course, the 
unemployment rate only indicates how many people want to enter 
the labour market. It does not consider all those people who are 
discouraged, who are on welfare or are trapped somewhere without 
benefits of any kind and have become discouraged.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Given the rate of unemployment and Quebec's need for a strong 
and vigorous economy, it is not only unacceptable, it is downright 
intolerable that this issue of control over manpower is once again 
caught in a tug of war, which prevents ordinary folks-women, 
men, young people, seasonal workers-anyone with needs, from 
getting the most out of the services they are entitled to.
<P>
	This is why, for reasons of efficiency relating to our culture, that 
the official opposition has tabled this motion this morning, which it 
will speak to throughout the day.
<P>
	The government has to realize the extent of the need of those it is 
penalizing by insisting on running the show. These people need 
jobs, help and a strategy. They cannot live with a system full of 
holes, a system that is in fact not one, but two. It is a useless 
system, because two governments are competing within it: one is 
on its own turf and the other is endlessly butting in. It has 
broadened the meaning of the constitutional amendment on 
unemployment insurance and, once again, with employees and 
employers' money, it is pushing aside the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada said, in the final days before the 
referendum, that he would do everything to keep Canada united. 
Now, in an area where consensus is so strong and less than a month 
after October 30, the government introduces a bill that ignores the 
unanimous  will of Quebecers. The government is acquiring the 
means to prevent Quebec from doing what it considers appropriate. 
It is giving itself the wherewithal to control. Worse, if, at the end of 
negotiations, Quebec, with the knife to its throat, refuses to bow to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17199"> 17199 </A></B>
<P>
the dictates of the federal government, Quebec will be unable to do 
what it wants.
<P>
	I am sorry the minister finds this funny; he could say he was 
open, but he has not managed to call even a single meeting of 
ministers of manpower and employment in the time he has been in 
office. He has not been and still is not known for his flexibility.
<P>
	It is hard to avoid feeling worried and discouraged in the face of 
a text such as this, regardless of the minister proposing it, because 
it is absurd to find ourselves once again in this endless twisting and 
turning at the expense of the ordinary folk.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Subclause 61(2), which deals with training, stipulates that the 
central government, through the commission, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-may not provide any financial assistance in a province in support of 
employment benefits mentioned in paragraph 59(<I>e</I>) without the agreement of 
the government of the province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	But paragraph 59(<I>e</I>) reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>59. The commission may establish employment benefits to enable insured 
participants to obtain employment, including benefits to:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>e</I>) help them obtain skills for employment, ranging from basic to advanced 
skills.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is important to have a good understanding of this provision. It 
means that, this time, with respect to the so-called employment 
benefits the government wants to introduce, it can, in case of a 
misunderstanding, proceed on its own by giving the commission 
the required mandate. In this specific case, however, it goes so far 
as to say that if the province-Quebec, in this instance-disagrees, 
it will not give anything. Great.
<P>
	It would make people responsible for Quebec's refusal to 
relinquish its jurisdiction. The last time we saw this was when 
Maurice Duplessis was in office.
<P>
	These provisions are extremely disturbing and do not appear to 
portend successful negotiations, far from it.
<P>
	These measures, which are supposed to help workers, are in fact 
modelled after other measures already in effect in Quebec to help 
welfare recipients improve their lot and find jobs they can keep. 
These measures already exist in one version or another. Except 
that, in this case, the federal government-that is the beauty of 
it-is set to introduce similar initiatives that will create an 
inextricable web of overlap and duplication so that two individuals 
in the same business could each receive a different kind of income 
supplement: welfare in one case and job benefits in the other.
<P>
	This kind of chaos is unacceptable. Co-ordination is needed. We 
must see to it that workers and people looking for jobs benefit from 
a real labour policy. The only way such a policy can become a 
reality is if Quebec has control over all these measures.
<P>
	This bill was expected. The minister had said that it would make 
people change their attitudes and that it would really help, as the 
ambitious title ``employment insurance'' shows. Yet, I cannot help 
but point out that the $800 million that will be spent on these 
measures will in fact only be spread over five years, another $200 
million for all of Canada, because measures are already in place 
whose effectiveness needs to be reviewed but whose total cost is $4 
billion, with the difference that only $1.9 billion comes from 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	How much will that make by the year 2001, when this reform is 
complete? Some $4.2 billion, or a mere $200 million more, with 
this difference however, and a crucial difference, that an additional 
$800 million will be paid out of the UI fund then while, as a result 
of the general tax currently levied to cover the cost of most of these 
measures, $600 million less will come out of the consolidated 
revenue fund.
<P>
	This whole operation that had raised hopes results in $200 
million in fresh money, but also and again, for Quebec in particular, 
in the imposition of measures causing duplication and overlap, 
jamming the labour market and preventing Quebec from putting in 
place an urgently needed manpower policy.
<P>
	I hope that, even though he laughed earlier, the minister will 
understand that the consensus in Quebec calls for the government, 
as a modern constitutional system, to recognize Quebec's 
jurisdiction and to accept that Quebec should have sole 
responsibility over this manpower policy for ordinary people and, 
therefore, that the allocated funds made up of money coming from 
businesses and workers should be transferred to Quebec to 
administer according to its own needs and priorities.
<P>
	I repeat, this must be done not only with the consent of the 
parties, but also that of business, labour, the co-operative 
movement, community groups, which may have been more active 
in Quebec than elsewhere, perhaps because Quebec was seriously 
hit by the 1982-83 recession. But this consensus is the best 
guarantee of what could be the Quebec model, in which we will be 
able to use our resources, our scarce financial resources, to help 
ordinary people whose individual well-being is in great need of 
improvement.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that our plea be heard in the interest of the 
people, because the government has no right to stubbornly keep 
preventing Quebec from fully playing its role like this.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome the opportunity to ask some questions and make some 
comments on the speech of the hon. member for Mercier. As 
always, she takes a very pessimistic outlook on this legislation.
<P>
	For the record, Canadians from coast to coast to coast 
participated in what was perhaps the most extensive consultation 
process in Canadian history. Over 100,000 people participated. The 
hon. member for Mercier was a very active member of the human 
resources development committee that was looking at the 
modernization and restructuring of Canada's social security 
system. The hon. member heard what I heard. She heard what the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister heard.
<P>
	What Canadians were saying was that they wanted an 
unemployment insurance system, a social security system that 
would help the most vulnerable in our society, that would help 
Canadians find jobs and keep their jobs and to do that in a 
sustainable fashion. They realized the skyrocketing costs of 
unemployment insurance from $8 billion in 1982 to $20 billion in 
1992. They realized the distortions which exist in the marketplace 
where 38 per cent of benefits are directed to 14 per cent of the firms 
and represent 12 per cent of the people. They realized that all these 
things needed to be changed because the status quo simply was not 
serving the people it was supposed to serve.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Throughout this process we engaged Canadians in a serious 
debate about the issues. If we look at the objectives and clearly 
analyse the EI bill which was tabled, we find that those objectives 
are met. The hon. member said that this is a regressive piece of 
legislation. She should rethink, re-read and re-analyse what is in 
the legislation.
<P>
	The hon. member does not talk about the progressive measures 
found in the legislation. Over 500,000 Canadians who were 
excluded and marginalized by the Unemployment Insurance Act 
will now be covered by the legislation. Part time workers count. 
Every hour, every dollar, every effort which they make will be 
rewarded under the legislation.
<P>
	The hon. member did not talk about the family income 
supplement which will allow people to receive up to 80 per cent of 
their average earnings. The hon. member did not talk about that 
because it is too positive to mention. She did not talk about the 
people who are included in the legislation. She did not talk about 
the fact that low income Canadians will be able to earn $50 without 
being penalized or taxed back. She did not talk about the fact that 
by reducing premium rates for business, job creation will be 
enhanced. Employees will be helped because they too will 
participate in the employment insurance fund.
<P>
	The hon. member tried to depict the federal government as a 
government which imposes its rules and regulations upon the 
provinces. That is not the case. The legislation is quite open. It says 
that the federal government will negotiate with the provinces on 
wage supplements, top ups, self-employment assistance, skills and 
loans. It will also work together with the provinces on job corps 
partnerships.
<P>
	Why is the hon. member continuing, like every member of the 
Bloc, this misinformation campaign? They are trying to confuse 
Canadians. Canadians know that the employment insurance 
program which was introduced speaks to the number one issue 
facing Canadians, and that is job creation. Over 100,000 jobs will 
be created directly as a result of measures taken by the bill.
<P>
	I am quite surprised. The hon. member knows that the province 
of Quebec has historically benefited from the unemployment 
insurance program and it will continue to do so under the 
employment insurance program. She also knows that she will 
benefit from the $300 million transition fund in high 
unemployment areas.
<P>
	I have a simple question for the hon. member: Why does the 
Bloc Quebecois continue this misinformation campaign? Why does 
it not tell the real story to Canadians?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the hon. 
member did not address the motion because, given its wording, he 
could only have agreed with me. We will discuss the overall UI 
reform project when we debate the UI bill.
<P>
	The motion before the House this morning provides that Quebec 
should control manpower policy. The hon. member remained silent 
on that issue, because he knows that I am right. What is really 
important is to ensure that the unemployed have the best guarantees 
to get help to find decent jobs.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Let me digress for a moment to say that, yes, I did participate in 
the consultation exercise. Canadians from everywhere told us that 
the real issue was jobs, not employability. And in order to create 
jobs, it is essential to have a co-ordinated manpower policy.
<P>
	This is why this motion deals with manpower policy. In that 
regard, and regardless of the October 30 results, the National 
Assembly was unanimous in demanding, yesterday, that Quebec 
have control over the manpower sector, and that the central 
government leave that field of jurisdiction and stop interfering in it. 
The vote was unanimous: 96 to 0, with no abstentions. Moreover, 
that unanimity also exists among businesses, unions, co-ops and 
community groups.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17201"> 17201 </A></B>
<P>
	I would have liked the parliamentary secretary to comment on 
our motion. I can only conclude, with some pleasure, that if he 
did not do it, it is because he would have had to say, assuming 
he is in favour of an efficient manpower policy in Quebec: ``Yes, 
you are right. The central government should get out of that 
sector''.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary said that Quebec benefited from the 
UI program. The fact is that Quebec and the Maritimes were the 
ones that bore the brunt of the 1994 reform. The same is true again 
with this reform. Indeed, by the year 2001, Quebec alone will have 
to deal with an annual shortfall of $735 million, in addition to a 
reduction of over $640 million in UI benefits.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for finally agreeing with me that the 
central government had to leave that sector.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a few brief questions for my colleague from 
Mercier.
<P>
	It becomes very obvious to me as I listen to Bloc members that 
they are only interested in Quebec. Because of that I question the 
fact that they should even be the official opposition in this matter, 
but that is simply an aside. We have to take into account the 
concerns of all Canadians. I have a very difficult time seeing how 
the concerns she has expressed differ in any way from the concerns 
all Canadians have. Therefore, I cannot support this motion as it 
presently stands.
<P>
	We all want jobs. She states that Quebec wants a vibrant 
economy and jobs. Is that not true for all of Canada? Should we not 
be moving toward a policy that addresses this across the nation? 
She says there is a culture in Quebec. Do we not have a culture in 
the rest of Canada? Yes we do. That also has to be taken into 
account.
<P>
	Why is Quebec asking only for control over the educational 
aspects of this and not control over the rest of the program? I 
cannot understand why Bloc members are only picking and 
choosing some of the things they want. I find that very difficult to 
understand. Perhaps the member can clarify for me her party's 
position on this.
<P>
	I realize that education is a provincial matter. I agree with the 
member that the provinces should be looking after the training 
programs because those are truly educational aspects of the 
program. If that is the case, why not reduce the premiums to the 
point where they do not include the educational aspect? The 
government has admitted that by reducing the premiums a lot of 
jobs would be created. Why is the member not working on that 
aspect of reducing the premiums and letting the Government of 
Quebec tax its own people for the educational aspects of this 
program?
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I shall be brief. First of all, I would 
like to tell my hon. colleague that yes, Canada does have a culture. 
What I am saying is that we ought to organize along cultural lines, 
since the economy, the organization of manpower policy, are linked 
to culture, after all.
<P>
	The Quebec National Assembly's demand-I could provide a 
Translation of it, but I imagine the interpreter will deal with it 
now-goes beyond the educational aspect. It is stated, and it has 
been adopted unanimously, that Quebec must take over the control 
and management of various services pertaining to employment and 
manpower development and all programs that may be funded 
through the unemployment insurance fund within Quebec's 
borders.
<P>
	It is, therefore, a matter of jurisdiction and of encroachment, but 
for the sake of efficiency. We want to have control over overall 
co-ordination because we can see the inefficiency of the present 
system and the great needs. Now he is accusing me of not speaking 
for all of Canada. Let me tell you, if anybody has travelled across 
Canada and given voice to the needs I saw everywhere, it is I.
<P>
	Except that this morning, with the National Assembly 
resolution, I felt it extremely important to state that these demands 
have unanimous support in Quebec. I am, however, aware that 
debates need to be held in Canada on centralization and 
decentralization. Knowing that I am not able to answer for 
Canadians on this, I wish for a debate. I think one is necessary.
<P>
	But the debate is over with in Quebec; this is the consensus of 
Quebec, the consensus of a variety of groups, unions, businesses, 
community groups, and so on; it is true for the province as whole, it 
is true for the regions. So now we wonder what are they waiting for 
before giving us back the tools needed for results, instead of 
continuing along with this unproductive duplication and overlap.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part 
in the debate in the House of Commons on the motion, particularly 
since the hon. member for Mercier could be nominated for the 
Quebec prize for literature, the Prix Athanase-David. Her speech is 
a great example of fiction writing, and I trust that all of her 
colleagues in this House will support her nomination after hearing 
it. This is an excellent example of the Bloc's talent for writing 
complete and utter fantasy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17202"> 17202 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When we read the Bloc motion, we wonder where its members 
have been. Like Rip Van Winkle, they have  been asleep for the last 
while. They neither take into account the statement made by the 
Prime Minister, which says very clearly that we will be prepared 
and in fact will welcome the opportunity to give full responsibility 
for education and training to the provinces.
<P>
	The tabling last Friday of the legislation for employment 
insurance clearly indicates once again that the area of education 
and training is the jurisdiction of the provinces. Furthermore, we 
would go beyond that and take in those areas of direct employment 
activity that are within our constitutional orbit and share with the 
provinces, sit down and work in concert with the provinces, plan 
with the provinces, co-operate with the provinces for one reason: to 
develop a partnership for employment.
<P>
	Yet the Bloc members bring in a motion that totally and 
completely misses the point. They are saying that somehow there 
will be more intrusion, more activity, and no withdrawal. It seems 
to me that this group simply cannot take yes for an answer. When 
we say we are going to do exactly what is being proposed, they 
seem oblivious, unable to filter it out. That only confirms my 
suspicion that all the speeches, all the motions, and all the 
commentaries were written before we even got around to making 
good on the initiative of the Prime Minister or tabling legislation. 
They just pulled it out of the old vault, took out the old speeches 
from the old drawers, put a new date on it, and presented it once 
again without taking a look at reality or the facts or the hopeful 
signs.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	With the initiative we announced on Friday I believe we can 
begin developing a whole new set of relationships with provinces, 
communities, and individuals directed toward the creation of jobs 
and employment in this country. It is the beginning of a new 
dialogue about how we can come together and form arrangements 
so we can share responsibility. If people are unemployed they do 
not care whether it is a provincial or a federal jurisdiction, they 
simply want a job. That is what it is all about.
<P>
	As I listened to the hon. member for Mercier carefully, what was 
beginning to creep into the language was that she was far more 
concerned about transferring power to bureaucrats in provincial 
capitals than putting money directly into the hands of individuals 
so they can get back to work. That is the real issue. It is power that 
is at the heart of this motion, not employment. It is the opportunity 
to control and manage, not to provide a new form of empowerment 
for individuals. That is what the debate is really about. It is really 
oldspeak government. It is really setting the clock back.
<P>
	When Canadians, in whatever region, are looking for 
government to provide new leadership, new formulas, new 
methods, we have an opposition party that is retreating back into 
the romantic past, trying once again  to dig up the old speeches that 
were written 30 or 40 years ago and not dealing with the difficult 
new realities in a world where work has changed.
<P>
	The major modernization of the insurance system of Canada for 
employment is pegged on one important reality: the world of work 
is changing and we must keep up and be relevant to that world of 
work. That is why the measures we have introduced state that the 
clear responsibility that was given by the provinces to the federal 
government in 1941 to be responsible for the basic insurance 
program for Canadians dealing with unemployment had to be 
modernized. I will be the first to say that throughout the years it has 
been a good program. It has provided an enormous bridge of 
support for generation after generation of Canadians who have 
faced unemployment.
<P>
	We should take some real pride in the fact that the federal 
government has been able to ensure not only security for the 
individual but security for the regions. Areas where there was 
wealth, growth, and jobs were able to share with those who were 
less advantaged. That has been the genius of the program. It was 
built on sharing, something our hon. friends opposite forget about. 
Sharing is not part of their vocabulary. Co-operation is not part of 
their vocabulary, the notion that somehow they can have a national 
system of insurance that enables Canadians to distribute support 
and security because we all mutually benefit from it. It is not a 
matter of charity but of good investment. We must make sure we 
can support the various measures in areas where they are faced with 
high unemployment so that those areas with lower unemployment 
do not have to bear the full burden in a geographic way.
<P>
	This plan has worked for most of its years, but it is changing 
because Canada is changing. What we have been discovering in the 
last decade or so is that the original architecture was no longer 
sufficient to meet a world where the work has changed, a world 
where we now have hundreds of thousands of part time workers, 
where there are multiple job owners who were not being given any 
protection, where individuals were facing much tougher problems 
of adjustment when jobs or skills changed.
<P>
	There is one thing that is clear from every single analysis and 
study that has been done internationally and nationally: the higher 
the level of literacy, skill and education, the better the chance for a 
job. There are lots of anecdotes and examples of people with good 
degrees who cannot find work. That is one reason we have 
introduced the youth internship program, which enables young 
people to move from school to work in an easier fashion through 
industry support and small business.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17203"> 17203 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	We know we have to invest in those areas. We also know that 
increasingly people need to get re-employment much quicker and 
faster than they do now and that there are useful tested means of 
achieving that.
<P>
	We spent the last two years working on various projects using 
wage supplements where the small business community that wants 
to hire a new worker but does not have quite the cash flow or is 
concerned it will not get full productivity or full learning in the first 
six or eight months is reluctant to make that commitment. Wage 
supplements open the door. We have seen in place after place that 
we have 70 per cent to 80 per cent improvement in job retention as 
a result of that measure and that we can extend work by 14 or 15 
weeks. This is what is important, that we add about $4,000 to 
$5,000 additional income.
<P>
	In talking about the employment insurance program, people get 
tied down talking about their benefits. What we have to talk about 
is their income. How do we improve people's income? The best 
way to improve income is by employment. That is the best way of 
doing it. If people simply rely year after year on a benefit program 
they begin to lose the ability to be in the job market and also their 
income does not grow. Governments are having tight times. 
Provincial governments everywhere are cutting back on those 
assistance programs. The real thing is to have a springboard back 
into the job market.
<P>
	We have said we are going to take all the programs we have, 39 
programs, and bring them down to five simple employment 
measures. These are not programs with their own organizations and 
their own bureaucracies, but a basic set of measures that are 
available to individuals to get back to work. They make the choice.
<P>
	I find it amazing that the members of the opposition do not have 
much trust in individual choice, that they really do not believe that 
individuals can exercise the right to decide how to get back to work 
and how to make these tools work. They really have lost faith in the 
right of individuals to be able to choose and decide, not exclusively 
but with some support. We know that oftentimes individuals 
thrown totally into the market by themselves do need some 
assistance, but assistance that works.
<P>
	However, the opposition members talk about transferring from 
one government to another and all these kinds of things. They have 
lost the sense that individuals are what really count and that they 
should be given the opportunities to make those choices. At the 
same time, they have also lost something else that is very important 
to recognize. It goes back to the fundamental importance of the 
employment insurance system: it is a federal constitutional 
responsibility and people pay in premiums.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois shakes his head. This 
is a party that spends its entire question period and its entire 
existence in the House arguing about federalism in the 
Constitution. Yet this hon. gentleman does not know that in 1941 
the provinces ceded responsibility for unemployment insurance to 
the federal government. That is incredible ignorance for someone 
who likes to say he knows what he is talking about. He does not 
know a simple reality of the history of this country.
<P>
	When people pay a premium they have a right to a benefit. That 
is what they are investing in, the right to that benefit. Now the Bloc 
Quebecois is saying no, just turn the money over to a bunch of 
bureaucrats and they will decide whether they get the benefit for 
not; it is no longer his or her right as an individual to have that 
benefit. That is what the Bloc members are saying in this motion, 
that individuals in Quebec who pay a premium no longer will be 
assured of the right to get the benefit of that because it is going to 
be decided somewhere else. As a result, the fundamental principle 
of the insurance program is taken away.
<P>
	I do not think that is a very popular notion in Quebec or 
anywhere else. What is recognized is that they are fundamentally 
undermining the philosophy of the insurance program, which is 
that people contribute to protect themselves against the risk of 
unemployment. That is what it is all about.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	I am surprised at the lack of understanding of the hon. member 
about the history of federalism in the country wherein that was 
ceded by the provinces to give us the insurance program. I am even 
more concerned about the sense of neglect of the principle of 
insurance, that is that people pay for the protection.
<P>
	Basically we are saying that they will be eligible for an income 
benefit and an employment benefit. The employment benefit has 
within it five basic measures: a wage supplement, with highly 
effective evaluations in terms of getting people back to work.
<P>
	Income supplements tested out in New Brunswick and British 
Columbia over the past year show that people on lower incomes 
who would not take jobs because the income was not sufficient to 
pay for their family needs will take the jobs if there is a small top 
up. Thirty-three per cent are now back to work today compared to 
only 3 per cent in the general area of proven success.
<P>
	Turning to self-employment, Canada is the self-employment 
capital of the world. We are generating more opportunities for 
individuals to start their own businesses. In a matter of two years of 
testing the program for unemployment insurance, over 30,000 
people started their own businesses. Each created a job for another 
person. In other words 60,000 jobs were created as a result of the 
measure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17204"> 17204 </A></B>
<P>
	Hon. members of the opposition want to deny people that. They 
say: ``Don't do that. Don't give people the right to 
self-employment, to start their own businesses, to create jobs for 
themselves or somebody else''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> They have lost faith in 
the individual.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> They have lost faith 
in the individual. Yet that basic benefit was built into the program.
<P>
	We also built in the basic partnership arrangement for job 
creation. Job fare is working in New Brunswick today involving 
1,000 people from the forestry industry, older workers mainly. 
They are now back to doing reforestation, rebuilding that resource 
of the nation, cleaning it up and creating a resource that will be 
richer for the next generation of people.
<P>
	Then we have the skills voucher that is available to individuals. 
That is where we come to an interesting point. We have said clearly 
in the legislation that in terms of the application of the voucher we 
will do so only with the consent of the provincial governments 
involved because it is their jurisdiction. We will not deliver it if 
they say no. It is not our right to do so. We think it is important that 
individuals have the right to make that choice. If getting back to 
work means a three-week program in computer upgrading, they 
should have that right. If the province says no, I will respect that.
<P>
	I want to go beyond that. In all the measures I have talked about 
we are prepared to sit down with each province to work on a 
business plan of protocol, a year by year arrangement to determine 
the best allocation of the measures and to eliminate all duplication. 
Where the province has a program that can deliver that kind of 
opportunity to an individual who is our client, I am prepared to use 
it.
<P>
	This is contrary to what the member for Mercier said. We should 
not listen to her. Frankly the hon. member for Mercier has an 
incredible track record in the House of crying wolf on 
misinformation. A year ago she was saying: ``Oh, my God, you 
have changed the UI system. There will be 200,000 people on 
welfare''. Where did it go? It did not happen. In fact it began to get 
a bit better. We have to look at her track record.
<P>
	I make very clear that in the province of Quebec the SPRINT 
program provides a training voucher for people to go back to work. 
If the province is agreeable we can use it. Clients who pay a 
premium and get the benefit can use that direct program. I have no 
problem with that. It is perfectly good. I do not want to duplicate 
but that means sitting down province by province to work out the 
arrangements.
<P>
	The one test I must have as a trustee of the insurance program is 
to ensure that those people who have paid into the program are 
eligible for the benefits and that  they have a chance at being 
re-employed because that is the nature of the new benefits.
<P>
	The member is creating a great fantasy of huge standards and 
intrusions. Once again the prize for fiction goes to the member for 
Mercier for fabricating, making up, fantasizing and, more 
important, trying to scare people, fearmongering again. It is 
unfortunate. In many ways I have a great respect for the hon. 
member for Mercier. She is a good person and a compassionate 
person. The problem is that every time we have a debate in the 
House-
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> First of all she leaves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> That is another 
problem. She does not listen too well. Let us put it that way. 
Nevertheless everything is filtered through the prism of her 
separatist philosophy. That is the problem.
<P>
	She cannot look at a major new program to help unemployed 
people. She cannot deal with the fact that we want to totally rework 
federal-provincial relations to transfer far more responsibility to 
the provinces, to transfer all responsibility for training. She cannot 
see that because everything is filtered through a separatist black 
box. It does not allow the hon. member and her colleagues to see 
the opportunities which exist.
<P>
	I should like to clarify another important point. The hon. 
member made claims that this would be offloading on the 
provinces and that it would create problems. I point out something 
that has not been deliberately omitted but certainly has not been 
commented on by opposition members. An important initiative in 
the legislation is to extend for up to three years to all those who 
have had an attachment to the insurance system their eligibility for 
employment benefits. People who have exhausted their claims will 
now be eligible to start their own businesses with a 
self-employment program, to get a training voucher or to receive a 
wage supplement.
<P>
	This means that 40 per cent of the people presently on the social 
assistance rolls in the province of Quebec will now be eligible for 
re-employment benefits. At a time when the provincial government 
is cutting back on those benefits we are filling the vacuum. That is 
a very crucial reason negotiation is so important.
<P>
	There is an opportunity to harmonize our efforts. There is a real 
opportunity to separate those on assistance from those on the 
insurance program because in many cases they are the same person. 
Let us deliver through provincial programs such as APPORT. Bloc 
members have forgotten that last summer I signed an agreement 
with the provincial Government of Quebec to contribute to the 
APPORT program, specifically to test how provincial governments 
could deliver direct employment measures. Now we are seeing the 
benefits of that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17205"> 17205 </A></B>
<P>
	I am pleased that the assembly has agreed to negotiate. It is a 
first step; it is a good first step. The minister of employment for 
Quebec has already thrown conditions into the process, but I do 
not mind. I invited her over a month ago to have discussions. I 
am willing and open. Once we get together to form a partnership 
we can talk about how to bring the measures together to help those 
who have exhausted their benefits but want to be employed and 
about how we can ensure that the benefits paid out are delivered 
efficiently and without duplication.
<P>
	Those are the real opportunities this measure opens up. It is a 
way of redefining how we work as governments and how we can 
work together. It means redefining the role of government for the 
individuals and giving far more responsibility, choice and hope to 
individuals of being able to find work. They will know there is 
support and they are not being left alone.
<P>
	It also means an opportunity to help rebuild communities. One 
of the interesting developments in Quebec is that it is reorganizing 
down to the community level. I am doing the same in my 
department. We are reorganizing so that we have far more 
autonomy and discretion at the local, community and regional 
levels. If we can get together with provincial governments to agree 
on decentralization down to the community level, to let them make 
choices about the best way of employing people, we have done 
something very exciting. We have redefined governments in their 
relationships with each other, with individuals and with the 
community. We can provide the strength to rebuild the 
communities, to rebuild the employment system in Canada and to 
rebuild the country while we are doing it.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
comment, to set the record straight. Reacting to my shaking my 
head-it was not even something I said-the minister went off on a 
tangent and said I did not know the history of Canada and the 
Constitution.
<P>
	I shook my head to indicate that there was nothing in the 
Constitution originally, although of course the minister is right, in 
that the provinces agreed to a constitutional amendment that gave 
the federal government responsibility for unemployment 
insurance. I want to make that clear, and I think it was in 1941. I 
wanted to make that clear.
<P>
	The minister is intelligent, dedicated, energetic and well 
intentioned, and he probably wants to improve things, except when 
he says that the hon. member for Mercier does not listen too well. I 
want to appeal to his own ability to listen, because in the days to 
come, it seems there may be a meeting between the minister and 
the Quebec Minister of Employment. I hope he will go to this 
meeting with an open mind. In fact, I hope both parties will.
<P>
	This morning, he seemed to be open to discussion. I am not the 
Quebec Minister of Employment. I am in the opposition here in 
Ottawa. I am also a member of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development, and like the hon. member for Mercier, the 
minister's parliamentary secretary and the parliamentary secretary 
to the Prime Minister, I travelled with the committee across Canada 
last year. I listened to people, and of course I do not share the 
assessment that was made of a consensus in this respect. I may 
remind the minister that everywhere there were demonstrations, 
and 75 or 80 per cent of the briefs boiled down to the following: 
Mr. Minister, no cuts, please. That is history. But yesterday in the 
Quebec National Assembly, and that will be the subject of my 
question to the minister-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Of the Government of 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Yes, of the Government of Canada, of course. There 
are some things that I, as a Quebecer, would like to say to the 
minister, and this morning I have the opportunity to do so. The fact 
is that throughout the year, throughout our travels, we saw two 
ways of looking at reality. The majority of Quebecers, in all parties, 
including the Quebec Liberal Party and the Conseil du patronat, 
have the same perception of reality. The people of Quebec have the 
same perception of reality.
<P>
	The minister made it clear this morning. I am not criticizing his 
personal values which dictate that the individual is entitled to 
insurance. I can go along with that. I heard that very often in 
English Canada too, I must admit. But in Quebec, as long as it was 
unemployment insurance, there were never any complaints. It is 
true that Quebec had agreed, I think it was in 1941, to have 
unemployment insurance come under federal jurisdiction. But 
since that time, especially these last few years, Quebec has 
demanded control over funds allocated to unemployment insurance 
from the federal consolidated revenue fund for training and 
employability improvement services, arguing that these matters 
came within the same jurisdiction as education and training. There 
lies the source of the dispute, if you will, that has been going on for 
some time now, namely that when the federal government takes 
money from the unemployment fund for training it is meddling in a 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the minister has surely received a copy of the 
resolution passed by the National Assembly. As I have been asking 
him since yesterday, is the minister ready to recognize Quebec's 
sole responsibility for labour adjustment and job training policies 
in Quebec, according to the unanimous wish of Liberal Party 
members, even those who were in the no camp in Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before giving the floor to 
the minister, I would simply remind my  colleagues that all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17206"> 17206 </A></B>
<P>
questions must be put through the Chair in order to keep the 
discussion within parliamentary rules.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to direct my remarks to such a distinguished resident 
of the central office of the House.
<P>
	First let me apologize to the hon. member if I misinterpreted his 
earlier comments about the Constitution. His clarification is 
certainly reasonable. It will fully restore my respect for his 
constitutional knowledge and judgment.
<P>
	Let me get to the central point which is the question the hon. 
member raised. The reality is that we have clearly said that all 
choices and decisions about the nature of education and training 
will be made by provincial governments. We are withdrawing from 
the course purchases which have been the standard pattern over the 
past few years where federal bureaucrats would sit down with their 
counterparts and decide which courses would be available to 
clients. It will be purely a provincial choice.
<P>
	We are withdrawing from apprenticeship training, co-op 
education and a number of other measures because we believe that 
the fundamental questions of curriculum, supply, institutions, 
course, faculty, all the things that make up the basic training and 
education are provincial choices, purely within their jurisdiction.
<P>
	We are also prepared to go one step further and say there are 
other programs, not training, but which are directly related to 
employment and if a provincial government is able, wants to, is 
prepared to and has the mechanisms to decide how to make them 
available, that is fine. All I have to make sure is the person who is 
the insuree, who puts the money into the pot, is able to get the 
benefit back. That is the test and a requirement under the act, under 
the Constitution as the trustee for that insurance program.
<P>
	The design, system of delivery and the nature of how training 
takes places are clearly and simply provincial responsibilities. It is 
important to recognize it cannot take place through a simple block 
transfer. As we have learned in the past, a block transfer with 
provinces does not end up in the programs it is intended for.
<P>
	Quebec has been one of the better provinces in ensuring transfers 
for education and health end up in those programs. There are a lot 
of provinces in which a lot of roads have been built with money 
that was supposed to go to universities and a lot of provincial 
public buildings built with money supposed to go into the health 
care system.
<P>
	As a result we have to ensure that when my colleague pays into 
the program she has a right to expect a benefit in return. That is all. 
We are saying we are substantially  simplifying those benefits. We 
are basically saying that the 39 programs my department would run 
are being taken down to five measures. Those are not even 
programs, they are simply a tool. The provinces will be able to 
design that tool.
<P>
	I use the example of the SPRINT program in Quebec which I 
think is a good program, a system to get people back to work. If 
Quebec is prepared to make that available to clients in the 
employment insurance program, let us do it and get them back to 
work. Those are the kinds of discussion I want to have.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that we will discuss in good faith. 
We have invited the provincial ministers to meet with us and I am 
looking forward to that because I think there is a chance for a new, 
fresh, innovative dialogue with the provinces on this very crucial 
issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the experience the minister displays in his career in 
politics is very obvious. He is a very good speaker and I 
compliment him on that. I am sure he would do very well selling air 
conditioning units at the north pole.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	As I listened to him there were several glaring contradictions. I 
have a series of questions related to these. He makes the same 
mistake as the Bloc when he appeals to history for what he is doing. 
Back in 1941 the government was given permission to run an 
unemployment insurance program. It is no longer a true insurance 
program.
<P>
	My question is a very obvious one. Why does he appeal to this 
mandate back in 1941 to support what he is presently doing, 
making this a grand federal scheme that does not include only 
insurance? Why does he not return this to a true insurance program 
and only that?
<P>
	Is there a long range plan behind all this? It is obvious this is 
simply tinkering. Is there some direction? Are we going to go 
beyond this?
<P>
	The minister's press releases said a five-cent reduction in the 
premiums will create 20,000 jobs approximately. If that is true, 
20,000 jobs with the unemployment we have is a drop in the 
bucket. If we can create jobs by tinkering with it only five cents, 
what is stopping the minister from reducing the premiums even 
more and creating more jobs? That is a very obvious question and a 
contradiction as far as I am concerned in what the minister is 
saying. If he wants to really create jobs why is he not doing more?
<P>
	There is doublespeak. He says we are putting money in the hands 
of the individuals for empowerment. Why is he taking it out in the 
first place? The federal government charges a big handling fee 
whenever it takes money and does whatever it wants with it. 
Bureaucrats do not work for free.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17207"> 17207 </A></B>
<P>
	I have several other questions. Perhaps throughout the day I will 
have a chance to ask them. I have asked three key questions we 
need answered now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for his compliments. I wish my father were here 
to listen to him. He may actually believe them. My father was an 
insurance agent. He had a small insurance agency in the north end 
of Winnipeg. It was enough to keep us together and to go to school.
<P>
	I learned one lesson when he was involved in the insurance field 
and that is the best way to be a good insurer is to reduce the risk. 
When he sold casualty insurance or fire insurance he always went 
along with a good program to ensure that people would have good 
wiring in their houses, that they would reduce the risk of accidents, 
whether it was health or safety or whatever.
<P>
	When we have an unemployment insurance system, what do we 
do? We reduce the risk of unemployment. That is the best way to 
bring costs down, to protect against it. That is why it is a full 
insurance program. That is why as a trustee we have to invest in 
getting people back to work. That was the fundamental purpose.
<P>
	It would be interesting if the hon. member read the debates from 
the House in the early 1940s. He would learn from that. The basic 
premise was that only on a national level could we ensure there was 
both a spread and sharing of the risk but also that we would try to 
reduce the risk. Only a national government which was responsible 
for the management of the overall economy could provide the kind 
of priorities and judgments in concert with others. That is why the 
provinces ceded responsibility at that time.
<P>
	The hon. member would know that insurance is very much a 
question of reducing risk. That is why in our business we want to 
invest in bringing down unemployment and giving people a chance 
to get back to work.
<P>
	The second question is legitimate. As the hon. member knows, 
we try to balance our program. When we want to talk about 
creating jobs we do not do it by one mechanism alone. Reducing 
costs for business is one important way but it is not the only way.
<P>
	I have explained in the House a couple of times that what we 
want to do first is build up a reserve. It means we can protect 
against the really quite tragic and disastrous effects of what 
happened in the early nineties when the previous government did 
not have a reserve fund. When the recession hit it had to escalate 
premiums by almost 95 cents. It was the classic putting on the 
brakes while trying to go up hill.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The reality is the unemployment insurance system was designed 
to put money into the economy as a counter cyclical measure at a 
time when a recession is taking  place. That government pulled 
money out because there was no reserve built up in order to insure 
and stabilize employment.
<P>
	It was a clear recommendation to the House of Commons 
committee by business, labour and other groups that we have to 
build up a reserve, which is what we want to do.
<P>
	We are still paying off the deficit of the nineties. We inherited a 
$6 billion deficit in the UI account when we came to government. 
We have been wearing that away for the past two years. That is why 
we need to build up the reserve. Each year the Minister of Finance 
will take a look at the accumulation in that reserve and how it can 
then be adjusted for further reductions for business.
<P>
	This year we thought we would be prudent and give a premium 
reduction. We have also provided savings to business by making a 
substantial simplification of the system. We will have the ROE, the 
bugbear of business, which will be substantially simplified and will 
save $150 million. That is a good first step.
<P>
	We froze premiums when we came in. We have now reduced 
them as a first step. We are bringing down the cost for business and 
each year it will be reviewed.
<P>
	In the meantime we can assure Canadians, at a time when the 
business cycle becomes more difficult, we will have a reserve so 
we will not be taking money out of the economy when we actually 
want to stimulate the economy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> While these compliments 
are going across the floor and directed to the Chair, I must say it is 
appreciated. However, what we appreciate the most is the respect 
the House continues to show for our institution through the Chair 
and its occupant at any one time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to request of you and through you to the minister that 
any remarks on the presence or absence of my colleague from 
Mercier, as was made in the previous portion of the debate, be 
deleted from <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	She is accorded the respect of all of us according to 
parliamentary procedures. One of the core issues relevant to that 
respect is that we do not remark on whether she is here or not. 
There were comments made by the minister during his speech and 
by colleagues surrounding him that may be part of the blues. I 
would like that to be addressed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me see if I can be helpful 
from my perspective. I am certainly satisfied that at no time did the 
Minister of Human Resources Development make any reference to 
the absence of anyone in the House. I will review the blues and if 
someone else did then it would be a matter for the Chair to take 
under advisement.
<P>

<P>
	I appreciate the reminder by the member for Calgary Southeast 
not only of a tradition but a rule of the House that is very 
important to our deliberations. We all know the constraints on our 
time away from the House. Therefore I fully respect the member's 
intervention.
<P>
	I do not think there is a point of order. We are engaging in 
debate. I will return to the debate on the motion of the official 
opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
your comments.
<P>
	Like everyone speaking today, I am honoured to address this 
motion. I clearly do not support the motion because referencing 
only Quebec narrows its scope. When the intent behind the motion 
is applied more appropriately to all provinces then of course I 
would support such an action.
<P>
	At the end of my speech I will amend the motion so that it refers 
to the powers of all the provinces. Given they should all be treated 
equally, we must ensure motions such as these reflect that.
<P>
	The motion proposed by my hon. colleague allows us to address 
some of the points made in the recent so-called employment 
insurance reforms. We believe the government intends to prorogue 
the House but in doing so may try to manipulate House procedure 
to ensure this legislation does not die on the Order Paper. Tabling 
the bill so close to Christmas break demonstrates that the 
government either does not expect to give it second reading until 
next February or that it hopes the bill will die on the Order Paper. 
Either way, tabling the bill as it has amounts to nothing more than 
irresponsible governance.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I will first address some of the amendments to employment 
insurance and then will focus on the government's failure to 
transfer powers to the provinces for labour market training. In its 
throne speech on January 18, 1994, the government stated that 
Canada's social security system must be responsive to the 
economic and social realities of the 1990s. This was a noble 
sentiment and we agree with it. However, the government also said 
in the throne speech that it would announce an action plan for 
major reform of the social security system to be completed within 
two years.
<P>
	The minister's announcement is not major reform of the social 
security system and it barely qualifies as reform of the 
unemployment insurance system. I say this because the minister's 
tinkering will not create a single sustainable job.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at some of the changes. This is cosmetic 
change, not the kind of real governmental changes that Canadians 
are demanding. It is a name change; unemployment insurance is 
now employment insurance. Do we think that Canada's 
unemployed care  about what the program is called? 
Unemployment by any other name is unemployment. It is this kind 
of rhetorical grandstanding of which Canadians have grown weary. 
Changing the name of UI to EI will not create a single sustainable 
job in Canada.
<P>
	There is a rollback of payroll taxes of five cents for every $100. 
This is a tax rollback of one-twentieth of one per cent. This 
amounts to a savings akin to a wooden nickel. It is hard to imagine 
this so-called tax cut will create a single sustainable job in Canada.
<P>
	The minister wants Canadians to think he has rolled taxes back 
but let us look at what is really going on. Part time workers will 
now have to pay the UI payroll tax which includes employer and 
employee shares totalling a 7 per cent tax hike. When eligibility is 
changed from weeks to hours, the government is imposing a tax 
grab on part time workers, a tax grab of over $1 billion.
<P>
	This means youth in Canada and working moms, many of them 
single parents, will have to foot the bill. Youth and working 
mothers will have to work many hours to be eligible for benefits. 
While they are accumulating benefits the minister will be sure to 
tax their paycheques. The big problem with this is the lengthy 
period of eligibility. It is often the case, as it is with the nature of 
part time work, that the contributors will move from job to job with 
short periods of unemployment in between. This means youth and 
working moms will pay benefits and seldom will be able to collect. 
This amounts to a substantial tax grab on a segment of society 
which can least afford it.
<P>
	The government has no estimates of how many jobs will be lost 
because of it. It does not know how many jobs will be lost because 
it has failed to do a thorough analysis of this aspect of the bill.
<P>
	According to statistics ending in October of this year, youth 
unemployment in Canada stands at 15.6 per cent. We needed to 
hear yesterday and today some ideas on how to get our youth into 
meaningful work situations. Instead of positive change we have 
learned that today's proposals will cause employers to hire fewer 
part time workers because a tax is effectively imposed on the hiring 
of part time employees.
<P>
	Let me restate this point. Part time workers now represent a 
massive tax hike on employers. This will not create a single 
sustainable job. In fact this change may choke off part time work 
altogether. This is especially disturbing when one considers that a 
growing percentage of the labour force is employed part time.
<P>
	The minister announced an $800 million job training program. 
The auditor general's recent report indicated that these expensive 
and wasteful schemes do not create jobs. He criticized the Western 
Economic Diversification Program, ACOA in the Atlantic 
provinces and FORD-Q in Quebec. We all know what a colossal 
failure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17209"> 17209 </A></B>
<P>
the TAGS program has been. The government itself admits that the  
$6 billion infrastructure program only created a few thousand short 
term jobs.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	Perhaps what is most disturbing about this announcement and 
more specifically related to the motion we are debating today 
relates to labour market training. It is clear from the government's 
package that the Prime Minister broke faith with Canadians when 
he announced he was giving labour market training to the 
provinces.
<P>
	The minister is trying to sneak through the back door a new 
made in Ottawa social program scheme which will intrude on 
provincial jurisdiction. He has created two mega programs and for 
all these new programs all the provinces must reach agreement 
with the federal government. The Liberal government needs to give 
power and resources to the provinces with no strings attached. If 
not, then the gesture is meaningless. The government simply does 
not understand what decentralization means.
<P>
	Let us move on now to decentralization, an issue that has 
garnered significant attention of late, especially given that the EI 
changes break the Prime Minister's Verdun commitment which he 
reiterated on Tuesday last week.
<P>
	It is ironic that we debate the government's broken promise of 
decentralizing manpower training today. Today at committee we 
will hear the bureaucrats explain to us how Bill C-96 also fails to 
decentralize powers. In fact, the bill may even create new powers 
for the federal government. Even if this new power never manifests 
itself, the bill at a minimum entrenches the status quo of federal 
intervention into provincial areas of social policy jurisdiction, 
areas I am sad to say for which the new EI bill fails to relinquish 
power.
<P>
	I find it quixotic, though I suppose not entirely uncharacteristic, 
that the government would try to enact legislation which engenders 
and champions the notion of centralization and the status quo. To 
do so amidst the decentralization forces pressuring the country to 
change is profoundly absurd.
<P>
	Recent events have shown to all that fundamental change is 
required of our federation. There is almost universal agreement 
that the federal government needs to rethink its current role as 
provider of services and programs. In areas of social policy we 
cannot continue to support a system which separates the revenue 
raising capacity from the expenditure function. In other areas too 
there is strong evidence to support devolution to the most logical 
level of government.
<P>
	In October the Reform Party released its vision for a new 
confederation. Reform believes that decentralization will permit 
future governments to respond more effectively to the needs of 
ordinary Canadians. It also addresses many of the historic concerns 
of individuals from all provinces.
<P>
	Reform's plan includes giving provinces exclusive control over 
natural resources, job training, municipal affairs, housing, tourism, 
sports and recreation. It gives the provinces control over setting 
their own interprovincial standards for health, welfare and 
education, replacing federal cash transfers with tax points, and 
allowing provinces to raise their own taxes to finance social 
programs.
<P>
	This decentralization will lead to a more balanced federation, 
one in which Ottawa will play a co-operative role rather than a 
dominating role. The proposals outlined in the new confederation 
speak to the long term. They furnish Canada with a vision. They 
put flesh on the conceptual bones of a new federalism. This is the 
kind of leadership that has been conspicuously absent from the 
current government benches.
<P>
	How can one govern without a coherent direction? It is 
incomprehensible. I am not talking about prescience here, but 
about the courage to say: ``These are my ideas; this is my vision''. 
We have seen none of that from the government.
<P>
	The traditional response to fiscal crisis has been centralization, 
consolidation and concentration. This instinct increasingly leads to 
failure. Centralized control and consolidated agencies create more 
waste, not less. There are many reasons that Reform speaks for this 
vision of decentralization and they will be outlined.
<P>
	Decentralization will engender greater flexibility allowing 
institutions to respond more quickly to changing circumstances and 
client needs. Decentralization will create more effective program 
and service delivery, as the deliverers and providers of government 
assistance are closer to those they serve.
<P>
	Decentralization will reduce waste, overlap and duplication 
created by concurrent jurisdictions and poorly co-ordinated 
government programs and services. Decentralization will engender 
greater fiscal responsibility, for a government that spends the 
money it raises will inherently be more accountable than one that 
spends the money someone else collects.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Decentralization in regard to the tax system is most compatible 
with the tenets of federalism. The efforts of a federal form of 
government is local autonomy. In its designated spheres, each unit 
is free to exercise its policy discretion unencumbered.
<P>
	It is important to remember in this debate on labour market 
training that decentralization is neither a celebrated buzzword nor a 
passing political fad. It is a policy movement that has been 
vigorously championed in Canada since the 1960s. It represents 
reconfiguring the locus of attention in the federation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17210"> 17210 </A></B>
<P>
	Former B.C. Liberal Party leader Gordon Gibson writes in his 
new book: ``Canadians ultimately want less  control by Ottawa and 
more local management of their affairs. The basic concept here is 
government closer to home. Now home is where the heart is in our 
private lives perhaps, but in government terms, home is where the 
folks have the knowledge and resources to do the job. That single 
thought takes us a long way''.
<P>
	Adhering to the rule of thumb that the responsibility for 
addressing problems should lie with the lowest level of government 
possible does not require that we disavow the notion of federal 
leadership. A federal government with fewer employees, fewer 
departments and smaller budgets can still have a steering role in 
Canadian society. There would still be a policy framework setting 
function in certain areas even if no services were delivered.
<P>
	These would include: policy areas that transcend the capacities 
of state and local governments such as international trade, 
macroeconomic policy and much environmental and regulatory 
policy; social insurance programs like employment compensation 
where paying equal benefits to all citizens requires that rich and 
poor share differentiated burdens; and investments that are so 
costly that they require tax increases which might discourage 
business from locating or staying in a city or province. These are 
fundamental to leadership and to federalism at the central 
government level.
<P>
	Even in these cases, Reform believes that programs can be 
designed to allow for significant flexibility at the provincial or 
municipal level. The federal government can and must work with 
provincial governments to define jointly the mission and the 
outcome, but in doing so it must free lower governments to achieve 
those outcomes as they see fit.
<P>
	Today we see that British Columbia is going to be penalized to 
the tune of $47 million for trying to do just that. What has been the 
Liberal response to decentralization?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Breaking the law.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Decentralization is not about 
breaking the law with all due respect to my hon. colleague on the 
other side of the House. The government has resisted the natural 
ebb and flow of this federation by operating completely oblivious 
to its surroundings.
<P>
	We saw this in the recent referendum. The government grossly 
miscalculated by adhering to a status quo position. Only when it 
became obvious that its policy was a complete failure did it move 
to make insincere promises of change. Now where is this change? 
Where is this vision for a new federation, a new federalism? Where 
is the blueprint for a renewed Canada? Where is the leadership to 
bring forward such a plan, given this government's previous 
attempts at major change? I would suggest that we will be waiting a 
long time before we see substantive and meaningful change.
<P>
	Let me give one example of how this government is failing to 
deliver on its promises to reform and decentralize social programs. 
Consider the current welfare issue in British Columbia. I wanted to 
come back to that in my text because it is extremely significant 
today. When the province made changes to its own program by 
stipulating a residency requirement for welfare qualification, the 
federal government stepped in, and it has indeed stepped in, in a 
punitive fashion today, and threatened the province. Yesterday the 
artificial deadline passed in B.C. and we now see the results of 
what has happened.
<P>
	There is no question that the B.C. government should be 
permitted to administer its affairs without federal interference. The 
minister, rather than taking such punitive action against the 
province should back off and leave it free to run its own programs. 
It is absurd for the minister, who has radically reduced transfers to 
the provinces, to turn around and intervene in provincial 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	The minister continues to refuse to meet with the provinces over 
the Canada health and social transfer. Now when the provinces try 
to move forward, he stands in their way. Go figure. It would seem 
this is the Liberal position on co-operative federalism. How 
terribly predictable. How truly unfortunate. How really ``made in 
Ottawa'' it is.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	During our briefings on Bills C-111 and C-112 we were provided 
with a briefing package on the changes these bills provide. At every 
twist and turn and at every reference to labour market training it is 
very clear that the provinces must negotiate with the government. 
They must seek to enter into a formal agreement with the federal 
government on how employment insurance benefits will work and 
how they will be delivered. Instead of giving complete power and 
adequate resources to the provinces, these amendments give a de 
facto veto to the federal government over the management and 
control of manpower training programs.
<P>
	Ironically, the Liberal government is holding on for dear life to 
programs it has proven it is absolutely incapable of managing 
properly.
<P>
	Just two weeks ago the auditor general stated in his report that 
there are grounds for concern that a lack of training in key areas 
may be producing a braking effect on jobs for the unemployed 
when the economy is expanding. Clearly, Canada's auditor general 
believes that the Liberal government is failing in its attempt to 
create those long term sustainable jobs, jobs, jobs we keep hearing 
about from the other side of the House. In fact, one may conclude 
from his comments that the government is actually hindering job 
creation, not helping it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17211"> 17211 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister's changes amount to mere tinkering, not a 
sweeping and comprehensive reform. What we need are systemic 
reforms that address the needs of the chronically unemployed, 
which was what UI in 1940 was intended to do. It was to provide 
a bridge for short term unemployment, not the massive social 
safety net we now see.
<P>
	I would like to share briefly with the House three options for 
change the minister did not address. Two of the options involve 
decentralizing power for training programs to the lowest level of 
government: directly to the individual. Our options for 
relinquishing control to individuals are motivated by the desire for 
individuals to care for themselves when they are capable of doing 
so. That is absolutely fundamental to the Reform ideology of 
individuals accepting responsibility to take care of themselves 
when they are able to do so. That is not too difficult to understand.
<P>
	However, the government wants to maintain control over 
training because it is a traditional political activity to maintain 
visibility in the area of employment and job creation. After all, the 
election is only two years down the road, and we want to be visible 
out there. Boy, we went out there and created those jobs, jobs, jobs. 
Are we not good?
<P>
	The first option to be considered is that employment insurance 
could be returned to a true insurance plan, as it was originally 
intended to be when it was created in the 1940s. This would mean 
doing away with regional inequities in the program and ensuring 
that only those who truly need benefits receive them.
<P>
	The system has become an income supplement. Income 
supplement does not, in my definition, translate to insurance. We 
believe there is a need and place for income supplements, but they 
should not be in UI or EI or whatever it is called. UI was meant to 
provide workers with temporary assistance for brief periods of time 
when they were between jobs.
<P>
	The second option would be for individuals to change how they 
contribute to unemployment insurance. They could contribute to 
registered employment savings trusts, or REST accounts. These 
accounts would be mandatory and would be used at the discretion 
of the individual. As many people never use UI, it is only a tax with 
no benefit. With a REST account, similar to RRSPs, if the funds are 
not used the money could be directed into their super-RRSP 
accounts. This idea is not without its problems; I acknowledge that. 
The period of transition would be difficult and youth and the 
intermittently employed may find the plan difficult to manage.
<P>
	A third option for the government is to drastically slim down EI, 
return it to a true insurance plan, and at the same time have 
individuals contribute to REST accounts. These things would 
happen together. This plan would ensure that the chronically 
unemployed are cared for and that those people who are seldom 
unemployed would be  able to administer their own employment 
insurance program. They would not be taxed.
<P>
	These are three options we are developing. We hope that in the 
new year we will be able to finalize our research and bring our plan 
forward to Reform's general assembly in June, where the 
membership, the people, can debate and come to a final decision on 
this important policy plank.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Having proposed options for decentralizing training, and after 
having demonstrated yet again how badly the Liberal government 
has broken its promise to transfer labour market training, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words after ``prevents'' be deleted and replaced with the words 
``the governments of all the provinces of Canada from adopting a true labour 
market training policy of their own''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> On the proposed amendment 
to the official opposition motion moved by the hon. member for 
Calgary Southeast, I will take it under advisement and the Chair 
will respond to this matter in the shortest time possible and get 
back to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the comments made by the hon. member from the 
Reform Party, the human resources development critic. At a time 
of constant change in our society, we welcome the meeting of 
minds and any exchanges that can take place between legislators 
and other individuals who are willing to propose new ideas. 
Although I may not agree with the concept prescribed by the hon. 
member, I certainly congratulate her on making at least the effort to 
come up with a new employment insurance plan.
<P>
	I have some fundamental questions in relation to a couple of 
points. One deals with the issue of federal-provincial relations, 
which is preoccupying the minds of the Reform Party members and 
of course the Bloc Quebecois as well. Other questions relate to the 
employment insurance package as it relates to small business.
<P>
	On the issue of decentralization of federal-provincial relations, 
members of Parliament who have followed this file attentively 
would probably find that the federal government has made many 
efforts with all the provincial governments to come up with a plan 
of action that speaks to the reality of the various provinces. As a 
matter of fact, the Minister of Human Resources Development has 
met with many of his counterparts. Part and parcel of this 
employment insurance legislation speaks to the fact that when we 
are talking about the tools, namely the self-employment assistance, 
the skills and loan grants, the top-ups in earnings, the federal 
government is co-operating with the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17212"> 17212 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, on the definition of decentralization, local 
empowerment, and the redefinition of the relationship among the 
individual, the community, and government, it is clear to me that 
if we are to give vouchers or give the opportunity to an individual 
to make up his or her choice, that is the ultimate form of 
decentralization. May I add, it speaks to the confidence the federal 
government has in the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	We believe the people of Canada can make the best choices for 
their own lives. They understand that in a changing economy they 
need to upgrade their skills, they need training opportunities, they 
need the types of vehicles that will ease their transition from the 
unemployment rolls onto the payrolls of our country.
<P>
	Talking about payrolls, the issue of job creation is extremely 
important for the people of Canada. As a result of the measures 
taken in this bill, 100,000 to 150,000 jobs will be created. Who will 
create them? Small business, which is responsible for the creation 
of 85 per cent to 90 per cent of all new jobs in this country.
<P>
	What have we done to enhance the opportunities for small 
business? We have lowered the premiums. The hon. member from 
the Reform Party says it is only a nickel. The reality is that if the 
hon. member were to calculate the reduction that occurs, not only 
to premium rates, and include the fact that maximum insurable 
earnings have gone down from $43,000 to $39,000, business also 
incurs that saving.
<P>
	Equally important in this discussion is that it is not only business 
that gets the tax break, it is also individual Canadians who pay into 
the fund. That is a very important point to underline.
<P>
	Another issue is that we believe in building a strong 
entrepreneurial spirit in this country. I think our actions speak to 
that. One of the five tools we have outlined in the human resources 
investment fund is the self-employment assistance program. Since 
we formed the government, 34,000 people have participated in this 
program, creating 60,000 jobs. That speaks to job creation and it 
also speaks to empowering people and giving people the 
opportunity that is required.
<P>
	How else is small business being helped? The five tools will 
enhance the human resources potential of our country, which 
means we are going to have a better skilled workforce. A better 
skilled workforce means we can set as a goal high-paying, highly 
skilled jobs that produce high value added products. That is 
extremely important to underline as we modernize our economy.
<P>
	When we talk about modernization, what about the new labour 
market information system that is going to connect business and 
people from coast to coast to coast so we may match people and 
also reduce the time people spend on the unemployment rolls of 
our country?
<P>
	These are extremely positive measures, not to mention what we 
have learned from the past government's error in reference to 
reserves. By building up a higher reserve we are going to make sure 
that the next time there is a recession, hopefully not for a long time, 
or the next time there is a downturn in the Canadian economy, we 
will not be taxing small business and employees at a time when 
they need tax relief. This reserve will make that transition from 
economic downturns to better economic times a lot easier.
<P>
	This will create stability in the premium rates. It will create jobs. 
It will create confidence. It will generate the type of confidence 
that is required so employment opportunities can be increased.
<P>
	I would ask a simple question to the hon. member. In the 
employment insurance package the Reform Party introduced to the 
media a few months ago there are some fundamental flaws. One 
flaw is that it excludes more people than it includes, unlike our 
package, which brings in 500,000 people, including 44,500 
seasonal workers who were excluded by the old unemployment 
insurance package. Why does the Reform Party, whether it is on the 
pension reform package or the employment insurance package, 
continue to practise the politics of exclusion?
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	I concur that this is a welcome meeting of the minds. We can 
have reasoned debate. We can come to the House of Commons and 
feel secure in knowing that at least our ideas will be received and 
debated in an atmosphere of collegiality, understanding that we 
come to this place with differing ideologies.
<P>
	The simplest answer to the hon. member's question when it 
comes to differing ideologies and how we understand and view the 
unemployment insurance system is that there is no doubt in the 
minds of the Reform Party that the unemployment insurance 
system is a fundamental labour market institution as it was 
developed in the 1940s. When it was developed in the 1940s it was 
for a specific reason: temporary assistance as an individual moved 
between jobs. It was not as it has now become, and I am quoting: 
``a cornerstone of Canada's social safety net''.
<P>
	If we look at it in those terms it is coming at the question from 
two very different points of view. On the one hand we would like to 
see it as part of and included in the labour market as a tool. On the 
other hand it has become part and parcel of the fabric of social 
support in Canada. Quite frankly, I do not quite know where a 
meeting of the minds would find agreement. We could see where 
each of us is going, based on our belief systems, on what we 
believe to be right.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17213"> 17213 </A></B>
<P>
	Another comment with respect to the question of differing 
ideologies is from something which appeared on page 20 of the 
briefing notes we were given the other day. It comes back to the 
question he asked. I question the political motivation behind the 
part of the proposal dealing with employment benefits and 
services.
<P>
	The federal government is now committing to work in concert 
with each province. The alarm bells start to sound when we start 
thinking about each province. The hon. member talked about 
inclusion and the same kinds of support across the country. Yet in 
my mind it will obviously be different because each province is 
invited to enter into agreements.
<P>
	For the decentralization the hon. member has described, it tells 
me there will probably be a different set of circumstances for each 
province given its particular debt, deficit and unemployment 
situation. This will include the agreements. That is why I say there 
could be quite a difference when we are talking about 
federal-provincial alignment.
<P>
	The design of the employment benefits and measures, how they 
will be implemented and a framework for evaluating the results tell 
me there will be consistency across the country. It just opens a 
social safety net to all kinds of expectations that perhaps the 
government has not thought about.
<P>
	With respect to the member's comment about growth and small 
business in the country, there is no question that small business 
generates lots of jobs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I ask the member to 
summarize in the next minute or two, if she could, so that we could 
resume the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have one 
more point with respect to building up the reserve. I will move 
away from the small business comments I wanted to make.
<P>
	Regarding the surplus in UI, I maintain the finance minister will 
probably do some very creative accounting with that surplus. He 
will reach his 3 per cent of GDP in the next budget and it will be on 
the backs of taxpayers in a UI surplus. Our growth rate right now, 
as was just reported, has moved from 4.2 per cent to 2.3 per cent. 
No one can tell me our economy is going anywhere. We have not 
created a single sustainable job since the government came to 
power.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before we resume debate I 
will return to the matter raised by the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast in her intervention about another member on the 
government side referring to a member of the official opposition, 
the Bloc Quebecois, not being present in her seat. I told the hon. 
member at that time that I would review the blues.
<P>
	I have the blues before me and a reference was made by a 
government member that first of all she leaves. The member for 
Calgary Southeast was entirely right that it occurred. Second and 
most important it goes against the convention of the House to make 
any reference to the absence of any member at any one time from 
the Chamber.
<P>
	I know other members such as the member for Lévis, and I 
believe someone on the government side, wished to rise on the 
point. I will consider the matter closed now that it has been raised 
correctly by the member for Calgary Southeast. I thank her for her 
intervention and the matter is closed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise in support of the motion by the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	Before going on, I would like to thank the member for Calgary 
Southeast for her vigilance, her attention and especially for having 
raised the matter. I appreciate the intention, because the member 
for Mercier indeed participates a lot in our work, she is very much 
present in the House. I think the remarks in question were 
inappropriate.
<P>
	The debate is on a motion which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for choosing to reform 
unemployment insurance in a way that maintains overlap and duplication in the 
manpower sector and thus prevents the Government of Quebec from adopting a 
true manpower development policy of its own.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I listened to the arguments by the member for Calgary Southeast 
on the amendment she is proposing. I shall reserve my comments 
on it for the moment, but I would like to thank her for her attention. 
Her remarks indicate that other provinces would like to take charge 
of manpower training.
<P>
	However, after touring the country with the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development last year, I felt that some 
provinces, such as the Atlantic provinces, were less keen, were not 
necessarily fuelled by the same desire. They wanted the federal 
government to remain very visible in this area, because they felt 
that their province was perhaps experiencing economic difficulties 
in this regard.
<P>
	I simply want to say that the amendment proposed by the 
member for Calgary Southeast would not be easy to apply, because 
there does not appear to be a consensus, unlike in Quebec. This has 
been shown very clearly. I say this to the member for Calgary 
Southeast, I will discuss it in my speech, I will recall the historical 
background of this claim by Quebec and the reason it is so 
important to us.
<P>
	To us, manpower training means education. Under Canada's 
Constitution, education is a provincial matter. This is particularly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17214"> 17214 </A></B>
<P>
important to Quebec, because  education is also a cultural concept, 
very close to our culture. It is a treasure to the people of Quebec.
<P>
	All those involved in this area agree. I would point out that 
yesterday the Quebec National Assembly passed a motion to again 
remind the federal government of its position. When I speak of the 
Quebec National Assembly, I am not talking just about the 
members of the Parti Quebecois, but also the members of the 
Quebec Liberal Party.
<P>
	Yesterday's motion was passed with a vote of 96 in favour, none 
against and no abstentions. It was therefore passed unanimously.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	What does this resolution say? It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That Quebec must have sole responsibility for policies pertaining to 
manpower adjustment and occupational training within its borders and patriate 
accordingly the funding allocated by the federal government to these programs 
in Quebec; ``Within the current constitutional framework and in order to 
improve services to customers, Quebec must take over the control and 
management of various services pertaining to employment and manpower 
development and all programs that may be funded through the Unemployment 
Insurance Fund within Quebec's borders, and must therefore receive the 
funding appropriate to such responsibilities;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The Government of Quebec and representatives of business, labour and the 
co-operative sector agree to oppose any initiative by the federal government 
that would constitute an invasion of Quebec's prerogatives''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, it asks the government and the Minister of Employment to 
immediately undertake formal discussions with the federal government in order 
to ensure the respect of the consensus and the promotion of the interests of the 
Quebec people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
I stress that this motion was adopted unanimously.
<P>
	A while ago, as I was shaking my head at something he said, the 
minister introduced a historical dimension to the debate. I had 
mentioned 1941 a bit earlier when answering a colleague's 
question. I must make a correction, I was wrong by one year. The 
constitutional amendment which enabled the federal government to 
set up and run the unemployment insurance program was passed on 
July 10, 1940. It was the British Parliament-as you know we had 
to ask its permission-which amended section 91 of the British 
North America Act, making it possible for the federal government 
to set up the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	It would be useful at this point to summarize Quebec's claims. 
Stakeholders in the labour market have recognized unanimously 
the need to patriate to Quebec all responsibilities and federal 
funding in the area of manpower training. The Liberal Party and the 
Parti quebecois are in agreement on this.
<P>
	It is also worth recalling that, in 1991, the former minister in 
charge of manpower, income security and manpower training 
claimed, in a policy statement from  the Government of Quebec 
about manpower development: ``For many years, Quebec has 
claimed control over policy instruments affecting the work market. 
In other words, the Government of Quebec and its economic 
partners want laws, budgets, institutions, programs and services 
concerning manpower or the operation of the work market to be 
under one authority. Partners on the Quebec work market are 
almost unanimous in recognizing that manpower policies must be 
prepared by authorities as close as possible to the various work 
markets''.
<P>
	This request for devolution of manpower training goes back a 
long way. In 1989, the job forum was a critical step in the 
advancement of this cause. This is when the job market partners, 
that is unions, employers and government, agreed to asl that 
Ottawa hand over full responsibility for manpower training.
<P>
	With such a consensus, the Government of Quebec officially 
requested, in December 1990, that any federal moneys for 
manpower programs be handed over to Quebec, including money 
from the unemployment insurance fund used for that purpose. In 
December 1990, the Liberal Party was in office, not the Parti 
Quebecois, and Robert Bourassa was premier. The Liberal Party of 
Quebec claimed exclusive jurisdiction not only over manpower 
training, but also over other aspects of manpower development, 
such as placement, employment assistance, job creation support, 
etc.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	To back up this demand, the Quebec government created the 
Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, or 
SQDM, which was to serve as a link between all labour market 
stakeholders and manage all manpower development programs in 
Quebec.
<P>
	The Quebec Liberal Party went even further, asking for an 
administrative agreement allowing Quebec to manage the 
unemployment insurance program within the province. It was 
asking for a return to the pre-1840 situation. Quebec wanted to be 
given jurisdiction in this area.
<P>
	Otherwise, the federal government would have to maintain a 
rather cumbersome administrative structure in Quebec. To make UI 
benefits and related services accessible to the Quebec people, a 
whole network would have to be maintained with all the 
inconveniences of this kind of duplication.
<P>
	In concrete terms, this agreement would have resulted in the UI 
program running the SQDM.
<P>
	This happened under the liberal government led by Robert 
Bourassa, a true blue federalist. Now, you will ask, what sort of 
problems is this situation creating in Quebec? At the same time, 
one must recognize that there is a problem with vocational training 
in Canada. In 1993, Canada was ranked 22nd out of 22 developed 
countries for on-the-job training.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17215"> 17215 </A></B>
<P>
	According to available statistics, the federal network runs 27 
training programs-the minister said earlier 38-and the Quebec 
network 5. The federal government-which has started cutting 
down-operates close to 100 Canada Employment Centres in 
Quebec, while Quebec set up the SQDM to replace the former 
Commission de formation professionnelle.
<P>
	The original mandate of the Société québécoise de la 
main-d'oeuvre was to work towards the creation of true single 
windows in every Quebec region. Today, it acts more as a mere 
manager of federal funds, without much of a say.
<P>
	I would like to point out that in 1993-1994, transfer payments 
accounted for 56 per cent of the SQDM budget, or $150.7 million 
out of a total of $269.5 million, a true description, if ever there was 
one, of Ottawa's control over manpower. The lack of co-ordination 
between the two networks results in the unemployed being ill 
served by the various manpower training programs.
<P>
	An internal memo of the federal government did reveal that in 
the spring of 1993-this is a federal memo, remember-nearly 
25,000 unemployed people referred to a training program could not 
register for lack of sufficient available places.
<P>
	The policy statement of minister Bourbeau described how two 
different manpower training networks could cause problems. It 
said: ``We understand how hard it can be for an uninitiated person 
or business to find its way among the multiple service centres like 
the Canada Employment Centres, the offices of the Commission de 
formation professionelle de la main-d'oeuvre, Travail Québec 
centres, school boards, colleges, universities and the Department of 
Manpower, Income Security and Skills Development.''
<P>
	Minister Bourbeau, a liberal federalist, estimated at $275 million 
the cost of these overlaps and duplications in manpower training 
programs. The minister who said that was not a PQ member, not a 
BQ member, not a sovereignist, but a federalist.
<P>
	Both governments agree that manpower training programs must 
change. The Minister of Human Resources Development said, in 
his discussion paper on improving social security in Canada: 
``Unfortunately, existing programs don't do this well enough. Too 
many people end up in programs that have little to do with their 
needs, aptitudes or opportunities. Many get training for jobs that 
don't exist locally. Many are shunted from one program to another. 
There are too many mismatched programs, with inconsistent rules 
and too much red tape. Programs offered by different levels of 
government are often not coordinated.''
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	According to him, the system had to change. The federal 
government is not alone in adding to the mess of  manpower 
training programs. We must recognize that, at the time, there were 
too many manpower training programs. The present minister has 
merged a number of programs, but she is having problems because 
the federal is ever present and nothing leads us to believe that it 
will willingly leave the field, since it is actually introducing new 
measures. Yes, it says that it is offering them to the provinces, but it 
intends to keep imposing guidelines. It intends to keep control.
<P>
	The minister said a while ago, in his presentation, that we cannot 
do away with controls because certain provinces-not Quebec but 
others- had used the program's money to build public buildings. 
He feels this is enough to justify a permanent control by the federal 
government.
<P>
	Basically, what he wants to do, what he would like to see is the 
provinces, Quebec included, manage the programs listed in his bill. 
He would like the provinces to do what he wants them to do. He is 
treating the provinces has mere pawns. For us in Quebec, this flies 
totally in the face of the established consensus.
<P>
	I will quote someone else. The president of the Business Council 
on National Issues, Mr. Thomas d'Aquino, added his voice to the 
voices of those who recommend that the federal government hand 
over manpower training to the provinces as fast as possible. On 
October 28, 1994, Mr. d'Aquino said: ``There is no doubt in my 
mind that decentralization in this area would be beneficial for the 
Canadian economy. The sooner the politicians come to an 
agreement on this question, the better''.
<P>
	Last year, members of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development travelled throughout Canada. When the 
minister suggests that he is implementing recommendations that 
the committee heard, let me say that I disagree with that. I travelled 
to all the provinces of this country and to all the large cities of 
Canada while travelling with the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development-the parliamentary secretary knows that, 
he had to suffer the consequences. On some occasions, I had to 
admire his courage in facing those who opposed his reform. But 
when he tells us later that this is what Canadians want and wish, 
after what I have seen and heard, when I know that 75 to 80 per cent 
of briefs were against what the minister is now proposing, that is, 
cuts of some $2 billion in unemployment insurance, I know that is 
not what Canadians wished for.
<P>
	People who came to testify before this committee said that what 
is missing today is work, job opportunities. They wished that the 
government would follow the policy outlined in its red book. The 
Liberal slogan during the last election campaign was even ``Jobs, 
jobs, jobs''. But we see that, in fact, there are not more jobs today. 
But worse still, the proposed changes will create two kinds of 
unemployed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17216"> 17216 </A></B>
<P>
	As critic for training and youth, I see that a young person will 
now have to work 910 hours over 52 weeks in order to qualify 
for unemployment insurance. That represents 17.5 hours of work 
per week in one year, every single week, in order to qualify. 
Otherwise, he will not be eligible. He must reach this minimum 
number of hours. So, it is now twice as hard for newcomers on 
the labour market to qualify for unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	And what do they do to unemployment insurance? They create a 
fund and make it available to the provinces, and tell them: ``You 
can help yourselves to some of it, but only under certain conditions 
because we want to keep control over it, or else we are going to 
take it away''.
<P>
	But this fund the minister mentioned is made up of money 
contributed by employers and employees. Why is the federal 
government messing with this fund when, as everybody knows, it 
has not contributed a single penny to unemployment insurance 
since 1991? It is not this government who did that, but the 
Conservative government. But now it is a profit nowadays with 
unemployment insurance and is using part of this profit to provide 
manpower training in a field which comes under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	This is what we are against and what we are condemning. There 
is a small opening here. We saw that the Quebec National 
Assembly, while establishing some parameters, is continuing to 
emphasize the Quebec consensus on the need to repatriate all the 
money spent by the federal government in manpower training, even 
UI funds, because the federal government would use that money to 
continue to multiply programs and to maintain duplication.
<P>
	To conclude, I ask the government and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to be on the lookout, to listen more 
carefully to what Quebecers want. He will see that Quebecers, not 
only the sovereignists, the members of the Bloc Quebecois or the 
Parti quebecois, but all Quebecers want the Quebec government to 
be in charge, to be responsible for its policy concerning manpower, 
training and all related services. I will conclude on that and I thank 
you for your attention.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to the comments made not only by the hon. member but 
also by the critic who preceded him.
<P>
	What struck me is the lack of sensitivity to individual 
Quebecers, whether they live in Montreal, in my riding of Mount 
Royal, in Trois-Rivières, Quebec City, Chicoutimi, Lac-Saint-Jean, 
or anywhere else in Quebec, because people who used to pay UI 
premiums now have a need and a right to receive some money to 
help them when they are jobless.
<P>
	What stands out from all their arguments and remarks is that 
they want the power to make decisions with Canada's money. As 
usual, they forget to tell the truth. In fact, for every dollar invested 
in Quebec by an individual in the labour force, this individual 
receives $1.33 when unemployed. They want to deprive every 
unemployed person of this 33 cents, which over time adds up to 
millions and millions of dollars. What a great policy.
<P>
	They then completely overlook the fact that this change 
addresses realities in Quebec. Like other Canadians, Quebecers 
must adapt their skills, attitudes and abilities to the new society. 
They have completely forgotten this, and they want to set aside a 
rather significant amount of money. We have injected over $4.2 
billion into this program, but they have forgotten this and are 
unwilling to tell their constituents. I find this very interesting. You 
do not want to tell-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. secretary of state to 
please always address her comments to the Chair.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, through you, I would like to ask 
my hon. colleague the following question: does he not want to 
spread the news that the Government of Canada is pumping $4.2 
billion into the system instead of $4 billion, including more than 
$500,000 in measures for the unemployed?
<P>
	Also, of the $800 million $240 million would go to Quebec, for a 
total of $747 million in extra money, and he wants to take what 
away. Does he really want to deprive his constituents of that? My 
constituents want jobs, they want retraining, they want training, 
they want decent working conditions, they want wage subsidies and 
remuneration supplements.
<P>
	Regarding women, does my hon. colleague want benefits for 
women or does he want to take away benefits that help ensure the 
financial independence of women? We are talking about individual 
insurable earnings and basic employment insurance benefits 
calculated on these earnings that go to the women and not to 
government, for governance, but to each working woman.
<P>
	In addition, women who are currently holding more than one job 
or working part time at different places will immediately qualify, 
but the hon. member does not approve of this change. He does not 
want them to be recognized as part of this change or those in need 
of assistance, like low income families with children, many of 
which are headed by women, to be afforded protection by the 
reform. There will be family income supplements, but he does not 
want to recognize the fact that this may mean an increase of up to 
about 80 per cent in the basic amount for low income families. He 
does not want to recognize that fact.
<P>
	Neither do Bloc members, in spite of the fact that they are taking 
steps for reasons of efficiency relating to their culture, want UI 
recipients to be able to supplement  their income by earning $50 a 
week without seeing their benefits adversely affected. They do not 
want to recognize that maternity leave and parental leave 
allowances as well as sick benefits and temporary disability 
benefits are maintained and provide basic support to Canadian 
workers and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17217"> 17217 </A></B>
<P>
their families. They refuse to recognize the fact that the reform is 
actually helping women overcome barriers to employment as a 
result of reinvesting in targeted employment measures, daycare and 
income support.
<P>
	I for one would like to know why the Bloc members, who were 
elected to this place to represent their constituents at the federal 
level, cannot and will not recognize that the proposals will have the 
effect of better protecting families, and women in particular, and 
why they are so intent on not giving the plain and simple facts to 
their constituents. Why do they not at least have the openness to 
say that, from now on, anyone who has received UI benefits or a 
maternity leave allowance in the last three years will have access to 
job search services? Why do they refuse to spread this good news? 
Could the hon. member give me an answer on that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make a comment before 
replying to the secretary of state for the status of women. For 
reasons of time, I cannot answer all of her questions. However, I 
want to make an observation. Most of the hon. member's 
comments had to do with the UI project, while today's debate is on 
a motion dealing with manpower training.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Through the Chair-since we must always comply with 
parliamentary rules-I want to provide some information to the 
secretary of state for the status of women, who asked specific 
questions.
<P>
	Why is it that we, Quebecers and Bloc Quebecois members, will 
not fulfil her wish to see Quebecers accept that the federal 
government bypass their provincial government in order to go 
directly to individuals? That is what she said, they want to reach 
individual Canadians. The hon. member said that we are really 
turning this into a power struggle. This is what she is suggesting: 
``You are turning this issue into a power struggle and, because of 
that, we, the federal government, have a problem adequately 
reaching individuals''. Such a view truly reflects an attitude which 
still prevails and which has to do with reaching Quebecers, 
individually, in fields that come under Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	The hon. member sees this as a power struggle. Earlier, in my 
comments, I tried to show the adverse effects of maintaining such 
duplication on these same individuals who want to get proper 
training.
<P>
	At one time, there were 25,000 people in Quebec seeking to get 
vocational training, but unable to get it, because sometimes one 
level of government would not have the required funds, while at 
other times it would be  the other one. The funds allocated to a 
particular program had run out. There were some 30 federal 
programs, and approximately the same number of Quebec 
programs. Confused by all this overlap, the unfortunate individual 
was sometimes discouraged. Because they kept on trying others 
obtained the information they required, but it was often too late 
because the funds had run out.
<P>
	For example, people registering in employability enhancement 
centres could be asked if they were UI recipients. If they said: ``No, 
I am on welfare'', they would be told they did not qualify and 
should turn to the Quebec government or to Quebec funded 
agencies. The reverse was also possible for welfare recipients. It is 
always like that.
<P>
	I am quite familiar with current federal programs, because I have 
been studying the issue thoroughly for the past two years, and I can 
say that only 15 per cent of welfare recipients can benefit from 
federally developed or supervised activities. The same thing can be 
said about the province, and one must understand the reasons for 
that situation.
<P>
	As Quebec must pay welfare benefits, even if 50 per cent of the 
funds come from the federal government, the province was well 
advised to create programs that helped people qualify for UI 
benefits, which is what they did. When they qualified for UI 
benefits the federal government decided to develop a program to 
retrain them.
<P>
	I have been in the House two years now and I know that some of 
my constituents have registered in one program after another but 
are still unemployed because the system has not met their needs.
<P>
	We are exposing that problem and we want it solved. According 
to the consensus reached in Quebec since the employment forum, 
only one government, the Quebec government, should have full 
responsibility for manpower training. That is what Quebec wants.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before debate is resumed, I see the hon. 
member for Calgary Southeast in her place.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	The Chair has been asked to rule on the validity of the 
amendment made earlier today by the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast. Her amendment reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words be deleted after the word ``prevents'' and be replaced with 
the words ``the governments of all the provinces of Canada from adopting a true 
labour market training policy of their own''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The motion of the official opposition reads:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for choosing to reform 
unemployment insurance in a way that maintains overlap and duplication in the 
manpower sector and thus prevents the  government of Quebec from adopting a

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17218"> 17218 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Under the circumstances the Chair must rule the proposed 
amendment is not valid within our rules. Briefly, the reasons are 
that the amendment would change the nature of the debate 
significantly in two respects. First, the official opposition's motion 
focuses on Quebec only, as it is entitled to do, whereas the 
amendment enlarges the debate to all of the provinces.
<P>
	Second, the official opposition's motion refers to manpower 
development policy whereas the amendment proposed by the 
member for Calgary Southeast refers to labour market training 
policy.
<P>
	On page 257 of Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 929 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On an allotted day, during consideration of the business of Supply, an 
amendment must not provide the basis for an entirely different debate than that 
proposed in the original motion. <I>Journals</I>, March 16, 1971, p. 416.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Accordingly, and with thanks to the member for Calgary 
Southeast for her submission, the Chair must rule the amendment is 
not receivable and not valid under our rules.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	When we debate in the House we often think about what the real 
people with real problems and real challenges are thinking as they 
see us exchange points of view. I wonder today what the 
unemployed Quebecer in Chicoutimi, Laval or Trois-Rivières 
would think about the motion brought forward by the hon. member 
for Mercier and the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	What would the single mother think as she struggles to hold 
down two part time jobs, scared to death that her family will end up 
on the street? What would the older worker think who sees his job 
disappearing while all the new jobs required better skills? What 
would the small business owner think who wants to create jobs and 
hire new workers but cannot afford to compete with the UI 
economy? What would the young student think as she prepares to 
leave school and sees her older friends already collecting 
unemployment insurance for the third, fourth or fifth time at a very 
young age?
<P>
	These people are looking for a decent chance at a good job with a 
good income. Instead the Bloc Quebecois has unfortunately 
resorted to this motion, a motion I believe has nothing to do with 
reality. It has nothing to do with the real challenges real people face 
in Quebec and outside of Quebec or with the real thrust of the 
employment insurance bill.
<P>
	Instead, unfortunately the Bloc Quebecois wants to pick a fight. 
It wants to pick a fight where there is really nothing to fight about. 
Is the Bloc truly concerned about provincial jurisdiction over 
training? Perhaps it should listen to the Prime Minister, to the 
minister who wrote this bill. Bloc members must read the bill 
itself.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	The federal government is saying loudly and clearly that we will 
do nothing in this area without the express consent of the 
provinces. We will get out of any activities that might be seen as 
interfering with provincial responsibilities.
<P>
	Is the Bloc truly concerned about overlap and duplication? Then 
listen to what we are saying. We are saying loudly and clearly to the 
provinces: If you want to deliver the employment benefits under 
this new system, we can live with that. If you have your own 
programs that do the same thing, let us use your programs. If you 
want to find better ways to co-ordinate programs and get rid of 
overlap and duplication, then let us do it.
<P>
	The minister has extended an open hand to Quebec, to all 
provinces by saying let us build a new and better partnership. 
Quebec was the very first province to respond and the response was 
yes, let us talk. The Quebec National Assembly passed a motion to 
enter into talks with the federal government on the very same day 
the legislation was tabled.
<P>
	It is time that members of the Bloc Quebecois realized that time 
and reality have passed them by. Quite simply, the motion they 
have brought forward is out of date. It was made obsolete by the 
very bill they are trying to condemn. Let us stop. Canadians, 
whether they live in Quebec or outside Quebec, are tired of what 
really are imaginary battles.
<P>
	What Canadians want us to do as responsible members of this 
Chamber is to get down and do the job that needs to be done. They 
want us to create a climate where people feel secure, a climate 
where jobs are created, where people are given opportunities and 
are empowered to make the best decisions possible for them, for 
their community and indeed for their nation.
<P>
	As a federal member of Parliament, as a member of the Canadian 
government, I know we have made every effort possible to reach 
out to the provinces in the spirit of co-operation and goodwill. We 
have extended our hand to anyone who wants to sit down, to get 
together in a very meaningful partnership and implement the 
changes people are asking for.
<P>
	I respect the hon. member for Lévis as a very hard working 
member of the human resources development committee. Of 
course, I do not share his point of view in reference to the issue of 
separation and many others. Now is not the time to throw up our 
arms; it is a time to roll up our sleeves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17219"> 17219 </A></B>
<P>
	There are people out there who depend on legislators to bring 
about positive change to their lives. It is for this reason that I get 
up in this House convinced that the employment insurance bill the 
government tabled is a very good bill. It is worth supporting and 
takes into consideration the very sensitivities that the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Reform Party and Canadians in general have 
brought forward during the debate on social security review.
<P>
	What are we trying to achieve with the employment insurance 
bill? The employment insurance bill recognizes two fundamental 
things. One is that people during time of unemployment require 
income security. It is provided in the bill. It also recognizes the fact 
that there is a different economy out there. Long term 
unemployment since 1976 has tripled which speaks to the 
structural changes of unemployment.
<P>
	People are staying unemployed for a longer period of time. Why 
is that? Because they do not have the skills required to get the new 
jobs. We need to have an active measure introduced which is 
referred to as a human resources investment fund.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The $800 million human resources investment fund has five 
tools which include a target income supplement, wage top-ups, 
skills and loans grants. There are job partnerships and 
self-employment assistance which has been working extremely 
well. There have been 68,000 jobs already created. We have 
lowered premiums to generate job creation which benefits not only 
small business but also individual Canadians. We have reduced the 
maximum insurable earnings which again reduces the premiums.
<P>
	We have taken all those steps because we believe that the system 
needs changing. We are doing this also with a great deal of fairness.
<P>
	Low income families will be able to get up to 80 per cent of their 
average earnings. The 500,000 people who were excluded from 
unemployment insurance are brought into the system. UI 
exhaustees who were shut out of the past system are now brought in 
if they have had an attachment to unemployment insurance in the 
past three years. Anyone who was receiving parental benefits over 
the past five years will be able to access one of the re-employment 
tools which means they will be given opportunities for 
re-employment.
<P>
	Above all, we are not only modernizing the employment 
insurance system, but the net result of these measures through the 
various measures including a $300 million transition job fund will 
be the creation of over 100,000 new jobs for Canadians. We are 
doing this for the people of Canada who throughout the hearings 
told us that they wanted a system that would help Canadians get 
jobs, keep their jobs, a system that would help the most vulnerable 
and do it in a sustainable fashion. They  too understood that the 
program as it is today could not be sustained when in 10 years it has 
gone from $8 billion to $20 billion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his remarks, 
the parliamentary secretary talked about ``real Canadians'', and 
then about ``real problems''.
<P>
	We on this side also feel we are talking about ``real problems'', 
and we also happen to feel there exists such a thing as ``real 
Quebecers'', but they include not only Bloc members who are 
intent on paralysing the government. The parliamentary secretary 
himself read the resolution passed by the Quebec National 
Assembly. This resolution was supported and passed by all 
members. It was supported by the Parti Quebecois members on the 
government side, but also by members of the Liberal Party of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Needless to say, the official opposition does not feel isolated on 
this side of the debate as he would have us believe by saying we are 
the only ones who do not want to co-operate and discuss solutions.
<P>
	Let me put a few questions to the parliamentary secretary. 
Concerning the partnership he was talking about, what does the 
federal government intend to do about employability development 
organizations? I should point out that all of them have been advised 
that their mandate will be over on March 30th. What will happen to 
them after that? After all, they are funded by the federal 
government. Could he outline the alternatives for me?
<P>
	Time permitting, could he also tell me what will happen with the 
program for independent students? Funds for this program ran out a 
long time ago in many ridings. It is all very fine to have programs, 
but what good are they when there are no funds? What does the 
government intend to do between now and March 30th for those 
people who want to go on training? This is an existing program. 
What is it that prevents the federal government from keeping those 
programs alive until an agreement is reached?
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Lévis 
for his question which deals with an interesting point. He is 
concerned about what is going to happen with training institutions 
and the independent studies.
<P>
	The $800 million human resources investment fund that we have 
announced will target five areas. There will be agencies that will 
have to deliver this program. I also want to bring to the hon. 
member's attention, and I am sure it is good news he already knows 
about, the fact that it is not only $800 million. This will be added to 
a fund of $1.9 billion which means that we as the federal  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17220"> 17220 </A></B>
<P>
government are investing approximately $2.7 billion on those five 
tools.
<P>
	We are empowering individuals and local communities and 
provincial governments, if that may be the case. These programs 
will be delivered by organizations. Some of those organizations 
may be the organizations the hon. member correctly brought to the 
attention of the House.
<P>
	We have to put this debate into its proper context. The federal 
government felt that the system which presently exists was not 
working, and the hon. member knows this because Canadians told 
us from coast to coast to coast. There were far too many jobs and 
skills mismatched, which thereby also increased unemployment.
<P>
	What is positive about our program is that it is better targeted. It 
collapses 39 programs into five. They are five tools that we know 
actually work because over the past two years we have done 
experiments and pilot projects with these five programs.
<P>
	If we look at the self-employment assistance, 34,000 people 
participated and 68,000 jobs were created. If we look at the wage 
top-ups and earning supplements, these have also increased the 
duration that people stay on the jobs plus their income, which is 
something we need to address as a federal government. We need to 
provide people with job opportunities and also good jobs that 
increase income levels.
<P>
	Fundamentally I want to conclude my response by turning 360 
degrees to the hon. member's question on my earlier comments. By 
that I mean, as we debate this in the House of Commons, Canadians 
are faced with the challenges of an ever changing economy. I spoke 
about the young people, the older workers, the multiple job holder 
and the part time employees who under the present unemployment 
insurance program are being marginalized and excluded. We will 
find that Canadians will respond well to this employment insurance 
bill. It brings people into the fold. It provides greater income 
security and opportunities. It recognizes that in an ever changing 
economy we need to do things better. We need to target things 
better.
<P>
	From a fairness point of view there is the fact that low income 
Canadians with dependents will get a top up which will make them 
reach approximately 80 per cent of their average earnings. There is 
the fact that people who were excluded or were UI exhaustees in 
the past three years will have access to the programs. The only 
thing they have now is to go on social assistance.
<P>
	People who were on parental benefits in the past five years will 
also receive the opportunity to access one of the five pools of the 
human resources investment fund. That may be a very important 
bridge to the workplace, to get them back to work.
<P>
	Overall the reactions I have heard today have been balanced. The 
small business sector is applauding this move because it basically 
reduces its tax burden. Small  businesses really believe they are 
benefiting because through the employment insurance active 
measures they are actually going to have better human resources 
available.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	At the federal level we want to co-operate fully with our 
provincial counterparts to ensure we are doing this together, in 
partnership. In the final analysis, the employment insurance bill 
tabled last Friday is really about bringing positive change to 
people's lives and improving their quality of life.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank and 
congratulate again the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
	As you know, we are getting into a rather important debate which 
concerns a very large majority of my constituents in 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. I feel very emotional 
because, as a member of Parliament, every day I am made aware of 
requests which are sent to me, to my office or to various offices 
providing services to our constituents. We try to find ways to create 
appropriate and durable jobs in my riding.
<P>
	As for the motion the hon. member for Mercier put forward, we 
have the feeling that it was written before the minister introduced 
his bill here in the House.
<P>
	I sense in this motion that they are not willing to really work 
with the Government of Canada, that to a certain extent they 
question the sincerity of the members on this side of the House, 
that they question how seriously the Canadian government wants to 
get Canadians and Quebecers back to work, especially people 
living in remote areas.
<P>
	I want to tell you, mainly for the benefit of the population but 
also for the benefit of the hon. member for Mercier, who is the 
official opposition's critic for this department, that this piece of 
legislation is intended to limit and ultimately eliminate the 
well-known overlapping and duplication in the system.
<P>
	Again, for the benefit of the members opposite and of the 
population, I want to say that the program has been designed in 
such a way as to harmonize the programs we have to develop and 
create jobs across Canada.
<P>
	Besides, what are we trying to do? We are inviting the provinces, 
especially my province, Quebec, and its employment minister, 
Mrs. Harel, whom we have to call by her name today, to sit down 
with us in order to explore the opportunities provided to all 
Quebecers, businesses and the unemployed in particular, to create 
permanent and durable jobs, and to stimulate as well, of course, the 
economic recovery of our area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17221"> 17221 </A></B>
<P>
	Still, the minister spoke of five new conditions, that is five new 
programs, if you will, that from now on are provided for in the 
bill. We know very well that these five different kinds of benefits 
will surely help those truly in need.
<P>
	I still go back to my region and I know full well that the people 
who work in the natural resources area, especially those who work 
part-time and in seasonal industries, are often penalized by the 
current system. The system we are proposing will right this wrong 
which has been going on for much too long.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I can give you some first-hand examples. In the Magdalen 
Islands, there are fisherman's helpers-this is just one example 
among many others-who people used to work and still work 10 
weeks a year to qualify for 42 weeks of UI benefits. When the 
program was changed, they had to work 12 weeks to qualify for 
only 30 weeks of UI benefits. That meant 10 weeks without income 
for these fisherman's helpers who worked, might I add, not 35 
hours a week, not 50 hours a week, but rather 70 hours a week on 
average. Such is the life of a fisherman's helper in the Magdalen 
Islands, in the Gaspé Peninsula and, of course, on the lower North 
Shore.
<P>
	I can also give you similar examples of men and women who 
work long hours in the forest industry, throughout eastern Quebec 
and rural Quebec. Unfortunately, these people were penalized. The 
number of hours they worked was not taken into consideration. 
With the new system, we now know that 12 weeks of work equal 
420 hours of work. But I can assure the House that these people, 
these fisherman's helpers in the Magdalen Islands, for example, 
work an average of 700 hours in 10 weeks.
<P>
	These people will be able to qualify. The people will not go 
without benefits for 10 weeks, as we have seen these last two years. 
This is what the reform is all about. I think it is encouraging to see 
in this debate that both sides of the House recognize that seasonal 
workers do work hard and do put in countless hours of work.
<P>
	Thus, companies will be better able to evaluate the efforts made 
by these workers in various areas. I can tell you of all kinds of 
examples, such as people who work in fish factories. I met with 
some of them in Pasbébiac, Gascons and other ridings surrounding 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine who work close to 90 hours a 
week. That is substantial. Unfortunately, as we know, these people 
were not eligible because, depending on the species harvested in 
the summer, the fishing season is often restricted to 10 or 12 weeks.
<P>
	So I believe we have corrected an iniquity that harmed the 
regions. Of course, the opposition is claiming that these cuts are 
unfair and wrong; they mostly benefit people who earn no more 
than $40,000. Very few of my constituents earn $40,000 or more in 
seasonal jobs. Most  of them are low-wage workers who did not 
have a chance to become educated or to find long-term jobs. Life is 
not always easy and the first thing that we have to acknowledge 
here today is that we want to help those who really need it.
<P>
	I remarked to the hon. member for Mercier, the other day, that in 
her own constituency, there are female or male single parents with 
two or three children and an income of less than $26,000. They did 
not have certain opportunities. That is why we want to establish a 
program for the underprivileged who really need it.
<P>
	There is no shame in saying to those who earn $55,000, $60,000 
ou $70,000 in a few weeks, in the worst cases, or in a few months 
that they have to reimburse, in part or in full, the unemployment 
insurance benefits they received. That is fairness. That is justice. 
That is the principal purpose of federalism as we know it.
<P>
	I heard some positive criticisms, but when I hear members of the 
Bloc Quebecois say: ``We are not happy with the situation. We only 
want the federal government to transfer the whole amount directly 
to the province of Quebec and let it run the program altogether''.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	But no one on that side spoke about the difficulties encountered 
by the people, the problems they have in finding a job, in getting 
training. No one ever mentioned the 40 per cent dropout rate in 
Quebec.
<P>
	As members of the Canadian government, we believe in this 
decentralization, and I want to tell you, especially my good friend, 
the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, that the Canadian 
government, with the offices it already has, will now be able to 
work in co-operation with stakeholders, social and community 
leaders in all of the regions of Quebec and, of course, of Canada.
<P>
	We are ready to design programs that accurately reflect the needs 
of our regions, of our employers, of our workers. That is what we 
want to do. We do not want, like the SQDM and its 12 service 
points, to establish programs in Quebec City, which will then be 
imposed upon my constituents. For our part, with our 90 service 
points and the others which will be developed very shortly in the 
province of Quebec, we will at last fill a real and urgent need, that 
is designing programs that will help create stable, durable and 
lucrative jobs. That is the main purpose of this bill, as set out by the 
federal government.
<P>
	Unfortunately, my time has expired. There are surely a lot of 
questions. But I invite the opposition, and the people to review the 
information and to take advantage of the new programs, which are 
there to serve the people and not civil servants.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was much interested in what the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine said about the relevance of 
changing the system based on a number of weeks to one based 
on a number of hours.
<P>
	He gave us the example of people who will probably benefit 
from this. However, the problem with this reform does not 
necessarily lie in the fact that the number of hours is changed.
<P>
	Saying that someone will have to work 910 hours to become 
entitled to UI benefits for the first time means that young people, 
those who return to the labour market, women who left it several 
years ago or who worked at home will now have to work for 26 
weeks, 35 hours a week, to get UI benefits. The eligibility period 
has almost doubled.
<P>
	There are aspects of the reform which are unacceptable and I 
hope the government will correct them. I will give another example 
which concerns the ridings of Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
and Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. I am talking about the fact 
that, under the new system, seasonal workers will lose part of their 
benefits. After three years, people who receive unemployment 
insurance every year, such as workers in the tourist or fishing 
industry, will see their benefits reduced from 55 per cent to 50 per 
cent of their weekly insurable earnings. They are going to be 
penalized because they work in seasonal industries.
<P>
	Now that the reform has been tabled, could it not be possible for 
the government to bring forward amendments to correct these 
things which will have a devastating effect on regions such as 
eastern Quebec?
<P>
	My question to the member is this: What does he think about the 
possibility of our young people leaving our regions because of the 
increase in the number of hours it takes to be eligible for 
unemployment insurance?
<P>
	Will the requirement to work 910 hours, which is the equivalent 
of 26 weeks at 35 hours a week, result in our young people leaving 
the regions in greater numbers?
<P>
	I have another question that I want to ask of the member, 
reminding him that, yesterday, the National Assembly of Quebec 
also endorsed the current position of the government of that 
province by a 96 to 0 vote. It was a unanimous decision.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask him if he would be willing to table in the 
House a motion which would read as follows: ``Quebec must have 
sole responsibility for policies pertaining to manpower adjustment 
and occupational training within its borders and patriate 
accordingly the funding allocated by the federal government to 
these programs in Quebec''. Would he be willing to table such a 
motion, which was adopted unanimously by the only parliament 
that represents Quebecers only, in order to  settle the issue of 
manpower once and for all? Would he be prepared to ask the 
federal parliament to adopt such an attitude?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are many questions I would 
like to answer.
<P>
	First of all, we clearly show our confidence in Quebecers and in 
all other Canadians. I think that by giving each unemployed worker 
a certain amount of money, we give him or her the tools needed to 
create his or her own job by letting him or her decide which course 
answers his or her own needs. They can choose the courses that are 
adapted to the new economy that is emerging in each region.
<P>
	Decentralization is going directly to these people, to Quebecers. 
That is decentralization, and that is what the unemployed want. 
That is what we mean by change: giving people the appropriate 
programs, according to their own personal needs.
<P>
	I also want to answer my colleague's second question, about 
young people finishing high school, professional training, college 
or university, therefore for all young people. When I finished my 
studies-and that was not too long ago-my first priority was to 
find a job. I would rather use examples from my own region. When 
a young person graduates from school, he or she seeks a job to get 
experience, to show what he or she can do. This is why with the 
new programs like services Canada but particularly youth 
internship, we will tell the young person this: ``Listen, you have 
this much money, go to your employer and tell him that, thanks to 
the support of the Canadian government, you can subsidize part of 
your salary, on the condition that he promises to keep you on staff 
for a certain period of time''.
<P>
	I think we are investing in Quebecers. For too long, we invested 
in the public service, in obsolete programs or in programs that were 
not adapted to the real needs of the population. We listen to the 
population and to the unemployed but, unfortunately, this is not the 
case of the opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very brief question.
<P>
	The hon. member has spent a lot of time defending the 
government's unemployment scheme. I would submit there would 
not be any need for this debate if he would answer one simple 
question: Why does the government not return this program to its 
original mandate of being an insurance program, as it was in 1940 
when it was started?
<P>
	Liberal members defend this by saying that history says they are 
supposed to do all this and be involved in this area. That is not true. 
The original intent of this was to be a true insurance program. The 
government has strayed from this, which is why the Bloc is asking 
these  questions. That is why the Bloc has these concerns. That is 
why many provinces have these concerns.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17223"> 17223 </A></B>
<P>
	The member used the phrase ``we are going to serve the needs of 
the people'', and the hon. Minister of Human Resources 
Development in defending it said ``we are going to reduce the 
risk''.
<P>
	The auditor general says this unemployment insurance program 
the way it is presently structured is increasing the risk. Why do the 
Liberals not do the proper thing and put it back to a true insurance 
program? They admit that by decreasing the premiums five cents 
they will create something like 20,000 jobs. I do not know how 
they know this, but that is what they say. If that is the case, why do 
they not put it back to a true insurance program and reduce the 
unemployment rate by 1.5 per cent to 3 per cent? That is hundreds 
of thousands of jobs.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	It is totally inexcusable for the government to go off on all kinds 
of tangents and create more aspects for the program rather than do 
the right thing. I do not know how the hon. member could ever 
defend the fact that it is not becoming again a true insurance 
program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this government does not have any intention of going back 
to 1941. The basis of this reform is to ensure we answer the needs, 
the requests, and the demands of the new economy, which is 
completely different from the economy of 1941. In 1941 we were 
in the middle of a war. It was a completely different context. We 
did not have the new economic realities. We did not have 
computers and fax machines and the rise of a new economic class. 
We did not have the fundamental changes that have taken place in 
the last five years.
<P>
	We are trying to invest not in the government programs per se, or 
the fonctionnaires, but in younger Canadians, in middle aged 
Canadians, and in older Canadians. We are trying to define what 
they need. Often what they need is also what the new economy 
demands. This is why we have to adapt our programs. This is why 
we should invest in the individual. It is up to the individual.
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, the Reform Party has always upheld 
individual rights more than anything else. We are now investing in 
individuals. We have faith in Canadians to make the correct choice 
in order to find the course that is tailored to their needs and to that 
of the new economy. That is why I would ask the hon. member 
opposite to support the government in this courageous initiative.

	What they told the Quebec Legislative Assembly was not ``Let 
the federal government give money to the unemployed in voucher 
form so they can take Quebec courses under an agreement between 
the federal and the provincial governments''. No, what they said 
was ``Turn all of the responsibility over to Quebec, and it will 
handle things''. This statement was supported by both the 
sovereignist government party and the federalist opposition in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	They also stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government of Quebec and representatives of business, labour and the 
co-operative sector agree to oppose any initiative by the federal government 
that would constitute an invasion of Quebec's prerogatives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To find an example of this one need look no further than clauses 
61 and 59 of the bill which show that, where no agreement is in 
place between the federal and provincial governments, the 
province will be penalized because the unemployed will not 
receive vouchers to purchase courses in Quebec. If this is not 
invasion of our prerogatives, what is it? Is this not the kind of 
behaviour the federal government has been accused of for years?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17224"> 17224 </A></B>
<P>
	The reform as presented is not what Quebec wants. The 
consensus against it, which we have voiced here on numerous 
occasions, took on a particular historical value with the National 
Assembly's motion of yesterday.
<P>
	Continuing to quote the motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, it asks the government and the Minister of Employment to 
immediately undertake formal discussions with the federal government in order 
to ensure the respect of the consensus and the promotion of the interests of the 
Quebec people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What the MLAs who reached agreement on this, whether 
federalist or not, was not ``We must accept the planned reform as 
presented by the federal government''. They said it was necessary 
to ``immediately undertake formal discussions with the federal 
government in order to ensure the respect of the consensus and the 
promotion of the interests of the Quebec people''.
<P>
	This initiative by Quebec is therefore entirely legitimate. And if 
the present federal government is not listening, if it fails to change 
its reforms accordingly, it will be up against a wall. And as a result, 
it will again fail to deal with the problem.
<P>
	Why is Quebec so keen on controlling this jurisdiction? Because 
as much as $500 million will be invested in five new employment 
measures. And by 2001 and 2002, it may be $750 million. These 
employment measures affect all of the areas over which Quebec 
has jurisdiction.
<P>
	Canadian federalism is a very good example of inefficiency. 
Although Quebec is responsible for the Labour Code, occupational 
health and safety legislation and labour standards, the federal 
government will set up programs relating to wage subsidies and 
income supplements, a job creation fund, assistance for 
unemployed entrepreneurs, and a system of loans and bursaries. 
We will take a closer look at some of these to show the potential for 
conflict.
<P>
	For instance, the job creation fund. If Quebec wants an active 
employment policy, it must be according to the federal 
government's development model. If the Quebec government feels 
that the federal model is not the one it wants, and if current reforms 
are supposed to promote manpower mobility and get people out of 
the resource regions when we in Quebec prefer to promote growth 
in our regions, we will be stuck with this model forever.
<P>
	Another example is assistance for unemployed entrepreneurs, 
the program referred to as self-employment assistance. In Quebec 
the so-called Paillé plan was implemented. If Quebec wants to 
develop these measures, it will not be able to control them all, and 
we get a situation where people who receive self-employment 
assistance do not get the Paillé plan. If they are on the Paillé plan, 
they do not get self-employment assistance. This creates situations 
in  which young business people wanting to start up have to knock 
on the doors of two governments. This reform will not resolve the 
situation.
<P>
	My final example involves the loans and grants program. You 
may be sure that, in the medium term, the program, which is 
intended to provide grants to the unemployed looking for work will 
conflict with Quebec's loans and grants program for irregular 
students. We will start making comparisons, we will look at 
workers' behaviour to see whether they would not do better in a 
regular educational program than under the federal program. This 
will raise the level of the cacophony between the two governments.
<P>
	This is why, I think, the wish of Quebecers expressed in the 
National Assembly may be readily understood.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, after the consensus was reaffirmed, following the 
affirmation that Quebec must be solely responsible for manpower 
adjustment policy, the minister of employment was told to discuss 
matters with the federal minister. She did so right away yesterday. 
She wrote the Minister of Human Resources Development to tell 
him she was ready to discuss matters within the context of the 
mandate given her by the National Assembly. The mandate is to 
promote the interests of the people of Quebec and ensure respect of 
the consensus that Quebec must take control in this area.
<P>
	Why are we having such a hard time getting the federal 
government moving on this? When we toured Canada, last year, 
with the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, 
we found in several circles that there was a willingness to take over, 
through decentralization, certain aspects such as manpower 
training. Why is it that the federal government has not yet moved in 
that direction?
<P>
	The answer can be found in certain elements of the 
unemployment insurance reform. This reform adds to an already 
complex decision making process, thus assuring the bureaucrats 
running the national network that their empire will endure. The 
best way to perpetuate a bureaucracy is to make it more complex, 
thus justifying the existence of more assistants, more advisers, 
more this and more that, in the end making the product less 
accessible to the client they are supposed to serve.
<P>
	If there is one thing the government can be blamed for, it is its 
inability to cut through this bureaucracy and do what the people 
really want. I think that the federal government was being called to 
order by the motion passed by the Quebec National Assembly. The 
National Assembly has put the federal government squarely in 
front of its responsibilities.
<P>
	It must listen to the consensus conveyed by the Quebec National 
Assembly. I will stress that 96 voted for the motion, none voted 
against and none abstained. All the members present in the 
National Assembly supported  this motion. I would ask the Quebec 
members on the government side this: Are you willing to move a 
similar motion giving Quebec sole responsibility for policies 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17225"> 17225 </A></B>
<P>
pertaining to manpower adjustment and occupational training 
within its borders, and supporting the other proposals put forward? 
Are you listening to Quebecers as National Assembly members 
were?
<P>
	Are you willing to take action in your caucus, in committee, so 
that this reform can provide any province with a real opportunity to 
opt out and set up its own program, to have a real employment 
development policy, and to opt out of existing manpower 
development programs. The array of federal and provincial labour 
development programs is the laughing stock of all public services, 
with their confusing names and objectives. These things have never 
been properly clarified.
<P>
	The federal government claims it is making an effort, that we 
could agree on a set of rules. It is wondering why we on this side 
are not yet satisfied. It is because the federal government wants 
control over the guidelines. This means that, every time we want to 
change the way these programs are run, we must first negotiate a 
federal-provincial agreement, a kind of administrative agreement.
<P>
	This is unacceptable, in my opinion. Before any administrative 
aspect is negotiated, there must be agreements on the substance of 
the issue, and the Quebec consensus on the need to transfer all 
federal budgets allocated to this sector and to repatriate control 
over and management of the various employment services must be 
recognized.
<P>
	Quebec now faces a rather special situation. Because the federal 
government decided to maintain its network of employment 
centres, it is significantly reducing the number of points of service. 
This will result in fewer services being provided to unemployed 
individuals. These centres will serve a larger area than before. At 
the same time, another network set up by the Centre Travail 
Québec and the Société Québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre is also 
active in the field.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	In the days before the referendum, this government told us: 
``Yes, we will take into account the fact that you are a distinct 
society. We will take into account the aspects that make Quebec 
different''. However, after the referendum, we came back here and 
it was business as usual. It is always the same thing. The federal 
government claims to be able to do better than Quebec in the 
manpower sector. That view is not shared by anyone in Quebec, 
particularly in light of the results.
<P>
	The auditor general once said that the federal government did 
not have adequate control over its employability support programs. 
These programs are not effective, as evidenced by the fact that one 
million Canadians are out of work. Yet, the government remains  
insensitive to this fact and cannot bring itself to giving Quebec 
exclusive jurisdiction over the manpower sector.
<P>
	I am prepared to bet that, if the manpower sector was delegated 
to Quebec tomorrow, within about ten years there would be a 
significant change in attitude. Since the stakeholders would be 
closer to the field, Quebecers would benefit from a program better 
integrated with the education network. Ultimately, the existing gap 
between the number of available jobs and the number of available 
workers would be filled.
<P>
	This is where our record is the worst; Canada has an 
international reputation with the OECD for performing very badly 
in this area, because we administer things at a distance, with no 
attention to local needs.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to invite the federal government, 
particularly those members representing regions of Canada with 
economic and social objectives, and realities that are different from 
those of the ridings close to Ottawa, to make their points of view 
heard in caucus. This will ensure that regions so desiring may be 
given the necessary tools for development, and the attitude that 
there is one mandatory national standard can be scrapped.
<P>
	It would be heaven on earth, if all we needed for automatic 
bottom-line results was to set standards. If that were the case, with 
all the standards we have in Canada all of our problems would be 
solved by now.
<P>
	Essentially, the solution for Quebec lies in this consensus in the 
National Assembly, in which all of the parties agreed to the same 
thing: that Quebec be given control of the tools relating to 
manpower, even under the present federal arrangement. When we 
have this we will be able to get things done properly together. And 
we are asking our minister of employment-because she is 
answerable not only to her government but to all of the Parliament 
of Quebec in the National Assembly-to carry out formal 
discussions with the federal government aimed at ensuring that this 
consensus is respected and the interests of the people of Quebec 
promoted.
<P>
	The government will be judged on whether it agrees to integrate 
this consensus into its reform. If it does so, it will have Quebecers' 
gratitude. If it does not, this will be proof once more that more than 
50 per cent of Quebecers ought to have voted yes on October 30, so 
that we might finally escape from this unwieldy system which 
benefits neither Quebec nor Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I sit back and listen to the debate in the House. I listen to 
what Bloc is telling us and what it is saying about the government's 
unemployment insurance program. I have a much more 
fundamental question that needs to be asked. Why is the Bloc not 
asking the government why it is not creating more jobs? We go on  
nattering 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17226"> 17226 </A></B>
<P>
about why one province does not have more of this jurisdiction and 
we lose sight of the big picture.
<P>
	It is totally unacceptable that we continue to debate these five 
points and we forget why the people in Canada in the last election 
tried to put in place a government they thought would create jobs.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	For two years it has been going on and on and has not done a 
thing. Why is the Bloc not asking the government about some kind 
of job creation strategy. How many jobs are being created by this? 
How many jobs are being destroyed by the unemployment 
insurance program?
<P>
	The auditor general has said the unemployment rate is one and a 
half per cent to three per cent higher than it should be because of 
what the government is doing. It does not make the changes. Why 
is the Bloc not targeting that problem?
<P>
	Instead we go on about other things. We have some simple 
cosmetic changes that have been made like how many jobs does 
changing the name from unemployment to employment insurance 
create? Not one. In fact it destroys jobs because we now have to 
raise taxes. We have to do all these name changes on all the 
buildings, on all the letterhead and all this kind of thing. That extra 
tax will destroy more jobs.
<P>
	We are not addressing the fundamental problem of why we have 
such a high unemployment rate. We are being taxed to death and 
the government is using the unemployment insurance system as 
simply another tax to run some of its favourite programs.
<P>
	Those are the fundamental questions that should be asked. The 
Bloc should be asking those questions if it wants to claim to be 
official opposition in the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I agree with some aspects of 
what the previous speaker said. Canadians have every right to 
criticize the present Liberal government because it was elected on a 
platform of jobs, jobs, jobs, but in the end it is just coasting. It 
creates jobs piecemeal, while just as many are being lost, so that 
net job creation is zero.
<P>
	This government plays a lot with words, and I think that is 
significant. Instead of unemployment insurance it now says 
employment insurance, but for heaven's sake, the contents should 
be what it says on the label. There should be something to help 
evaluate the impact in terms of job creation and helping us to get 
out of this mess.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois are concerned about job creation. We 
see in these reforms a lot of measures that will have a negative 
impact on job creation, including the fact that young people who 
come on the labour market and fail to accumulate 910 hours will 
remain dependent, will go back on welfare and well become part of 
the welfare cycle. This is wrong and lends further credence to  the 
fact that this is a lost generation, and that we cannot accept.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois have a different perception of 
employment. We agree with the Reform Party in some respects. 
There is also a structural and organizational problem in Canada.
<P>
	We have developed a system in which one government has the 
power to collect taxes and spend money in jurisdictions it does not 
know and does not control, and has developed a fantastic 
bureaucracy to be able to function. This has created a lot of public 
service jobs but today, at the operational level, we realize this no 
longer works. Yes, we have a problem with the plumbing. We will 
have to deal with a number of things, but we also have a problem 
with the architecture: I am referring to the fact that governments do 
not have clearcut jurisdictions.
<P>
	From the federalist point of view, which I do not share, one could 
say it is entirely normal that in Canada international relations come 
under the jurisdiction of a federal Parliament. However, manpower 
is a not an area in which the federal government can be effective, 
and this is borne out by unemployment rates that are unacceptable, 
that are much too high and that show a significant spread. There are 
marked differences between the regions in central Canada and 
around the federal government, and more distant regions.
<P>
	The maritimes, Quebec and other regions outside larger urban 
centres always seem to have higher unemployment rates than the 
metropolitan areas. The system puts the regions at a disadvantage, 
which means that young people must look for employment 
elsewhere. If we keep the 910-hour standard, you will see a large 
number of young people between the ages of 18 and 23 who may 
have managed to get summer jobs in their own regions but will 
have to leave to get jobs in the city, and we are just going to 
aggravate this exodus.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Yes, the Bloc is concerned about employment, but as far as the 
solutions are concerned, we think it is also a matter of the structure 
and management of manpower training and also the fact that it 
should be more closely related to the needs of the people concerned 
and integrated with our educational resources.
<P>
	When we have a government like the one in Quebec that is 
responsible for the Labour Code, for occupational health and safety 
legislation and for labour standards, and we have another 
government that is going to introduce five measures dealing with 
issues such as wage subsidies and income supplements, this will 
further complicate the system. Someone somewhere in the 
Department of Human Resources Development will then be able to 
say he is an expert on something no one else understands.
<P>
	This means he can justify his job, but this is not efficient, and in 
North America we can no longer afford  to operate this way. If we 
want to be competitive on international markets, decision making 
must be brought as close as possible to the people. That should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17227"> 17227 </A></B>
<P>
the government's objective. If the federal government does not 
adjust and act accordingly, it will be swept away.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, things are becoming more and more curious as I listen to 
my colleagues from the Bloc and the Reform Party.
<P>
	I listened to Bloc members saying they agree with Reform. Then 
I listened to Reform members asking why government is not 
creating more jobs. That sounds a lot like the NDP. Then when we 
have the Reform and the NDP voting together against the 
government on issues like gun control, voting against the veto 
power, perhaps there is a reason for the hon. member's confusion.
<P>
	Speaking of confusion, I would like to touch again on a point of 
confusion my friend from the Bloc seems to have. He seems to be 
suffering from the same affliction as the member for 
Yorkton-Melville in that he thinks the government was elected on 
jobs, jobs, jobs. Again, there is probably confusion there given the 
close relationship between the former government, which did 
promise that, and the Bloc Quebecois whose members tend to be a 
lot of recycled Tories.
<P>
	I am wondering about the comment the member from the Bloc 
made with regard to what should have happened. This is not a 
world of should have but a world of what has happened. The people 
of Quebec rejected what was put to them by the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The member has made a strong statement that there is not going 
to be any agreement. I regret that because it seems the package put 
forward by the Minister of Human Resources Development goes a 
long way in allowing the federal government and the provincial 
government to work together to achieve exactly what we have been 
hearing from the member from the Bloc all year long. I encourage 
him and his party to co-operate with the government rather than 
destroy the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, when the government member is 
surprised that the opposition parties have similar views on certain 
things, this is perhaps the time to twig to the fact that, when you 
make campaign commitments, the decent thing to do is to honour 
them.
<P>
	When you say you are going to create jobs, you are supposed to 
have corresponding policies. When you defeat a government like 
the former Conservative one by saying that its policies were 
unacceptable, you have to meet the commitments you made 
subsequently. The idea is not to win elections, but to carry out 
mandates you  have been given. This is the goal and what must be 
achieved.
<P>
	There is a lesson for the government in this. For two years the 
Liberal government said there was no problem in Quebec. It told 
Canadians that there was no problem in Quebec, that, if it did its 
job right, there would be no more Quebec problem. But then they 
found themselves with 49.4 per cent of the people of Quebec saying 
yes to sovereignty. The Prime Minister is the intermediary between 
Canadians and Quebecers. Canadians realized that he had lost 
touch with reality and should perhaps be removed so people could 
talk directly.
<P>
	I think it important that the message be understood. Our 
objective should be effective government. On this point a number 
of parties could agree, why not have the same idea? Federalists 
should basically promote very broad decentralization if they really 
want this country to continue to function.
<P>
	In any case, throughout the world today, the solution lies in small 
groups, which have the tools to develop and do so successfully, 
controlling the course they want to take and making their own 
choices.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. A Liberal member misrepresented the position and 
the statement I was making. I made it absolutely clear that I was 
not expecting-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is not making a point of 
order, he is getting into argument. He will have an opportunity in 
debate to deal with what has been said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand Liberal members have been splitting their time and I 
have been asked not to split my time. I will be using the full 20 
minutes, plus the 10 minutes allotted for questions and comments.
<P>
	I rise today with some reluctance to speak on this motion. I hope 
to have an opportunity to speak on the bill and on the many good 
points in the legislation. However, today we are debating the Bloc 
opposition motion condemning the government's employment 
insurance legislation for maintaining overlap and duplication in 
labour market training. I will try to confine my comments to that 
motion and to the aspects of the bill which relate to that motion. 
However, I would like to speak about the many good things the bill 
will do and I hope to have the opportunity to do so in the future.
<P>
	If the hon. member and her colleagues in the Bloc had taken the 
time to give thorough consideration to the new employment 
insurance legislation they would see it does not maintain overlap 
and duplication in labour market training. After all, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development tabled the legislation only last 
Friday. It is a  comprehensive document which deserves serious 
consideration by all members of the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17228"> 17228 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The people of Quebec would be better served if the Bloc spent 
more time trying to understand this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Instead they are conjuring up fallacies about its implementation.
<P>
	To address the hon. member's motion directly, I suggest she 
refer to page 19 of the just published employment insurance guide. 
I know the hon. member has not seen this document. If she had she 
would not be wasting the valuable time of the House with this 
motion.
<P>
	On page 19 of the guide, under employment benefits, the last 
paragraph of the first column states: ``The legislation also proposes 
a new partnership with the provinces in order to eliminate 
duplication and encourage governments to work together to foster 
employment''. It says the federal government will work in 
partnership with the provinces to eliminate duplication. That also 
means eliminating overlap; they are, after all, the same thing.
<P>
	I do not know how much clearer the government can make it. It 
has been spelled out in the EI guide. I hope that by elaborating I can 
assist hon. members opposite, who still seem confused, to 
understand exactly what this means.
<P>
	The labour market training initiatives under EI are not the one 
size fits all programming approach taken by previous governments. 
The federal government will work with each province individually, 
including the province of Quebec, because Quebecers are 
Canadians and are entitled to the same considerations under this 
legislation as are all citizens of the country.
<P>
	We will work with each provincial government to help it deliver 
a federal program if it desires to do so or, and this is a key point, 
where a province is operating a program which will equally serve 
EI clients we will support that program. I do not know how much 
clearer I can make it for the members of the Bloc.
<P>
	If the provincial government of Quebec agrees or if it has an 
employment initiative which meets the employment benefits 
criteria of this legislation, we are fully prepared to work with the 
Government of Quebec to use that initiative to help unemployed 
Quebecers get back to work as quickly as possible. The same thing 
applies in every province and territory of the country.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	My colleague has already mentioned, but it bears repeating, that 
the good news is the Government of Quebec has passed a resolution 
that says it is willing to discuss labour market training with the 
federal government. Like my hon. colleague, I can assure  
members opposite the federal government welcomes this 
opportunity to work in partnership with the Quebec government for 
the benefit of Quebecers. The same philosophy will apply when the 
government is dealing with other provinces.
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians are very concerned about the impact EI will 
have on their lives. We understand we cannot deal with Nova 
Scotia the same way we deal with Saskatchewan. I should know 
since my grandfather and my mother are from Saskatchewan. My 
grandfather was an MP from Saskatchewan and spoke often of its 
concerns. They are not the same problems, they are not the same 
situations as they are in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	We are all Canadians but there are different circumstances in the 
labour market and they call for different approaches in different 
parts of the country. That is the beauty of the employment benefit 
measures under EI. They provide for local decision making and 
ensure appropriate accountability in local areas. Also, they 
emphasize individual responsibility and self-reliance. All of these 
things are much needed in this area.
<P>
	Media reports on this topic keep talking about cuts to UI as if 
that is all there is to this legislation. There is so much more. I look 
at this legislation as a Robin Hood response to a program badly in 
need of change and modernization. We are doing everything we can 
to maintain the benefits for those who need them most. We are 
helping out. We are providing a low income supplement for low 
income families with dependants so they will be better off in the 
future than they have been in the past. They will get more 
employment insurance than they would under the old UI system. 
They will get more now under this system.
<P>
	We are aiming at those. It is true we are cutting from people who 
make $70,000 or $80,000 a year and collect UI on top of that. 
People in my riding have been telling us to do that for a long time. 
They have been saying people who make $60,000 a year cannot 
keep taking out $10,000 or $20,000 on top of that in UI year after 
year, and after only paying in a few hundred dollars. They cannot 
keep drawing out when they already have high incomes. They will 
have to learn to spread those high incomes over the full 12 months 
of the year. That is only fair.
<P>
	People have been complaining in Atlantic Canada about that, in 
my riding certainly for a long time. We are hitting those people 
who really should not be taking UI every year, those with really 
high incomes. We are preserving it for those who need it most. That 
is a very important point. That is why I call this a kind of Robin 
Hood response to this problem.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleague, I think I caught you before your next 
sentence. That is what I wanted to do so I could take you back there

<P>
	As chairman of the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Transport, I am mindful that last year over 40 per cent of 
automobile fatalities involved a drunk driver. That startling 
statistic underlies the theme of this year's National Safe Driving 
Week, the hidden face of impaired driving.
<P>
	In addition to supporting public awareness campaigns, several 
provinces and territories are either currently implementing 
mandatory rehabilitation programs and administrative licence 
suspensions or plan to do so in the very near future. These 
measures will prohibit those charged with impaired driving from 
operating a motor vehicle while awaiting criminal court 
proceedings.
<P>
	Through ongoing initiatives such as National Safe Driving Week 
and the strategy to reduce impaired driving I am confident we will 
reduce the level of drunkenness, death and injury on our roads.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on October 30, the second largest Canadian carrier 
stopped flying from Montreal to overseas destinations. Canadian 
International has decided to concentrate its international operations 
in Toronto, thus depriving Montreal of a direct link to Rome.
<P>
	It is inconceivable that a major carrier such as Canadian 
International could stop providing international flights from a city 
as big as Montreal. This situation shows how flawed the transport 
minister's international route allocation policy is. In fact, Air 
Canada offered to provide regular flights between Rome and 
Montreal. The minister's policy, however, prohibits designating a 
second carrier for this market.
<P>
	Through his policy, the minister undermines Montreal's 
development and helps erode its traditional role as a Canadian 
transportation hub. The minister must stop putting Montreal at a 
disadvantage by changing his international route allocation policy 
and reviewing all routes already allocated.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians from sea to sea do not like the distinct society motion. A 
recent poll shows that only 37 per cent of Canadians outside 
Quebec support it.
<P>
	Albertans rejected this notion in the Charlottetown accord. They 
reject any concept that promotes the inequality of citizens or 
provinces or gives special status to any province.
<P>
	The arrogance shown by the Liberal Party during the referendum 
turned to panic and confusion when status quo federalism was 
rejected by nearly 50 per cent of Quebecers. The result is this 
ill-conceived motion. Surely the members opposite can see that 
this motion is ill-advised and it will further embitter and fracture 
this nation.
<P>
	Why are the Liberal members from Alberta mute on this issue? 
Why do they not speak out on behalf of Albertans? Can they not 
persuade their colleagues and their leader of the miscalculation of 
this motion? Too much is at stake to be silent. Canadians should 
debate this issue fully and not get closed off in the House of 
Commons. No, nervous nellies in the government invoked closure 
and are ramming it through. They seem proud of it.
<P>
	The people will speak. If they do not get a chance to speak now, 
they will speak later in Edmonton East at the ballot box in 1997.

do so, the Government of Quebec must regain control over the 
management of employment and manpower services, with fair 
financial compensation and no strings attached.
<P>
	Given that the National Assembly has instructed the Quebec

Quebec counterpart the unconditional transfer of responsibilities 
<P>
<HR>

for providing services and setting standards in the area of manpower, along with the related funds and fiscal resources?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the 
Quebec government accepted the amendment proposed by the 
opposition Liberals recommending that the Quebec government sit 
down and undertake a serious negotiation. That is a very good step 
which I think demonstrates there can be some openness in terms of 
pursuing these very important matters of how we can redefine the 
roles and responsibilities. I certainly will be approaching those 
discussions with a very open mind about the kinds of interests and 
the ways in which we can deal with the problem.
<P>
	We have been in contact with Madam Harel's office. We hope to 
be able to organize the meetings as soon as possible and as soon as 
we can fully look at all the respective programs that are being 
considered in light of the statement and conditions set forward last 
week by the Prime Minister.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
National Assembly's resolution clearly reaffirmed the consensus 
reached in Quebec that manpower issues should unconditionally 
come under the jurisdiction of the Quebec government, as 
prescribed by the Constitution.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the minister's answer that he is 
prepared to conduct discussions with the Quebec government about 
Ottawa's withdrawing, unconditionally and without federal 
standards, from the area of manpower and transferring related 
resources to Quebec, as requested in the resolution passed 
unanimously by the Quebec government and the Liberal 
opposition? Everyone agrees in Quebec. Does the minister really 
intend to do so?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was already made very clear 
in the Prime Minister's statement of well over a week ago that the 
federal government will withdraw from the area of manpower and 
training. We have made that very explicit. We have also followed 
that up with the legislation which was tabled on Friday. It will 
oblige the federal government to work in concert with the 
provinces in detailing those kinds of relationships. We made it very 
clear that there would be no training voucher of any kind without 
the consent of the provinces. We will be sitting down with the 
provinces to work out a clear harmonization of programs where it 
is required. It can develop beyond that.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	What is important-and this is what the hon. member should 
applaud-is that for the first time since the Quebec government 
was elected well over a year ago there has been a major change in 
its position. It is now willing to sit down under the present 
Constitution to talk about how we can establish a partnership to 
help people get back to work.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
convinced that not only the minister, but all those watching these 
proceedings and all members of this House understand our 
concern. The Government of Quebec was taken for a ride so often 
by the people opposite that we have become extra careful. We want 
to know if this is going to take place under optimal conditions.
<P>
	I would like the minister to be unequivocal. Will he agree, as 
suggested by the Quebec government at the request of the Quebec 
National Assembly, Liberals included, to discuss with the Quebec 
employment minister the possibility of repatriating to Quebec 
responsibilities pertaining to manpower without letting the threat 
of national standards hang over our heads as he has in the past? Is 
he prepared to make a commitment to achieve results along the 
lines of the consensus expressed by the Quebec National 
Assembly? I think that the question is clear enough to deserve a 
clear answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I gave a very clear answer to 
the previous question. We have already stated clearly in the House 
and we have entrenched it in the proposed legislation, which I hope 
the hon. member will vote for as he is so interested, that we 
recognize and accept the full jurisdictional competence of the 
provinces in the area of training. There is nothing ambiguous about 
that. It is perfectly clear.
<P>
	Now we have to sit down to work out the basic rules so that we 
can apply all the programs. We have to ensure that the clients of our 
insurance program who paid premiums to get benefits will be 
assured of receiving those benefits. It is as simple as that.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Since Friday, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development and the Minister of 
Labour have been repeating the refrain that the federal government 
will not use the unemployment insurance fund surplus to reduce  its 
deficit, but will instead put it into a separate reserve fund. Need I 
remind the Minister of Finance that, in his 1995 budget, pages 89 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17234"> 17234 </A></B>
<P>
and 94, he took those surpluses into account in calculating the 
revenues and expenditures of the federal government?
<P>
	Are we to conclude from the statements by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and the Minister of Labour that 
the Minister of Finance has decided to set up an unemployment 
insurance reserve fund and to give up on his plan to apply UI 
surpluses to the federal government's revenues and expenditures?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer the hon. member 
by simply repeating what we said yesterday.
<P>
	During the course of our extensive public discussions we 
received a number of recommendations, including 
recommendations from the trade union movement in Quebec, that 
we establish a reserve fund to stabilize premiums. In that way we 
could prevent the kind of drastic economic downturn which 
occurred in the early nineties when, because there had been no 
reserves set aside, the recession was worsened by the previous 
government's necessity to substantially jack up premiums.
<P>
	That was recommended by the trade unions in Quebec. It was 
recommended by business groups and by the general public. It is 
good, prudent economics to set aside a reserve fund so we will not 
have the additional costs faced in 1992 which would make a 
downturn worse than it would be otherwise.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr.

Development answering-everything is topsy-turvy. I shall repeat 
the question.
<P>
	It is clearly set out in his budget, as in the federal government's

indebtedness of the federal government.

<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Under these circumstances, is it or is it not true that the federal 
government intends to set up a reserve fund. If so, will the Minister 
of Finance admit that his deficit forecasts based on using the UI 
surplus will be struck a fatal blow by the creation of this reserve 
fund?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just let me answer the  
member directly as to how it does affect the deficit not just of the 
government but of the people of Canada.
<P>
	Because of the failure of the previous government to set up a 
reserve fund in order to stabilize premiums, the interest charged 
against the UI account between 1992 and 1993 amounted to $1 
billion which had to be paid by workers against the premiums. That 
is what members of the Bloc Quebecois are now recommending, 
that we put additional burdens on workers because they will not 
support the establishment of a reserve fund.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when it comes to some provinces, the government's 
attitude is now we see them and now we don't.
<P>
	The federal government has been utterly indifferent to B.C.'s 
concerns on aboriginal issues and the mismanagement of the 
salmon fishery, and the Prime Minister's constitutional veto 
scheme ignores British Columbia completely. About the only time 
the government recognizes B.C. or Alberta is when it comes time 
to extract money. These western provinces are becoming 
increasingly alienated from Ottawa. That alienation will deepen 
when the human resources minister withholds $47 million from 
B.C. for introducing residency requirements for welfare.
<P>
	What does the human resources minister really expect to 
accomplish by fining British Columbia for attempting to manage 
its welfare rolls more effectively?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very surprising 
question coming from the leader of the third party whose members 
stand up every day and demand that we ensure that individuals live 
up to the law.
<P>
	The British Columbia government has broken the law. If I 
understand the leader of the third party, he is saying that it is okay 
for the provinces to break the law but it is not okay for individuals. 
We believe the law applies to everybody whether they are a 
provincial government or an individual.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the law is not the issue. If the provinces could fine the 
federal government for every commitment it has broken, they 
could pay off their deficits.
<P>
	The real issue here is the government's Neanderthal approach to 
federal-provincial relations. The government talks about ushering 
in a new era of flexible federalism. The reality is that a bankrupt 
federal government is attempting to use fines and threats to control 
provincial areas of jurisdiction.

<P>
	The human resources minister attaches strings to manpower

Minister of Health does exactly the same things to Alberta.
<P>
	Is this really the government's vision of federalism, federalism 
with strings attached, red tape federalism, federalism by threats, 
federalism by fines?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that the hon. 
leader of the third party is looking in a mirror. That is his version of 
federalism. I will tell you what we see. We see a federalism which 
allows and enables Canadians to move freely throughout this 
country to search for work and to exercise the right of mobility.
<P>
	It is very interesting that in its proposal the Reform Party says 
there should be a free movement of goods and a free movement of 
services, but apparently in the lexicon of the Reform Party there 
can be no free movement of people. The real problem is to defend 
the right of Canadians to move freely about this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government imposes fines on British Columbia and 
Alberta to impose its outmoded view of federalism. It dismisses 
fundamental objections to its ill-conceived Quebec package from 
western provinces out of hand.
<P>
	All of this undermines rather than strengthens national unity. In 
its misguided attempt to appease Quebec separatists, in its 
ham-fisted approach to retaining federal control in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, the government runs the risk of pushing 
provinces like British Columbia and Alberta out the back door.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development realize 
that his steadfast resistance to real decentralization is as great a 
threat to the national unity of the country as the efforts of Quebec 
separatists?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the real threats to 
Canada is the balkanized, fragmented, mean-minded attitude 
expressed by the leader of the Reform Party. That is the real danger 
to the federalism of the country.
<P>
	If he knew his facts, which he does not, he would recognize that 
we put in place last year a new transfer payment that would give the 
provinces brand new flexibility in making choices and the 
provincial premiers could set up a process to begin discussing it.
<P>
	The ministers of British Columbia were a full part of it but 
refused to bring their concerns in front of the provincial body 
where those decisions could be made. They acted unilaterally 
without any discussion with  ourselves or the other provinces. They 
took an action which broke the law.
<P>
	We went out there three weeks ago to say let us find a solution, 
let us negotiate, let us find a partnership. There was absolutely no 
support from this gentleman or his party for the kind of federalism 
which must be based upon partnership and co-operation, not the 
kind of fragmentation this gentleman represents.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In his reform, the minister takes advantage of the conversion of 
weeks worked into hours worked to reduce still further eligibility 
for benefits as well as their duration. Whereas someone now needs 
between 180 and 300 hours of work to qualify for benefits, in future 
this figure will be between 420 and 700 hours.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that, by doubling the number of hours 
required to qualify for benefits-or worse-in both high 
unemployment regions and others, he will exclude thousands of 
unemployed people from the plan, women and young people in 
particular, who will then have to turn to welfare?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one reason for moving to an 
hours based system, which is quite a fundamental reform, was to 
ensure that we would give full credit to all the work that was done.
<P>
	For example, in many high unemployment areas where there is a 
lot of seasonal work, many workers put in long hours, 40 or 50 hour 
weeks, for which they get no credit. They get exactly the same 
credit as somebody who works 20 or 25 hours.
<P>
	As a result of this major changeover, many of those who are in 
seasonal work and work very long hours for very short periods can 
establish their eligibility sooner and receive benefits longer. A 
quarter of a million Canadian workers who presently pay into the 
system would be able to have a longer term of benefits than they do 
now because of the hours based system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bulk 
of part time and term employees are young people, women, or new 
workers. These are the ones who will be affected by the minister's 
reform.

<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17236"> 17236 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	Does the Minister acknowledge that, by requiring 35 hours of 
work instead of 15 for eligibility for a week of benefits, he is 
reducing the duration of benefits considerably for part time 
workers, most of whom are young people or women? Seventy per 
cent of part time workers are women and 40 per cent are young 
people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I ask the hon. member 
to look at the package in its entirety.
<P>
	One of the most important changes we have made is to break 
what has been commonly known as the glass ceiling. That was a 
very strong recommendation made during the public hearings. That 
is the rule whereby 15 hours is the dividing line on which eligibility 
is established.
<P>
	Many employers across the country establish an artificial barrier, 
giving work only up to the 15-hour level so they would not have to 
pay premiums and give people eligibility. As a result a lot of people 
were denied work and, more important, were denied the 
opportunity to have the security of the program, to have access to 
maternity benefits and to have access to the re-employment 
measures.
<P>
	We have broken that glass barrier and we will now allow the 
work to take its natural course. Therefore people will get more 
hours than they can under the present artificial barrier.
<P>
	At the same time for part time workers we are establishing a 
major premium rebate. Close to 1.3 million of the present 2.2 
million part time workers who now pay into the system, something 
the Reform Party has not quite understood yet, will be eligible for a 
refund of all the premiums to ensure basic balance and equity in the 
system.

important change in our evolution as a country.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Heritage if this is for real. If so, why did the Canadian public not 
even have a say on it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the coat of arms was approved by the Queen in 1987. I 
am always prepared to have great parties to celebrate events but 
this one would be a little late.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
press release says that the Canadian coat of arms proposed by 
Bruce Hicks of the press gallery was approved by Queen Elizabeth 
on July 12, 1994, not 1987.
<P>
	The point is that this issue has not even come before Parliament; 
it has not even come before the people of Canada.
<P>
	My question is about symbols. These symbols do not belong to 
the Liberal government; they belong to the people of the country. If 
this is real, why has Parliament not even discussed it?
<P>
	We have seen closure on the distinct society motion. We have 
seen closure on constitutional vetoes. Why are we now seeing 
closure on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, perhaps I could make a brief correction on dates. The 
date I gave is correct. That was when the coat of arms was 
approved. What happened more recently was that the Queen 
decided it could be distributed all over Canada. That is the 
difference in dates.
<P>
	As to the authority, we should remember that the coat of arms is 
under the authority of the Governor General of Canada. If the

Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	With his reforms, the minister has taken the first step towards 
establishing an employment insurance system that discriminates 
against seasonal workers, whose benefits will be reduced 
depending on the number of weeks they were on unemployment 
insurance in the past.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that this is a complete 
contradiction of the recommendations of his task force on seasonal 
employment and of his own commitments, in that he is creating a 
two-tier system in which seasonal workers will be treated like 
second class unemployed workers?
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic  
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first we should put this matter 
in context. Just 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17237"> 17237 </A></B>
<P>
over a decade ago about 15 per cent of UI claimants were those 
who used the system on a regular basis. Today that number is well 
over 40 per cent. There has been an incredible expansion or 
explosion. That was one of the reasons the cost of the system had 
gone from $8 billion to $17 billion when we inherited it in 1993.
<P>
	As the hon. member should know, the system was no longer 
being used to assist people who are unemployed or to enable people 
to get back to work. It was being used increasingly as a form of 
supplement to wage packages by a wide variety of industries.
<P>
	A very strong recommendation came out of the public hearings 
that were held. The seasonal workers report established that it did 
not agree with the notion of a two-tier system. It talked about a 
graduated response that would apply the principles of experience 
rating. As with any insurance policy, a different premium level is 
applied the more we use it. That is the kind of principle we have 
applied here.
<P>
	It is a very modest one. It is there to provide a certain deterrent to 
increased use. It is not discriminatory. It is simply to recognize and 
evaluate the very serious cost of the program as a result of the 
incredible expansion in use over the past 10 years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, seasonal workers are honest users of the system and are 
only guilty of supporting the seasonal economy in the regions.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that regions whose economy is 
largely based on forestry, the fisheries and tourism, as is the case in 
eastern Quebec and eastern Canada, will be among the principal 
victims of his reforms and that they will become second-class 
regions with second-class unemployed workers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that the hon. 
member did not listen to the previous answer.
<P>
	However, a quarter of a million workers in seasonal industries 
will be able to receive benefits for a longer period of time. If we 
add up the actual dollars, it will be more dollars because of the 
hours based system. The shift to the hours based system means that 
for the first time full credit or full value is given for the full work 
they do. That is what workers want. They want to be given full 
credit for the amount of time put in and not have a bunch of 
artificial formulas applied to them.
<P>
	That is what we have done. Every dollar and every hour now 
count toward credit in the new employment insurance system.

directed to the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	As we know now, the minister's reforms will triple the number 
of hours required to be eligible for unemployment insurance for the 
first time, from 300 to 910 hours. In so doing, the minister 
penalizes thousands of young people who are trying very hard to 
get into the labour market as well as thousands of women who want 
to go back to work, because they will need more than six months of 
full time work to qualify.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that all workers who lose their jobs and 
apply for unemployment insurance for the first time after having 
worked less than 18 hours a week for one year, will not be eligible 
for benefits, even if they paid premiums during that time?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting that the 
question cited as reference the report of seasonal workers. That 
same report recommended strongly that there be stronger 
eligibility requirements for young people because it was noticed 
that many young people were simply using a minimum amount of 
work to get into the system and therefore becoming dependent on 
cycles year after year.
<P>
	Our response has been very clearly twofold. First, we have 
shifted, as the hon. member should know, to a much stronger series 
of measures to help people, including young people, get back in the 
job market quickly and effectively.
<P>
	Second, we have increased our budget for youth employment by 
15 per cent this year. In the first year of operation of a youth 
internship we already have 25,000 young people working in 
business to make that transition. Our belief is to use positive, active 
measures to help our young people get into the workforce.
<P>
	Furthermore, there is one important thing the hon member 
should know but does not. We are extending those active measures 
to people who have paid into the new employment insurance 
system for a period of three years. All those employment measures 
are available even to those who have exhausted their claims. They 
will now have the benefit of our employment measures.

unemployment insurance as a drug.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question from a different perspective. Does 
the minister agree that individuals who work less than 490 hours 
annually will never be eligible for unemployment insurance 
although they have to pay premiums, which has not been the case 
so far?
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	This has been debated for many years. We have finally said the 
old system which purely provided benefits was not sufficient to 
help people get back to work. We have shifted those resources into 
effective measures of employment, things like the 
self-employment measure, things like the development of a wage 
supplement to provide for small business.
<P>
	We are using those measures to help people get back to work, to 
make up those hours because we happen to believe that everyone 
would rather work than simply stay on benefits. We are now giving

the Minister of Justice agree that the wording of Bill C-110 is such 
that the federal government is free to circumvent the Quebec 
National Assembly and, for instance, call a federal referendum in 
Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the important thing to bear in mind 
is nothing in Bill C-110 changes the formula for amending the 
Constitution, as set out in part V of the Constitution Act of 1982. 
What is required under section 38, as the hon. member well knows, 
is the agreement of seven of the ten provinces expressed by 
resolutions passed by their legislative assemblies. That is what is 
required before a constitutional amendment can take place.
<P>
	All Bill C-110 provides is that before the Canadian government 
will participate in such a change, and after seven legislative 
assemblies have expressed their agreement, it will determine the 
consent of the provinces to the extent of the majority as described 
in the bill.
<P>
	What constitutes consent could very well be the legislative 
assemblies' statement. It could be an expression of support by the 
government of the province or it could be expressed directly by the 
people. That flexibility is one of the real advantages of the 
legislation.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

emotional, controversial and moving in Canadian history. It gave 
all Canadians an opportunity to participate in the development of 
the symbols of the country.
<P>
	We are now told our new coat of arms is ready for distribution

Speaker, the hon. member has asked a serious question. Although 
it is on short notice I will try to present her and the House with 
some information I just received.
<P>
	I have in my hand a booklet entitled ``Symbols of Canada'', 
published by the Department of Canadian Heritage. On page 5, 
under the heading ``Armorial Bearings'', which I understand is 
another term for coat of arms, it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Adopted: By proclamation of King George V on November 21, 1921. On the 
advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, Her Majesty the Queen approved, on 
July 12, 1994, that the Royal Arms of Canada be augmented of a ribbon with the 
motto of the Order of Canada, desiderantes meliorem patriam-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	-they desire a better country.
<P>
	I hope my hon. friend also desires a better country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, of 
course I absolutely do want to see all of us build a better Canada, a 
better future. However, the issue here concerns the embargo until 
yesterday, December 4, 1995, and that part of my question was not 
addressed.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	Further to that, if indeed the House of Commons represents a 
place for all Canadians to come and debate through our 
membership, I would like to know why we did not have a broad 
debate in the House of Commons to discuss this very basic simple 
issue.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I understand it-I will be corrected if I am wrong-this booklet I 
have was distributed to all members of Parliament and to the 
public. It was distributed some time ago. It is hardly a secret.
<P>
	I want to add that as far as I am aware, while there has been a 
debate and vote in the House on the Canadian flag and a debate and 
vote in the House on our national anthem, the matter of the 
armorial bearings of Canada has been something for decision of 
Her Majesty the Queen of Canada and not for the House of 
Commons. So I see nothing to criticize this government over the 
actions of Her Majesty the Queen.

	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	Seniors have come into my office complaining about the long 
line-ups at customs as they return home for the holidays. By the 
time they reach customs they are quite tired from their flights. Can 
the minister tell the House what he is doing to ensure that seniors 
and other  travellers can move through customs without having to 
stand in long line-ups?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to report that Canada Customs is fully 
prepared to provide extra services at the border during this holiday 
season. There is an increase in traffic at this time. A large 
proportion of the 110 million people who come into Canada come 
at that time.
<P>
	Our job is to provide, through extra shifts, part-time workers, 
and some student customs officers, the best possible service at this 
time. In addition, this year we will also have at our busiest airports 
special client service representatives to assist those who may be in 
trouble.
<P>
	I think we should recognize that the customs service of Canada is 
probably the best in the world. They work very hard and long hours 
during the holiday season protecting this country against illegal 
weapons, drugs, and other such things. I hope the House will 
recognize the important work they do, particularly at this time of 
year.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The last government walked away from the unemployment 
insurance fund and this government has done nothing to bring itself 
closer. Would the minister tell us why he thinks he has the moral 
authority to take another $1 billion out of the pockets of 
unemployed Canadians on top of the $7 billion he took out last year 
to use to pay down the deficit, which those people made no 
contribution in creating?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been through this 
territory several times, but I would be quite happy to try to repeat it 
for the understanding of the hon. member.
<P>
	First, the proposed changes are designed specifically to help 
create jobs in this country. A large part of that amount goes to 
re-employment measures, which will enable people to get back to 
work. The remaining portion goes to help establish a fund to 
stabilize the premiums.
<P>
	The hon. member was in this House during the 1990s. He knew 
what happened when the previous government had to raise the 
premiums by 95 cents over a period of two years. It threw the 
market into total havoc. It drove down the economy. It put an extra 
burden on workers. It destroyed jobs.

The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I am informed that you have two 
minutes remaining in your speech. This will be followed by a 
five-minute question and comment period. I understand you are 
sharing your time with another hon. member. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is correct.
<P>
	My wife is often astonished at how quickly and how frequently 
the schedule changes for a parliamentarian. This is an example of 
that. When I rose to speak an hour ago I said I would speaking for 
the full 20 minutes and now it is 10 minutes. I happy to comply and 
adjust my schedule again.
<P>
	Before question period I was saying that the bill was a Robin 
Hood response to the problem we have with the UI system. In 1983 
the UI system cost $9 billion to employers and employees across 
Canada. Today it costs $17 billion. The growth in the cost of this 
program has represented a tax on jobs in Canada and we have to 
deal with it.
<P>
	People in my riding tell me that it has been misused in many 
ways and it is time to deal with it. But how do we deal with it? And 
why am I calling it a Robin Hood response? Because we are dealing 
with this problem of reducing the cost of the program by reducing 
benefits for the well off who have been breaking the system for a 
while and increasing benefits to the poor. The low-income people 
who have dependants will get up to 80 per cent, rather than 55 per 
cent of their previous income under this system. So it is an 
important step forward and we are maintaining the program as 
much as possible in a very solid way for those in the middle. That is 
a very important point.
<P>
	Finally, I want to mention the issue of involuntary part-time 
workers. I have been involved in the food bank movement in the 
Halifax area, as people in my riding would know. One thing we 
always complained about for low-income people is the growing 
number of people who have to work part time because they could 
not find full-time work. One reason for that has been the incentive 
provided in part by the UI system to employers to only hire 
part-time workers, who would work less than 15 hours a week so 
they would not have to pay these UI benefits, for example.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	By moving to an hourly based system where every hour counts 
and every hour has premiums paid on it, it means that people who 
are working part time will qualify for UI and the incentive for 
employers to hire only part time will no longer be there. These are 
important and positive points about this employment insurance 
program.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to vote against this Bloc motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to the speech by the member for Halifax West. I was 
surprised, because he is from one of the Atlantic provinces, that he 
had no criticism of the unemployment insurance reform. His is one 
of the regions that will be affected most in Canada following the 
unemployment insurance reform. The member sees only positive 
effects, but his region will surely suffer negative and disastrous 
consequences.
<P>
	I come from Latin America, and sometimes representatives of 
the International Monetary Fund, who travel throughout Latin 
America, tell governments that they must make cuts, reduce 
salaries or terminate unemployment insurance or social security 
programs. From what we see here in Canada, it looks like policy is 
being dictated by the International Monetary Fund or the OECD.
<P>
	I would like to know the member's opinion. What does he think 
of the negative consequences of the system set up by the Minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17242"> 17242 </A></B>
<P>
of Human Resources Development  for the Atlantic region, which 
will be hit just as hard as Quebec and other regions in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, they are incredible. The Bloc members 
are unable to see the benefits of these changes to the system. They 
fail to see the problems with the old unemployment insurance 
system.
<P>
	Yes, I come from one of the Atlantic provinces. But, in these 
provinces, in my region, many people recognize that the old 
unemployment insurance program needed to be changed, renewed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member speaks about my region being hard hit by these 
changes. As a matter of fact I think the member should examine the 
proposals a little more carefully and see exactly what is happening. 
The fact of the matter is that 45,000 more seasonal workers in 
Atlantic Canada will have access to employment insurance because 
of these changes.
<P>
	Yes, there will be a reduction in the overall amount being spent, 
but we are focusing it much better toward the creation of 
employment, toward employment assistance programs, toward 
training programs, toward important things that are required to 
move this system away from unemployment insurance to insurance 
of employment, which is what it is all about.
<P>
	In the year 1997-98 there will be a total net decrease of about six 
per cent. By the year 2001 the total decrease in the whole impact of 
the program will be about seven per cent. Considering that the cost 
of the program has gone from $9 billion 12 years ago to $17 billion 
today, it should not be surprising that we need to have some 
changes to this program. The fact that the total impact over the next 
five or six years will only be seven per cent total for this region 
should tell the hon. member something. We have done this by 
making sure that those who need it the most still have it. This 
means it will work well in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, studies have shown that the utilization of unemployment 
insurance benefits is very hard to forecast. The reason is that 
institutions tend to exploit the opportunities. For example, we 
know institutions developed in Atlantic Canada that allowed 
workers to work for exactly 12 weeks in order to qualify for 
benefits and then the next batch came in to work for 12 weeks. This 
is how the cost increased.
<P>
	I wonder whether the Department of Human Resources 
Development has looked at the possibility of similar institutional 
developments coming forward in the context of now making 
part-time workers eligible.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am aware that the department has 
examined many aspects of the bill. There will also be an ongoing 
monitoring process by the Employment Insurance Commission.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been saying that we should make it much 
more like an ordinary insurance system, maybe even make it a 
totally privatized system. This shows me that Reform Party 
members are not responsive to the concerns of Atlantic Canada, 
that they do not care one iota, not one ounce, not even a smidgen 
about the people in Atlantic Canada. Otherwise they would not 
hold that position.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what counts for Canadians is jobs, and that is what counts 
for the government as well. This is also the fundamental objective 
of the bill on employment insurance, which the opposition motion 
is so wrongly criticizing.
<P>
	The bill does more than protect the incomes of the unemployed. 
It is based on the principle that we must more actively help people 
find work. And it is based on the requirements of a modern 
economy. Another question, however, is central to the debate. The 
employment insurance bill announces a completely new way to 
view the role of the provinces in the labour market. This is one 
indication of this government's flexibility in past matters and its 
continued flexibility in federal-provincial matters.
<P>
	The issues on creating and maintaining jobs had to be gone at in 
greater depth. A serious look had to be taken at ways of combining 
our efforts with those of the provinces. This means understanding 
jurisdictional problems and finding solutions.
<P>
	We take into account the fact that the provinces are responsible 
for education and job training. We accept the point of view held by 
many in Quebec and elsewhere that the federal government should 
not get involved in job training. We acknowledge that the federal 
government should not get involved in activities that risk changing 
provincial priorities in the area of job training.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Last Friday the Minister of Human Resources Development 
restated that commitment. He went further. He outlined how the 
new employment benefits under employment insurance would 
assist in getting Canadians back to work. Needless to say, they will 
be much more respectful of provincial responsibilities in this area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17243"> 17243 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Quebec provides an excellent example of this sort of active 
approach: collective organizations and partnerships such as the 
Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The employment insurance bill provides for a new balance to 
federalism. This is what we see in employment benefits. It is based 
on an answer to a very important question: Would a new set of roles 
and arrangements between the federal and provincial governments 
do a better job of getting Canadians back to work and would it do 
that more efficiently?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The answer to this question is yes. And now is the time to say 
yes. Quebec is the very place this answer has to be given. We will 
no longer be buying training courses from public or private 
institutions. We will withdraw from apprenticeship, work-study 
and training programs at the workplace. These measures are in 
keeping with the consensus in Quebec.
<P>
	However, while the federal government no longer intends to play 
a role in manpower training, it does intend to continue its role in 
helping the unemployed return to work. The new employment 
benefits will represent an investment in people. We want to spend 
this money so effectively that our clients will never need us again. 
We want to spend this money on, devote it to activities that will 
ensure the best results.
<P>
	Wage subsidies, for example, will help employment insurance 
clients find work, and we are talking here primarily about people 
such as those with a disability, who have a harder time of it.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Income supplements will help employment insurance clients 
find work; most of these people may need short term financial 
assistance.
<P>
	Job creation partnerships will help create new jobs for 
employment insurance clients.
<P>
	The five measures we have just mentioned are not programs; 
rather, they outline the types of needs on which we have decided to 
focus our efforts.
<P>
	We are reaching out to Quebec and we are ready to work with its 
employment development programs and tools.
<P>
	Through the strategic initiatives program, the federal 
government already supports two Quebec programs that should 
allow all of Canada to learn important lessons on the labour 
market. Federal support for PWA will help over 25,000 families 
throughout Quebec benefit from this important program every year.
<P>
	As my hon. colleagues may know, PWA provides wage 
assistance to low income families. Parents benefit, of course, but so 
do tens of thousands of children, who can then grow up in families 
who are proud of their work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The results will be clients who are better off with a simple 
process. That is a basic reason why we are insisting our programs 
be harmonized with provincial ones.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By reinvesting insurance savings, we will spend more on helping 
these Canadians. Expenditures will rise from $1.9 billion to $2.7 
billion. This money will be spent on concrete measures that will 
make it possible for Quebecers and Canadians to find work.
<P>
	Allow me, Mr. Speaker, to sum up these various arguments. Our 
government has said that it would withdraw from job training, and 
it is. We are going to focus our efforts on effective measures that 
have a tangible impact. We have made a commitment to harmonize 
efforts and to strike partnerships so that we can provide real 
benefits for our clients and for the future of employment insurance.
<P>
	As part of this employment insurance proposal, we invite the 
provincial governments to collaborate with us in designing and 
distributing employment benefits.
<P>
	I was therefore delighted to see that the Quebec government has 
taken an important step toward an agreement. When the Quebec 
National Assembly voted in favour of the Liberal amendment 
urging it to discuss with the federal government, it made a decision 
that gives us some hope. It took a step that should eventually 
improve the choices offered the unemployed throughout Quebec.
<P>
	We are confident that our commitment to fully respect provincial 
jurisdiction over education and training is a step in this process. We 
feel that our commitment to harmonize our activities with those of 
the provinces is another.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government has always been committed to flexible 
federalism and to flexible approaches on federal-provincial issues 
such as working together to help the unemployed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Everyone will benefit from this type of collaboration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while the 
minister said in his opening remarks his government's main 
concern was with jobs, I can tell you that this government's biggest 
failure is precisely in that area, in spite of the fact that it got elected 
on a platform of ``Jobs, jobs, jobs''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17244"> 17244 </A></B>
<P>
	These jobs are nowhere to be seen in Canada, let alone in 
Quebec. Unemployment is running as high as 10 per cent in 
Canada. What the minister is suggesting today does not reflect 
reality.
<P>
	He also said that the federal government plans to withdraw from 
occupational training, but at the same time, it is putting forward 
unemployment action measures to try to interfere, once again, in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, because education and 
occupational training come under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I must say that I agree with the resolution passed by the Quebec 
National Assembly saying that the Government of Quebec is 
prepared to undertake negotiations with the federal government, 
provided that the federal government completely withdraw from 
occupational training.
<P>
	Does the minister agree with the federal government's complete 
withdrawal from the area of occupational training?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the first question or comment made by 
the hon. member, to the effect that there has been no job creation, is 
just not factual.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that, since we took office, 509,000 new 
jobs were created in Canada. I am quoting Statistics Canada 
figures. More than 119,000 new jobs were created in Quebec. That 
is my answer to the first question.
<P>
	When we look at the facts, we can seen that jobs, in fact more 
than half a million new jobs, have been created in the economy. 
Our economic and job creation policies work.
<P>
	Second, regarding occupational training, we must make a 
distinction between two things. Quebec claims jurisdiction in the 
matter because education is a provincial jurisdiction. This means 
that we must withdraw from all training courses coming under their 
jurisdiction. But there is another jurisdiction involved which is a 
federal jurisdiction and, in fact, an exclusive federal jurisdiction. 
And that is unemployment insurance.
<P>
	When we draw money from the UI fund to reduce 
unemployment, we are acting like any responsible person would in 
spending adequately the funds allocated to them; that is our 
jurisdiction. We are trying to limit future UI expenditures and to 
stimulate employment.
<P>
	A measure designed, for example, to supplement a person's 
income to allow this person to find a job or to subsidize his 
company so that he can have a job clearly does not pertain to 
training. It is an employment measure coming fully under federal 
jurisdiction and involving the UI fund, over which the federal 
government has exclusive responsibility.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the member who spoke about the great 
amount of jobs that had been created since the Liberal government 
took over. I beg to differ with him. If jobs have been created, it 
certainly has not been as a result of the federal government. Any 
jobs that have been created have been done through the private 
sector.
<P>
	When will the government realize that governments do not 
create jobs? The best thing that governments have been able to 
create over the last many years is debt. If job creation programs 
instigated by parliaments were successful, everybody in Canada 
would have at least two jobs.
<P>
	The other day I asked the Minister of Human Resources 
Development about changes in the delivery of the training 
programs. He said that we really should be transferring resources to 
the people, to the private sector and to communities. I would 
certainly like to see that. I applaud the minister for even thinking 
about transferring training to the private sector. That is a great leap 
in attitude for the Liberal government. I would like to see that come 
about.
<P>
	In the private sector at least the training would be job specific. It 
would be specific to the marketplace. The marketplace would have 
some say in what sort of training should take place rather than 
having training programs that are supported for example under 
section 25 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, whereby moneys 
are allocated to very questionable job training prospects. When I 
ask about those specific projects that take place in our area, 
because I would like to have some feedback as to what kinds of 
permanent jobs have been created and how many people have 
become employed as a result of those projects, I get very little 
response. As a matter of fact, I am waiting to get some information 
as to how successful or unsuccessful those programs are.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I believe the Bloc has come up with a good motion. However, I 
do not believe it is specific to Quebec. We are talking about 
Canada. Of course the Bloc oftentimes only speaks about the 
province of Quebec. This is certainly relevant in my province of 
Alberta, as it is in la belle province. The Bloc would have had our 
support if the motion had not been strictly specific to Quebec.
<P>
	The auditor general questioned the effectiveness of this program. 
This is not simply an idea the Reform Party has come up with or the 
Bloc has come up with. The auditor general stated in his report: ``In 
studying programs that pumped about $4 billion into regional 
development over eight years, administrators often just added up 
the number of jobs the projects they funded were supposed to 
create and concluded that the programs had created those jobs''. 
That is hardly the way to assess  the effectiveness of the program.

<P>
There should be more accountability with respect to these 
programs.
<P>
	It is noteworthy that there will be a rebate to people who are 
part-time employees. If they do not earn more than $2,000 their 
contributions will be refunded. However, the employee's 
contribution will not be refunded to the employee. That will have 
the reverse effect of what the Liberal government says will be a job 
incentive program. Anything that taxes the people who employ 
people will have a negative effect on the number of people who are 
employed. We should be doing more to remove payroll taxes. We 
should not be putting more roadblocks in the way of business, 
industry, and private enterprise. We should give them more of a 
break to ensure they become successful.

has the floor. I understand you will be sharing your time with 
another member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that Bill C-111, introduced in the House last Friday 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development, is one of the 
most modern pieces of legislation introduced by this government.
<P>
	As Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said, the proposed reform aims 
to help jobless Canadians to rejoin the workforce as quickly as 
possible, and to regain the dignity associated with working.
<P>
	Employment insurance is designed to promote the development 
of the Canadian workforce, as well as economic growth.
<P>
	To that end, the new employment insurance program proposes 
new measures geared to the needs of individuals and communities.
<P>
	It also seeks to promote partnership and co-operation with the 
provinces, with the sole purpose of improving the well-being of 
Canadian workers.
<P>
	In co-operation with the provinces, and in the context of a new 
vision and a new approach, we want to provide  Canadian workers 
with the tools and the opportunities that will help them find their 
niche in the workforce. Along with the provinces, the private sector 
and community organizations, we want these workers to have jobs 
that will make our country competitive on the international 
markets.
<P>
	Governments must get together to meet the challenges of the 
new economy and provide workers with the necessary skills and 
knowledge.
<P>
	Employment insurance proposes a system that is better suited to 
the needs of those who want to find work in the modern labour 
market. For example, I can think of the workers who want to get 
training, so that they can meet the new labour market requirements, 
including in the professional and industrial sectors, to ensure their 
well-being and also contribute to the country's economic growth. 
Once fully implemented, the proposed reform will create between 
100,000 and 150,000 jobs every year, including 40,000 in Quebec.
<P>
	Employment insurance is a much more efficient program, 
because it recognizes the work effort, while also helping the 
unemployed. The proposed changes are fair to all Canadian 
workers, including those who hold part-time jobs.
<P>
	This program is indeed more efficient. Once fully implemented, 
it will result in savings of two billion dollars, without depriving any 
Canadian of his or her rights. Out of that amount, $800 million will 
be reinvested in the employment benefit program. Adding to that 
amount the current budget of $1.9 billion for employment benefits, 
we get a total of $2.7 billion to be allocated to employment 
assistance each year. This is a unique and golden opportunity for 
those provinces interested in reaching agreements with the federal 
government to look after their workforce in a proactive fashion.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	It was also our intention to ensure that Canadians living in high 
unemployment areas could take advantage of employment 
incentive measures in order to work more hours in a year. We have 
therefore established a $300 million transition job fund over three 
years, to fund independent growth-related employment in areas of 
higher unemployment.
<P>
	In conjunction with our partners, we wish to encourage 
employers to create new jobs and to help the unemployed to return 
to the work force as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Employment benefits are practical and efficient tools which 
assist those attempting to return to the work force with practical, 
and in some cases personalized, measures.
<P>
	Since training is a provincial responsibility, and it is the federal 
government's intention to withdraw from that sector under the new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17246"> 17246 </A></B>
<P>
legislation, skill development loans  and grants will be given only 
after formal consent by the province concerned.
<P>
	Employment benefits were designed to encourage personal 
initiative, to encourage people to make appropriate job search 
choices. There are management systems to help recipients plan 
their return to the work force in a methodical way. They will need 
to commit to following that plan, and there will be follow-up 
mechanisms.
<P>
	We have sought to make wage benefits and all employment and 
re-employment measures as flexible as possible. All levels of 
government acknowledge the necessity of bringing their labour 
market-related roles in line with each other; duplication of effort, 
services and expenditures must be avoided, and initiatives must be 
co-ordinated. A province wishing to administer a service itself, or 
to substitute another program which would yield the same results, 
will be able to do so. The federal government is determined to act 
in as open a manner as possible, within the confines of its mandate 
under the national Constitution.
<P>
	What will Quebec get out of this new legislative package? 
Respect of our jurisdictions, greater flexibility in human resource 
management, new opportunities for agreements, and the 
continuation of some of the many agreements already in place 
between us relating to employment insurance and human resources 
development.
<P>
	To prevent overlapping initiatives and programs, we want to sit 
down with Quebec and see how we can focus our efforts in the area 
of manpower training. Parochial squabbles do Canadians a 
disservice and are counterproductive. We are here to serve all 
Canadians and that should be the only rationale for what we do.
<P>
	If the province of Quebec already has a program, we are quite 
willing to let Quebec manage and determine the basic orientation 
of this program. We want to avoid duplication at all costs. It is too 
expensive, creates bureaucratic problems and prevents us from 
understanding the needs of workers and employers.
<P>
	We will try to set up formal and specific agreements with the 
provinces. In each case, we will ask what instruments, programs 
and employment services should be designed and managed locally. 
This will be done keeping efficiency in mind. We must give each 
individual the tools he needs to get back on the labour market.
<P>
	This means that on the basis of such agreements, Quebec will be 
able to assume responsibility for delivering an even larger number 
of projects, programs and services to its workers.
<P>
	As Prime Minister Jean Chrétien announced a few days ago, the 
federal government will withdraw from manpower training 
activities. We will no longer purchase training courses from 
provincial institutions. We will  withdraw from apprenticeship 
training, co-operative education programs and on-the-job training.
<P>
	These measures must be implemented as soon as possible. We 
have provided for a transition period of up to three years to give the 
provinces and institutions time to adjust.
<P>
	Since 1966, we have concluded agreements with Quebec as we 
have with other provinces in this country, and this proves that we 
are able to work in harmony to promote the well being of our 
human resources, with due consideration for the priorities of the 
province.
<P>
	The employment insurance bill is a starting point for discussions 
with the provinces. These discussions may lead to various 
agreements depending on the particular needs of the provinces, 
their economic situation and the needs and circumstances of local 
labour markets. It is up to us to sit down together at the negotiating 
table and proceed with our discussions while considering our 
workers, the jobs they need and the economic development of all 
regions in our country.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In some cases, for example, a provincial government could 
manage federal employment measures or could use its own 
programs, rather than implement the proposed federal measures. 
Similarly, we could combine federal and provincial programs along 
with other programs from the private sector and the community.
<P>
	These programs could be administered by the private sector, a 
local or provincial organization or a consortium. The employment 
benefits and services proposed in Bill C-111 are based on proven 
job creation practices.
<P>
	Experience tells us that helping claimants set up a business is an 
effective way to return people to work. Since April 1994, 34,000 
Canadians have set up businesses using this method. Seventy per 
cent of them were still active 18 months later. They create an 
average of 1.1 jobs.
<P>
	A quick example, before I conclude. In February 1995, 
Dominique Grenier of Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts started a 
specialized business in software for people with a disability.
<P>
	After four years of temporary jobs, he saw self-employment 
assistance as a way of getting a job. After only ten months, his 
business is expanding. Interest in his products, which help people 
cope with their environment, continues to grow. Next year, he 
intends to hire at least one person, and perhaps two. Here is what he 
says: ``I would not have been able to carry this project out had it not 
been for the help I received from the Department of Human 
Resources Development. This sort of program is vital for anyone 
wanting to start a business''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17247"> 17247 </A></B>
<P>
	In the interest of our fellow citizens, this bill deserves our 
support. It is centred on a single and vital objective: jobs that give 
Canadians, communities and regions real hope for the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the member's speech. I know he is very 
interested in his riding and I have heard him many times express 
his concern about the issue of employment in the province of 
Quebec. I recently had the opportunity to read a report by the 
Quebec Manufacturers' Association, who said that employment 
conditions and problems of labour and employability within 
Quebec were very serious. I would like to get the views of the 
member.
<P>
	I understand unemployment insurance benefits in Canada are 
some of the highest in the western world. Many people feel that 
because these benefits are inordinately high compared to countries 
we compete with in international trade, it has created a lower 
productivity. In view of that, a number of people feel that 
productivity in Canada has been declining over the last ten years 
and no less so in Quebec.
<P>
	A very positive aspect of this legislation would be to increase 
labour productivity, increase the attractiveness of Canada and of 
Quebec as a competitive place in which to do business. What we 
are really looking at is a long-term commitment to create a great 
number of jobs within that province.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my Liberal colleague 
for his question. This new employment insurance reform as 
proposed by the Minister of Human Resources Development will 
help us increase productivity in Quebec and across Canada.
<P>
	There are several very interesting points in this reform; there are 
the responsibilities we will give to all job seekers. There will be 
wage subsidies and earnings supplements. I already mentioned 
self-employment assistance. There will also be partnerships with 
the provinces, municipalities, and the companies themselves to put 
people back to work.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I think that this is the most important. There will also be social 
incentives. Basing the reform on the number of hours of work and 
on earnings will greatly benefit the Canadian economy. There are 
inequities in the existing Unemployment Insurance Act in that 
some people can qualify for UI after working 15 hours a week for 
12 weeks, while others who work 14 hours a week in part time jobs, 
perhaps for several years, have no chance of receiving UI benefits.
<P>
	This bill will eliminate some inequities. In the case of lower 
income people, namely those working part time,  some 500,000 of 
them will now be eligible for UI benefits should they need 
them-although I hope they will keep their jobs for as long as 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask my hon. colleague opposite a question.
<P>
	Given that the opposition motion before us today deals with the 
perpetuation of duplication and overlap in the area of manpower, 
how does he react, as a Quebec member representing the interests 
of Quebec in this House, to the resolution unanimously carried 
yesterday in the Quebec National Assembly requesting that the 
federal government withdraw totally and completely from the 
whole area of occupational training and everything that pertains to 
it?
<P>
	First, what is his reaction and, second, how can he reconcile not 
acceding to the unanimous request or wish expressed yesterday by 
the National Assembly with regard to this government's so-called 
good intentions in recognizing Quebec as a distinct society? If the 
federal government were not to comply with the resolution passed 
yesterday, how could he reconcile all that, as an elected 
representative supposedly here to represent the interests of the 
Quebec people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my hon. colleague from 
the Bloc Quebecois for his question.
<P>
	I think it is relatively easy to reconcile the federal government's 
position and the interests of the people of Quebec, because our 
focus is on job creation. I believe that the Quebec government is 
looking into the matter and that future legislation passed in the 
National Assembly will also focus on job creation now that the 
referendum was defeated in Quebec.
<P>
	As far as our reform proposal is concerned-and you referred to 
occupational training in particular-we feel that the bill now 
before the House of Commons makes it quite clear that the 
government intends to withdraw from occupational training 
completely.
<P>
	I think that what must be understood with this bill is that the 
federal government would like all provincial and territorial 
governments of Canada to get together and look at how duplication 
can be eliminated. As I indicated in my remarks, as far as we are 
concerned, there is no question of us buying any occupational 
training courses whatsoever as we know them, because we must 
withdraw from occupational training with the consent of the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	I reach out to my hon. colleague and suggest that he ask his 
leader, who is very likely to become the next Quebec premier, to be 
not so kind but rather so wise as to come and sit down with the 
federal government to negotiate federal-provincial agreements on 
manpower training.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a western Canadian, I welcome the opportunity to take 
part in this debate on the motion of the opposition party concerning 
our government's plans to reform the old system of unemployment 
insurance in Canada.
<P>
	So far most of the discussion that has taken place since the 
Minister of Human Resources Development introduced the new act 
on Friday last has focused on the impact in the eastern parts of the 
country, in Quebec and Atlantic Canada in particular. It is 
important to keep in mind, however, that these reforms will impact 
in all parts of Canada. Canadians in every province will be 
potentially better off because of them.
<P>
	A number of respected and knowledgeable Canadians, including 
several from western Canada, have already spoken publicly in 
support of the new legislation. There is indeed broad support for 
the new program all across the country.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	It is important that members of the House should assess the new 
employment insurance act in terms of what it will do for 
unemployed Canadians, not on how it fits with one political 
ideology or the other. It is also essential that we use this 
opportunity to help Canadians to better understand the new act, and 
especially to clarify some of the misconceptions that have arisen in 
some of the public discussion in the past few days.
<P>
	The first thing that needs to be clarified is the question of the 
reserve, how in fact the reserve that is expected to accumulate in 
the insurance fund will be used. I raise this because there has been 
concern expressed that any surpluses that may accumulate will be 
used to pay down the government's debt or reduce the operating 
deficit.
<P>
	Let me be perfectly clear on this. Surpluses in the insurance fund 
will not be used to reduce the government's debt or deficit. The 
unemployment insurance fund has operated under a separate set of 
accounts in the past, and that will not change with the new law. The 
federal government acts as a lender of last resort for the account 
when it is in deficit, which by the way must be repaid with interest. 
Alternatively, when the account accumulates a surplus it will earn 
interest.
<P>
	Since 1986, following the recommendation of the auditor 
general of the day, the unemployment insurance account has been 
part of the government's consolidated account. This is simply to 
provide an integrated report of the government's financial 
operations.
<P>
	As with the unemployment insurance account, the employment 
insurance account will be separate from the government's 
consolidated revenue fund. It cannot be used for purposes other 
than those designated in the legislation. Thus, should there be any 
surpluses in the  employment insurance fund, which is 
self-financed out of employer and employee contributions, it will 
stay in the EI account. To make it abundantly clear, EI premiums 
will not be used to pay down the debt.
<P>
	It is true that the unemployment insurance fund is currently in a 
small surplus position. It is true that the minister has said it is the 
government's intention to increase the reserve in the account. The 
reason for this is quite apart from issues of deficit and debt 
reduction. The reason for this is to ensure the stability and 
long-term sustainability of the EI program itself.
<P>
	Members of the House may remember that during the last 
recession the unemployment insurance program was in serious 
financial difficulty. Benefit claims were climbing sharply, 
contributions were not covering the increased payouts, and the 
unemployment fund operating deficit was growing at an alarming 
rate. As everyone knows, for an insurance program a growing 
deficit between claims and premiums spells disaster.
<P>
	The government of the day, in reaction to this impending 
disaster, was forced to raise premiums and then to raise them again. 
In a two-year period premiums increased by about 25 per cent. In 
fact over a five-year period premiums rose by 36 per cent, from 
$2.25 to $3.07.
<P>
	The bad news is that these hefty increases in premiums, which I 
would remind hon. members are paid by the employers and the 
employees, were not enough to balance the account. At the end of 
the day, the fund eventually ran up a cumulative deficit of $6 
billion.
<P>
	People are tired of these big numbers. They are getting very used 
to them. I would like to put this in perspective. The impact of a $6 
billion deficit on a fund like this means hardship for the employers 
and the employees. In the first place, employers were faced with 
higher payroll taxes at a time in the economic cycle when they 
could least afford it. In effect, this served as a drag on job creation. 
Some estimates suggested that the premium increases killed as 
many as 40,000 jobs.
<P>
	As for the workers, they too were faced with paying higher 
premiums, which meant they had less money in their pockets after 
deductions. The increased premiums in fact reduced their after-tax 
income at a time when the economy needed stimulation in the form 
of more consumer spending.
<P>
	Fortunately, the system is now back in equilibrium. As I said 
earlier, we have a small but positive surplus in the account. The 
financial disaster in the UI fund was averted. No one wants that 
kind of situation to happen again. That is why it is extremely 
important that we build a surplus in the EI fund.
<P>
	Should we get into a position where the reserve is judged to be 
sufficient, it will allow us to consider whether further premium 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17249"> 17249 </A></B>
<P>
reductions may be possible. The review of the adjustment to the 
reforms, which the  legislation itself requires must take place by 
December 1998, will provide us with an opportunity to reassess the 
financial stability of the fund and contemplate any such changes.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Where did the suggestions for these changes come from? As it 
turns out, the proposal to accumulate a reserve in the UI account 
came from the House of Commons committee which studied this 
issue and whose members recognized the necessity of maintaining 
a stable account through the economic cycle. They recognized the 
need to have money set aside in case of a downturn in the business 
cycle and the consequent need for higher UI payouts should this 
occur. For this reason they made a recommendation to keep a 
reserve against that possibility. This is what the term insurance 
reserve is all about. It is a matter of prudent fiscal management and 
has nothing whatsoever to do with deficit reduction.
<P>
	This is not to say that our government has lost any of its firm 
resolve to deal with the deficit and debt situation we inherited. We 
remain firmly committed to the objective set out by the Minister of 
Finance. We are meeting our deficit reduction targets through 
operating efficiencies and other spending cuts. In fact, we expect to 
make significant savings with the new employment insurance act. 
How can this be? There are some very practical ways this could 
occur.
<P>
	The first is that we are reducing the cost of premiums for both 
employers and workers. We are restructuring the system of benefits 
as we come to grips with a program whose costs have doubled from 
around $8 billion in 1982 to over $16 billion this year. We are 
introducing a number of new administrative efficiencies which will 
reduce the overhead costs of operating the unemployment program 
and will result in a more decentralized program delivery system.
<P>
	These are important measures for western Canadians and in fact 
for all Canadians. Reducing premiums means that western 
Canadians will pay less for the benefit program and will receive 
more back for every dollar they contribute. This will reduce the 
amount of cross-subsidization of the program by western 
Canadians.
<P>
	These are big changes. Of course sometimes big changes need a 
time of transition. For this reason, government is committed to 
ensuring that in special needs areas, for example, where 
unemployment rates are higher than 12 per cent, those areas will 
receive transitional assistance during adjustment to the reforms.
<P>
	In addition, the family income supplement will mean that low 
income parents on unemployment insurance could collect up to 80 
per cent of their previous earnings. An important aspect of this new 
measure is that it treats the family as a unit for unemployment 
insurance purposes and not as a set of individuals.
<P>
	We know that the best way to reduce costs in the unemployment 
program is to get people working again. It is not for nothing that the 
new program is called employment insurance. The new 
employment insurance program introduced last Friday contains a 
set of employment benefits that have been described as pro work. 
Some $800 million of the savings from unemployment reforms 
will be reinvested in these measures which are designed to help 
unemployed workers re-enter the workforce.
<P>
	Western Canadian provinces will also have full access to the 
employment benefit measures. The objective of these employment 
benefits is to improve incentives to work and to reduce dependency 
on the EI system.
<P>
	The new employment benefits include well targeted, results 
oriented measures such as wage subsidies, earning supplements, 
self-employment assistance, job creation partnerships and loans 
and grants to help workers improve their skills. Use of these 
employment measures will be tailored to meet specific labour 
market needs and priorities as determined within a decentralized 
context. The emphasis will be on flexibility, common sense and 
practical experience.
<P>
	In addition, the future service delivery and decision making will 
take place as close to the local level as possible. Local skills and 
expertise will be used working in partnership with other levels of 
government, community groups, educators and others from the 
business community and labour organizations.
<P>
	This new approach to unemployment assistance is based on the 
idea that effective programs can be designed and delivered in the 
region that will use them. Ottawa does not have to make all the 
decisions. It is based on our belief that people want to work. They 
do not want to draw UI time after time. With the new employment 
insurance program, we are giving them the tools to get back to 
work.
<P>
	Other sceptics may ask: Will this innovative approach work in 
western Canada? The answer is, it already is. The human resources 
development department has undertaken a number of pilot projects 
in western Canada which are based on this model.
<P>
	There is a job creation partnership project in the area of tourism 
in Medicine Hat. Twenty-six seasonal or displaced workers became 
involved in a project jointly funded by the federal department and 
the city of Medicine Hat to help the city plan for an expansion of its 
tourism industry.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	In the area of business start ups, in my home city of Saskatoon 
there is a self-employment assistance project which has helped 17 
entrepreneurs start new businesses. A number of these people have 
in turn hired new workers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17250"> 17250 </A></B>
<P>
	Another example is in that very important area of making the 
transition from welfare to work. There is a self-sufficiency project 
in the lower mainland of British Columbia, a co-operative venture 
which provides earnings supplements to help single parents get 
off welfare and get back to work.
<P>
	These are all practical working examples, not just airy-fairy 
hopes and dreams. This is why we know it will work in western 
Canada just as its works in all parts of the country. The door is open 
for the development of co-operative ventures with each and every 
province.
<P>
	With the new employment insurance act this government has 
opened the way for individual provinces to work with the federal 
government to develop unique labour market programs which meet 
the needs of individual governments, regions and people. Because 
of this, I must disagree with the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Mercier. It is my belief that contrary to that motion this 
government is doing everything-

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, in her 
speech, the hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt claimed that, 
generally speaking, Canadians were enthusiastic and appreciative 
as regards the reform proposed in the bill.
<P>
	I can say that I heard of lot of opinions to the contrary. Many 
people have opposed several aspects of this legislation.
<P>
	The hon. member also says, and I agree with her on that issue, 
that some decisions had to be made to try to reduce, if not 
eliminate, the UI fund deficit. It is true that something had to be 
done sooner or later about that.
<P>
	However, based on what principle of social equity does Bill C-96 
lower the contribution of high income earners, while increasing 
that of those who hold precarious jobs, particularly part-time 
workers?
<P>
	In the end, the deficit will be reduced at the expense of the poor, 
not the rich. I would appreciate it if the hon. member could 
comment on that principle, because I cannot figure it out.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not disagree with the hon. 
member opposite that there are some discordant notes and most of 
them are being played from that region of this House of Parliament.
<P>
	As with any bill there is going to be debate across the country but 
I would only say that the provisions of the bill responded to a need 
that committee members heard when they travelled across the 
country just over a year ago. They heard a need for reforms to the 
unemployment insurance fund and the act, not only to the 
underlying principles but to the way the service is delivered. This 
piece of legislation goes a long way to providing that service 
delivery.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>

<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The second question concerned what principles of social equity 
this was based on. The provisions of the bill will go a long way to 
ensure there is greater equity among all Canadians. I would quote 
again as an example the changes from a minimum number of weeks 
to hours to take in part time workers.
<P>
	I am not sure if I misunderstood what the hon. member said or if 
he misunderstood what I said. In terms of using the employment 
fund to reduce the deficit, I went to great lengths to say that is not 
in fact what the reserve will be used for. If that was his suggestion, 
I will say once more that the reserve in the employment insurance 
fund will not be used to reduce the debt and deficit. The surplus 
which is there will exist as a contingency. If it ever becomes large 
enough it will be used to reduce premiums. That would benefit both 
the employers and the employees which is quite an equitable 
solution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first, I want to say that I will be sharing my time with the hon. 
member for Champlain.
<P>
	I am very pleased to participate in the debate on the motion 
tabled by the hon. member for Mercier, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for choosing to reform 
unemployment insurance in a way that maintains overlap and duplication in the 
manpower sector and thus prevents the government of Quebec from adopting a 
true manpower development policy of its own.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	You will understand the relevance of that motion, following an 
almost historical event yesterday, in that a resolution was 
unanimously approved. Indeed, it is rare that western parliaments 
unanimously approve such resolutions. Yet, that was the case 
yesterday in Quebec City, where the three parties at the National 
Assembly, namely the Parti Quebecois, the Liberal Party and the 
Action démocratique, unanimously agreed on a resolution which 
provides, in part, that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Quebec must have sole responsibility for policies pertaining to manpower 
adjustment and occupational training within its borders and patriate 
accordingly the funding allocated by the federal government for these programs 
in Quebec;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Within the current constitutional framework and in order to improve services 
to customers, Quebec must take over the control and management of various 
services pertaining to employment and manpower development and all 
programs that may be funded through the Unemployment Insurance Fund 
within Quebec's borders, and must therefore receive the funding appropriate to 
such responsibilities;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government of Quebec and representatives of business, labour and the 
co-operative sector agree to oppose any initiative by the federal government 
that would constitute an invasion of Quebec's prerogatives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a resolution that was unanimously approved, by a vote of 
96 to nil, by the three parties sitting in Quebec's National 
Assembly. The timing of this resolution is all the more appropriate, 
given a particular aspect of that reform mentioned on page 3 of the 
release. I am referring to the national employment service. It is said 
that ``a modernized employment service will help out of work 
Canadians organize and conduct job searches. The computerized 
information network on the labour market will be more powerful 
and will tell people where they can find work in every region of the 
country. To that end, the implementation of an improved and 
universalized version of the service delivery system in Canada's 
human resource centres was announced in August 1995''.
<P>
	People in Trois-Rivières know all about the implications of that 
announcement. This is the other reason why I am pleased to speak 
today and to discuss, for the third time in the last two or three 
weeks, issues that plague Trois-Rivières.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	These are linked to one of the aspects of the minister's reform 
and relate to the creation of a new national placement system. It 
will be centred on the Department of Human Resources 
Development employment centres, and in our area it has been 
decided that the regional administrative centre, the focal point of 
departmental activities in our region, will be located, not where it 
would normally and naturally be at Trois-Rivières, the regional 
capital which I have the honour to represent, but at Shawinigan 
instead.
<P>
	This is, of course, a worthy city as well, one which knew glory in 
the days of natural resource development by the Shawinigan Water 
and Power, and is now represented as best he can by the hon. 
member for Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister of Canada. The 
decision was made at the Department of Human Resources 
Development to have Shawinigan be the one to benefit from the 
regional administrative centre, rather than Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	The question remains-since we are totally in the dark as to the 
reasons for this decision-was this a technocratic decision or a 
political one? If technocratic, it is confirmation of all of the 
public's prejudices against the judgment of technocrats in their 
ivory towers, away from life's realities, away from the grassroots, 
making decisions among themselves in comfort and behind closed 
doors. They hold meeting after meeting at which they convince 
each other of how justified their decisions are, without ever really 
worrying about whether those decisions are in the least bit rational.
<P>
	If this is a technocratic decision, then we must condemn it out of 
hand, because it is based on absolutely nothing rational. I will offer 
you proof very shortly that it even contradicts the parameters set by 
the department itself.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17252"> 17252 </A></B>
<P>
	The other explanation, perhaps a more plausible one, is that 
all-mighty, all-rational, all-giving politics were involved. That the 
Prime Minister might have let it be known that common sense and 
interest ought to prevail, including the self-interest of the member 
for Saint-Maurice, to ensure that the residents of his riding, with 
all logic, all rationality thrown to the winds, would reap the benefit 
of the creation of this new centre, rather than the region of 
Trois-Rivières, the city of Trois-Rivières, where workers are 
merely shuffled around, and never a job created. In fact, if 
memory serves, there was more than shuffling, there were cuts, 
with 58 positions lost due to office closures.
<P>
	Whether technocracy or politics were involved, the decision is 
indisputably illogical and arbitrary. As I have said, it contradicts 
the parameters the department has set for itself with respect to 
creating these regional centres. The parliamentary secretary will 
agree there was some kind of rationale. It is never easy to make 
these decisions, and that is why you need certain criteria.
<P>
	The main criteria when making these decisions include the 
population affected, the number of unemployment insurance 
recipients affected, the number of welfare recipients and the 
number of businesses and employers likely to hire people on 
unemployment insurance and welfare.
<P>
	In each case, Trois-Rivières represents more or less twice the 
activity, population, number of employers and number of 
unemployment and welfare recipients. That is why Trois-Rivières 
is the regional capital. It is the largest urban area and the most 
important one in terms of economic activity and population in the 
whole region. That is why it made good sense to have and keep this 
kind of service in Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	The department, for reasons that remain obscure, decided to 
locate the service in Shawinigan. The decision was not only 
arbitrary and illogical but also very unpopular. Since September, a 
petition has been circulating, signed by more than 25,000 people, 
condemning this decision by the federal government. Seventy 
agencies took the trouble to draft resolutions condemning this 
decision, including 40 municipalities as well as community 
agencies.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	This case has attracted the support of the Fédération des caisses 
populaires and the Fédération de l'âge d'or, because the elderly 
become anxious when they see changes coming, while the regional 
federation got involved as well.
<P>
	We are seeing a chorus of protests in the riding of Trois-Rivières 
and in the region, including Cap-de-la-Madeleine, a riding 
represented by my colleague from Champlain, 
Trois-Rivières-Ouest, in my riding, and even on the other side of 
the river in  Bécancour, which historically has always done 
business with Trois-Rivières because of its location.
<P>
	So this illogical and unpopular decision will have certain 
practical consequences. This is not about protest for its own sake. 
The fact is that the paperwork, under the new system, will be done 
by the regional management centre in Shawinigan. People will 
register in Trois-Rivières where the facts will be noted, without 
further processing. And any intervention subsequent to registration 
with the manpower centre, which happens in three out of four 
cases, according to our statistics, which always require additional 
processing, will be originated from Shawinigan instead of being 
processed in Trois-Rivières as is now the case.
<P>
	The minister claims it will make no difference and will not in 
any way change the quality of the services now enjoyed by the 
people of Trois-Rivières and surrounding area. Nevertheless, we 
should realize that departmental investigations following 
registration and all appeals to the UI board of referees, for instance, 
will from now on, according to our information, be done in 
Shawinigan instead of Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	Do not tell us there will be no drop in the quality of service for 
the Trois-Rivières area. That is just not true.
<P>
	This decision is arbitrary, illogical, technocratic and political, 
and above all, it was made without any consultation with regional 
partners.
<P>
	As I said before, the government has three alternatives, one 
being the status quo, leaving Trois-Rivières as is and setting up a 
centre in Shawinigan for the northern Saint-Maurice area, but the 
government should not locate a regional management centre in 
Shawinigan for the whole region, as it is about to do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, as I 
listened to the member's comments about this bill I became very 
confused. He started off criticizing the federal government's 
spending power, presumably under the whole aspect of manpower 
training. Basically what has been asked for is the federal 
government not use that power in such a way that it would create 
duplication and overlap within provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	I hear the federal government has consented to that and has 
basically said it will not use its spending powers. However, they 
want the government to do both. They want the government to give 
them the money in addition to curbing its powers. The reality is 
they want to have their cake and eat it too.
<P>
	Worse than that, the hon. member went on to give us a 
dissertation from the national assembly in Quebec City which 
would, as I understand it, basically say we should have no presence 
there whatsoever. The member continued to argue why we should 
have a placement centre in his riding of Trois-Rivières. It would be 
more  consistent if he argued there should be no placement 
facilities either in Shawinigan or his own riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17253"> 17253 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems terribly inconsistent to me. The argument seems to have 
developed into ``we want to have the spending, we do not want you 
around, but we kind of want you around too''. We had a very 
looped discussion.
<P>
	What really concerns me is the discussion about labour mobility. 
Basically what has been stated is that the federal government has 
no presence in the whole aspect of placement throughout the whole 
country as a nation. I do not know what the member is saying. If he 
has unemployed workers in Trois-Rivières and there are jobs 
available in New Brunswick or possibly Ontario or another 
jurisdiction, would he rather have those people in Trois-Rivières 
continue to be unemployed? Is that basically the philosophy behind 
these comments? Possibly the member could clarify that for me.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. It gives me the opportunity to pursue my line of thought 
and show the arbitrariness and illogic of the decision or proposal, 
because we hope it is still a proposal, to locate the centre in 
Shawinigan rather than in Trois-Rivières. It is a matter of good 
common sense. It is clear. Trois-Rivières is the regional capital of 
the Mauricie region; this is a fact.
<P>
	Certainly, if we undermine its character like this, take the 
stuffing out of the regional capital, maybe we will no longer have 
one. Shawinigan may not be a desirable choice, because it is not as 
well situated.
<P>
	We have to bear in mind that this decision is not only arbitrary, it 
is political. It has all the earmarks, at least according to our 
information. We can see that the Prime Minister is looking after his 
own political interest to show he is working for his constituents, 
while leaving far behind the collective interest of the Mauricie 
region.
<P>
	There are two types of people. The people of Shawinigan, and 
they have a lot of good common sense, are very aware of the 
outlandishness of the situation. They are also increasingly 
uncomfortable, like the federalists in Trois-Rivières, who are well 
aware that, in logical terms, the decision is untenable, because, 
historically, economic activity has been focussed in Trois-Rivières 
primarily. They know a major centre has to be maintained. 
Everyone knows that the decision, with its obvious political 
overtones, is untenable.
<P>
	I reiterate the three options open to the government. It could 
maintain the status quo, keeping Trois-Rivières as the main centre 
of activity for the entire region; it could set up a centre in 
Shawinigan to satisfy the Prime Minister's fancy while retaining 
Trois-Rivière's regional nature, incorporating Bécancour; or it 
could implement its plan, which should not be done, especially as 
regards  Shawinigan becoming the regional capital. Shawinigan 
lacks the attributes of a regional capital-although the people there 
are very nice-but it lacks a pool of employers and of people and 
claimants, who do benefit arbitrarily although highly politically, at 
the expense of individuals, employers, seniors and community 
organizations. We will never agree with a decision that means we 
have to go all the way to Shawinigan.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty pursuant, to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt: national defence; 
the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra: Vietnam.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first 
of all, I would like to remind the members of this House that job 
training has historically been an area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The federal government sneaked in through its jurisdiction over 
unemployment insurance and put in place a multitude of 
employability development programs. Over time, and given the 
costs involved, the federal government has decided to restructure 
its authority, reduce its financial involvement, and increase its 
visibility. This is probably the basis of the reform proposed by 
Minister Axworthy.
<P>
	However, for several years now, there has been in Quebec a 
consensus to repatriate manpower training powers. The 
government, labour unions, and the Conseil du patronat du Québec 
are hoping the federal government will take a concrete step in this 
direction in the interest of users, both employees and employers, as 
outlined in a 1991 letter made public by Quebec employment 
minister Louise Harel and signed by her Liberal predecessor, André 
Bourbeau, which condemns any attempt by the federal government 
to fund labour training through groups and organizations.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada is using the principle of 
decentralization to play politics by sending directly to Quebecers 
cheques allowing them to adapt their training to the new realities in 
the labour force. He has just missed a good opportunity to establish 
constructive relations between the Canadian federation and its 
provinces.
<P>
	The federal government's position in this area denotes a lack of 
respect for Canada's provinces and supports its efforts to centralize 
powers. By acting this way, the federal government is trading 
effectiveness for visibility while contributing to anarchy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17254"> 17254 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister's bill specifies that he will try to conclude with the 
provinces official agreements on the  implementation of four 
manpower programs designed to put people back to work. 
However, should he be unable to come to an agreement with the 
provinces, he reserves the right to implement his programs with or 
without their consent. The federal government gives itself the right 
to bypass the provinces, in case no agreement can be worked out. 
Does the Minister of Human Resources Development agree with us 
that the provinces will negotiate with a knife at their throats?
<P>
	The fifth program announced by the minister provides for the 
establishment of a job creation fund amounting to $300 million 
over three years, which is not distributed among the provinces. To 
obtain federal funds, the provinces and perhaps even the 
municipalities will have to inject an equivalent amount. This type 
of funding favours the richest provinces. This goes against the 
objective of the fund, which is to create jobs in high unemployment 
regions.
<P>
	On the one hand, the minister is promoting overlap between the 
various levels of government and supporting the costs, and on the 
other hand, he is tightening UI qualifying conditions and reducing 
UI benefits.
<P>
	For the second year in a row and in spite of the UI account 
surplus, the Minister of Finance announced in his February budget 
speech that the funds allocated by the Treasury Board to the 
Canadian job strategy administered under the unemployment 
insurance program would be cut by an additional $1.1 billion for 
fiscal years 1996 and 1997.
<P>
	At the same time, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is announcing that $800 million will be allocated to 
training programs to promote job readiness. This new resource 
envelope being funded through the UI fund, the government is able 
to save $300 million on the backs of employers and employees just 
by shifting the load.
<P>
	By introducing in his reform the notion of weekly hours of work 
and by increasing the number of weeks of work required to qualify 
for benefits, the minister is going after part time workers, most of 
whom are women, and seasonal workers, the most vulnerable 
segment of our society. By acting this way, the minister is giving a 
one-way ticket for social assistance to a larger number of 
Quebecers, as more than 40 per cent of new welfare recipients were 
previously on UI.
<P>
	Once all of minister Axworthy's proposals will have been 
implemented, they will represent a $640 million shortfall for the 
people of Quebec. In my riding, the economy is heavily dependent 
on the expansion of the tourist, forestry, farm and business 
industries, all of which provide mostly part time and seasonal 
employment.
<P>
	On the whole, UI reform represents a shortfall of approximately 
$7 million just in my riding.
<P>
	The federal government is drawing its inspiration from the cuts 
Alberta and Ontario made on the backs of workers and the 
disadvantaged. The Chrétien government could show some 
initiative and daring in cutting tax benefits for large companies and 
the best paid members of our society, but apparently he would 
rather disguise his deficit reduction effort as a social program 
reform.
<P>
	According to a document released by the HRD department, the 
reform making the unemployment insurance into an employment 
insurance is designed, among other things, to help unemployed 
workers meet the challenges of new job requirements and career 
renewal.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Could the minister tell us how, concretely, his reform proposal 
will resolve the persistent disparity between the ever increasing 
number of unemployed and the 300,000 jobs that remain vacant 
every year in Canada, because the unemployed lack adequate 
training?
<P>
	This reform will certainly perpetuate overlap between levels of 
government and the associated costs, but it will also force all those 
who are looking for a job or for further training to go back and forth 
between their Canada employment centre, the regional office of the 
Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, 
educational institutions and aid agencies. The people of Quebec 
and Canada will not only have to bear the brunt of this reform, but 
they will also have to put up with the drawbacks of overlap. That is 
the real impact of the Axworthy reform.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the comments of the hon. member. I must admit it 
seemed there was more discussion about governments and partisan 
issues than about people. I was concerned that the member had not 
really addressed the basic issues and the needs of the workers of 
Canada, regardless of what province they live in. We only have one 
taxpayer. The important issue is that we really make sure the 
services provided to Canadians are focused and efficient.
<P>
	The member talked a little about the fact that in his opinion job 
training is the sole jurisdiction of Quebec. He said there was 
federal encroachment by this legislation that has come forward 
before the House and basically reduced it to a simple matter of 
petty politics. He then concluded that Quebecers needed full 
control over manpower training but then concluded we need a 
constructive partnership. In itself, that is a total contradiction. You 
cannot have full control and a constructive partnership at the same 
time.
<P>
	My real question has to do with the whole UI issue. The member 
seems to talk about the UI distribution as some sort of instrument 
of equalization of benefits. Quite  frankly, every region of Canada 
should have one objective, and that is to eliminate all benefits for 
all Canadians because we will not need them. We need people to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17255"> 17255 </A></B>
<P>
get jobs. UI is not a matter of equalization. Our objective should be 
to reduce the amount of benefits paid through job creation.
<P>
	Would the member try to deal with the essence of the subject 
really being not equalization but rather the best interests of 
Canadians?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Madam Speaker, earlier I listened to the speeches

<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Madam Speaker, I will remember that. One of his 
colleagues said that a person working 14 to 15 hours a week for 52 
weeks would benefit-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Again, I remind the hon. 
member for Champlain that his observations must relate to 
comments made by the member who asked the question, not to 
those of another speaker.

	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> I understand, Madam Speaker. It is because I do 
not have the name of the hon. member's riding.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Mississauga.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Mississauga. Fine. I will now continue. The 
member opposite told us that the new UI program is beneficial to 
those who never collected UI benefits. He referred to people 
working 14 to 15 hours. However, if we multiply those 14 or 15 
hours by 52 weeks, we realize that it is impossible for these people 
to be eligible for UI benefits. The numbers do not add up.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, thank 
you for the opportunity to address the Bloc motion on the subject of 
unemployment insurance reform. I can only begin by saying how 
astounded I am that such a motion could have been drafted, let 
alone introduced at this time.
<P>
	What is the source of the motion? What unemployment 
insurance reforms are the hon. members of the opposition thinking 
about? I presume it is not the same reform that was introduced by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development last Friday.
<P>
	I heard the Prime Minister's announcement a little over a week 
ago. I read the documents. What I and millions of Canadians heard 
was a statement from the Prime Minister that the federal 
government respects and  recognizes the jurisdiction of the 
provinces in education and training. Millions of us heard him say 
that the federal government is therefore withdrawing from the 
direct purchase of training, from apprenticeship training, 
co-operative education programs, and workplace-based training. 
We heard him announce that agreements with the provinces will be 
sought on the design and delivery of proposed employment 
benefits in order to harmonize them with provincial programs. We 
heard him explain that in some cases the provincial government or 
a provincial agency could be responsible for delivering these 
federal measures. Indeed, he was at pains to point out that in other 
cases provincial programs could be used instead of the proposed 
federal measures.
<P>
	He made it perfectly clear to millions of us that funding for 
training will only be provided by the federal government with the 
consent of the province concerned. Depending on the agreement 
reached, it could be provided to individuals, to the provincial 
government, or to a third party. He stated clearly and ultimately 
that this arrangement can allow a province, if it wishes, to assume 
full responsibility for these employment measures, subject only to 
the proviso that the federal government's responsibilities to ensure 
the needs of the unemployed are addressed and that the measures 
that allow them to return quickly to the workforce are met.
<P>
	The employment insurance reforms specifically and deliberately 
seek to eliminate overlap and duplication. The reforms will mean 
that even more than ever a province will be able to develop a 
comprehensive labour market strategy and policy. It is surely a 
distortion to maintain otherwise.
<P>
	It is always difficult to bring about true reform. In the case of a 
program as well ingrained in the economic and social fabric of 
Canada as the unemployment insurance program, it is doubly 
difficult. I am concerned that factual distortion of the sort 
presented by this motion will damage public understanding of the 
reform package, especially in Atlantic Canada, where a sound 
understanding of the new system is of paramount importance.
<P>
	I believe it is important for Atlantic Canadians to know the facts 
so they can be aware that the reforms provide much needed 
structural adjustments, which are absolutely necessary and which 
over the long term will be good for Canada and for Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	The opposition members should also take note of the fact that 
these reforms will help high unemployment regions like Atlantic 
Canada. In fact this reform package will create 100,000 to 150,000 
new jobs, and 45,000 part-time workers in Atlantic Canada who are 
now not eligible for benefits will qualify under these reforms.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance was never a solution to the Atlantic 
regional unemployment, nor was it meant to be. We are now facing 
the fact that it has actually become a cause of unemployment. In 
other words, it is part of the  problem and not the solution. Many 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17256"> 17256 </A></B>
<P>
people are better off collecting UI than accepting the work that is 
available. In a recent survey of small businesses in Atlantic 
Canada, 45 per cent of respondents said they want to hire but 
cannot compete for workers with the social programs, particularly 
UI.
<P>
	The new employment insurance legislation is a balanced 
package that improves work incentives, reduces dependency, and 
increases fairness while helping Canadians get back to work.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	Specifically what does this mean for the Atlantic provinces? It is 
true that we are cutting overall spending. There will be impacts on 
Atlantic Canada. We should remember that when reinvestment is 
taken into account the overall reduction in the region will be no 
more than 7 per cent. On the whole each of the four Atlantic 
provinces currently receives more in benefits than it pays in 
premiums. Although the ratio will be lower they will still be net 
recipients after reform.
<P>
	Another important impact for Atlantic Canada is that during the 
transitional period regions with high unemployment will receive 
more in terms of job support programs. About $800 million in 
savings from the new system would be reinvested in proven job 
support programs to create opportunities and to help more people 
get into the job market.
<P>
	By fiscal year 2000-01, $214 million or 27 per cent of that 
amount will go to Atlantic Canada. Further, to stimulate the 
economy in high unemployment areas transitional job funds will 
provide $300 million for job creation over a three-year period. This 
is in addition to the $800 million being invested in job support 
programs.
<P>
	On the benefit side, people in high unemployment areas will 
need fewer hours of work to qualify for benefits and will be able to 
receive benefits for a longer period.
<P>
	There are other provisions affecting seasonal workers and as we 
all know Atlantic Canada has more than its share. Under the new 
system, although some seasonal workers in industries like fishing, 
forestry and agriculture will receive lower benefits, they will 
nonetheless get more out of the program than they pay in 
premiums. They will have more incentive to work outside the peak 
season because additional work will now not only increase earned 
income but provide increased benefits as well.
<P>
	Workers, employers and communities have to be able to cope 
with the substantial change the employment insurance scheme will 
bring to the Atlantic region, so the new system will be introduced 
gradually over several years.
<P>
	The new employment insurance system will bring essential 
change to the Atlantic region. We believe the  employment 
insurance active employment measures will lead to stronger labour 
markets and a more skilled workforce, which in turn will attract 
investment and jobs.
<P>
	In the Atlantic region the federal government already works in 
partnership with the provinces, municipalities, community 
organizations and the private sector to design and deliver 
re-employment programs. There are education and training 
initiatives, personal and business counselling, wage subsidies, 
self-employment assistance and special programs for women, 
youth, aboriginal people, individuals with disabilities and members 
of racial minorities.
<P>
	Whenever possible both individuals and local communities are 
encouraged to take responsibility for their own development.
<P>
	The old UI system trapped people in a cycle of dependence. The 
new system is designed to help people help themselves. I want 
Atlantic Canadians to understand that fact and not be distracted by 
the naysayers. This is why I say the motion before us should be 
viewed in Atlantic Canada and across the country as the distortion 
it truly represents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for South Shore for providing the House 
with an insight into the situation in Atlantic Canada. There has 
been much said in the media and among members of Parliament 
who perhaps do not know the situation very well in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	One of the impressions given in some media reports is that it is 
somehow the norm in Atlantic Canada that people would work for 
only a few months and make a substantial amount of money, that it 
was simply a way of life to go on UI. The member has dispelled 
that very well. The constituents of South Shore should know how 
very hard and how very ably their member has represented the 
interests of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	With regard to the media impression that has been given, could 
the member elaborate a bit more on the kinds of things that have 
been happening, from his experience in South Shore and Atlantic 
Canada, in reaction to the proposals and on his expectations with 
regard to the potential benefits of the new program?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Madam Speaker, I did an interview in my riding last 
week. Some people who discussed the issue were in favour of some 
parts of the program and against other parts. To suggest that we can 
bring in this substantial change without there being some negative 
comment is not possible. Certainly when people will be affected 
there will be some negative comment.
<P>
	However, on balance it is clear to me from discussions with the 
business community and others in my riding that the change from 
weeks to hours is very positive. Every hour of work will now count 
in the seasonal industries. In  many of the industries in Atlantic 
Canada people do not work a 35-hour week during peak periods. 
They work 40, 50 and 60 hour weeks. Now they will get credit for 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17257"> 17257 </A></B>
<P>
all the extra time, whereas in the past they would only get credit for 
the week regardless of the number of hours. That is a very positive 
aspect that has been accepted and endorsed by Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, there will be at least 45,000 additional people 
in Atlantic Canada who will now qualify for benefits. They are not 
getting benefits now because in most cases they are working less 
than the 15 hours presently needed to qualify.
<P>
	In addition there is the new family support benefit, a family 
income supplement for low income families with children. This 
provision will allow claimants to earn up to 80 per cent of their 
insured income.
<P>
	Those are just three points but there are others. I could perhaps 
cite six or seven other provisions that are very beneficial to 
Atlantic Canadians which will offset some areas where without 
question some adjustment will be needed. We all recognize that we 
need to make structural changes to make the system an 
employment program as opposed to an unemployment program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
must say that I was very disappointed and even shocked to hear the 
comments of the member who just spoke.
<P>
	Throughout his speech, we had the impression that he feels the 
unemployed are lazy people and that making them hungry will 
somehow help create jobs.
<P>
	A supermarket recently opened in my riding. It needed to hire 60 
people, mostly for part-time jobs. Yet, 2,000 people showed up. It 
is not true that the unemployed are lazy. What is true, though, is 
that there are no jobs for people willing to work. Jobs will not be 
created by making these people hungry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Madam Speaker, that comment is very much like the 
motion, a distortion of the true facts. That is certainly not what I 
said or implied. To even suggest it to me is an insult. I did not say 
that. I will not suggest it. The member should not even think it.
<P>
	We all recognize that people who are out of work are not out of 
work by choice. At the same time the present system is not helping 
them. We are trying to bring in employment measures that will 
assist these people to get the tools and that will help industry and 
business create the jobs these people badly want.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, in support of my colleague for South Shore, I 
simply advise the member from the Bloc that we from the 
maritimes need not be told that unemployed people are not lazy.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	I will speak to a number of benefits included in the minister's 
recent announcement. Probably the most important benefit 
concerns the fact that employment insurance will now be much 
more inclusive. There are estimates that up to half a million people 
who were not eligible to be included in the benefits of the 
unemployment insurance will be included for benefits under 
employment insurance.
<P>
	I cannot overestimate how important that provision is because it 
will allow many Canadians inside the system who currently are on 
income assistance in the province of New Brunswick to qualify. In 
many cases they could not find sufficient numbers of weeks to 
work but could certainly find the number of hours necessary under 
this provision. There will be people in my province who will be 
able to qualify with nine or ten weeks of work who might have 
needed to find fourteen or fifteen weeks of work in the past. They 
will have access to the program by virtue of the fact that the 
industries in Atlantic Canada are very seasonal. During peak 
periods they can work long hours but they cannot extend the long 
hours over a large number of weeks. It is very important that it has 
a very progressive outcome by virtue of that.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, one of the benefits of the recently announced 
employment insurance amendments has to do with the fact that 
coverage is going to be broadened quite considerably. Many people 
will have access to employment insurance who have not had access 
to it in the past.
<P>
	Another significant advantage is the low income protection 
contained in the amendments. This will allow up to 80 per cent of 
insurable earnings to be covered for low income families with 
children.
<P>
	There are also the advantages in terms of the long term political 
viability of the program in that high income earners will have a 
greater percentage of their benefits clawed back. As an Atlantic 
Canadian, I am somewhat tired of all of those who point to us and 
talk about all those wealthy people who are drawing unemployment 
insurance benefits after making large amounts of money. It does 
not happen very often. By introducing this clawback we will be 
able to establish that more quickly in the minds of Canadians.
<P>
	I would also point out the importance of the employment benefit 
programs that are part of the package. There were 39 in the past 
which have been reduced to five. Those five programs will now be 
managed essentially by local officials which means if one element 
of the package is more suitable to my constituency then all of the 
attention could be placed in that area. That is a huge improvement.
<P>
	The job partnership program meets a very real need in my part of 
Canada. Many people do not acquire enough coverage for the full 
52-week period. For example, people are eligible for 26 weeks of 
insurance benefits yet their summer job or their seasonal job does 
not start until 10 weeks beyond that.
<P>
	One of the elements of the new employment benefit package is a 
job partnership program which will allow job creation 
opportunities in the communities. This will allow people to fill in 
that gap when they otherwise would not have benefits or income.
<P>
	I pay tribute to the minister for last year's consultation. As an 
Atlantic Canadian, I have been  particularly concerned about the 
bill and the UI changes. I can only say good things about the 
amount of consultation the minister has allowed and I understand 
he is going to continue to receive when we look at the bill in 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.15 p.m., it is my 
duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
necessary to dispose of the business of supply pursuant to Standing 
Order 81(16).
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The question is on the

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the Income 
Tax Act to eliminate the payment of personal income tax on interest from 
personal savings accounts when the amount of interest is $1,000 or less.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to introduce this motion today. I believe taking this 
action could benefit a great number of people, particularly our 
senior citizens.
<P>
	Amending the Income Tax Act to eliminate the payment of 
personal income tax on interest from personal savings accounts 
when the amount of interest is $1,000 or less is not a completely 
new idea.
<P>
	In 1974 an exemption on the first $1,000 of interest income was 
introduced as a way of counteracting the impact of inflation on the 
taxation of interest.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17261"> 17261 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	It was also believed the exemption would reduce tax evasion, as 
those with small amounts of bank interest would no longer have an 
incentive to ignore the interest they received when filing their 
income tax returns.
<P>
	Another argument was that the exemption would increase 
savings by increasing the post-tax return of investment that 
produced interest. All of these were valid arguments in 1974 and 
remain valid today.
<P>
	In 1988 as a result of a decision by the Tory government the 
exemption was removed. According to statements given by the 
witnesses to the Standing Committee on Finance in 1987 the people 
who had the most to lose if the exemption was removed were senior 
citizens.
<P>
	It therefore stands to reason that senior citizens are the people 
with the most to gain if the exemption is reinstated. According to 
testimony before the committee more than 80 per cent of taxpayers 
over 65 claimed the $1,000 deduction in 1983.
<P>
	Despite the fact that the deduction was removed in 1988, 
2,026,620 or about 70 per cent of all seniors who filed income tax 
returns in 1992 still included bank interest as a source of income. 
Bank interest was even more significant among the seniors 75 
years of age and older, with 878,370 people or about 75 per cent 
naming bank interest as a source of income. It is obvious that for 
senior citizens keeping their money in a bank savings account is a 
way of life, the result of a lifetime of habit.
<P>
	Think for a moment of the life of a person who is 75 years old. 
Think of the time they were born, the significant events of their 
lives and the lives of their parents. Think of the Great Depression. 
Think of the second world war. These people have known the 
hardship of trying to make ends meet when the ends just seem to 
get farther and farther apart.
<P>
	The Great Depression hit Canada and Canadians hard. It was a 
terrible, grim time when all manner of personal indignities and 
deprivations became the norm. People lost their jobs, their homes, 
their dreams. Soup kitchens were a booming business. Men 
tramped the city streets trying to pick up 50 cents doing odd jobs or 
in desperation travelled the country in boxcars looking for work or 
a handout and the advice of those who still had handouts to give. It 
was always the same as that of John D. Rockefeller, always to save 
their money, not squander it. It was a lesson they took to heart.
<P>
	Then the war came and blew the depression away. Suddenly 
there was a desperate need for everyone to work, but there was an 
equally desperate need for everything to go to the war effort. 
Rationing was introduced and people learned to barter and to save 
their butter and eggs for the important events in their lives.
<P>
	People saved string from parcels. They saved paper. They saved 
buttons and zippers from discarded clothing, anything they thought 
could be used again.
<P>
	Our senior citizens and many of their children still save 
everything useful. They are the original recyclers and they know 
how to clip a coupon. When they were finally able to work again 
they saved every cent they could squeeze from their carefully 
worked budgets as a down payment on their future.
<P>
	Credit was a dirty word to our senior citizens. It meant you could 
not afford to pay your bills. It meant a loss of dignity.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Instead they saved to buy their homes. They saved to pay cash 
for their furniture, their appliances and their cars. They saved to 
pay for the education of their children. They saved for their old age 
so they would not have to do without in their sunset years, so they 
would not be beholden.
<P>
	Now with interest rates so low their carefully hoarded nest eggs 
are yielding less and less. Seniors have been hard hit in recent years 
by falling interest rates. Unlike younger people who may have been 
able to accumulate savings, our senior citizens are usually unable 
to work. Their interest from their savings is their income. A $1,000 
exemption on interest will really make a difference to them.
<P>
	Younger taxpayers still working may enjoy a tax advantage or an 
investment in an RRSP, but such investments and tax breaks are 
often unavailable to seniors. Many older people are not at ease 
putting their money into more adventurous avenues.
<P>
	Often they do not feel comfortable turning their life savings over 
to a stranger to invest. They are afraid of losing what they worked 
so hard to save. They feel it is safe and secure in a bank savings 
account and they want to be able to withdraw their money at will.
<P>
	Surely the people who built this country deserve a break. It was 
their money, carefully saved and invested, the banks had at their 
disposal when others came to borrow. Their habit of putting money 
aside for the future enabled the banks to invest in the dreams of 
other younger people when they wanted to start a business or build 
a new home.
<P>
	I believe this would be a good habit to instil in the young people 
of today as well. I believe giving them an income tax exemption on 
the first $1,000 of interest would prove to be an incentive.
<P>
	As parents we always want things to be better for our children 
than they were for us. We try to teach them the importance of a 
strong work ethic. We show them ours is a society that celebrates 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17262"> 17262 </A></B>
<P>
success. We tell them they must always strive for personal 
excellence. We encourage them  by stressing there is nothing they 
cannot achieve if they just try.
<P>
	We know young people must be given the opportunity to learn to 
take responsibility for their own lives. Only then can they acquire 
the self-confidence and pride in their own accomplishments that 
everyone needs for self-esteem. Without self-esteem it is pretty 
hard to gain entry into the mainstream of society and virtually 
impossible to become the leaders we will need in the future.
<P>
	Our youth are the future of our nation and our world. They will 
decide our destiny. The choices made by the young people of today 
will eventually define the world in which we all live.
<P>
	There is little in this life more fulfilling than saving for a goal 
and reaching that goal through conscious effort and sacrifice. I can 
think of no better or more satisfying way to take control of one's 
own life and destiny.
<P>
	Our government should do whatever it can to encourage our 
young people to be responsible citizens and consumers. Among 
young people age 25 to 29, 406,660 or 55 per cent included bank 
interest as a source of income in 1992. So it is already a significant 
means of saving, ready to increase with some encouragement. 
Young people who may be saving for a down payment on a house 
or for a new couch or refrigerator are not making much interest on 
their savings. They should not be penalized on what little they do 
earn.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	An exemption would act as an incentive and would make more 
money available for banks to loan out as well. Many of the big 
ticket items like appliances have been purchased on credit cards in 
the past few years. Instead of the dirty word it was to our seniors, 
credit and the amount of credit available somehow became a status 
symbol.
<P>
	Credit is incredibly easy to get. Everyone has heard of reports of 
children and even the family dog being offered credit cards. But 
credit card purchases cost consumers much more than waiting until 
one can pay cash. It is very easy to be sucked into the maelstrom of 
spending more than one actually earns.
<P>
	In the first seven months of this year 36,118 consumer 
bankruptcies were filed across Canada. That is 16 per cent more 
than in the same span last year and one per cent more than in the 
first seven months of 1991, when the 12-month toll reached an 
unprecedented 62,277. According to some analysts, much of the 
cause of these consumer bankruptcies is credit card borrowing.
<P>
	Saving is clearly a better way to go. For those with relatively 
modest incomes, an investment in a savings account is one of the 
few investment opportunities readily available.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that there are plenty of tax breaks 
for those with large amounts of money to invest. An exemption on 
the payment of income tax on the first $1,000 of interest from 
savings accounts would give a break to the little guy and help our 
senior citizens as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
rise to speak to the motion by the member for 
Bramalea-Gore-Malton concerning the tax exemption of 
interest income from saving accounts generating interest of less 
that $1,000.
<P>
	I am convinced that this motion, under its present form, as the 
member explained in his speech, is aimed at helping people with 
low incomes, people who are not well off. However, it creates a 
huge void, because, of course, a motion is not a bill, it is not very 
precise. The motion provides:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the Income 
Tax Act to eliminate the payment of income tax on interest from personal 
savings accounts when the amount of interest is $1,000 or less.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let us look at it in today's context. Someone with $10,000 in an 
account earning 9 per cent would make $900. This means that this 
$900 would be tax deductible. It might be a commendable goal. 
However, if I had $50,000, I could make five $10,000 term deposits 
in five different accounts and earn $4,500 in interest, $900 on each 
account, and pay no income tax. But in truth, I would not belong to 
the group the motion is aimed at. I am not convinced that he is not 
trying to help people with a high income or large savings to evade 
income tax.
<P>
	For this reason, I find it difficult to support a motion whose 
present wording would create such an unprecedented tax loophole. 
Even if there is a precedent, it would still be a horrendous loophole.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	If you put this debate in a larger perspective, you can see that the 
goal of the motion is to help lower income people. I am pleased that 
we are showing concern for people with a low income and few 
savings.
<P>
	In politics we are very often influenced by the richest lobbies, we 
also go to bat for the neediest, but in between there are all the 
workers, all the wage earners, that we very often forget and that are 
probably the least organized. They very often belong to 
professional corporations or trade unions, but it is very seldom that 
we show concern in our speeches or political actions for the lower 
middle class. They maybe the least organized and this would 
explain the fact that they are the target of all government measures: 
they are not a political force.
<P>
	If you look at this motion in the larger perspective, it shows a 
desire for equity. In the area of taxation everything is a matter of 
equity. However, I do not think  that the solution is to increase the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17263"> 17263 </A></B>
<P>
deductions we now have. With our deficit at around 32 billion 
dollars, such a proposal does not seem like a good idea at the 
present time. Just as we cannot afford to forego tax revenues, 
because our tax system is extremely complex and some people can 
even afford tax experts to bypass the system. I am not talking about 
fraud or anything illegal here, just going over every comma and 
every sentence in the Income Tax Act to get the most out of it.
<P>
	I am just back from a series of consultations held by the finance 
committee in western Canada, where even tax experts told us: 
``Look, we cannot even make sense of this Act ourselves, and we 
are not sure that the government can make sense of it either. One of 
these days, we will have to consider a real reform, whose first 
objective would be, even before the amount of tax revenues to be 
generated, to simplify the whole system''. Of course, the second 
objective would be to determine the optimal level of revenues to be 
generated by a new tax system.
<P>
	All of this brings me back to an issue which has yet to be settled. 
The people have the feeling that the current tax system is not 
working and they are not mistaken.
<P>
	Take, for example, the GST which has been in effect for several 
years now and which will not generate more revenues this year that 
last year. There is a problem here. Even though the growth of 
domestic demand is weak, we see that taxpayers have developed a 
number of ways to avoid paying this tax, which is perceived as 
being extremely unfair.
<P>
	This has been fuelled by the Liberal members who decried this 
tax, when they were in opposition, and promised to replace it, 
something they never did. By the way, we should also be concerned 
about that. People felt that their concerns were legitimate since 
they even had the support of a political party saying that the tax was 
unfair.
<P>
	It is true that it is not perfect, that it is flawed, that it causes a lot 
of problems, but the Liberal Party was accused of demagoguery 
when it said that it was a new tax. The tax on services was new, but 
the tax on goods simply replaced the federal sales tax. In that 
context, it is not right to make the taxpayers angrier than they 
already are about the current tax system for purely political 
reasons.
<P>
	I come back to the fact that we cannot afford today to add these 
types of deductions, but if we want people with low incomes and 
few savings to feel that there is some kind of justice, we have to 
ensure that our tax rules do not allow higher income people to 
avoid paying their fair share.
<P>
	Sometimes people are right, sometimes they are wrong, but 
when we refuse to have a thorough debate on an issue, the 
perceptions that people have, whether good or bad, remain. An 
example of that is the perception that  banks do not pay their fair 
share. I do not have a definite opinion on that, but I think that it is 
something that is worth looking into. It is not by avoiding the issue 
or by making a fine statement that will sound great on the news, 
such as it is too generous, it is out of date, etc., that we will make 
progress. We will have to look into all this.
<P>
	Perhaps when the Minister of Finance and the Minister of 
Revenue both consult Canadians on the budget next year they 
ought, instead of listening to all of the organized groups whose 
final word is always ``Do anything you want to anybody else but 
me'', to set some guidelines for a real debate, true consultation on 
various scenarios for tax policies and tax expenditures, in order to 
get a proper evaluation.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	How much do the present measures cost? What are their 
objectives? Based on that, let us go out to Canadians so that they 
may make their own evaluation and come up with a final 
conclusion that ``We can afford this, but not that. Here are what our 
priorities are for taxation for economic and social development''.
<P>
	Our taxation system pursues two objectives, obvious economic 
ones, but a major social objective as well: the redistribution of 
wealth. This ought never to be lost sight of. For that reason, if the 
taxation system is simplified, that second objective must not be lost 
sight of.
<P>
	You do not deal with fiscal problems due to the fact that not 
enough tax revenue is being collected from people who could pay 
more, by increasing the number of deductions that already exist. 
We simply cannot afford it. How much would the measure 
suggested today cost? Good question. I repeat, those who are a 
little better off may manage to avoid this altogether by having more 
than one bank account, as I explained earlier, by having three or 
four accounts, for instance. That often happens.
<P>
	I have two or three accounts myself. The point is to put your 
money into different accounts, keep your interest income below 
$1,000 and thus avoid paying taxes on this income. I realize this 
technicality could be improved upon while maintaining the purpose 
of the motion which is that interest income of $1,000 and less 
would not be taxable, but in the end, what have we achieved? How 
are we going to finance all that? The question lies here as well.
<P>
	Therefore, out of a sense of fairness, yes, we have to work on it, 
but not necessarily in the way suggested. In the minute I have left, I 
wanted to say, because I heard mention of RRSPs, where 
accumulated interest is tax protected, that they are not really 
affected by such a motion, because RRSPs are taxable only when 
money is removed from them. This is when tax is taken, according 
to our income at that point.
<P>
	So this would not promote saving necessarily. It would not have 
a particularly strong effect on saving, because the vehicle already 
exists and is already attractive enough,  I imagine, from all the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17264"> 17264 </A></B>
<P>
funds successfully channelled and the financial institutions' 
aggressive campaigns to solicit RRSPs.
<P>
	So, to avoid creating an additional tax shelter, which will cost us 
a lot and risks benefitting those who, in the end, perhaps have the 
income and ability to avoid it, we cannot support this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, Motion 
497 seeks to amend the Income Tax Act to eliminate the payment 
of personal income tax on interest from personal savings accounts 
when the amount of interest is $1,000 or less.
<P>
	The rationale used by the hon. member for 
Bramalea-Gore-Malton is that the motion will do five things. 
First, it will promote savings. Well, it is pretty hard to save these 
days. As the hon. member from the Bloc mentioned, this creates 
different avenues and ways to stuff your savings away where it will 
be harder for Revenue Canada to find it.
<P>
	Second, the motion is intended to help the elderly who rely on 
savings and seldom enjoy the tax advantages of an RRSP later in 
life. This is an honourable objective and one I would agree with as 
a problem to solve. But solving it this way is unnecessary, 
especially if we were to devise a proper system of taxation.
<P>
	Third, it is intended to compensate for falling interest rates. Why 
is this the responsibility of taxpayers, adjusting for the inflation 
component and interest income? That is not necessary. When 
institutions set their rates they base them on the performance of the 
economy. They are set at a regular time and over a period of ten 
years the average rate of return is adjusted for inflation.
<P>
	Fourth, the rationale is to reduce administration costs because 
banks will no longer have to issue T4s for interest income, reducing 
the paperwork for Revenue Canada.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member has it backwards. In April we all 
become employees of Revenue Canada and we work for free. We 
sweat for hours trying to get this income tax done and figure out 
how much we have to pay, make sure it is correct and then send it 
in. The information we use has to come from where we have earned 
our money or placed or invested our money. So whether interest 
income on savings is less than or higher than $1,000, the banks will 
still have to issue the paperwork necessary to show you made less 
than $1,000 or more than $1,000.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	We need to stop tinkering with the Income Tax Act and the 
income tax system. We should stop using it for direct social and 
economic engineering. This is another example of using it for 
social engineering. We are using it  to solve a problem. I do not 
deny there is a problem with money, with savings, and with how we 
look after ourselves, but the way to solve it is not through the 
Income Tax Act. We are making it too cumbersome and too 
difficult. It should be under a separate direct-spending program if 
we want to help seniors and children.
<P>
	In 1917 the original purpose of income tax was simply to raise 
money. It was to pay for the first world war. Then the politicians 
and bureaucrats saw how nice and neat it was. Yes, I agree, it is a 
great way to deliver social and economic benefits. But problems 
have been created.
<P>
	In 1992 the net revenue that was collected by the government on 
personal income alone was $60 billion. That included all the 
exemptions, deductions, and tax incentives or loopholes. If there 
were no deductions, exemptions, and tax incentives, the revenue 
for 1992 would have been $120 billion. That is $60 billion we are 
leaving in the hands of people. We give it back to the people. We 
know it is unfair.
<P>
	If we collected that revenue and put it into the spending 
envelopes of the people who are responsible for immigration, 
transportation, unemployment, and health care, then we would 
know what that costs. We would know who is responsible: an 
elected minister or a permanent deputy minister. Those people 
would be more responsible and accountable. The pressure would be 
on the government to rationalize and justify its spending. I believe 
there would be a downward pressure. The problem with our current 
income tax system is that it is unfair.
<P>
	The GST is another example. It generates $30 billion to $36 
billion, yet the net take of the government is $15 billion to $16 
billion. There is the system of rebates, the high cost of compliance 
and the high cost of collection. It is ridiculous.
<P>
	If we used taxation for the one simple purpose of raising money 
and then put the money into the areas where we want to spend it 
and where Canadians want it to be spent, it would be a more 
efficient and effective system of taxation than we presently have 
and we would no longer need all these rates.
<P>
	We know the system is complicated, confusing, and convoluted. 
We need to make changes. Yet nobody addresses that. Everybody is 
afraid to look at a simple system of taxation because in simplicity 
the cost of transition from the current income tax system to a 
simple tax system would be too expensive and the transition would 
be unattainable. I heard that from the chairman of the Standing 
Committee on Finance, who is an income tax lawyer and an expert 
in his field.
<P>
	In the name of deficit reduction and in the name of losing tax 
dollars, is the government afraid to look at a system of taxation that 
features a single rate and allows a generous tax-free portion so that 
the people who need  the money most, the seniors and low-income 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17265"> 17265 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians, do not have to pay any income tax? That line would be 
somewhere between the poverty line and the low-income cut-off. 
Would that not reduce the pressure on our social programs? Would 
that not be a more efficient way of helping the people who need the 
help, rather than tinkering with the Income Tax Act, adding five 
more pages of definitions and rulings and three more reasons why 
auditors have to check every bank account, as the hon. member said 
earlier?
<P>
	We have to look at tax reform. Tax lawyers are afraid to return 
from holidays to read the latest communiqués from Revenue 
Canada with the new rulings and definitions.
<P>
	The current system is a disincentive to work. The more a person 
makes the higher the percentage they have to remit. They call that 
progressivity, but at a certain point they stop working for the 
government. Why? Because they see that government wastes 
money. If the government were spending the money on programs 
Canadians want and not what bureaucrats and politicians want, and 
if people could see their tax money being spent fairly and wisely, in 
a way that was responsible and accountable, in a clear and visible 
fashion, we would have more compliance. More people would pay. 
With a single rate everybody would know they are paying the same 
rate over a certain base that is tax-free.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	It costs us $12 billion to send in our income tax. The personal 
portion we pay other people to do this for us costs $3.7 billion. 
Revenue Canada is $1.5 billion. The government cost for GST is 
$0.6 billion. Corporate costs to do the T4s and their corporate tax is 
$4.9 billion. The GST industry costs $1.7 billion.
<P>
	It is clear: our current system is unfair, unclear, and 
unacceptable. There is no reason we should keep up with it and 
there is no reason we should continue to promote ways and means 
of adding more to the confusion of the income tax. We should be 
cleaning it up, simplifying it, rewriting it.
<P>
	We have had three major tax reforms since 1971. We went from 
18 different brackets and a high marginal rate of 80 per cent in 1971 
to 10 brackets and 43 per cent in 1981, to today, from 1988 until 
now, three brackets with a high marginal rate of 29 per cent. When 
each of those transitions and reforms went from 80 per cent down 
to 29 per cent it meant more revenue to the government.
<P>
	Lower taxes mean more revenue. Simplicity means more 
revenue. Therefore we need one more major tax reform in this 
country, one more simplified tax featuring a single rate with a 
generous tax-free portion that will look after the lower income and 
retain progressivity. It will introduce fairness. Everybody will 
know what they are paying. Reduce the rate to the area of 20 to 22 
per cent, another 7 per cent reduction, and a single rate. I  would 
argue that would generate even more revenue for the government.
<P>
	Some of the other principles we should keep in tax reform are 
keeping it simple and understandable and defining the purpose as 
raising money. Tax reform is not to add another element that the 
first $1,000 you make in savings accounts is free because we are 
helping this sector; not to help the farming sector by giving this 
deduction over here; not to develop oil and gas by offering 
flow-through shares over here; not to help this by doing that over 
there; not to help charitable organizations by allowing generous 
exemptions over here; not to aid and facilitate seniors by having 
some moneys there.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Liberals are neglecting their responsibility to 
the public in giving lip service to tax reform. They are not prepared 
to look at genuine comprehensive tax reform in this country. The 
Reform Party is and will. We will continue to address this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to rise 
today in the House to speak on Motion No. 497. I would like to 
congratulate my hon. colleague from Bramalea-Gore-Malton 
for his hard work in getting this motion to the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Motion No. 497 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the Income 
Tax Act to eliminate the payment of personal income tax on interest from 
personal savings accounts when the amount of interest is $1,000 or less.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Federal taxes on foreign and domestic income received by 
Canadians and Canadian income received by non-residents are 
imposed under one statute, the Income Tax Act. The net income or 
profit received by Canadians is defined by that act.
<P>
	Personal income taxes are imposed by both the federal and 
provincial governments. The federal government has agreements 
with all provinces except Quebec to collect personal income taxes 
on their behalf.
<P>
	The federal government defines taxable income in the Income 
Tax Act and levies its personal income tax according to the rate 
schedule in the act. The agreeing provinces then levy their personal 
income taxes as a percentage of the basic federal tax.
<P>
	In the last decade, the number of taxpayers has jumped from 
10.4 million to 13.7 million. In 1988 there was a sharp drop in 
taxpayers due to the first year of the tax reform. Under it, a 
significant number of low-income taxpayers were granted tax 
relief. Another decline in the number of taxpayers took place in 
1991 and was caused by the recession of the early 1990s.
<P>
	Between 1974 and 1988 the first $1,000 of interest income was 
exempt. The exemption was introduced in 1974 as a way of 
counteracting the impact of inflation on the taxation of interest. It 
was also argued that the  exemption reduced some tax evasion, as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17266"> 17266 </A></B>
<P>
those with small amounts of bank interest no longer had incentive 
to ignore the interest they received when filing their tax return.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	Several arguments can be made in support of my hon. 
colleague's motion. The exemption of the first $1,000 of interest 
income would promote savings. This is very important for those 
with relatively modest incomes. Often an investment in a savings 
account is one of the few investment opportunities readily 
available to a good number of people.
<P>
	Under the existing system, by imposing tax on interest earned 
some consumers are more apt to choose to spend their income in 
the year it is earned because the interest earned on their already 
taxed income will be taxed should they save. ``Spend it. We are 
only going to be taxed on it'', they cry. This commonly held view 
dictates against the merits of saving money.
<P>
	With the proposed motion there would be little distortion 
between present and future consumption. While there is some 
controversy about the magnitude of the change on savings resulting 
from income tax on interest, the general view is that it is a negative 
effect.
<P>
	Some of us ask what are the consequences of reducing savings. It 
is generally felt that a reduction in savings will normally lead to a 
reduction in capital accumulation and in the long run to a reduction 
in output per capita.
<P>
	In light of shrinking government budgets and the upcoming 
review of our role in the provision of pension income, we have and 
continue to encourage Canadians to invest in their retirement. 
There are deductions for RRSP contributions, but why is there no 
provision for savings account or Canada savings bond interest?
<P>
	I realize that RRSP interest is taxed upon withdrawal, albeit 
generally at a reduced rate. There are real limitations in the deferral 
of taxation and these implications translate into economic choices.
<P>
	Another argument in support of the motion is that it will help 
Canada's senior citizens. After the $1,000 tax exemption was 
eliminated in 1988 there were some very convincing statements in 
favour of keeping the exemption, especially as it related to senior 
citizens.
<P>
	In the 1980s over 80 per cent of our taxpayers over the age of 65 
claimed this exemption. It was said that the elimination would have 
a disproportionate effect on senior citizens. Almost half the current 
generation of Canadian seniors, about 50 per cent, live at or below 
the poverty line. A small percentage, 5 per cent only, across Canada 
enjoy incomes of $40,000 or more. The remaining 45 per cent had 
hoped during pre-retirement years to invest in something that 
would act as a supplement to their pension cheques. This 45 per 
cent of Canadian senior citizens over the age of 65 would benefit  
by the restoration of the $1,000 investment income deduction.
<P>
	A third argument is that the exemption would compensate for 
falling interest rates. Although economic activity may in general be 
stimulated by falling interest rates, those whose incomes depend on 
interest bearing assets are being hurt by falling rates. Seniors have 
been hit hard in recent years by such falling interest rates.
<P>
	While there are benefits for seniors and an encouragement of 
savings I also have some serious concerns about the motion. The 
proposal to exempt the interest on savings accounts runs counter to 
current trends toward increasing tax revenue. If all bank interest 
were tax exempt, the lost tax revenues would certainly be 
significant.
<P>
	In the mid-1980s the $1,000 exemption cost the federal 
government about $900 million in loss tax revenue. In 1992, for 
example, tax filers declared over $18 billion in bank interest. This 
figure would be much higher if the exclusion were only for interest 
earned at financial institutions, as investors would adjust their 
portfolios to take advantage of the tax break.
<P>
	Recently Revenue Canada instituted reporting changes for 
financial institutions. Beginning with the 1995 tax year, these 
institutions will be required to issue T5s for interest income at $50, 
down from the current $100 limit.
<P>
	This new measure is meant to limit tax evasion. Some taxpayers 
with interest below $100 have simply ignored that income for tax 
purposes, forgetting or ignoring that every interest dollar earned is 
to be included as income. However the new change seems to 
indicate the government considers bank interest an important 
source of tax revenue.
<P>
	Revenue is obviously an important component of our deficit 
reduction policy and reducing revenue runs counter to this 
necessary policy.
<P>
	Another concern I have with the motion is the difference in 
treatment of earned income and non-earned income. Those who 
work for minimum wage are taxed on the first dollar they earn. 
Those who earn income from interest revenue are treated equitably 
under the existing system. I understand that invested money was 
once income and was likely taxed at the time it was earned, but the 
interest too is income. Allowing exemptions for interest income 
will disproportionately benefit seniors. How can we balance this 
against earned income so that it is socially equitable?
<P>
	I will also address a comment by my colleague from Rimouski. 
The bill indicates interest earned on savings accounts. This would 
include all savings accounts and it would be an accumulative 
effect. It would be the total of the interest that would be considered 
an income. We could not spread our savings over five, six or ten  
<P>

<B><A NAME="17267"> 17267 </A></B>
<P>
different accounts. The exemption would apply to the full income 
no matter where it was.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	While I have some serious concerns about the bill, I generally 
speak in support of it because the investment income exemption is 
one of the few tax initiatives that would reach out and touch most 
Canadian citizens, including my constituents of Erie, rather than 
just a select group of investors.
<P>
	Taxpayers are crying out for tax relief and tax reductions, and 
understandably so. This initiative could be a possible means of 
partially satisfying these demands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, contrary to the private 
member's Motion M-497, the Government of Canada should not 
support the elimination of personal income taxes on interest from 
personal savings accounts when the amount of interest is $1,000 or 
less.
<P>
	As hon. members may remember, before 1988 individuals were 
allowed to claim a deduction of up to $1,000 of interest income in 
computing taxable income. This interest income deduction existed 
at a time of high inflation as an approximate method of providing 
some allowance for income tax paid on the inflationary component 
of interest.
<P>
	Inflation is now very low. Therefore this rationale would not 
apply today. In addition, the elimination of interest income 
deduction was one of a number of base broadening initiatives 
introduced as part of the 1988 tax reform. Those measures made 
possible a reduction in tax rates and the enrichment of certain tax 
credits.
<P>
	The elimination of interest income deduction for 1988 and the 
subsequent taxation years was largely compensated by a $1,730 
increase of the basic personal amount.
<P>
	Therefore it would be inappropriate to restore this deduction 
particularly at a time of very low inflation. The federal revenue 
cost resulting from allowing a deduction of up to $1,000 of interest 
income for income tax purposes would be very high; in the order of 
$1 billion per year.
<P>
	Because of the fiscal situation of our country we simply could 
not afford to make such a change without making up lost revenue. 
This lost revenue would therefore have to be made up through a 
general tax increase, an increase in taxes across the board. Most of 
the burden would fall on the shoulders of the average income 
Canadians while the deduction would benefit only most higher 
income individuals.
<P>
	The bulk of the efforts of the government on the income tax side 
since coming to office in the fall of 1993 has been directed at 
ensuring the tax system is fair. A number of tax advantages that did 
not meet the standards  of fairness Canadians expect were 
eliminated in the 1994 and 1995 federal budgets presented by the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Let me highlight a few of those more important changes that 
have contributed to making our tax system fairer. As hon. members 
are aware, the federal budget of February 22, 1994 proposed a 
number of personal income tax measures. First, the $100,000 
capital gains exemption was eliminated. This exemption largely 
benefited high income filers, and there was little evidence that it 
encouraged investment and job creation as it was first intended to 
do.
<P>
	The tax exemption for premiums related to the first $25,000 of 
coverage under employer provided life insurance plans was also 
eliminated. This measure ensures individuals with employer paid 
life insurance are not treated more favourably than those who 
purchase life insurance out of after tax income.
<P>
	The government did not limit its elimination of tax preferences 
to those preferences that affect individuals. A number of tax 
measures affecting businesses were also introduced in the 
government's first budget. For instance, the deduction for meal and 
entertainment expenses was reduced from 80 per cent to 50 per cent 
of eligible expenses. This change makes the tax system fairer by 
reflecting the significant element of personal consumption 
involved in these or such expenses.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	In addition, Canadian controlled private corporations with 
capital of $50 million or more are no longer eligible for the small 
business deduction and the enriched research and development 
credits accorded to small businesses.
<P>
	The government's commitment to tax fairness did not end with 
the tabling of its 1994 budget; quite the contrary. The federal 
budget tabled February 27 announced more steps the government 
was taking to make the tax system fairer. For example, it was 
announced that the tax deferral advantage enjoyed by individuals 
with business or professional income resulting from their ability to 
select their own year end for tax purposes was being eliminated.
<P>
	As other Canadians, individuals who begin to earn business or 
professional income will have to report their income on a calendar 
year basis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, the 1995 budget eliminated some of the tax benefits 
from family trusts. The government repealed provisions allowing 
the postponement of the implementation of a rule requiring a 
deemed disposal of assets after 21 years.
<P>
	Our efforts to make our tax system fair did not start and do not 
end with budgets. The proof of that is the measures announced by 
the government in December  1994 to prevent the erosion of the tax 
base brought about by the active promotion of abusive tax shelters 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17268"> 17268 </A></B>
<P>
and a longer list of deductions in the calculation of the alternative 
minimum tax.
<P>
	What the government has done in the last couple of years attests 
to its commitment to a fair Canadian tax system. Giving 
preferential treatment to interest income, as suggested in this 
motion, would not be consistent with the policy the government has 
adhered to from the start. Such a change would benefit mainly high 
income taxpayers, since they have more savings.
<P>
	To conclude, and for all these reasons, I urge the House to reject 
private members' Motion M-497.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated a 
votable item, the time provided for the consideration of Private 
Members' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper, pursuant to Standing Order 96(1).
