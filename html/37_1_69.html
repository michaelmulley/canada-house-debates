Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to present a petition signed by

health care system and our environment, and ensure that the 
safety and security of Canadians is at the top of the list.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK23">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should call a 
federal-provincial first ministers' conference for the purpose of 
reapportioning the tax base among the federal and provincial 
governments through the transfer of tax points. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, it is an honour for me this morning to 
launch this debate on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. This is, in 
my opinion, a very important debate that addresses Quebec's 
historical demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, I think it is a good idea to reread the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should call a 
federal-provincial first ministers' conference for the purpose of 
reapportioning the tax base among the federal and provincial 
governments through the transfer of tax points. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the financial situation of the two levels of 
government, namely the federal and provincial governments, can 
be summed up very simply: the needs in the health, education and 
social services sectors are in Quebec and in the other 
provinces, while the money is in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now, Ottawa has been accumulating indecent 
budgetary surpluses. This would be acceptable if Ottawa seized 
this opportunity to withdraw from the area of taxation and left 
it to the provinces or if it would transfer part of these 
surpluses to Quebec and to the provinces, for health and 
education. 
But Ottawa would rather hide these surpluses and reallocate them 
massively to reduce the debt. It even refuses to restore 
transfer payments to the 1993 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has had, and will again 
have the opportunity to demonstrate, with all the energy, 
enthusiasm and seriousness that characterize him, this critical 
aspect because this is what led to today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last federal budget, Ottawa's fiscal effort in the 
transfers for post-secondary education is the lowest in 30 years. 
As for health, the federal contribution is now only equivalent 
to 14 cents for each dollar spent by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion seeks to correct the fiscal imbalance and to 
ensure that the revenues of each government are based on their 
fundamental needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois is calling for a 
federal-provincial conference for the purpose of reapportioning 
the tax base through the transfer of tax points from Ottawa to 
Quebec and the other provinces.  In Quebec there is complete 
agreement on this, and the premiers of some of the other 
provinces share that consensus as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I prefer to leave discussion on the financial situation up to 
the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, our finance critic, and he 
will be speaking later in the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not difficult to figure out that the money is in Ottawa 
while the needs are in the provinces.  The federal government's 
revenues have increased by 53% between 1993 and 2001, while its 
expenditures have decreased by 3%.  Over that same period, 
Quebec's program expenditures have risen by 16% and health 
expenditures by 32%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the health sector alone represented 71% of the 
increase in expenditures.  Federal cuts in expenditures have 
been at the expense of the provinces through cuts to transfer 
payments.  From the early 1990s to the present, federal 
transfers to Quebec have dropped from close to 20% of Quebec 
social expenditures to about 13%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve will certainly 
elaborate more on health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending in education increased by only 3% from 1993 to 2001 
because health was a priority. Things were already fiscally 
tight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem is due to the federal government, because its 
financial contribution in terms of transfers for post-secondary 
education is at its lowest level in 30 years, as I said earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government contributes less and less to the needs of 
Quebecers. Between 1993 and 1999, its share has dropped from 23% 
to 13.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bit of historical context of the tax point issue would be in 
order. Tax points transferred to the provinces are not a kind of 
federal assistance, nor are they an exercise of its spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, they contribute to balance the tax positions in the 
federation, and this has nothing to do with the Canadian social 
transfer for health, education and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax point transfer to the provinces in the 1960s, aimed at 
giving back to the provinces some of the tax room they had 
yielded to the federal government in the 1940s, particularly to 
finance the war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important dates should be remembered. In 1882, Quebec introduced 
its tax on corporations. In 1892, it created inheritance tax. In 
1917, the federal government introduced a personal income tax. 
In 1939, Quebec collected tax on personal income. From 1941 to 
1942, tax rental agreements were signed by which the provinces 
agreed to refrain temporarily from collecting personal and 
corporate income taxes and inheritance tax; in return, the 
federal government agreed to pay them a rent for the war 
effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1947 after the war, the federal government tried to renew 
for five years the tax rental agreements for the purpose of 
reconstruction. Quebec and Ontario refused and created their own 
corporate income tax scheme. These two provinces also started 
collecting inheritance tax again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1952, the federal government maintained its approach and 
offered a new transfer package to the refractory provinces. 
Ontario accepted the offer, but not Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1954, Duplessis said “Give us back our booty”. Since it 
failed to negotiate a partial withdrawal of the federal 
government from the field of personal income tax, Quebec got 
back on board with a rate equal to 15% of the federal rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1960 and 1966, a series of tax points were transferred 
to the provinces. In 1977, there was a federal-provincial 
agreement on tax points, an agreement that excluded Quebec 
which, supposedly, had received more than its share in 1966. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That tax point transfer has indeed been the subject of a 
federal-provincial agreement. The provinces and the territories 
received from the federal government a transfer of 13.5 tax 
points for personal income tax and one tax point for 
corporate income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997-98, the main tax point transfers to the provinces and the 
territories amounted to $2.7 billion.  These transfers are now 
worth four times more, that is, $13.9 billion.  That does not 
mean that the federal government is transferring tax fields 
worth $13.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax points are, in fact, provincial revenues.  Thus, the tax 
point figures appearing in the various federal budgets are 
simply the current value of the points transferred in the 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here I would like to quote a comment Allan Maslove, a professor 
at Carleton University's school of public administration, who 
said that tax points are now an established component of the 
provincial tax base and should not be viewed as a form of 
transfer from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, all Quebec premiers have expressed concerns over 
the tax balance with Ottawa.  By starving the provinces 
financially the federal government, citing its spending power, 
manages to impose its management conditions on certain areas of 
Quebec jurisdiction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier Mr. Duplessis, but I would like to point out 
that Jean Lesage, at the federal-provincial first ministers' 
conference in 1960, reiterated Quebec's position with respect to 
federal spending power by decrying the conditional funding paid 
to the provinces in the form of shared cost programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following him, Daniel Johnson in 1966 renewed Quebec's 
decision to opt out of established joint programs and not take 
part in any new programs.  In addition, he demanded that 
Quebec's withdrawal be unconditionally fiscally compensated.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joint programs are an obstacle to the unfettered growth of 
Quebec. They impose priorities that may get in the way of those 
Quebec would otherwise set, and limit its real budgetary 
autonomy ...  Joint programs freeze the fiscal resources of a 
nation like ours and deny us full control over areas of activity 
that rightfully come under our jurisdiction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Johnson's successor, Jean-Jacques Bertrand, maintained 
Quebec's position. He, too, denounced the exercise of federal 
spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it was the turn of Mr. Bourassa's Liberal government, which 
also saw this spending power as a federal intrusion in Quebec's 
jurisdiction. 
Like his predecessors, Premier Bourassa felt that a new fiscal 
balance would allow Quebec the full exercise of all its powers. 
He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we will only achieve a viable balance if, within the framework 
of the general principle, we can ensure the necessary 
flexibility so that each level of government has the revenue it 
needs to exercise its fiscal powers without a negative impact on 
overall growth and the balance of the various sectors of the 
economy. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Quebec's inaugural speech, read in the 
national assembly in March 1973, made rebalancing tax sharing in 
the federation a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is to say that what we are asking for this morning is 
consistent with what Quebec has asked for in the past, not just 
under PQ governments but under all governments since Duplessis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I too am 
pleased to take part in this debate and to support the motion 
put forward by the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this motion should get the support of every member in 
the House. I would like to read it again in order to put the 
debate in the right perspective. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should call a 
federal-provincial first ministers' conference for the purpose of 
reapportioning the tax base among the federal and provincial 
governments through the transfer of tax points. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the situation is excessively simple and it is also 
excessively dramatic. 
As it was pointed out already, and I think this should be 
stressed again, needs are currently under provincial 
responsibility, like health, post-secondary education and social 
services as a whole. All these responsibilities are at the 
provincial level, whereas money is at the federal level, in 
Ottawa. It is a situation that has to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strongest evidence that the money is in Ottawa is the fact 
that between 1993 and 2001 federal revenues have increased by 
53% while federal spending decreased by 3%. Meanwhile, in Quebec 
program spending increased by 16%. I think these numbers 
illustrate quite well the situation where needs are growing in 
Quebec with a 16% increase in spending, while revenues are 
increasing and spending is decreasing at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allows the federal government to accumulate surpluses that 
are becoming indecent. From 1996 until now, there have been $60 
billion in unforeseen, hidden surpluses. Over the years, the 
Minister of Finance has erred by 130% to 400%. Can the 
government pretend that such errors are inadvertent? I do not 
think so. This is a federal government strategy to 
undemocratically divert part of the taxes paid by Quebecers and 
Canadians in order to use them for other purposes than those 
that were announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has $60 billion in hidden surpluses since 1996. 
These are systematic, deliberate errors. The member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has done some calculations and has correctly 
identified the surpluses over the last years, something the 
Minister of Finance was unable to do. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, whom I congratulate for his 
excellent work, had forecasted $60 billion in hidden surpluses. 
He now tells us that in the next four years $90 billion in 
surpluses will go into the federal government's coffers. What 
for? To pay off the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most undemocratic action since the passage of the 
so-called “clarity” bill, Bill C-20 tabled by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, who wants to lock in the Quebec 
people and their right to collectively choose their future. 
In my opinion, after passage of Bill C-20, the most undemocratic 
thing the federal government has done is certainly diverting its 
surplus towards paying off the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Because the Liberal government got elected on the promise 
that 50% of the surplus would be used to cut taxes and reduce 
the debt and the other 50% would be devoted to all programs, 
particularly those under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we saw some low, despicable electioneering.  The Liberals 
went through the campaign saying that this is how they would 
split the surplus, opposing their approach to the approach of 
other parties like the Canadian Alliance.  The Alliance was 
proposing further tax cuts.  The Liberals wanted to appear 
progressive, but in fact they chose to repay the debt without 
any public debate and they deceived the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this discredits the Liberal government and, 
unfortunately, the whole of politics.  I think we must condemn 
such an undemocratic act and the conference we are proposing 
would be the opportunity for a real public debate where we could 
determine exactly what the surplus should be applied to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, the Bloc Quebecois is not against paying down the 
debt.  However, when we pay down a good part of the debt with 
hidden surpluses, without any public debate, in a way that is 
detrimental to the quality of public services, especially 
provincial ones, there is a big problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I remind hon. members that the Minister of 
Finance greatly paid down the debt with concealed surpluses, in 
a way that was detrimental to health. This has been said before 
but it warrants repeating.  A few years ago, the federal 
government funded 50% of all health spending in Quebec; it paid 
50 cents on the dollar.  Today, its share is only 14 cents on 
the dollar. 
At the same time, the federal government still wants to impose 
national standards on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for post-secondary education, the level of transfer payments 
is at a 30-year low.  Yet the liberals are telling us that investment in 
education is the Canadian way.  What a lie.  Over the past few 
years, federal transfer payments for post-secondary education 
have gone from 12.5% to 8.3%.  That is reality.  It is not just 
words, but reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third element consists in the wholesale paying down of the 
debt with the concealed surplus, while refusing to restore 
transfer payments to the provinces to their 1993 level, a time 
when federal public finances were in a sorry state.  This means 
that today federal transfer payments for program funding in 
Quebec have gone from their 1990 level of 20% down to 13%.  This 
is a real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois have a solution for resolving this 
problem of fiscal imbalance.  As has been said, this is a 
problem that goes back in history.  During World War II, the 
provinces did indeed give up this source of revenue in order to 
contribute to the war effort.  This is a situation we now need 
to remedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to the Bloc Quebecois that the best solution is 
Quebec sovereignty.  With Quebec sovereignty, we would 
repatriate all of our taxes, make collective decisions and 
avoid the anti-democratic situation in which we find ourselves at 
the present time within the Canadian federal system, this 
systematic lack of democracy.  The best example of this is the 
way the employment insurance fund surplus has been diverted and 
the way the surplus that came from all taxpayers has also been 
diverted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec sovereignty is therefore the choice that should be made 
here, but until that time it seems to us that for the good of 
Quebec and for all the provinces as well, all members of this 
House should agree with this motion. The government must sit 
down with the provinces in order to reapportion the tax bases 
and transfer tax points, which would become the property of the 
provinces, so that they may assume their responsibilities in the 
areas of health, education and all the social services.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has already been mentioned.  Historically speaking, all 
Quebec premiers, regardless of their position on the national 
issue, called for the re-establishment of a fiscal balance, be it 
Duplessis, Lesage, Johnson, senior, Jean-Jacques Bertrand, Robert 
Bourassa, René Lévesque, Pierre-Marc Johnson, Daniel Johnson Jr., 
Jacques Parizeau or Lucien Bouchard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these premiers wanted to rectify a situation that may be 
explained historically witch dates from the second world war. 
The federal government has systematically fought the desire 
of Quebec and the provinces to return to the situation that 
existed prior to the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this, I must add an element in the debate, which I think will 
be picked up by the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
This fiscal imbalance exists in the context of a social union, 
something that is extremely dangerous for the future of Quebec, 
because the other provinces have legitimized the federal 
government's intervention in Quebec's jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec refused to sign the social union—which we agree with 
entirely—but in the context of fiscal imbalance, the provinces 
see their jurisdictions threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most amusing illustration of that perhaps was the 
millennium scholarships, in which the federal government did 
everything possible to ensure a little maple leaf appeared on 
the cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the motion proposed by the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière speaks for itself. 
Nevertheless, I would like to move the following amendment to 
the main motion. I move: 
<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding after the word “conference” 
the following: “, as soon as possible,”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the situation is pressing.  It is dramatic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must call this conference.  All the 
provincial premiers are calling for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> The amendment is in order. 
Debate is now on the amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise in the House this morning to speak on the Bloc 
motion, although I speak on it with some surprise.  We have the 
Bloc asking for a first ministers conference to discuss the 
reapportioning of the tax base among the federal-provincial 
governments through the transfer of tax points.  I am also 
surprised by the assertion of the Bloc that there is an imbalance 
between the provincial governments, or in this instance between 
Quebec and the national government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to a couple of the speeches a few moments ago, 
there was also a substantial amount of rhetoric with respect to 
what the government was doing with the surplus and how we were 
managing our approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, I disagree with the statements made by the Bloc 
members that the government was not taking a balanced approach to 
its financing.  When we look what we did with our tax file and 
our reinvestment in health care and post-secondary education, 
along with the debt repayment, it clearly reflects what Canadians 
have said to the national government.  In fact they have said it 
to the finance committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also found it quite humorous that a member across the way 
talked about how we were not consulting Canadians.  If we look at 
the prebudget consultation process that was put in place when we 
took office, I believe it was more transparent and more open than 
any prebudget consultation.  It was probably the most transparent 
approach to building budgets in the history of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a couple of statements already made by the Bloc 
that I have some difficulty with and I will address them as I 
continue my discussion this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I would like to make at the outset is that while the 
Bloc has put this motion in front of the Chamber and has asked 
members to consider the idea of calling together first ministers 
to discuss the issue, first ministers meet often.  This is an 
issue could be added to an agenda for discussion, but I find it 
outrageous that the Bloc would put forth a motion to discuss tax 
points, when according to the Bloc it does not mean anything. 
Therefore, I am a bit confused when I try to comprehend why it 
would need more tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to illustrate that point by the fact that since I 
have been in the House, dating back to 1993, and in the various 
debates which have taken place in the House, the Bloc has never 
acknowledged the value of tax points.  That was said earlier by 
the hon. member across the way when talking about the federal 
government's contribution to health care in the province of 
Quebec.  Just to clarify the record about health care and the 
value of tax points and cash, it is 30 cents of every dollar 
rather than the 14 cents as the hon. member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the Bloc members have made a statement that they want 
first ministers to get together to discuss the issue of more tax 
points for the provinces, yet at the same time they never 
acknowledged the value of tax points.  So I have some difficulty 
with that position.  It is quite a contradiction on their part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, there is no consensus among provinces on this issue. 
Unlike Quebec, many provinces in this federation would prefer 
additional cash funding instead of additional tax points.  We 
would have to also acknowledge that the change the hon. members 
across the way are suggesting would lead to some inequities among 
provinces as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point to an example where tax points are worth more in 
prosperous provinces than in less prosperous ones.  One personal 
income tax point is worth $35 per capita in Ontario but only $17 
in Newfoundland in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cash component of the CHST ensures that all provinces get 
the same amount of funding per capita.  Also, and this may be a 
point that the hon. member from the Bloc has great difficulty 
with, the cash transfers also enable the federal government to 
uphold national values.  I point to the principles of the Canada 
Health Act and the prohibition on the minimum periods of 
provincial residency to receive social assistance.  We had a 
situation like that recently where the cash transfers actually 
acted as a lever to ensure some upholding of national values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point that the members across the way made was the 
issue of fiscal imbalance between the federal government and the 
provinces. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT9"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT9"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045
<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the facts, there is no fiscal imbalance between 
the federal and provincial governments.  The majority of 
provinces, 7 out of 10, had balanced budgets in 2000-01 and 8 out 
of 10 provinces are projecting surpluses for the year 2001-02. 
The fact that provinces can balance their budgets and reduce 
taxes means that they have sufficient resources at their 
disposal.  I should also point out that all provinces have 
reduced taxes since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have some difficulty with the assertion of the Bloc 
member that in some way provinces are junior players in the 
Canadian federation.  That is not the case.  Provinces are not 
junior players in the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have access to all major tax bases open to the federal 
government.  They levy personal and corporate income taxes as 
well as sales taxes.  They also have unique access to some of the 
fastest growing revenue sources.   While there is some debate 
about the revenue sources, the provinces nonetheless have access 
to revenue sources like gaming, liquor and natural resources. 
When I look at the facts I have to disagree with the hon. member 
across the way when he talks about the imbalance that exists 
between the federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would acknowledge, as would any member of the House, that 
provinces obviously face spending pressures.  I hear it every day 
in my community, as I am sure many members hear it in their 
communities.  The provinces face pressure with respect to health 
care and education.  We all know that those two issues are 
extremely important to Canadians.  Members across the way, 
particularly those in the Bloc, must acknowledge that the federal 
government recently announced a 35% increase in cash funding in 
five years in support of these programs through the Canada health 
and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc put forward some points this morning with which I would 
agree.  There are spending pressures in the provinces with 
respect to health care and education.  It is incumbent upon the 
Bloc to recognize that the national government has played a role 
in helping to ease those pressures and to reflect what Canadians 
are telling federal members of parliament, for example that 
health care and education are priorities, so that the national 
government responds to those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also incumbent upon Bloc members to recognize the value of 
tax points.  Perhaps they are doing that now.  Hopefully later 
today those members will rise to acknowledge the value of tax 
points.  Up to this debate Bloc members have consistently ignored 
tax points and have said that they have no value.  Yet today they 
are asking for more tax points and for a first ministers meeting 
to attempt to accomplish that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out the financial picture we are facing 
when we talk about the relationship between the federal 
government and the provinces.  Compared to the provinces, the 
national government faces a much higher debt burden.  In fact 
federal spending on interest payments is 25 cents per dollar of 
revenue and provincial spending on interest payments is only 12 
cents per dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly face some challenges as a national government. We 
are prepared to deal with them.  We are attempting to pay down 
the debt at the same time.  We have always maintained in the 
House, since coming to office in 1993, that our approach would be 
a balanced one.  We would not take an extreme approach to 
governing and working with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across the way also made the point this morning 
that the national government was running surpluses at the expense 
of provincial fiscal stability.  I have to disagree with that 
statement.  Our federal priorities are reflected in the recent 
actions that have been taken, namely the $100 billion in tax 
reductions to provide savings to Canadians and to spur economic 
growth. 
That type of tax plan will help provincial economies to prosper. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since coming to the House I have consistently stated as a member 
of parliament that there is a relationship between a reduction in 
tax and the economy growing.  I believe we must maintain a 
balanced approach.  We do not want to jeopardize the very real 
priorities of Canadians, those being health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been substantial increases in transfers to the 
provinces to support social programs.  To date Bloc members have 
not recognized the value of tax points.  I am hoping that today 
they will stand to recognize the value of tax points and 
recognize the role the national government plays in reflecting 
Canadian priorities and in supporting provinces in partnership to 
address provincial issues, which in many cases are national 
issues as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax points are a very important way in which the federal 
government transfers money to the provinces.  My colleagues on 
this side of the House will be explaining how important they are. 
It is not the only way in which transfers occur.  I would like to 
spend a few moments telling the House and Canadians about some of 
the others ways the national government transfers funds to 
provincial governments.  If we want to understand what is 
happening and if we want to see the whole picture, we have to 
consider the full range of ways in which the federal government 
transfers resources to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus for a moment on the province of Quebec and make 
reference to other ways the province of Quebec receives funds 
from national programs.  The province of Quebec receives 26% of 
federal research dollars, 33% of industrial R and D, 32% of 
health research funds, 26% of infrastructure dollars, 30% of CFI, 
29% of funds allocated for research chairs, and 50% of technology 
partnership funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the transfer of funds it is incumbent upon 
everyone to recognize that the transfer of dollars to provinces 
occurs in a number of ways, tax points being one.  It is 
refreshing to hear that the Bloc is now recognizing that tax 
points have value.  Cash transfers are another way of 
transferring money to provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Canada health and social transfer. It is 
certainly what many Canadians would say is the most important 
transfer to provinces because of the programs if funds and in 
turn what those programs mean for families and their communities. 
Out of that transfer the provinces fund health care, 
post-secondary education, social assistance, social services and 
early childhood education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to present some historical context because it is 
important to go back in history, as my hon. friends across the 
way often do, to understand what we are talking about this 
morning.  In 1996 the CHST, a single consolidated transfer, 
replaced two programs.  It replaced the established programs 
financing which supported health and post-secondary education and 
the Canada assistance plan which contributed to social 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CHST transfers money to provinces and territories that helps 
fund these programs.  At the same time, I emphasize, it gives 
provinces the flexibility to allocate those dollars to their own 
priorities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1055

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September, some eight months ago, the Prime Minister and 
first ministers from across the country reached an agreement that 
included a strengthening of the financial commitment to the CHST. 
It is important to note as well that the first ministers gave 
Canadians their commitment to strengthen and renew health care 
services through partnership and collaboration, with the federal 
government being an equal partner in this renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That commitment set out a five year stable funding plan which 
would mean a transferring of an additional $21.1 billion through 
the CHST.  That agreement had an immediate impact.  In 2001-02 
the provinces and territories will receive $18.3 billion in cash. 
That will significantly help to accommodate some of the 
increasing pressures outlined this morning with respect to the 
many CHST funded programs.  In fact that number will rise 
steadily to $21 billion by 2005-06. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding commitment was also accompanied by a renewed 
commitment to the Canadian health care system which was the 
latest in a series of important CHST related investments on the 
part of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to take a minute to think about some of the 
measures the federal government has announced in the last few 
years. In 1998 we raised the annual CHST cash floor to $12.5 
billion. The 1999 budget announced an $11.5 billion cash 
investment in health.  The 2000 budget provided a further $2.5 
billion in cash. In the last two years alone the federal 
government announced CHST cash transfers of over $25 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, our debate today has to consider the 
whole picture when we talk about transfers to the provinces. 
Certainly the CHST may be the most important transfer to 
Canadians, but when we look at the way dollars are transferred to 
provinces we would be hard pressed to think of a transfer more 
typically Canadian than equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of policy, equalization means that the federal 
government helps to reduce disparities among provinces and 
regions and helps to ensure that all Canadians, regardless of 
where they live, have access to quality services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, although I could probably speak to this issue for 
the entire day, it is fair to say I have some difficulty in 
understanding the rationale behind the Bloc proposing the 
motion.  Back in 1993-94 the Bloc never recognized the value of 
tax points. Now it is asking for more tax points.  Its members 
talk about the fiscal imbalance between the federal government 
and the provinces.  That is clearly false.  Since 1993 we have 
been very open and transparent with respect to surplus and with 
respect to building budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe for one moment that the Bloc has any real 
interest in pursuing the debate and dealing with the facts, given 
that its only purpose is to continue to bring forward statements 
that are questionable in some cases.  I certainly respect the 
opinion of my hon. colleagues across the way, but I respectfully 
disagree with a number of points they made this morning.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the member for Stoney Creek. It is not out 
of ignorance that he made such ill-chosen remarks. He is familiar 
with the issue since he was, for a few years, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance. I find it hard to 
understand how he is approaching the issue and how he can make 
such ill-advised comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he said that the Bloc Quebecois never cared about tax 
points. The fact is that we have cared about them since we first 
got here. 
As early as 1994, we suggested that the transfer of tax points 
to the provinces, particularly Quebec, would provide some 
protection against the deep cuts made by the Minister of 
Finance—who was putting his fiscal house in order at the expense 
of others—to the Canada social transfer, for health, education 
and income support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were the first ones in 1994 to raise the possibility of 
transferring tax points in order to free up some area of 
taxation for the provincial governments, so that they could 
protect themselves against the federal government's slash and 
burn approach. Second, we were also concerned about the 
interpretation made by these professional demagogues of the use 
of tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1960s, the federal government transferred tax points, 
specifically at the Quebec City conference in 1964.  Mr. Pearson was 
much more open-minded than this bunch of demagogues.  In 1977, 
he transferred other tax points, freeing up the tax field and 
telling the provinces “From now on, I will look after my 
responsibilities in certain areas of jurisdiction, and I leave 
the tax field to you.  You can collect taxes in my stead”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once you sell your house, you no longer have a say in what goes 
on there.  That is the business of the new owner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing with the tax points.  The Bloc Quebecois is 
denouncing the demagogic use the Liberals are making of these 
tax points transferred in the 1960s and 1970s.  Do members 
realize what this allows them to say as a result?  It allows 
them to say “On the contrary, we increased the Canada social 
transfer”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has managed to almost double the value of federal 
transfers by factoring in old tax points over which it no longer 
has any say; the house has been sold.  There is a new owner. 
The government's figures are misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I ask the member for Stoney Creek how he can grandstand on 
an issue as important as this.  He will recall, if he knows his 
Canadian history—although he does not seem to; it is a bit odd 
that a sovereignist is instructing a federalist on Canadian 
history—that in the 1960s and 1970s, we were looking at a fiscal 
imbalance.  In those days, there were intelligent people on both 
sides, in Quebec and in the rest of Canada, who could sit down 
together and negotiate new tax sharing agreements.  Could we see 
a little more intelligence and a little less grandstanding and 
cynicism on the other side of the House? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am always interested to 
hear from my hon. colleague along the way.  I had the opportunity 
to spend a bit more time with him when I was much more involved 
as a parliamentary secretary with respect to finance issues and 
the finance committee.  His enthusiasm for his perspective has 
not diminished at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still find it somewhat ironic that perhaps he was not 
listening earlier this morning when two members of his party were 
in debate and were talking about the participation of or the 
expenditure made by the national government with respect to 
health care in his province.  I stand to be corrected, but I 
certainly understood the member to be suggesting that we were 
only participating to the tune of some 14 cents per dollar.  If 
we calculate the cash transfer and include the tax points it is 
closer to 30 cents per dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member might want to stand in his place and say that 
when members of his party first got here they acknowledged the 
tax points and the value of tax points.  However when putting 
forward their position they continue in their rhetoric and 
continue to ignore the value of tax points and only speak about 
the cash portion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take the position put forward by the hon. member, and this 
occurred a number of years ago, we must ignore the room that was 
ceded to the provinces with respect to tax points.  I am not sure 
whether the hon. member is suggesting that we were to freeze the 
value of tax points back then.  If we look at the value of those 
tax points today and the room that was ceded to the provinces, 
they are worth six times more today than in 1977.  They were 
worth $2.7 billion then and today they are worth $15.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have it both ways.  While we acknowledge that the tax 
room was ceded to the provinces at that time, we cannot ignore 
the fact that those tax points were ceded by a national 
government. 
When we talk about transfers to provinces we must continue to 
look at the whole picture, and the whole picture involves the 
transfer of cash and the transfer of points.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I meet with my constituents, and I am sure many members 
across the way meet with theirs, they are pressing the national 
government to ensure that it maintains some type of system of 
equality across Canada.  Cash transfers are the way that is done. 
That is the way we uphold Canadian values and, for instance, the 
Canada Health Act.  Equalization is the way we attempt to 
maintain equality of services for all Canadians across the 
country when some provinces are more prosperous than others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand and accept that provinces have funding challenges, 
but it is somewhat irresponsible to suggest that the national 
government has played no role in trying to assist provinces.  We 
must define the way we participate in that partnership.  That is 
quite clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We help fund health care and post-secondary education and we do 
so by tax points and cash.  I ask the hon. member to not only 
recognize that tax points were ceded back then but to acknowledge 
that tax points play a role in transfers to the provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the member was erudite and thorough in his 
response.  He made the point that the value of tax points ceded 
in the 1970s has grown sixfold.  I do not know if that is in 
purely nominal terms or in real terms.  I suspect it is in 
nominal terms.  Nevertheless they have grown over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the great virtue of tax points as opposed to simple 
transfers that take place through the equalization system or 
through the CHST.  Such transfers do not grow and therefore do 
not respond to the growing need for provincial expenditures in 
health care, education and other areas that will grow over time, 
particularly health care as the population ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What justification can be given for not ensuring that our health 
care system, which is by consensus across the country the most 
valuable of all our social programs, is funded through an 
expanding, guaranteed tax base that cannot be cut as was the CHST 
or its predecessor in the early to mid-1990s by the Liberal 
government?  Those cuts left provinces in the lurch and created a 
funding crisis which continues to this day, notwithstanding the 
partial and very tardy, if I may say, return of some of those 
funds to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at those two options, what would be the principal reason 
for denying provinces a predictable tax base whereby they could 
operate the most important of all social programs at their 
disposal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, I hope the hon. member 
across the way does not disagree with what I am about to say.  He 
acknowledged that tax points continue to grow and will continue 
to grow.  However it is important to recognize, and I hear this 
from my constituents on a consistent basis, that Canadians want 
to see the national government play a role in national programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of British Columbia wanted to impose a residency 
requirement for the collection of social assistance.  The only 
reason the decision was reversed was that the national government 
would have held back a cash transfer which would have imposed and 
reflected what Canadians were saying.  They want national 
programs which, if not exactly the same from province to 
province, at least adhere to specific criteria to some extent 
like the health care program and social assistance programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there a cash portion in our transfers?  It is to ensure 
that national standards or a national approach to these programs 
is clearly evident.  We have seen that with respect to social 
assistance and we want to see it with respect to health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, at the start of my comments I 
advise that I will be splitting my time today with the member for 
Lanark—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Relating to the response and the question we have just heard, 
the British Columbia government passed a requirement that for 
healthy, employable people moving into the province, and it was 
very clear on that, there would be a three month residency 
requirement before they could access social services.  That was 
the B.C. government supported by its population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it ran counter to federal Liberal philosophy that the 
program should be available even to healthy, able-bodied people, 
the government put pressure on the B.C. government and said that 
it would fine that government every day the policy was in place. 
That was in direct contradiction to the democratic request of the 
people of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we asked most Canadians whether there should be some kind of 
stipulation for healthy, employable people not to be able to 
immediately access social welfare programs, I think most would 
agree that there should be some kind of regulation and would not 
be in agreement with the federal Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to rise today to concur with the Bloc 
Quebecois on the motion.  I am being very careful in saying that. 
It is not often I am able to do so.  On many issues such as the 
great question of national unity we do not agree with the Bloc, 
but wherever possible, as is the Canadian way, we strive to find 
common ground and proceed from there. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are telling the government there is a common ground. We 
are asking the government to meet with the provinces to discuss 
the transfer of tax points. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer of tax points was actually our policy before the 
formation of the Canadian Alliance.  During the last election 
campaign the Canadian Alliance once again made the proposal to 
transfer more tax points to the provinces.  It is therefore 
appropriate that we call upon the government to meet with the 
provinces to discuss, at the very least, the next step in a 
process which was begun by the Liberals in 1977.  With the usual 
glacier-like speed of government we are trying to get the issue 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All stakeholders should meet to discuss such a change because it 
affects all provinces.  Therefore it should not be done 
unilaterally as the federal Liberals like to do on too many 
occasions.  It is important to hear from all provinces so the 
merits and demerits can be properly considered. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments across Canada want to provide comparable services to 
all their citizens, regardless of where they live. We want these 
principles to be upheld; they are part of the Canadian 
tradition. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to put the issue in context by making an historical 
reference.  The Rowell-Sirois commission, which was struck in 
1937, made a proposal that only the dominion should levy income 
taxes.  Although the proposal was initially rejected, when the 
war broke out it was adopted by the provinces strictly as a 
wartime measure.  The provinces abandoned their income taxes and 
in return were supposed to receive unconditional payments to 
compensate them for that lost revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its agreements with each province the federal government 
undertook that at the end of the war it would reduce federal 
taxes so as again to create room for the provinces to resume 
levying their income taxes.  In 1977 the Liberal government of 
the day ceded back to the provinces some of the tax room that the 
federal government had taken away.  However the arrangement has 
been frozen since 1977. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compromises provincial governments had to make 50 years ago 
to support the war effort must be recognized. The current 
Liberal government must act accordingly. We are not asking it to 
be generous, not at all, rather we are asking it to give back to 
the provinces the powers that are rightfully theirs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further transfer of tax points would also address two 
fundamental problems.  The first is the present mismatch between 
the responsibilities of the provinces and the power they have to 
tax. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT15"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT15"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1115

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year three noted economists wrote a paper arguing that 
there “is a fundamental mismatch between the taxing power of the 
federal government and its restricted spending jurisdiction”. 
That is, the federal government simply takes in too much money 
compared to its constitutional responsibilities.  It is an 
imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That generates the political problem of democratic 
accountability, since the government that raises the taxes, in 
this case the federal government, does not actually spend the 
money.  Instead, the federal government transfers cash back to 
the provinces in the form of the Canada health and social 
transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the federal government can cut the transfer 
arbitrarily, as the federal Liberals have done throughout their 
time in office.  It has been their consistent approach.  This has 
forced provinces to make drastic cuts in their areas of social 
spending, notably health care, and also undergo the consequent 
displeasure of the electorate.  If the government does not 
transfer the full amount of resource, then provinces have to 
cutback and experience voter displeasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CHST is still lower today than when the Liberals came to 
power eight years ago.  They have removed a cumulative $25 
billion from the CHST, but since they do not deliver the programs 
funded by the CHST the provinces then wrongly take the political 
blame for those cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further tax point transfer would help to realign democratic 
accountability, and that is what we are talking about.  No longer 
would the federal government be able to reduce funding 
unilaterally and then place the blame for cutbacks on the 
provinces, as the federal Liberals have done consistently in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second problem is a related one.  It simply has to do with 
trust.  For the last seven years the federal government has 
rejected its responsibility for health, social and post-secondary 
education spending.  As a matter of fact, it has spent over $100 billion on 
grants and contributions, while sacrificing the most important 
social programs which Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are asking us how the federal government can then be 
trusted in the future to preserve that which is most valuable to 
Canadians?  There is a lack of trust because of the history of 
the federal Liberals in this area.  I believe that if the federal 
government feels it is necessary it will again act in a cynical, 
political way to abandon health care, if it is health care where 
the pressure is, or off-load cuts to education and social 
assistance to the provinces in order to preserve other items for 
their own public image.  That has been their past history.  I 
believe we run the risk of seeing that to be their future 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present system of fiscal transfers encourages federal 
irresponsibility.  The logical step to restore confidence and 
trust in the security of funding for our social programs is to 
realign the taxing power with the spending power, as indicated in 
our constitution, to make sure the government, which has the 
constitutional responsibility to deliver program, also has the 
power to go to its electorate to raise the money to pay for the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we trust the provinces?  That is the next fair question.  I 
believe we can.  We can trust the provinces because those 
governments are all returned to office, or replaced and new ones 
brought in, by the very electors who share a broad democratic 
consensus for the need to have strong support for the social 
programs, especially health care.  I remind the House that while 
the federal government was cutting over $6 billion per year from 
cash transfers for health, the provinces were increasing health 
care spending.  They have proven their level of trust.  They have 
earned the trust of Canadians and the government has not. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of tax point transfers enjoys broad support among not 
only the provinces, but also the opposition parties in the House 
of Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This area is one of great concern, as we have indicated.  In 
1997 Jean Charest's platform promised to convert $12.5 billion in 
CHST cash transfers to tax points in exchange for reaching a 
covenant defining federal and provincial roles in supporting 
health, post-secondary education and social programs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an excellent position, which we fully support and about 
which we continue to be in agreement with Mr. Charest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question is good. 
Because of the time allotted for this particular debate, I do not 
want to depart from the importance of the subject of the tax

is a transfer of cash to members of parliament, and citizens 
really want to know where we stand on that.  It is a very 
important issue, but I do not want to deflect from this issue of 
calling together the provinces to talk about transferring the tax 
points to them, which the federal Liberal government took away 
some years ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam

</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Leader of the Opposition tell us whether his party is 
committed, regardless of its position on tax points, to 
maintaining or perhaps even expanding the cash portion of the 
transfer from the federal government to the provinces with 
respect to health care and post-secondary education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our point of view, the cash transfer is very important 
to maintain national standards.  If we do not have anything to 
withdraw, or not transfer, or if national standards are not being 
met, for instance the conditions of the Canada Health Act, then 
the federal government loses its power to enforce national 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Leader of the Opposition tell us whether his party is 
committed to maintaining the cash floor either as is or in an 
enhanced way, and whether or not his position on tax points in 
any way suggests that the cash floor should be eliminated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Madam Speaker, the ability of the 
provinces to continue to finance their programs under CHST, 
especially health care, is critically important.  I can answer 
the hon. member's question by repeating the Canadian Alliance 
position, especially related to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only should we maintain the five principles of the Canada 
Health Act, but we should add a sixth principle which would 
legislate the funding level for health below which the federal 
government could not go. That would put in place the assurance 
our citizens need that we would not see for political purposes 
the arbitrary reduction of the value of that portion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we would be not only supporting the cash transfer, 
but also the minimal level and restoring the full amount of the 
cash transfer, which still has not been done to the 1994-95 
levels.  Therefore, restore it to those levels and put into law 
the principle of a legislated amount below which the federal 
government could not go. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the leader's remarks in this area.  In 
his previous capacity as the treasurer for the province of 
Alberta, he will know, in terms of the farm situation, that in 
recent years the Liberal government made much of the fact that 
funding for farm aid programs was in the 60:40 ratio; 60% from 
the federal government and 40% from the provinces.  The 
government would have us believe that has been the case 
since confederation.  However there are all kinds of examples to 
indicate that it is a relatively new phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came from a meeting of the agriculture committee at which 
it was made very clear that the have provinces, which would 
include Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, were probably better able to 
finance farm programs, such as the AIDA program and now the 
Canadian farm income program, than some of the have not 
provinces, including Manitoba and Saskatchewan at this point in 
time, as well as I suppose the Atlantic provinces.

member, there is an equity even in terms of how certain 
agricultural policy is applied.  We have proposed a number of 
very clear initiatives that would help the entire agricultural 
community, regardless of whether they are so-called have or 
have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there needs to be an aggressive initiative on the part of 
the federal government to negotiate downward with the United 
States and the EU community the subsidies which right now put us 
at a competitive disadvantage.  For instance, it has not put 
together the leveraging power of the Cairns Group of countries on 
the agricultural side to pressure the United States.  The federal 
government needs to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also needs to deal with the question of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  There is an inequity among provinces.  The Canadian Wheat 
Board binds western provinces to market their grain through that 
wheat board, not having the choice or the ability for alternate 
sources of marketing.  Ontario and Quebec are not bound by that. 
In fact, a farmer wanting to look at value-added processing would 
have to sell his or her product to the wheat board, buy it back 
at a higher rate and also add in the grain transportation cost 
even though there might not be any transport of the grain.  That 
needs to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of grain transportation, efficiency and market 
realities have to be put into the grain transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the tax side, the taxes on farmers and on agricultural 
business have to be significantly reduced so we get the value 
added going in.  The agriculture fees the federal government 
charges need to be reduced; $300 million alone just on the 
fertilizer.  As well, diesel costs, excise tax and the GST on 
fuels should be lowered so the government is not taxing on tax. 
Those are a number of things that need to be done in the 
agricultural community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will start by deviating from the prepared 
remarks I have and comment on the question that was raised by the 
hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona.  Presumably he was referring 
to CHST payments and Bloc grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was involved as the Reform Party's senior researcher in 1995 
or 1996 when the CHST legislation was proposed.  It was really a 
rehashing of the legislation that permitted the former Canada 
assistance plan and the established programs financing plan to 
exist.  We put forward some detailed amendments which, like all 
amendments that came forward in committee, were of course voted 
down and never given a fair hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I looked at the details of funding and how it was 
withheld when non-compliance occurred with federal standards 
under the CHST.  What was striking about it was how utterly 
discretionary it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the Minister of Health decided whether a violation 
has taken place.  The Minister of Health at his or her sole 
discretion decides whether or not a penalty is appropriate, what 
the amount of that penalty should be, whether it should apply in 
one province but perhaps not in another province and if 
compliance has not been achieved whether the penalty should 
continue.  What we see is a situation in which we do not have a 
standard that is enforced by any kind of impartial mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a standard that is enforced, if it is enforced at all, 
based on political considerations.  Is it a province in which the 
government holds a lot of seats?  Is it a province in which it 
might hold a lot of seats in the future, if it does the right 
thing?  Is it a province that is assertive in standing up for its 
rights or is it one that can be easily intimidated by the 
government?  Is there an election coming?  Has an election just 
occurred?  Is this going to play well elsewhere in the country? 
There is a whole series of considerations that have nothing to do 
with providing for satisfactory health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made recommendations at that time that would have created 
some form of right of appeal of citizens or of provincial 
governments before the Federal Court of Canada.  The court would 
then make the decision whether or not a standard was being 
violated.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also have the salutary effect of actually defining some 
of the national standards under the Canada Health Act, which are 
often not as clear as they ought to be.  That would have been a 
real step forward.  All of that was put aside.  Much of it was 
actually incorporated in the 1997 Conservative platform which my 
leader cited today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of trying to get co-operative national standards is a 
bit more detailed than finding some form of standard to which 
there is an agreement to co-operate with and therefore an 
enforcement mechanism.  None of that has been done.  Therefore we 
would find that the Canada Health Act and the block transfers 
that are given under the Canada health and social transfer would 
continue to be as they are now, that is, extremely ineffective in 
ensuring enforceable, meaningful national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to draw the House's attention to the fact that 
the motion we are debating today fits within a growing stream of 
voices from across the country that are calling for an end to the 
imbalance that exists under which the provinces have the vast 
majority of the spending needs.  It is because they are assigned 
the most important social programs under our constitution and 
under which the federal government draws in most of the revenue 
and therefore redistributes it.  This is a problem that has 
existed for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back to Confederation, the Fathers of Confederation 
provided for per capita cash transfers that continue to this day 
but they are very small because they were in nominal dollars and 
the economy has grown and inflation has taken place. 
Nevertheless, there was a system set in place for transfers to 
provinces and, I should mention, these were non-discretionary. 
They could not be withheld for any reason.  Therefore there were 
some assurances the provinces would operate effectively within 
their spheres of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to the voices in recent decades over the need to 
return to the original intent and spirit of the constitution, we 
find that many of the voices have come from Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there was the Tremblay Commission in the 1950s, 
last century. There was former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau, who said in 1957 that there was no real basis for the 
federal spending authority in the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also the interim report of the Quebec Liberal Party 
special committee on the political and constitutional future of 
Quebec society that came out in January of this year, the report 
by the constitutional commission of Action démocratique du 
Québec and the Séguin commission. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these groups are talking about the transfer of tax 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside of Quebec we see the same concerns being raised with an 
ever clearer voice.  For example, an eminent scholar, Thomas 
Courchene, has recommended some form of tax point solution to the 
fiscal imbalance that exists in Canada.  The so called firewalls 
group in Alberta has called for something of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has been a consistent voice in favour of 
using some form of tax point system that would ensure our economy 
grows and that the health care needs of our aging population 
would be met without going through the song, dance and chicanery 
that went on when the government cut its own expenditures by a 
mere 6%.  At the same time as it cut transfers to the provinces 
for health care and education, by I believe 20% to 25%,  it also 
tried to lay the blame for the lack of health care spending on 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax point solution was also the policy of the former Reform 
Party.  It was an excellent policy and one that we can all stand 
behind.  I was involved in actually drafting the policy so I will 
read it for the benefit of the House.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the establishment of an agreement to 
replace federal cash grants to the provinces with unconditional 
transfers of the tax base of each province, adjusted for 
differential provincial economic development so that the 
provincial tax revenues collected in each province will grow in 
parallel with the growth in the province's economy and 
population.  This will allow the content and particulars of 
provincial policy to be set by provincial government clearly 
accountable to the electorate of that province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something needs to be said when the point is made about being 
accountable to the electorate of a province.  Sometimes it is 
suggested that the federal government ought to impose national 
standards because the federal government knows best what 
Canadians care about and what is important to them.  That means 
we must accept that the voter who goes out and casts a vote in 
the province of Ontario or Quebec is acting less responsibly and 
has less of a social conscience at that moment than he or she 
does when casting a ballot in the federal election.  It infers 
that somehow there is this schizophrenia in the Canadian voter, 
that we are a hardhearted and uncaring people when we vote 
provincially but when we vote federally, boy we sure do care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is obvious nonsense and the only way it gets through is 
because there has been a really concerted effort on that side of 
the House to maintain that fiction.  There is a very powerful 
vested interest in saying that the Liberals are the responsible 
ones here, that they are the ones who dictate what is good, fair 
and right in the country and that they protect our interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in my comments to the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, the record shows that the federal 
government's performance in this area has been appalling.  It has 
been shameful, inconsistent and politically based.  It has not 
been based upon any kind of fairness or objectivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When other parties such as our own have come forward and 
proposed ways in which it could be made fair, objective and 
actually guarantee that health care and other national standards 
would be maintained through an agreed upon, consensual process 
that would be enforceable and would reflect the will of Canadian 
voters, it has been rejected out of hand without any hearing 
whatsoever.  That is unfair and it should be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax point solution proposed by the eminent authorities I 
have cited and also by the Bloc Quebecois today is the best 
solution.  I encourage all members in the House to vote for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member who just spoke was responding to something I 
said earlier.  I hope I have the time to take that up with him 
because he makes a good point when he talks about how national 
standards are enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while I still might have the ear of the Leader of the 
Opposition, it seems to me that there was a contradiction between 
what the member just said and what the Leader of the Opposition 
said in response to me when I asked him whether or not his party 
was committed to maintaining the cash transfers.  He said that 
the Canadian Alliance was committed to it, committed to 
legislating it into law and that the cash transfer could not be 
unilaterally reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minutes later the hon. member got up and read from a Reform 
Party policy resolution that he said he had something to do with, 
which was the policy of the Reform Party and now the policy of 
the Canadian Alliance.  He has the resolution in front of him but 
I do not.  He may want to have another look at it as it talks 
about the total conversion of all cash transfers to tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone is not levelling with us here.  Is it the policy of the 
Canadian Alliance to convert all cash transfers to tax points? 
That certainly is what the member just read into the record, as 
the blues will show.  If that is the policy then what was the 
Leader of the Opposition doing telling me that it is the policy 
of the Canadian Alliance to legislate the cash transfers?  Is the 
Canadian Alliance legislating against itself?  Is it going to 
legislate cash transfers so that when it forms the government it 
cannot implement its own policy?  What is going on here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Madam Speaker, I cannot find the 
contradiction that the hon. member cites but I do point out that 
part of what a government does is legislate so that it cannot act 
in an irresponsible manner.  That is why we have a constitution 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We make amendments to the constitution that are not amendable by 
one government alone.  Depending upon the amending formula, it 
requires unanimity, seven provinces or 50% of the population. A 
couple of other amending formulas for exceptional cases require 
different levels of consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the point is to legislate something that one cannot 
change oneself.  We did that with the Canada pension plan, as the 
hon. member will know, so that the federal government could not 
unilaterally change the rules under which Canadians enjoy the 
potential benefits of that plan.  It was an amending formula 
which, at least on paper, was more strict than that of the seven 
provinces or 50% formula in place under that plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does act in this manner.  When we speak of creating binding 
agreements with the provinces, the point is that we bind 
ourselves and future governments so that they must act in a 
consensual manner and they must find the support of those 
provinces.  This ensures that a government, which is almost 
always elected by less than 50% of the population until we have 
some kind of electoral reform, cannot act without seeking some 
kind of broader consensus which actually reflects the will of the 
majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see what the contradiction is in saying that we would 
legislate to bind our own hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  The member should read the policy and 
resolution into the record again and let the House judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Madam Speaker, I invite the member to 
check the record.  We are not in favour of striking down the 
CHST.  We are in favour of transferring some of the value of cash 
transfers to the provinces into tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  It did not say some.  It said all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  It says cash grants.  It does not say all 
and it does not say some.  My understanding is that if we can 
find a way of getting the government to be more generous with 
cash transfers we would be very happy about that.  We will 
encourage that when we get the opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have the opportunity to ensure that some of those 
transfers, and we do not know the percentage but whatever 
percentage we can wrangle out of the government, could be put 
into tax points to ensure that there would be a guaranteed 
growing base for health care and education in the provinces over 
time, we would favour that.  When we see the way in which tax 
points grow over time thereby ensuring—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, all I did was invite the hon. member to read into the 
record one more time exactly what he read into the record a few 
minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of it, if members were able to hear it, they would 
see that it was in direct contradiction to what the Leader of the 
Opposition told me in answer to a question that I asked him.  The 
member was so unwilling that he quickly disowned his own policy. 
I could hear the cock crowing three times all the while that I 
was asking the member to get up and read it into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is his own policy.  Surely he is not ashamed of it.  Surely 
he would have been willing to read it into the record one more 
time, except it would have become obvious at that point that we 
get mixed messages from the Canadian Alliance on the question of 
federal transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  You invented mixed messages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  I guess it is not a mixed message to 
favour— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Order, please.  I 
implore hon. members to give the same respect to the member as 
was given to the other members today.  There will be opportunity 
during questions and comments to put questions to the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, when we hit on something 
they start to yelp.  We have hit on something that is a 
continuing contradiction within the Canadian Alliance Party.  Its 
real policy is that it wants to get rid of cash transfers 
altogether.  It is right in the policy that the member read into 
the House.  It wants to transfer the tax points and return to 
basically a kind of pre-World War II confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the kind of Canada we 
had before World War II and that it was only because of the war 
the provinces transferred these tax points to the federal 
government.  It was a very clear indication that the policy of 
the Alliance Party is to return to that pre-war situation. 
Sometimes we get the feeling that it wants to return to pre-war 
social policies as well, but that is another matter I will not 
get into.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the hon. member, who is somewhat unhappy with 
me at the moment, that I was actually intending to get up and 
agree with something he said in his speech before he read that 
policy into the record which so contradicted his own leader.  He 
made a good point about national standards and the fact that we 
do not have a way of enforcing national standards that is not 
open to the charge of being a political process or a political 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the debate around the social union, the NDP was 
open, and said so in a public document, to the idea of 
establishing national standards by mutual agreement between the 
federal government and the provinces.  We wanted some kind of 
impartial mechanism for determining whether national standards 
had been violated, somewhat along the lines of what the member 
just spoke about.  The difference is that we think the cash 
transfers must be maintained and enhanced, and that the federal 
government must bring them back to where they were and beyond. In 
that way the government would not only have the mechanism for 
enforcing it, which is to say withdrawing the cash transfers, but 
it would have the moral authority to do so because it would be 
playing its full role in the partnership that was established 
earlier on with respect to various social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not that the provinces do not have the tax 
points.  The problem is that the federal government is not living 
up to its part of the bargain.  If the federal government were 
living up to its part of the bargain and maintaining the 
partnership, there would be no cry on the part of the provinces 
for tax points because they would be getting the kind of cash 
that they should be getting.  Instead, we do not have that 
situation.  In spite of all the hoopla last August about the 
health accord, the federal government is still not putting into 
health care and education what they were putting in prior to the 
1995 budget.  This is a fact that cannot be truthfully denied by 
anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government were willing to do that then we would 
have a much different situation.  I think we would still have the 
Bloc and the Alliance calling for the conversion of cash grants 
to tax points because that is their vision of Confederation. In 
the case of the Alliance, it wants a more decentralized 
Confederation.  I am not sure whether the Bloc Quebecois is 
thinking about Confederation or about Quebec, but it does want 
more powers for Quebec and less ability on the part of the 
federal government to enforce national standards because it 
rejects the very notion of national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I think all members can see that the NDP 
cannot support the Bloc motion, though we think a first 
ministers' meeting to discuss this would be a good idea.  It is 
not the idea of the meeting that we are against.  There is 
probably good reason for having a meeting.  First ministers would 
probably like an opportunity and should have an opportunity to 
make the case for the federal government to more fully live up to 
the commitments it made years ago when it brought in medicare. At 
that time medicare was to be a 50:50 partnership.  Canadians 
certainly do not have that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good point was made by the Leader of the Opposition.  He said 
that the provinces have all these responsibilities while the 
federal government has the tax points and is able to raise the 
money. The federal government should be transferring that money 
to the provinces to the extent that they need it to implement 
programs brought in by the federal government.  The solution in 
our mind is for the federal government to do its job and do it 
well.  It must adequately fund medicare, post-secondary education 
and social assistance through equalization.  That is where the 
solution lies from the point of view of the NDP.  The solution 
does not lie in giving up on the Canadian project, on national 
standards and on national social programs.  The solution is not 
to allow the provinces to take over these programs as the 
Alliance and the Bloc would like to see happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the NDP view.  We agree with the portion of the motion 
that calls for a meeting but because the motion prejudges the 
outcome of the meeting we cannot agree with it nor support it. 
If the motion proposed a meeting to discuss the problems with an 
open mind as to how they might be solved, that would be a 
different matter, but that is not the motion we have before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition said that the problem was lack of 
trust in the federal government.  I agree.  Canadians, by and 
large, although we could not tell from the way they voted, have a 
lack of trust in the federal government.  Regardless of the 
political choices they make, they know when something is wrong. 
They know the federal government is not putting the kind of money 
into health care that it used to or there would not be these 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with the Leader of the Opposition and his colleague 
when they implied that Canadians have reason to trust their 
provincial governments.  The problem for a lot of Canadians is 
that they are caught between a federal government that will not 
adequately fund a one tier health care system and certain 
provincial governments that are interested in introducing a two 
tier health care system and a more privatized health care system. 
They want to introduce the private sector into the health care 
system even more than it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians face a dilemma.  They must choose between a federal 
government that wants to starve the one tier system to death and 
provincial governments that want a two tier system.  It is not a 
happy choice for Canadians.  A real choice would be to have a 
federal government that wanted to properly fund the one tier 
system so that there would be no pressure for a two tier system 
and no province could complain that the federal government had 
unilaterally withdrawn from the commitments it made in the past. 
That would be the solution.  I urge the Liberals to consider 
whether someday they might live up to that ideal.

cut it, to slash it like they have since 1994.

province did not meet one of the five, there would be legal

on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just finished saying, before the member rose, how unhappy we 
were with the fact that the federal government was starving 
medicare to death. I do not know whether the hon. member did not 
hear me or did not understand me, but we are not happy with the 
current situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we think the solution is not to hand the ball over to 
the provinces.  The solution is to have the federal government 
live up to its responsibilities.  That would be a lot better from 
our point of view. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, in his comments the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona seems to put a great deal of faith in future 
federal governments acting responsibly in the use of a spending 
power they have not used responsibly in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am willing to accept that if the hon. member were to find 
himself as prime minister in the future he would make transfers 
for health care his top priority and would do whatever was 
necessary. However I think he and I would both agree that it is 
unlikely he will be prime minister in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on a record in which the federal government has gone from 
50 cent dollars down to 15 cent dollars before more cash was put 
in, although we are certainly nowhere close to the 50 cent mark, 
we have seen the federal government effectively renege on the 
greater share of its health care funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that, I find it difficult to understand why he feels that 
is the responsible route when we are concerned about health care 
transfers.  It seems we must find a way of binding the federal 
government's hands and requiring that those transfers be made. 
Tax points do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there are other methods, but I do not see them being 
proposed at the moment.  This seems to be the best option 
realistically available to us.  It has the additional advantage 
of putting more money into provincial hands as the needs of an 
aging population grow and as the economies of those provinces 
grow.  There are some other advantages that go along with 
encouraging prudent fiscal management in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we say that health care and national standards are the goal, 
it seems to me we are better off ensuring an adequate and growing 
source of funding than using any other means available to us.  I 
cannot see how we can get around that.  I wonder if the hon. 
member could enlighten me on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, without wanting to be 
too polemical about this, it seems that the hon. member once 
again is very much at odds with what his leader said.  He is 
asking how else we can make the federal government live up to its 
responsibilities unless we convert all the cash grants to tax 
points.  Yet the Leader of the Opposition said that as far as he 
was concerned the solution was to legislate such that the federal 
government could not reduce its cash transfer to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one solution.  Why did he not offer it?  Why is he 
fixated on converting cash grants to tax points when his own 
leader is not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the other question about why I should trust or 
have great confidence in future federal governments, the point is 
well taken.  I do not have a lot of confidence in the present 
government.  This and previous federal governments have made a 
whole lot of unilateral cutbacks in the federal commitment to 
medicare and post-secondary education, going back to the budget 
of Allan MacEachen and to the Conservative budgets.  Almost every 
federal budget, with the exception of recent ones which have put 
back some of the money, unilaterally took out money from the 
partnership that was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the hon. member trust future provincial governments? I 
am arguing on the basis of what I think the best system would be. 
I do not have a lot of confidence in Mike Harris or Ralph Klein. 
Maybe the hon. member does and that is the difference between us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am arguing for what I think the federal government should be. 
I am arguing for what I think the role of the federal government 
should be.  My job as a politician is to try to make what I think 
is the best thing happen, not always to make judgments on the 
basis of how badly the Liberals are living up to what the federal 
government should do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to inform the Chair that I will be sharing my time 
with the member for Kings—Hants, who will join us in a few 
minutes, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, it is my pleasure to speak to this motion by our Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues, which we will of course support.  We may 
have a few problems with the way it is drafted, but I think 
that, by talking on the subject, we will have the opportunity to 
readjust, review and improve federal-provincial relations.  It 
can do no harm to hold a first ministers' conference.  I think 
this motion must be agreed to right off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time there is an opposition day, and we look at the 
subject proposed, questions come to mind.  I do not want to 
detract from the motion's credibility or its objectives, but we 
always wonder what lies behind an opposition motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it current affairs, the problems of a given party, government 
policy on a specific matter?  Is it a more specific policy that 
concerns Quebec?  I do not want to detract from the good 
intentions of our colleagues in the Bloc, whom we like very 
much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It perhaps has to do with the fact that our 
colleague, Jean Charest, visited the rest of Canada—as they say 
often—with ministers from the country's well off provinces to 
present a sort of common front, to stand up to the 
federal government on the issue of tax point transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I will share a secret with you: it may be because 
the Bloc Quebecois wants to help the Parti Quebecois by saying 
“You know, we put forward a motion in the House of Commons and 
Liberal members voted against the transfer of tax points”. At 
the same time it wants to thwart Jean Charest's efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, a provincial election is looming in Quebec. There 
may be a more partisan motivation vis-à-vis Quebec on the part of 
the Bloc Quebecois. That being said, it takes nothing away from 
the merit of the motion. What will happen to it later on is 
everybody's guess, but I believe this to be its true purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is bad news if it is truly the reason behind this. We will 
however support the motion and I hope a number of members and 
parties will do likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, the transfer of tax points is an important 
issue, but one must be very careful when talking about tax 
points. It is connected to another issue, that of equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One tax point transferred from the federal government to the 
provinces, assuming it is worth $1 today and the province in 
question enjoys significant economic growth, may be worth $1.05 
or $1.25 one, two or three years down the line. A province's 
economic vitality pushes the value of tax points upwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the bigger and wealthier provinces of this country 
want to have tax points transferred to them quickly because, in 
spite of the inflation, economic growth would add value to them. 
We must be careful. We live in a vast country where for the time 
being—I repeat, for the time being—some provinces are less well 
off than others. 
We must therefore talk about equalization. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If tax points are transferred, for example to Newfoundland, 
these points will have less value in 18 months than the tax 
points transferred to Quebec, Ontario or Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we must have an equalization system that corrects 
this situation. This is important. This principle must be the 
basis for any federal-provincial discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the motion of the Bloc Quebecois cannot be amended 
the way we would like to, we must keep in mind that we should 
talk about equalization, to ensure that the have not provinces 
do not feel left out in this reapportioning of tax points, this 
reapportioning of existing and future wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of equalization, I should point out that the 
premiers from Atlantic Canada asked that the ceiling be removed 
with respect to the calculation of royalties, as was done for 
Alberta over 50 or 60 years ago. The idea is to give the 
provinces a chance to keep the new wealth that they may have, 
without being immediately penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the current government said no. This is not 
surprising, as we know, but it is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say yes to a discussion on tax points and on transfers. 
This is important. Why? Because it provides and stabilizes a tax 
value for health, education, social services and so on, and it 
also gives it a permanent character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must not be a strictly political decision on the part of 
the central government. 
We agree with that. But this should really be part of a 
discussion with all Canadians, and the poorest provinces should 
not be excluded in calculating how many tax points to transfer. 
We are saying that equalization payments must also be 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, we are telling the government not to be 
afraid of talking with Quebecers, with the government of Quebec and 
with the people of Ontario and Nova Scotia.  It should not be 
afraid of getting together with people from time to time.  There 
is no harm in doing so.  The goal is not necessarily to come up 
with a formal agreement overnight. 
But why not have a much more permanent discussion mechanism? 
Why not?  Why not recognize the importance of our partners in 
this country?  Why is it always necessary to rattle the central 
government's cage to get anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the central government knows it is on the eve of an 
election, it decides to transfer a little more money.  But the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has put it very well, and has 
done so for years now, when he says that there are hidden 
billions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the government's huge surpluses, the impression 
one is left with, in the case of the health agreements reached 
last September, is the same as if I were the federal government 
and my little boy of five, whose name is Gabriel, had come to 
ask me for money.  What I would do is reach into my pocket, 
pull out a handful of change, give it to him and tell him how 
generous his father was. 
That is what it is like.  I got off easy, because he was happy 
with the handful of change.  But he did not know that my pockets 
were full of money, because he got more than one pack of Pokémon 
cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems like the provinces have to beg for pocket change 
compared to the enormous surpluses hidden in various programs 
and in the federal government's way of doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us come to an agreement, talk about tax points and provide 
the provinces with stable funding. Let us give them a chance to 
plan ahead: equalization. Let us give poorer provinces a chance 
not to be penalized through the transfer of tax points and 
encourage them to put the money and energy needed for their 
development, particularly with regard to natural resources off 
the Atlantic coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could be the world's largest oil and gas producer if we had a 
vision and if we helped our partners, the provinces, often the 
poorer ones and sometimes the richer ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly support this motion, even though we know the federal 
government will say that it has done an excellent job since 1993 
and government members will vote against it. Nevertheless, the 
Bloc's motion is important inasmuch as the provinces are asking 
for a tax partnership.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will simply say that I invite members to look at 
the spirit of the motion proposed by the Bloc Quebecois today 
and to vote in favour of it. There is no obligation of result, 
but the first result that could come out of this motion would be 
for the federal government to accept, at a federal-provincial 
conference, to discuss such an important issue as the transfer 
of tax points. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
asking my question, let me clarify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, the Bloc Quebecois talked about tax points as 
protection against the terrible cuts the Minister of Finance 
wanted to make to the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, Mrs. Marois, then Quebec's finance minister, asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the federal government withdraw from social program funding 
and that it transfer to Quebec the tax points used to pay for 
that funding. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, Quebec's minister of intergovernmental affairs said 
exactly the same thing: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec will demand that its constitutional authority be 
respected, will seek to fully exercise that authority, will 
continue to denounce the federal government's interference, and 
will call for full financial compensation in the form of tax 
points. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, even before Mr. Charest's tour through the rest of 
Canada, Mr. Landry said that he would fight this battle, because 
it made no sense that the health and education needs were in 
Quebec but the money was in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect for the member for Richmond—Arthabaska, we 
have been talking about tax points for a long time. 
Since Mr. Charest agrees with this proposal, and because he 
certainly still has very close ties with Mr. Charest, could the 
hon. member not convince him to throw his support behind the 
premier of Quebec, who is also calling for such a 
federal-provincial conference, and who will continue to call for 
the transfer of tax points in order to help right the fiscal 
imbalance that has existed, particularly in the last three 
years, between Quebec, the Canadian provinces and the federal 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I want to assure my hon. 
colleague that we do have great relations with our former 
leader. I hope things will remain the same after he is elected 
premier, maybe as soon as next year, who knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think Mrs. Marois was finance minister in 1995, but it 
is true that the Bloc has consistently ensured for several years 
now, just like the government of Quebec, regardless of the 
political party in office—to keep, as the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot pointed out—some kind of protection for 
Quebec and for Canada against the ups and downs of the sad 
decisions made by Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out that the Mazankowski budget, for instance, was 
the first step of the very tough budget approach. It was under 
our government that the whole issue of transferring tax points 
began. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is important for all partners, government members and 
opposition members alike, to join forces to fight the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, let me remind my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot that when Mr. Clark and I had the honour and 
privilege to meet with the premier of Quebec, Mr. Landry told us 
candidly that he did not think it was likely to happen. But we 
do have to hang on to some kind of hope if we want our requests 
to appear credible. 
The transfer of tax points is obviously very important. As I 
said earlier, equalization is also a major concern for Quebec. 
It is all interrelated. I am sure my colleague would agree with 
me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak to the opposition day 
motion brought to the House by the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. I share the hon. member's view that 
federal-provincial co-operation needs to be expedited in the area 
of tax point transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a huge difficulty in Canada now with the reticence of 
the federal government to engage in any meaningful co-operative 
effort with the provinces.  The PC Party has a strong history in 
this regard, going back to our 1997 platform in which we proposed 
a tax point transfer to the provinces to enable provinces to 
better address some of the social investment needs. 
The provinces are probably most capable of determining those 
priorities as they are closest to the people affected by the 
decisions.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need some sort of practical action to create a new system of 
government that is much more responsive, more accountable and 
ultimately more efficient.  By giving provincial and regional 
concerns a clearer voice, Canada can become a stronger country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These practical changes can be achieved through 
federal-provincial discussion and agreement without 
constitutional amendments.  That is important because I think 
most Canadians want to avoid a constitutional dialogue at this 
point.  If we can achieve that through federal-provincial 
discussions, which we can, then we should proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This requires co-operative federalism, not brinkmanship, bravado 
and disdain for the provinces, which have been the trademarks of 
the government since 1993.  The Liberal government has had a 
paternalistic approach to the provinces.  It is an Ottawa knows 
best approach.  Whether on health care, education or any social 
spending, the government has attacked the provinces since 1993 
with draconian cuts to transfers.  These arbitrary and unilateral 
cuts have created, for instance, a health care crisis in every 
region of the country.  The government has also slashed transfers 
to the provinces while barely tinkering with its own spending in 
terms of program spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government had a choice to balance its books. 
Instead of reducing federal program spending significantly, it 
chose to maintain federal program spending but to cut the 
transfers to the provinces such that the hard decisions 
ultimately had to be made by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is why the federal government slashed health care 
transfers to the provinces while leaving its own departments 
unscathed.  The answer is because it could.  It had the power to. 
It was able to escape the accountability of explaining and 
dealing with the impacts of those cuts because it had the power 
to act unilaterally and arbitrarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal of a tax point transfer to the provinces could go 
a long way to ensure that federal governments do not have that 
unfettered power to do again what this government did in the 
early and mid-1990s by cutting the transfers to the provinces so 
dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the big problem here is that the federal government 
currently has the power to trample over the provinces and escape 
accountability for the consequences of these actions.  Currently 
the provinces have very little authority over their revenues, yet 
they have all of the responsibilities for how the programs, 
investments and spending programs will be administered.  It is 
like what Mark Twain once referred to as a bad job.  We could say 
that currently the provinces have a bad job:  a lot of 
responsibility but no authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same federal government that created the health care and 
post-secondary education crises across Canada by its cuts to the 
provinces has tried to act like a knight in shining armour by 
introducing, for instance, a millennium scholarship program to 
directly fund students from the federal coffers.  The government 
is more interested in whose names are on the cheques than in the 
long term interests of ordinary Canadians who want health care 
and education systems they can depend on.  Clearly some sort of 
reform is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is not exactly what the hon. member is calling for 
with this motion.  He is actually just calling for a first 
ministers conference to discuss the possibility of a tax point 
transfer.  Clearly there is nothing wrong with having a 
discussion of first ministers on an issue of this importance.  I 
would hope that members opposite and members of all parties would 
see that in the interests of a constructive approach we should 
all be supportive of the notion of a first ministers conference 
to explore the possibility of this type of initiative.  It makes 
a lot of sense.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does this initiative make sense, but even those who may 
disagree with the notion of a tax point transfer should at least 
agree to the idea of having a discussion with the first ministers 
of the provinces on this.  We also need to broaden the nature of 
this discussion to include equalization.  Our equalization system 
is currently broken.  When we look at the history of 
equalization, a cornerstone of Canadian public policy and the 
only constitutionally enshrined spending program, we see that it 
was introduced around 1958.  At that time the stated goals of 
equalization were to achieve approximately equal levels of 
taxation and equal levels of services across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, particularly on the tax front, with some provinces like 
Ontario and Alberta increasingly in positions to take fairly 
aggressive tax reduction policies, we are seeing a ghettoization 
of Canada in terms of the very important role of tax policy.  Ten 
years ago I do not think anyone recognized how important tax 
policy could be in terms of creating levels of economic growth, 
opportunity and ultimately prosperity for citizens within a 
particular jurisdiction.  However, today we have seen what has 
happened in countries like Ireland, where an aggressive tax 
strategy focused on capital taxes and corporate taxes has helped 
achieve a 92% growth in GDP per capita over a 10 year period 
during a period of time when Canada has had a 5% growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enabling the provinces to have through equalization a little 
more control over their natural resource wealth, for instance, 
would go a long way in provinces like Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland toward actually enabling those provinces to reduce 
taxes and to create greater levels of economic growth, not 
specifically in resource areas but in new economy ventures et 
cetera.  Clearly we have to address the issue of the clawback of 
resource revenues that impacts provinces like Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland in such a negative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to address the issue, as my colleague from 
Richmond—Arthabaska mentioned in his comments, of the caps on 
equalization.  We have 10 provinces with 10 premiers who have 
agreed that now we should take the caps off the equalization 
levels that go a long way toward denying individual provinces and 
recipient provinces the opportunities and the ability to grasp 
the economic levers they need to grasp, including tax policy and 
social investment policy, in order to create some level of 
sustainable economy and to ultimately be independent of 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the current equalization system's treatment of 
recipient provinces, it is like how in certain jurisdictions 
social welfare systems sometimes treat people worse if they get a 
job.  If they actually get a job they end up worse off than if 
they stay on welfare.  In some ways we have an equalization 
system that has created a welfare trap, in that we actually treat 
provinces that are starting to become successful and starting to 
forge ahead worse than if they were not to pursue and embrace 
economic opportunities in a way that we should be encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former premier of Newfoundland, currently the Minister of 
Industry and self-promotion, said in October: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the development of offshore oil and gas both here and in Nova 
Scotia have been made more difficult by the way the current 
equalization formula works.  The current claw back provisions in 
particular slow the pace at which equalization receiving 
provinces can catch up to the Canadian average standard of 
living. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more with his comments then.  Goodness knows 
where he is on that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a consistent commitment from the government to enable 
provinces, through equalization, through tax point transfers, to 
achieve on behalf of their constituents prosperity and equality 
in the 21st century.

listened intently to my hon. colleague's comments.  Earlier today 
in the debate I made the comment that I do not suspect that there 
is a lot of consensus or a consensus at all among provinces on 
this issue with respect to the movement to tax points versus cash 
transfers.  I think it is fair to say.  I know the hon. members 
from the Atlantic provinces did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly analysis has shown that a conversion to tax points for 
the smaller provinces would in fact be harmful given their 
smaller tax base.  I am trying to reconcile this in my mind.  I 
am trying to understand if the member, coming from the Atlantic 
provinces and knowing that the Conservative Party is supportive 
of eliminating cash transfers and going straight to tax points, 
much like our colleagues from the Bloc, has had any dialogue at 
all with his provincial premiers with respect to eliminating the 
cash portion of the transfers and going to tax points completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I am a little concerned about and am trying to 
understand some of the inconsistency, perhaps, in the thinking on 
tax points versus the equalization payments, where equalization 
payments are a transfer of cash and there is a moving to tax 
points on the straight transfers.  There is a bit of 
inconsistency in the thinking.  I would like to hear from the 
hon. member on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's intervention.  This hon. member is not confused, but I 
believe he may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the issue of tax point transfers, it is entirely 
consistent with our party's position, going back to the 1997 
election platform, that we should be enabling provinces to have 
more say over their own tax policies and ultimately over spending 
priorities through giving them an opportunity through tax points 
to achieve that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case, he is quite right that without an 
adjustment through equalization to ensure that there is some sort 
of ameliorative impact from the equalization perspective, some 
provinces would be worse off.  That is why it is fundamentally 
important to ensure that the equalization system, as I 
articulated, takes that into account.  One of the best ways to 
achieve that would be to remove the equalization caps, which we 
do have consensus on from 10 premiers across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point.  The hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois 
who has proposed this opposition day motion is proposing that 
there be a first ministers conference to debate and discuss this 
issue.  If the hon. Liberal member opposite is ingenuously 
interested in hearing the views of Atlantic Canadian premiers, 
then he should be supportive of this motion such that first 
ministers would be able to get together and have this kind of 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois is not saying in this 
motion that he would want the transfers of the points.  The 
motion says that we want to have the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the hon. member's government should not be afraid of a 
meaningful discussion, a first ministers conference on this 
issue, which would give an opportunity to Atlantic Canadian 
premiers, among others, to express their views and to negotiate 
and achieve on behalf of their constituents what they are capable 
of doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just wonder what the member opposite 
would think about the fact that Canada's public medical services 
were financed originally by an earlier Liberal government, 
basically with cash, and then a subsequent Conservative 
government changed these cash transfers into tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While that may work in most of the country, in the province of 
Ontario we have the dilemma where a lot of the money that is now 
going to the provincial government to finance health and social 
care is basically not getting to this target because the 
provincial government is spending less of its own money on health 
care or is only using the money it receives federally.  I wonder 
what the member has to say about that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member, 
respectfully, is wrong.  The fact is that the provincial 
government in Ontario has increased its spending and investment 
in health care disproportionately when compared with the federal 
commitment to health care in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a sharp decline in the federal commitment to 
health care in every province and the provinces have had to make 
that up.  In Ontario there has been a dramatic increase in the 
provincial investment in health care to help compensate for the 
draconian cuts by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it is easier in some ways for a province like 
Ontario to make up that money but in a province like Nova Scotia 
with a weaker tax base it is very difficult.  I would ask the 
member to be cognizant and respectful of that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, 
I want to say that I will be using my 20 minutes to give a 
demonstration based on the motion we introduced this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to reread the motion because, since the 
beginning of this debate, we keep hearing things that have 
nothing to do with the purpose of the motion. I thank my 
colleague from Kings-Hants, who clarified the motion by the Bloc 
Quebecois, to prevent the debate from going the way it seemed to 
be going this morning. The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should call a 
federal-provincial first ministers' conference for the purpose of 
reapportioning the tax base among the federal and provincial 
governments through the transfer of tax points. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying that everything has to be turned upside down 
and that the value of equalization has to be challenged. We are 
not saying that the federal government's actions in its own 
areas of jurisdiction should be questioned either. The only 
thing we are saying, after four years of observation, is that it 
is essential that a balance be struck somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now reached a point where, and this has been the case 
for the last three years, there is too much money in Ottawa, 
given this government's constitutional responsibilities, and not 
enough in the provinces, including Quebec, given their 
responsibilities, particularly for health, education and income 
support. 
There is too much money. We are not talking about peanuts. We 
are not talking about a few billions, but rather several billion 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 the Bloc Quebecois has gotten into the habit of 
making its own forecasts regarding revenues and expenses, 
therefore surpluses, especially the surpluses that have been 
building up since 1997. We make forecasts because we do not 
trust this government. Ever since he has been holding the 
finance portfolio, the minister has been making forecasts that 
are way off, sometimes by an incredible 130% to 400%. 
How can we trust a government that does not even give us a true 
picture of public finances, which would allow us to make the 
right choices? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came up with a rough forecast of surpluses over the next four 
years—one must be very cautious regarding the last year because 
four years is a long way away, even the third year is iffy. If 
we use the same economic growth parameters as the major banking 
institutions such as the SGF, the Caisse de dépôt et placement 
du Québec, the Mouvement Desjardins, the CIBC, the Bank of Montréal 
and the National Bank, and take into account not only the growth 
parameters but also the analysis of the growth, we see that over 
the next four years the Minister of Finance will have, thanks 
to the taxpayers of Quebec and Canada, a budget surplus of 
between $70 billion and $90 billion, plenty of room to manoeuvre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have hardly ever been wrong, maybe only by 5%. For his part, 
the finance minister has been way off; since 1994, his forecasts 
have been off by $60 billion. These are no small miscalculations. 
Over the next four years the government will accumulate 
surpluses of between $70 billion and $90 billion. Why such huge 
surpluses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, people pay too much taxes; second, the federal 
governments responsibilities are such that it cannot spend the 
money entrusted to it by Quebec's and Canada's taxpayers; third, 
if the surpluses are so huge it is because they have been 
accumulated on the back of the provinces by drastically cutting, 
gutting transfers since 1994. The provinces' needs keep on 
increasing whereas here in Ottawa money has been pouring in, 
especially over the past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 federal revenues have increased by 53%. 
Revenues from taxes and income tax have increased by 53% since 
1993, while federal spending dropped 3%.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at the situation in Quebec. Program spending 
in Quebec has increased by 16% during the same period, that is 
since 1993. This means that the government of Quebec spends 13% 
more for programs under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In health care alone, the increase was twice as high: the 
government of Quebec's spending in health care has increased by 
32%. Spending is increasing year after year, especially 
because of the natural aging of the population. Needs increase 
by 5% per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's spending has decreased by 3% since 
1993. This is due to the fact that there were cuts to transfers 
to provinces. The federal government has reduced the level of 
its contribution to cost sharing programs, which had been set 
during the 1960s and 1970s, especially in the areas of health 
and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much so that, for every dollar invested by the government of 
Quebec, the federal government contributes only 14 cents. 
However, these cost sharing programs were established on a 50:50 
basis, the federal government contributing 50% of the costs and 
the provinces the other 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of education, it is even worse. The Liberals should stop 
misleading people by saying that there the federal government is 
not backing out. For every dollar invested by the government of 
Quebec in education, the federal government spends 8 cents. 
In the past it has even been 50 cents for 50 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next four years, there will be huge surpluses, so 
unbelievably huge as to be nearly surrealistic: between $70 
billion and $90 billion in surplus for the next four years, and 
that is the conservative scenario.  I would again point out that 
the Bloc Quebecois has never been wrong.  The Minister of Finance 
has, and far wrong at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Minister of Finance doing with these surpluses? 
First of all, the federal government is using these surpluses, 
under section 91 of the constitution and subsequent 
interpretation thereof, i.e. the power to spend, to intervene, or 
not to intervene, in areas under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of employment insurance. Instead of 
taking action, it makes cuts, while on the other hand, as the 
surplus accumulated over the past four years, its intrusions in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, in particularly areas of Quebec 
government jurisdiction, increased proportionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take for example the 1997 budget, where the first 
significant federal surplus appeared: $4.1 billion.  The federal 
government invested in new initiatives, in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, sums in excess of $2.3 billion.  Out of a total of 
$4 billion, $2.3 billion were invested in areas coming under 
provincial jurisdiction.  These include: the family, the child 
tax credit, research, education and health, particularly via the 
Canadian health information system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over half of the first year's surpluses were invested in 
exclusively provincial jurisdictions. However, in that same 
year, the Canada social transfer had not been restored to fund 
health and education through the existing networks that were 
well managed by Quebec and the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, it was the same: a $10.8 billion surplus and $4 billion 
in new initiatives in areas in which the federal government has 
no business. In other words, it cuts on one side. It accumulates 
surpluses year after year, at the expense of the provinces, the 
unemployed and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government then reinvests these surpluses through the back 
door, in provincial jurisdictions that it has obviously 
neglected if we look at the general transfers to fund health and 
education, among others. This is the tactic used by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same thing with the budget for the year 2000. The government 
will have between $15 billion and $19 billion in surpluses. The 
minister's forecasts called for less than half of that. The 
minister has lost all credibility in that respect. In any case, 
no one still believes him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the year 2000, close to $8 billion was spent on new 
initiatives and renewed initiatives from 1997, in particular, in 
jurisdictions that come exclusively under Quebec and the other 
provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it normal that, on the one hand, the federal government goes 
after the provinces and has them bearing the brunt of all the 
cuts made since 1994 in health care and education when the 
needs of the provinces in both these areas are increasing? I 
want to remind the House that federal transfers for education 
have never been lower in the last 30 years. The government is 
cutting and not meeting the needs of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, it keeps infringing upon areas of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction recognized in the Constitution of Canada 
and in many court rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not normal to have the federal government juggling with a 
surplus while the provinces and Quebec are overburdened by heavy 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to rebalance the tax base. This is such a matter of 
urgency that the government of Quebec and the premier of Quebec, 
Mr. Landry, have decided to set up, the Séguin 
commission, chaired by a Liberal who is a former Quebec minister 
of finance, to examine how great the imbalance is and how to 
correct it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are constantly in crisis. 
We cannot have a situation where the needs of the people are 
constantly growing while the federal government has huge 
surpluses and avoids debating the issue, because we know that the 
Minister of Finance, as astute as he is and with the lack of 
transparency he has shown, is predicting surpluses that have no 
basis in reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the money that is not included in the budget and that 
magically appears at the end of the fiscal year, as we have seen 
since 1997, goes directly to debt reduction pursuant to the 
decision made in that regard. There is no debate. The government 
also avoids debating with the provincial governments, including 
the Quebec government, the fact that the needs are with the 
people but the surpluses are here, in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not normal. For decades, successive governments and 
successive premiers in Quebec have fought every time an imbalance 
became apparent. It happened under Maurice Duplessis, as well as 
under Lesage, Bertrand and Johnson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bourassa said that the worst threat facing the government of 
Quebec was fiscal imbalance and a situation where the federal 
government continually, through its spending power, interfered in 
areas under the jurisdiction of Quebec and the other provinces, 
thereby preventing a consistent approach to public affairs 
management in areas which, under the Canadian constitution, are 
recognized as being the responsibility of the provinces, 
including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undoubtedly, the federal government has a problem.  However, the 
provincial governments have more serious problems, because they 
have to meet the needs of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must limit the federal spending power.  What is happening now 
was foreseeable.  Since 1997, when the possibility of huge 
surpluses appeared for the first time, we have been saying that 
this would happen. Those who do not believe me can refer to 
<I>Hansard</I>; our speeches were mostly on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will accumulate surpluses on the back of 
everybody: the unemployed, the sick people and the provinces. 
As soon as it has done so, as soon as the first surpluses 
appear, it will revert to its old bad habits, intrude into 
provincial jurisdictions and multiply federal initiatives in 
these areas just to stick the Canadian flag everywhere and to 
say that it is a good government, working in the best interests 
of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How hypocritical to have cut programs of such basic necessity as 
education, health and income support, to have made the 
government of Quebec and Canadian provinces bear the brunt of it 
and then to have come in as a saviour by taking several 
initiatives in these areas through the back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we have brought forward this motion, asking the 
government to reapportion the tax base by calling a 
federal-provincial conference.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 50 years, there have been two important conferences. 
One of them took place in 1964, in Quebec City. Mr. Pearson was 
the Prime Minister of Canada, and Mr. Lesage was the premier of 
Quebec. Mr. Pearson was an intelligent man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was able to understand that the requirements of the provinces 
and of Quebec had to be met, if we were to have a better balance 
in this country. 
He did realize that, for the war effort, the federal government 
had borrowed the personnal income tax base of the provinces, 
but that after the war it was necessary to reapportion the tax 
base because of the constitutional responsibilities of the 
provinces. They had to regain the tax base they needed to 
finance these responsibilities. He realized that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977, during the second important conference, once again, the 
federal government realized what the situation was and 
transferred tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this federal government so dense? Why is it so obtuse 
that it cannot see the obvious? Things cannot go on like this 
for years. We cannot have the money in one place and the needs 
elsewhere. A reapportionment is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The easy way is to use tax points, since this tax base can be 
easily reapportioned, by taking into account the needs of the 
provinces without denying the role of the federal government. 
Some members talked about equalization earlier. Certainly, when 
tax points are given to provinces such as the maritime 
provinces, there will be a problem at some point. These 
provinces have by definition some difficulty in getting from 
their taxpayers the taxes that would allow them to maintain 
services of the same quality as those provided elsewhere in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is equalization. We are not asking the federal 
government to transfer everything. We are asking that a new 
balance be struck. Might it not be open-minded at some point, 
instead of constantly saying no? We are used to no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to Quebec, the federal government has always 
behaved as if it were a unitary state. It said no to Quebecers' 
democratic rights with Bill C-20. Everyone remembers that there 
was a reference to the supreme court. With Bill C-20, the 
government said no to Quebecers' democratic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It said no to parental leave, for instance. It said we would 
have a program coast to coast. It is not nearly as good as the 
Quebec government's program, but that does not matter because 
it is the parents in Quebec who will pay at the end of the 
day. It said no to Quebec's program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also saying no to young offenders, as we saw recently. The 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, carrying indecency to a 
new high, beyond anything he had done up till now, went as far as 
to tell us that the consensus that we presented here, that my 
hon. colleague for Berthier—Montcalm presented, was a fabricated 
consensus because we had infiltrated all the organizations that 
supported us in our approach. We would then follow that we have 
infiltrated the Quebec Liberal Party. Such nonsense is quite 
incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is saying no again, because the transfer of tax points is 
another idea from Quebec. Sometimes we wonder if this government 
is not in the process of changing Canada into some unitary state, 
where differences are not tolerated. Forget about Quebec's 
specificity. We have almost become an internal colony. Before we 
were a colony ruled by metropolitan Britain. Now we have become a 
colony within Canada. We are told “No, Ottawa knows best. Ottawa 
knows everything. Ottawa knows what is good for Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will find more open-mindedness on the part of the 
Liberals toward our proposal for a federal-provincial first 
ministers' conference for the purpose of redefining the tax base, 
of reapportioning that tax base. The current situation is 
unbearable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is not alone. The government can say no to Quebec, in its 
colonial spirit, and seek to have a wall-to-wall policy across 
Canada, even while recognizing that sometimes Quebec's policy is 
better than the federal policy. We demonstrated it with respect 
to the Young Offenders Act. It can treat us that way if it wants, 
but a consensus is in the making across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only Quebec. Members 
were speaking earlier of a national policy.  We have a national 
government in Quebec City which is forming a consensus with the 
provinces to readjust the tax base.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the poorest provinces, it is very simple.  There 
are equalization payments.  We are not calling for them to be 
scrapped. We simply want, when we speak of the federal 
government's withdrawal and of redefining the tax base, the 
federal government to withdraw first from everything that 
concerns Quebec's and the provinces' jurisdiction—that would be 
the minimum—and to transfer the equivalent taxing power to the 
provinces.  That could be discussed at a first ministers' 
conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the Minister for International Trade bleating.  If he 
stood up instead of being a wishy-washy member from Quebec, he 
would join the consensus. For once, if he stood up like a real 
Quebecer, he would defend Quebec's point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleagues in the House of Commons will vote in 
support of this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Minister for International Trade could go back to 
his seat and ask a question, I would not have to put questions to 
my colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first make a few comments. I would like to congratulate 
the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, in particular for his 
demonstration. With the means available to him, which are far 
from what the government has at its disposal, he has always 
succeeded in forecasting as precisely as possible, more precisely 
than the Minister of Finance in any case, the size of the 
surplus. I think he deserves a special tribute for this. He was 
always very close to the actual figures, even though he did not 
have access to the same tools as the federal officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of his support for the motion I brought forward. 
The members of the Bloc Quebecois have all worked together to 
bring this important motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot agree with the 
expression commission on fiscal 
strangulation used by the Parti Quebecois government? Does he 
consider this expression exaggerated or adequate? I would like to hear 
his comments on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is no great feat to have forecast reality, because we have come 
pretty close to the right figure by using known and public 
figures, even those of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he has not done the same, then, it is because he has done a 
poor job, either out of incompetence or lack of transparency, or 
because he was trying to be astute, as I said earlier.  He likes 
not forecasting a surplus; then he can decide on his own what to 
do with the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expression fiscal strangulation is no exaggeration.  We find 
ourselves in a situation—no joke here—in which the federal 
government's financial situation is going to be really 
flourishing.  We are talking of $70 billion minimum over four 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who find this an exaggeration have always said the same 
thing when we presented our estimates “It's an exaggeration, it 
makes no sense”.  Yet we have always been dead on.  There is, 
therefore, no exaggeration here and we have consulted many 
experts.  We did not consult certain economists, not the friends 
of the Minister of Finance; we consulted all forecasting 
organizations.  We were objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about fiscal strangulation in connection with 
needs.  For instance, health needs are increasing in the 
provinces.  In Quebec alone there will be a 5% rise.  We are 
talking billions of dollars.  The billions of dollars of surplus 
will pile up in the federal coffers while the health needs in 
Quebec and in the provinces will be very great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These needs must be met; they are the needs of the population. 
Yes, there is fiscal strangulation going on.  The present 
situation is a dramatic one. 
There has been an increase in initiatives in areas of 
jurisdiction that belong to Quebec, such as health and education, 
which do not take into account the needs of the public and the 
government of Quebec's policy in these two sectors in particular, 
where it spends more than the federal government. We are talking 
about $1 for every 14 cents in the health sector, and $1 for

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is meddling in other areas, which have 
not been identified as fundamental needs by the government of 
Quebec.  What does this mean?  It means that the federal 
government is not making good use of our money.  There are no two 
ways about it.  So how are we to reconcile these two visions, 
Canada's and Quebec's? We are making an attempt.  We are 
introducing a motion which says “Sit down with the premiers of 
Quebec and the provinces. Talk about rebalancing fiscal 
resources, but on the basis of the real numbers.  Let us have no 
more of the Minister of Finance's nonsense, with estimates that 
are off by 140% to 400%.  We want the real numbers”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make a comment that may be somewhat off 
topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it quite deplorable that the member for 
Papineau—Saint-Denis would be screaming from behind the curtains 
and does not even have the courage to take his place and ask 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for his speech and I would like to hear 
what he has to say about the money the federal government owes 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague from 
Rivière-des-Mille-Îles has put his finger on a thorny issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the federal government owes over $3.2 billion to the 
Quebec government and, despite repeated requests, it steadfastly 
refuses to pay up. These outstanding bills are documented. Every 
one of them is well documented and together they total $3.2 
billion, which the federal government refuses to acknowledge it 
owes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At issue is, for example, $1.9 billion in compensation for the 
GST. A few years ago Quebec harmonized its provincial sales tax, 
the TVQ, with the GST. It has been losing money ever since. The 
federal government never told us it would one day compensate the 
maritime provinces for doing exactly the same. Three maritime 
provinces got $900 million for harmonizing their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the federal government for $1.9 billion because 
harmonization has cost us dearly. We were the first ones to do 
it, on our own initiative, because we wanted the tax system to 
work well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there any way that someday Quebec's demands will be met? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true of the Canada assistance plan. The Quebec 
government is suing the federal government for $310 million owed 
to it by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government is asking the federal government for $96 
million to administer the Young Offenders Act. I am not talking 
about the new harsh, barbaric act beneath the dignity of this 
parliament, but rather about the old act under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These needs are not being met. 
It is incredible; the Minister of Finance has billions of 
dollars, he even boasts about the surplus, and he lets the needy 
remain exactly that, needy.  He lets sick people wait in 
hospitals. He invests elsewhere.  For example, as far as health is 
concerned, he invests through the real transfer to the Quebec 
government, but he does nothing for the fundamental needs of the 
sick people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He makes students wait.  A student is not a student forever.  At 
one point in his life he has needs that must be met quickly. This 
is incredible. The funding of education, through the CHST for 
post-secondary education, has never been this low in 30 years. 
The minister continues to brag about the surpluses.  He is 
being astute by not making forecasts that reflect the real 
surpluses.  He is avoiding debate and paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he not give a bit more to the people, dish out the dough 
as they say?  Let him spend on the people in order to meet the 
real needs, and let him pay his bills and his debts.  The federal 
debt is not the only one the minister has to deal with. He has a 
debt toward the Quebec government because we have taken measures 
that were warranted from a practical point of view.  For example, 
there is the harmonization of the GST and the QST and the issue 
of young offenders.  I think there is a lack of will on the part 
of the government.  This government is ignoring Quebec 
completely, it just does not care about Quebec.

is hardest hit by this tax burden? How are they affected? Can he

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt in my mind 
that the bad policies of the federal government have hurt two 
main groups, women and young people.

affect women and young people, who make up 60% of all those 
ineligible for EI benefits.

taxes, but mainly for the rich. Single parent families, often 
headed by women, will go empty-handed this year, next year and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what we have in 
the House today is a motion by the Bloc to transfer tax points 
from the federal government to the provinces.  This is not 
complicated.  It means the Bloc simply wants us to give up our 
power to raise revenue to the provinces.  It wants us to give up 
our power to do the things which are absolutely critical to our 
country as a nation affecting every province and every person 
regardless of where they live, not just in particular 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc wants us to reduce our capacity to make transfers to 
individuals.  Our biggest single expenditure to individuals is 
over $25 billion a year to Canada's seniors.  How much of that 
does it want us to give up?  It wants us to give up our capacity 
to cut taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just introduced the biggest tax cuts in Canadian 
history, $100 billion over five years.  We have seen the benefits 
of that.  Those cuts started January 1.  Canada's growth rate in 
the final quarter of last year was 1.9%. In the first quarter of 
this year the latest figures show that our growth rate has gone 
up to 2.5% in spite of the serious downturn in the U.S. economy 
and one that was threatening us and one that members opposite 
were saying that we had to do something about, that we had to 
bring in new budgets because things were not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That stimulus presented by the Minister of Finance just when it 
was needed has ensured that we have not gone into a tailspin, but 
have been able to cope with that downturn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc wants us to give up our capacity to pay down the 
federal debt in order for the provinces to pay down more of their 
debt.  Paying down debt is good for all of us but the fact is 
that the federal debt is more than twice that of the provinces. 
We have made enormous strides in paying it down.  When we took 
office it was 71% of GDP.  It is now below 54% of GDP and heading 
to less than 40% of GDP within five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, last year the finance minister paid off $15 
billion in Canadian debt.  This is important because this payoff 
is saving us about $2 billion a year in interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces should maybe pay down their debt too but their 
debt cumulatively is less than half of what ours is. 
We pay about 25 cents out of every tax dollar to service the 
federal debt.  The provinces pay about 12 cents.  In terms of 
fairness, where should that capacity to pay down the debt go 
first? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the credit ratings that we get as a country and 
the lower interest rates that the bond rating agencies give us, 
it is because we have been able to balance our budgets for the 
past three years, reduce our taxes and pay down the debt.  Those 
reduced interest rates constitute an enormous savings not only to 
the federal government but to every one of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc members want us to give up to the provinces our 
capacity to make strategic investments for the future of 
Canadians, strategic investments in areas such as education, 
which is so critical to the economy of the 21st century and to 
the new economy, and to give up our capacity to support 
innovation such as through technology partnerships.  All these 
programs are critical to the future economic well-being of 
Canadians.  We are not going to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen an historic accord concluded last September by the 
Prime Minister of Canada with all of the provincial ministers. It 
was historic, first, for the amount that was involved, $21.1 
billion over five years added to the transfers that we are 
already making to the provinces.  In addition, another $2.2 
billion for early childhood development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the overall transfers that we are making as a federal 
government to the provinces?  They are at an historic high.  When 
we look at the CHST, including the tax points, and at 
equalization, which is at an all time high, it is over $40 
billion a year that is transferred to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back historically and take a look at how this whole 
issue of tax transfers appeared on the agenda.  It started in 
1977 when the provinces said that they needed more room to tax. 
The federal government said that it would give them more room but 
that they had to recognize that those transfers of tax points to 
the provinces would be transfers of revenue generating capacity. 
The federal government gave up its capacity to tax by 13.5% on 
the personal side and 1% on the corporate side.  The provinces 
picked that up by imposing those taxes.  They got the cash and we 
did not.  It was a transfer of cash to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since then the provinces have said that the federal 
government was not transferring to them anything more than the 
cash component. How could they be so short-sighted?  How could 
they go back on their word which they gave in 1977?  How could 
they go back on their commitment to recognize that the tax points 
they took from us were in fact transfers to those provinces? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net impact of tax points on taxpayers was zero, but it cost 
the government a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the value of tax points transferred to the provinces 
was $2.7 billion. That amount has been increased and is now at 
$16 billion, which is about half the total amount provided to 
provinces under the CHST. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are our reasons for not going back on what we have done? 
First, doing tax points creates inequities among the richest and 
the poorest provinces.  A tax point in Ontario is worth $35 per 
capita today.  It was worth only $17 last year in Newfoundland. 
Is that the type of equity that we are trying to build for all 
Canadians? 
On the other hand, when we transfer cash to the provinces it 
means the same amount per capita.  That is equitable.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason we will not go back on this is that we will 
not give up the federal capacity to legislate the values which 
are so critical to Canadians, such as the Canada Health Act. This 
is why we have used the threat of cutting transfers to the 
provinces, and have actually had to cut in certain cases in order 
to ensure that the principles of the Canada Health Act were 
adhered to by the provinces.  If all that cash were gone, total 
leverage would be gone and our admired system of public health in 
Canada would be finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of social assistance, we used it to enforce the fact 
that provinces could not impose minimal residency requirements. 
That was fair.  If one is a Canadian it does not matter which 
province one lives in, one's rights will not be cut off.  That is 
what it means to be a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at our relative capacity to tax already.  In 1977, 
before the transfer of tax points to the provinces, personal and 
corporate income taxes brought in about 60 cents for every dollar 
of federal tax.  Today that is up to about 85 cents.  When we add 
federal transfers to that revenue generating capacity in the 
provinces, the provinces end up with a higher revenue base than 
in the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the fiscal tools to be strong.  Nothing could have 
demonstrated that better than the Canadian economic miracle of 
going from a deficit of $41 billion to three straight surpluses, 
heading to four, and having been called by the economists of 
London the economic miracle of the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc members, the opposition, have consistently denied the 
value of the tax points.  They say that we give only 15 cents on 
the dollar to health care.  They also ask us to give them more 
tax points.   If tax points are so valuable, why did they ignore 
the tax points when they said we gave only 15 cents on the dollar 
for health care?  It is over 30 cents.  They cannot have it both 
ways. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is hypocrisy. Twenty-six per cent of federal funding for 
research and development goes to Quebec. What percentage of the 
Canadian population does Quebec account for? Twenty-five per 
cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For industrial research and development, the government spends 
33%; for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 32%; for 
infrastructure, 26%; for the Canada Foundation for Innovation as 
well as for 29 research chairs, 30% of the budget. For the CHST, 
50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we can see why the Bloc Quebecois is proposing this motion. 
It is obvious. It does not want a federal government, a Canadian 
government. It wants to destroy Canada. That is their sole 
objective and that is the reason why a few weeks ago, here in 
the House, members of the Bloc Quebecois insisted that we switch 
to a North American dollar. They want to destroy Canada's ability 
to have an independent monetary policy. The sole motivation of 
the Bloc Quebecois is to destroy Canada, not to promote it. That, 
we will never accept.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister managed to work himself up into quite a frenzy over 
a proposal to continue with the status quo.  He spoke as though 
the transfer of tax points between senior levels of government 
would somehow undermine the federation and the very glue that 
bonds it together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister not admit that tax point transfers from the 
federal to provincial governments to allow them to finance 
programs more transparently within their own exclusive 
constitutional jurisdiction is a longstanding historic practice 
of the Canadian federation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he does admit this, why is he concerned about the motion 
which simply suggests that the first ministers gather for the 
purpose of reapportioning the tax base among the federal and 
provincial governments through the transfer of tax points?  Is this 
not an ongoing process?  Does this not happen from year to year? 
Is the negotiation of who finances what not a work in process in 
terms of tax points and cash transfers?  If so, why is he so 
concerned?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he proposing that the meeting of first ministers for the 
purpose of reapportioning a tax base among the federal and

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have to say that I am very disappointed with his 
diatribe. Each time we put sensible projects forward, we are told 
we want to destroy Canada. They do not need us to do that. They 
are destroying the country themselves by being as narrow-minded 
as they are, and by not even accepting the idea of a 
federal-provincial meeting. Really! A federalist is opposed to a 
meeting between his prime minister and the provincial premiers to 
talk about the efficient operation of the federation. This is 
really unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about the elimination of the deficit as if it were a 
miracle. Well if all miracles came about that way, we would never 
have seen one on the face of this earth. It is easy to have 
somebody else do the dirty work and then say it is a miracle. He 
did not see how the budget was balanced, that is for sure because 
it was done somewhere else, not here. It is the unemployed who 
did it, as well as the provinces. But I do agree, it is a 
miracle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we strike some sort of a balance somewhere? It is not only 
the public finances that need to be balanced. Could he show a 
little more balance and admit that it would be a good idea, given 
anticipated surpluses of between $70 billion and $90 billion in 
the next four years, to talk about reapportioning the tax base? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his kind words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the federal government does not want to meet with 
the provinces to discuss fiscal arrangements. If my memory serves 
me right, the Prime Minister and all the premiers had a meeting 
on September 11, last year. Under their historical agreement, the 
federal government transferred more than $23 billion to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the kind of Canadian co-operation the hon. member 
dislikes? Does he not want to have this type of co-operation 
between the federal government and the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he wants to talk about problems, let me tell him quite 
frankly that since separatism became a force to reckon with in 
Quebec, we have seen a great deal of change.

talked about powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never felt any compassion whatsoever from the hon. member for 
the 1.3 million children living in poverty in Canada. I did not 
hear the hon. member say anything about the problem facing the

social services, health care and education services.

stop squabbling over powers and talking about separatism all the 
time, and to start thinking about the real people who need the 
money?

benefits, which will reach nearly $9 billion annually, is one of 
the most considerable ever made for children and low-income 
working families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done for education is very important for the future 
of all our youth. Even when there was a deficit we invested in 
post-secondary education. We had a budget for education and 
invested enormously through various programs: chairs of

tax credits for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have given enormous amounts to that sector and Canadian 
universities have thanked us for all we did in the area of 
education because education might just be the most important

represented a Progressive Conservative, New Democrat or Liberal 
government, including the former premier of Newfoundland and now

Bloc Quebecois today. This conclusion is that, in the Canadian 
federal system, there is an incredible distortion between the 
pressure under which the provinces are to provide services to 
their citizens in vital areas such as education, health and 
social services, and the situation of the federal government, 
which accumulates surpluses and is involved in areas where the 
pressure is much less.

ensure the kind of balance that is so important in a federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a university student I learned—and I am sure I am 
not the only one who did—that federalism is characterized by the 
coexistence of two levels of government in a state of balance. If 
this is the case, then we must call this conference, because we 
desperately need to correct the existing imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some figures which I find very meaningful. Between 1993 
and 2001, federal government revenues increased by 53%. During 
that period, its expenditures went down by 3%. 
If its spending were reduced, one does not need a doctorate in 
economy to understand that it made cuts and offloaded a number of 
responsibilities, or that the pressure to provide services is not 
on this government, but on the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, during the same period—no one can say that our 
numbers are not precise—from 1993 to 2001, program spending in 
Quebec, when considering all the programs administered by the 
Quebec government, increased by 16%. It increased by 32% in 
health care alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like members to remember that a year ago all the 
health ministers asked their public service—so it is not the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot or the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve or the member for Lévis—the public 
service of each province was asked by its health minister to see 
what kind of pressure will be put on the different health 
departments throughout the country in the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to a study that I have here witch says that for the 
next several years, not two or three years, but 15 years if the 
provinces want to provide exactly the same services every year, 
if all Quebecers who received health services last year expect to 
receive exactly the same services, the budget of Quebec's health 
minister will have to increase by 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot 
understands me well when he whispers to me that it is per year. 
That means that we will not come to the end of the tunnel if the 
status quo in the fiscal imbalance between the provinces and the 
federal government persists.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The 5% is attributable to the aging population, to the 
acquisition cost of medical technologies. For a hospital, 
acquiring a scanner may cost millions of dollars and that is only 
for a single hospital and one piece of medical equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know what item is currently the most costly in hospital 
budgets? It is the increased spending on drugs. That expense 
cannot be cut down, so over the next few years there will be 
significant increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us acknowledge something. Has there ever been in the history 
of Canadian federalism, in the history of this parliament, a more 
hypocritical government than the one opposite? Has there ever 
been one? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No, it is the worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Look at the situation. This is a government 
that is raking in surpluses. 
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot mentioned certain 
data from the finance minister's estimates. He was talking about 
a $60 billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> His mistakes in estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> His mistakes in estimates were of about $60 
billion. 
Not only has the government accumulated surpluses to the extent 
that we know, but year after year, despite the host of economists 
working for it, despite the econometric models that exist, 
despite the Department of Finance's powerful computers, it has 
been unable to estimate its assets and surpluses correctly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Or it made a mistake on purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> There is no doubt that it made a mistake on 
purpose.  This regime is based on hypocrisy, it is based on smoke and 
mirror tactics. Do you truly believe that people will accept 
that? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a few examples. While the government has these huge 
surpluses, there is money to be paid. There are legitimate 
demands from the government of Quebec. These demands often come 
from both the Liberals and the Parti Quebecois. When dealing with 
such issues, there is a consensus in the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take an example with which I am very familiar, the 
expansion of the Palais des congrès. How many times did the 
Minister of National Revenue, who is responsible for the Economic 
Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, rise in 
this House to say, in a bragging tone of voice, “We believe in 
regional development and we want to use taxes paid by Quebecers 
to promote development in Montreal and the regions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the real test came, when the time came to get involved 
financially in structuring projects for Montreal, this government 
said no. It would not give anything, not even a penny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the tourism industry in Montreal. People from 
Europe and elsewhere come to Montreal to spend a few days and go 
to the Olympic stadium, and so on. But there is also what is 
called business tourism. That is what governments want to focus 
on, business tourism, not only pleasure tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a student, I was not as strong in economics as our finance 
critic, but I did take some classes where we were told “As the 
construction industry goes so goes the world”. The construction 
industry is very important. The government of Quebec paid for the 
expansion of the Palais des congrès all by itself, even though 
the federal government owes us $59 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could have taken this opportunity to 
support economic growth in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give the House other examples like the ice storm. 
Hydro-Québec has submitted a claim for $400 million for losses 
incurred by crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see, Mr. Speaker, that my time is running out, although I feel 
like I have just begun. What I want to tell the government in 
conclusion is that everyone should support our motion, because it 
is not right for Ottawa to have all that money while so much 
pressure is being exerted on the services in the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
hesitate to use the word hypocritical.  It is not my word.  It 
was used by the hon. member across the way.  What I find somewhat 
hypocritical is the fact that the Bloc is now recognizing tax 
points.  This is great news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would inform the hon. member that when he is talking about the 
value of tax points with respect to health care, the value of the 
contribution by the federal government is 30 cents and not 14 
cents. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the hon. member's comments about some of the other 
pressures that are on the health care system with respect to the 
change in demographics.  The hon. member should recognize some of 
the other transfers that are actually made to the province of 
Quebec, such as 32% of the health research funds.  Health care 
research is critically important to ensure a sustainable health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I respect the fact that the member can stand up in the 
House and engage in the debate, he should do so by recognizing 
the facts.  The facts are that the contribution to Quebec by the 
federal government is substantially larger than the hon. member 
is prepared to recognize.  I ask the hon. member to recognize 
that fact. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask our colleague 
on the government side to read the conclusions of the Clair 
commission.  This commission is not the Bloc Quebecois or the 
government.  The federal government is assessed as follows: “For 
every dollar spent by the Government of Quebec, 14 cents comes 
from the federal government, no more, no less”.  When our 
colleague suggests that it is 30 cents, I respectfully submit he 
is out to lunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as concerns research and development, with the fifty 
centres belonging to the federal government on the Ontario 
side—well, they are in the greater Outaouais-Ontario region, 
they are not on the Outaouais side, but on the Ottawa side—the 
figures given me are fairly dramatic.  They date from 1999 and 
show that Quebec receives only 14.4% of the jobs in R and D. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is our fellow member asking us to be satisfied with that?  Is he 
asking us to keep a provincial and colonial mentality?  If that 
is so, I say that on this side of the House we will never agree 
to that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always intimidating to rise just after the very 
eloquent member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. However I will try to 
take the challenge offered so kindly to me by my colleague and 
friend from Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have been listening to the debate I have had the feeling 
that government members have not taken the time to carefully read 
what we are debating. We are asking that the federal government 
call a federal-provincial first ministers' conference for the 
purpose of rectifying the fiscal imbalance between the federal 
government and the provinces in offering a new way to share the 
tax base, including through a tax points transfer that will 
respect the constitutional responsibilities of Quebec and the 
other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking to turn everything upside down, change the 
world or reinvent the wheel. We want a proper forum to be created 
to deal with a lack of balance in the tax system, which is 
acknowledged by most economists and stakeholders in Quebec and 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representations or questions raised by the Liberal member 
who spoke before me could or will be brought to the table by the 
federal government for discussion by the first ministers. I do 
not agree with his point of view. Instead of making demagogic 
speeches as he did, let us create a forum where such discussions 
will be meaningful because they will lead to concrete action 
within a very short time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that the reason why government members will not vote 
for the motion is because they like the current situation which 
is part of Canada's nation building continuum, which started 
several decades ago and gathered speed in 1982 with the 
unilateral patriation of the constitution and is increasingly 
gathering speed since 1995.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is intent on turning the federal state that 
Canada should be into a unitary state. It is wants to weaken the 
provincial governments and turn them into big municipal 
governments, to rake in astronomical surpluses at the expense of 
the provinces so that Ottawa can wallow in money while the 
provinces have to take up increasingly difficult challenges with 
their heads barely above water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While feeding mere crumbs to the provinces, the federal 
government is not just weakening them, it is also deciding on its 
own to dictate conditions on the transfer of new funds, impose 
national standards, bulldoze its own constitution—which sets out 
federal and provincial jurisdictions—to build a Canada that is 
more and more uniform nationally, a Canada that negates the 
specificity not only of Quebec, something which is crucial and 
essential, but also of other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many options. We still have in Quebec a continuous 
position that dates back to the Maurice Duplessis government. The 
Union Nationale governments of Duplessis, Johnson and Bertrand, 
the Liberal governments of Lesage, Johnson and Bourassa, and the 
PQ governments of Lévesque, Johnson, Parizeau, Bouchard and now 
Landry all had or have the same position. 
There is still a very broad consensus in Quebec that fiscal 
imbalance has been around for a long time and that it does exist. 
There is a consensus on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it only too well.  We saw with the young offenders that 
there is no Quebec consensus that will stop this government.  It 
is really a shame, and Quebecers will remember this when the time 
comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite talked about federal spending and said that 
the federal government gave more to Quebec than it deserved. That 
is what it boiled down to.  I would like to respond, if I may, as 
follows.  In 1997, federal government program spending in Quebec 
was $28.3 billion, or 23.9% of the total for Canada. That is less 
than Quebec's demographic share, which is 24.4%. But it is worse 
than that because when we take a closer look we see the form 
this spending took. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is over-represented when it comes to equalization 
payments and employment insurance—$2.9 billion more than its 
demographic weight—but under-represented when it comes to 
structuring spending, such as procurement of goods and services, 
investments and grants which represent $3.5 billion less than 
its demographic weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to an independent organization, the Institut de la 
statistique du Québec, this under representation of $3.5 billion 
deprives Quebec of 45,500 jobs, which would account for half of 
the historic difference between the rate of unemployment in 
Quebec and in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Premier Bernard Landry said that the federal system was not 
to Quebec's advantage, he went even further, and he was perfectly 
right. Other figures could be mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Institut de la statistique du Québec, $100 
million in federal government spending generates 920 direct and 
381 indirect jobs.  Spending of $3.5 billion would therefore mean 
45,500 jobs in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, this means that these jobs amount to 
one and a half times the number of jobs in all of the Gaspé 
peninsula; 80% of the jobs on the North Shore; two-thirds of the 
jobs in Abitibi—Témiscamingue; one-third of the jobs in the 
Eastern Townships; and one-third of the jobs in 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not giving Quebec its fairshare. Given 
the losses incurred by Quebec because of the fiscal imbalance and 
given the losses incurred by Quebec because the money spent by 
the federal government in Quebec is mainly passive money and not 
structural spending that generates economic activity, jobs and 
economic development, this is not only a criticism of the federal 
government—as we have said before, successive governments in 
Quebec have raised this question since Duplessis—it is a 
criticism of the system itself and of the logic of the system. 
It is imposing more and more constraints on Quebec, with the 
result that it has to face increased social spending. My 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve was talking about this a 
little earlier. Quebec's social spending is increasing at an 
alarming rate. In health alone, it is increasing by 5% per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers are faced with the following choice. They do not have 
to choose between the status quo and the full and complete 
control over their development.  They have a choice between Quebec 
sovereignty and an increasingly centralizing and unitary 
federalism, which is weakening the provinces a little more every 
day, riding roughshod over the Quebec nation, negating more and 
more the reality of Quebec, ignoring its consensus and 
personality, in fact aiming at making the Quebec nation disappear 
in the medium and long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the choice that the people of Quebec have. We will see 
that Quebecers will make the right choice and realize that the 
solution lies in full control over their development mechanism, 
sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask my colleague a question in connection with an 
intervention by a former parliamentary secretary to the minister 
of finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said we were in an advantageous position as far as R and D 
investments are concerned, spending on laboratories.  What is he 
thinking of?  We hear on all sides that this is not the case, 
that Quebec is disadvantaged.  The government side always turns 
up with miraculous figures and proportions.  I do not know where 
they get them.  I do not know what mental gymnastics they use to 
come up with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member be able to give us the truth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau: </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like 
to respond to the question of the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot as to where the figures come from.  I too 
would like to know.  I think the Liberals just pull them out of the air 
before they come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the future of R and D investment—we are in an 
increasingly wired world, and the future belongs to the most 
productive R and D people—federal R and D investments in Quebec 
represent 14.4%, which is more than 10% less than our population 
share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hear my hon. colleague from Saint-Lambert say it is not 
so.  These figures come from the Minister of Finance's own 
statistics, her minister, who says that 14.4% of research and 
development expenditures go to Quebec. The most flagrant example 
is that of the federal capital—the only national capital in 
Canada is Quebec City—where all R and D centres in the greater 
Ottawa region are on the Ontario side. There is not a single one 
on the Quebec side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the hon. member for Saint-Lambert to find a figure 
other than 14.4% for federal R and D expenditures in Quebec and 
to show me an R and D centre in the Outaouais region on the 
Quebec side as opposed to the Ontario side.  I send her this 
challenge.  Let her take the floor to tell us what the figures 
are, if they are other than the ones I have given.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
just could not let the member's comment go by.  To use his word, 
fabrication is the topic of the day.  The fact that we are here 
debating this issue is, in a lot of people's minds, a 
fabrication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have heard to date, the Bloc is engaged in some 
phenomenal gymnastics.  If the figure I provided earlier is not 
enough, perhaps the hon. member would want to get up and 
challenge the fact that Quebec receives 26% of the infrastructure 
dollars and 50% of the technology partnership fund which are 
actual dollars that flow directly into the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not dwell on throwing these numbers back and forth but 
let us recognize that there is a role for the federal government. 
The role is to maintain a united country that works for the best 
interests of all Canadians.  That is something I do not believe 
the hon. member has with respect to his interest in being in this 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau: </B>Mr. Speaker, if the Liberal member who 
just asked a question wanted to be honest, he should not be so 
close to the tree that he ignores the forest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain. It is easy to look at a program in isolation, 
but we should consider the whole situation. The figures for his 
own department are as follows: the Quebec share of federal 
spending on goods and services is 21%; its share of current 
transfers to businesses is 16.5%; its share of R&D is 14.4%. 
These figures come from his department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite easy to look at just one program. Instead of being 
too close to a single tree, let us look at the forest. When we do 
this, we realize that Quebec is being short changed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find it interesting that the only resolutions or ideas that 
come from the Bloc deal with taking money, power or both, and we 
know they are both the same, away from the federal government and 
giving increased money and power to the provincial government in 
Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what the agenda is of the members from the Bloc but I 
find it curious indeed when I sit in this place and see the 
Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition stand in his place and 
rap his arms warmly around the Bloc's concept of stripping power 
away from the federal government and increasing it at the 
provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a group in opposition who are indeed 
provincial politicians who should be selling their wares in the 
beautiful province of Alberta or in the province of Quebec.  The 
reality is that there is a role, much to the chagrin of the Bloc 
Quebecois, for the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will also be splitting my time after question 
period with the member for Markham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it astounding to hear members of a national parliament 
stand in their place, as a member opposite did, and refer to the 
nation of Quebec and to hear the Canadian Alliance agree with 
that.  The reality is that there is no nation of Quebec. There is 
a wonderful province of Quebec in the nation of Canada. It is 
about time those members understood that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member also stand in his place and ask when the 
Liberals were going to accept the consensus of the people of 
Quebec?  I have a message for that member.  Perhaps that member 
did not get it in the last election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals won 10 additional seats in the province of Quebec 
in the last election.  We accept that.  We are quite happy to 
accept that.  We have 36 or so people in the Quebec caucus 
representing the federal government in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not whether Quebec City, Toronto Queen's Park or 
Alberta should have more authority to take more money away from 
the people, or whether or not the federal government should 
deliver services.  The real issue is that the provincial 
governments, and my province of Ontario is a classic example, 
having done this for years, continue to run a deficit while 
cutting taxes, which means they are cutting taxes while borrowing 
money to pay for those tax cuts.  Someone help me understand 
where that fits in economics 101. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the province of Ontario, with a straight face, hand out 
to all hospitals around the province envelopes with $2 million, 
$3 million, $4 million, and $5 million for the purpose of buying 
capital equipment?  When we add up the amount of money being 
transferred to the hospitals it just happens to be $294.5 
million.  That happens to be the exact amount of money 
transferred from the federal treasury to the province of Ontario 
for the purpose of acquiring new equipment.  Is that not 
interesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the province then turn around and announce it will spend 
$114 million on children's services under the ministry of 
community and social services?  When we look at the CHST and the 
amount of money transferred under that agreement to the province 
of Ontario from the federal government, it just happens 
coincidentally to be $114 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is how to make the nation work.  I suggest there 
is a very important role for the government to play in terms of 
national standards.  I say to the members of the Bloc Quebecois 
that there is only one nation.  Outside of the one policy they 
have in their policy platform they are not bad parliamentarians, 
except that every once in a while that one policy, like eating a 
bad cucumber, comes back up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That policy simply says that they want to destroy Canada.  I 
have news for them.  We will not let them do it under any 
circumstances.  Under our watch there is no chance and no way 
that they will have success in convincing either Quebecers or 
Canadians that somehow we should split the country along 
provincial lines.  It is not on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of attending the FCM conference in Banff, 
Alberta, last weekend where I spoke to many people from Alberta 
and many people from right across the country.  The people from 
Alberta love this country.  They will not allow any kind of an

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Alexander was contacted by a census worker after he failed 
to complete the long census form in full.  The problem is the 
census worker is someone he knows quite well.

the census form.  Not even the loans officer at my bank in 
town”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Today the Chair heard submissions on a point 
of order raised by the government House leader in relation to 
Bill S-15, a bill that has now received first reading in the House.

benefit of his advice on this point.

</P>
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the two questions raised with respect 
to Bill S-15 are in regard to the need for a royal recommendation 
and whether the levy described in the bill is a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental purpose of the requirement for a royal 
recommendation is to limit the authority for appropriating money 
from the consolidated revenue fund to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 2 of the Financial Administration Act, appropriation 
is defined to mean any authority of parliament to pay money out 
of the consolidated revenue fund.  The consolidated revenue fund 
is defined to mean the aggregate of all public moneys that are on 
the deposit of the credit of the receiver general.  Only 
ministers can obtain the necessary approval from the governor 
general for a royal recommendation to appropriate these funds. 
The constitution stipulates that bills requiring or processing a 
royal recommendation must originate in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill S-15, the money raised through the levy is 
to be collected by the Canadian tobacco industry.  Therefore I 
see no requirement for a royal recommendation for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question has to do with whether or not the levy 
established through the bill constitutes a tax.  In plain 
language of the bill, the bill speaks in terms of a levy rather 
than a tax.  The purpose of the levy, as stated in the bill, is 
to meet an industry purpose beneficial to the industry, although 
the industry purpose also has public benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levy is imposed exclusively on tobacco products of whatever 
description and is to be spent in pursuit of the goals listed in 
the bill.  Consequently, what is being proposed is a levy, not a 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May describes two criteria by which a bill proposing a 
levy is exempt from the financial procedures, including the 
adoption of a ways and means resolution that would normally apply 
to bills imposing a tax.  The first criterion is that the levy 
must be for industry purposes.  The second is that the funds 
collected must not form any part of government revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May includes examples of bills from the United Kingdom 
which were regarded as levies, as well as those which failed to 
meet either or both of these two criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are recent Canadian experiences, as well.  In this 
parliament we have the example of Bill C-27 which imposes a levy 
on the nuclear industry.  The government felt it necessary to 
attach a royal recommendation to the bill and adopted a ways and 
means motion prior to its introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In support of Bill S-15, we have the example of Bill C-32, an 
act to amend the Copyright Act, which was considered in the 35th 
parliament.  Bill C-32 imposed a levy on the sale of blank tapes 
to be distributed to artists and artist groups as a form of 
royalty.  Bill C-32 did not have a royal recommendation and the 
bill was not preceded by a ways and means resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Speaker Parent's ruling of December 2, 1998, regarding Bill 
S-13, the predecessor to Bill S-15, he cited the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levy was of benefit to that industry since it permitted the 
audio duplication of copyright material for private use.  This 
would enhance the market for blank audio tapes.  The levy on the 
tapes was designated to raise funds by which owners of copyright 
material would be compensated for losses caused by private 
duplication of that material.  The link between the benefit to 
the industry and the levy being imposed seems clear in that case. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make a comparison of Bill C-32 to Bill S-13, the Speaker went 
on to say of Bill S-13: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the lack of credibility referred to here is a function of 
our common sense understanding of the self-interest of the 
tobacco industry, namely, that as a commercial enterprise its 
primary goal is to expand its markets and thereby to increase 
profits.  Young people would constitute the future growth 
potential for the industry's market.  How could it be to the 
benefit of the industry to reduce smoking among the very people 
who would constitute its growth market?  It is this implausible 
proposition that underlies the credibility problem to which the 
bill refers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect to Speaker Parent, he may have been a 
competent school teacher and a respected speaker of the House but 
that did not qualify him as a director of marketing for a tobacco 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, myself, do not pretend to guess at the marketing strategy of 
those corporations.  If the fate of the bill hinges on whether 
the levy is a benefit to the industry or not, we should get that 
answer from the tobacco industry itself.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The claim that the bill is not beneficial to the industry is 
false.  The industry has been asking for this very bill.  It has 
been running ads in support of Bill S-15.  I have a copy here and 
I will give a copy to you, Mr. Speaker, at the end of my 
comments.  At the end of the ad it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imperial Tobacco and JTI MacDonald strongly support Bill S-15. We 
believe that it is consistent with our companies' view that 
underage people should not smoke and that the decision to do so 
should be an informed one made only by adults.  We commend those 
who have worked so hard to help bring Bill S-15 towards reality 
and reaffirm our support for the Bill and the Foundation it would 
create. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There you have it, Mr. Speaker.  The industry clearly supports 
the bill.  If we go back and consider Speaker Parent's suggestion 
that common sense prevail, it is common sense that Bill S-15 is 
beneficial to the tobacco industry since it is going to great 
lengths and spending large sums of money on these ads promoting 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other weakness in the argument of Speaker Parent in this is 
when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could it be to the benefit of the industry to reduce smoking 
among the very people who would constitute its growth market? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Robert Parker, chairman and chief executive officer of the 
Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, stated before the 
Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on 
April 1, 1997, the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manufacturers agree that youth should not smoke, period. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Don Brown, past chairman, president and CEO of Imperial Tobacco 
and chair of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, made 
similar comments regarding youth smoking to the Vancouver Board 
of Trade on October 1, 1998.  He said “We believe children 
should not smoke—”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Speaker Parent, in his ruling, overlooked the fact that 
selling cigarettes to minors is against the law.  He was 
suggesting that breaking the law is a common sense marketing 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event the Speaker is sympathetic to the point of view of 
the government House leader, I offer another alternative, and 
this will be my last point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our rules there are exemptions regarding financial matters. 
Standing Order 80(1) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All aids and supplies granted to the Sovereign by the Parliament 
of Canada are the sole gift of the House of Commons, and all 
bills for granting such aids and supplies ought to begin with the 
House, as it is the undoubted right of the House to direct, limit 
and appoint in all such bills, the ends, purposes, 
considerations, conditions, limitations and qualifications of 
such grants, which are not alterable by the Senate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 80(2) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to expedite the business of Parliament, the House will 
not insist on the privilege claimed—. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing order describes these circumstances as, and I 
quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—penalties thereby imposed are only to punish or prevent crimes 
and offences— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose and the benefit of Bill S-15 would be to prevent 
young people from smoking.  Since this is considered an offence, 
it would meet the criteria of Standing Order 80(2).  I would 
think that the government and all members of the House would not, 
in this instance, insist on its financial privileges. Bill S-15 
is aimed at significantly reducing underage smoking in Canada. 
What better reason is there than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Senate Speaker, in his ruling of April 2, 1998 on 
Bill S-13 said that it was his view that, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—matters are presumed to be in order except where the contrary 
is clearly established by the case.  This presumption suggests to 
me that the best policy for a Speaker is to interpret the rules 
in favour of debate. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case I would argue that we should give the benefit of 
the doubt to the receivability of Bill S-15 and allow for debate 
and a decision by the House on a very important issue for the 
young children of this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would first like to express my gratitude to the 
Chair for deferring this matter in order to hear my brief 
submission, as well as the submission of my learned friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be focusing in on procedural, as opposed to legal or 
constitutional arguments, which is where I believe the focus 
should be on this particular point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues at play are very important and very complex.  They go 
to the very pith and substance of responsible government.  The 
sad part is that it is the failure of the government to act 
responsibly that has given rise to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling of Speaker Parent dealt with the content of Bill 
S-13.  Bill S-15, we are told, was drafted to answer some of the 
procedural objections raised by the Chair.  This bill of course 
we know originated in the Senate.  Others have also addressed 
that point and supporting material has been filed with the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Parent's ruling seemed to reject, based on a common 
sense approach or standard, that the industry could not possibly 
want something that would hurt its own cause.  Yet there is a 
clear indication that the industry does in fact want this 
scenario and has asked for it on previous occasions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The logic seems to be that the industry was possibly in the 
process of hurting itself, yet the Speaker seemed to think this 
was implausible.  Following that logic, if the industry was in 
favour of causing harm to children this would be illegal.  We 
very much need to look at what the industry has said in this 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has suggested that the levy proposed 
in the bill amounts to a tax and therefore a burden on the 
people.  However there is proof that it is not a tax.  If one 
examines in detail the provisions of the bill one will find that 
it is not a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look closely.  The charge is made not on the population 
at large but is placed on the industry itself with the proceeds 
directed specifically and narrowly.  The proceeds are to be used 
completely outside the process of government and, I hasten to 
add, for a positive benefit: the promotion of health and healthy 
living of young Canadians.  The proceeds are not to be used by 
the government but are for private use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a precedent for this situation.  It is dealt with on 
page 763 of the 18th edition of Erskine May.  At this point I 
must recognize that Speaker Parent resorted to precedent from the 
22nd edition of May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a corollary issue surrounding the issue of competing 
editions of this volume and the degree to which the house of 
commons at Westminster continues to indirectly legislate this 
parliament, but that is best left for another time. I will return 
to my friendly 18th edition of May where I find compelling 
precedents that outnumber the modest rule of the 22nd edition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of instances where levies have been treated as matters 
outside the ways and means rules, Erskine May cites 10 instances 
of bills which oppose levies and levies which have been used for 
purposes other than direct positive benefits to an industry.  The 
levy can be used for other purposes.  Clearly precedents exist 
both in the jurisdictions of Great Britain and Australia.  I 
submit that this is the case with respect to Bill S-15.  I am 
quoting from page 763 of Erskine May which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may sometimes be difficult to define the limits of an 
industry, as in the Wheat Bill, 1932 (which was treated as within 
this rule) under which levies upon importers of flour formed a 
fund for making payments to growers of wheat.  An even more 
difficult case was the Mineral Workings Bill, 1951, under which a 
fund fed by contributions from ironstone operators, owners and 
the Exchequer was set up to restore agriculture land from which 
iron ore had been extracted.  This again was held to be a levy on 
the operators and owners though it involved some extension of the 
rule. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal recommendation was required on the mineral workings 
bill because of the contribution required from the exchequer. 
That was significant in the House as recorded in volume 486 of 
<I>Hansard</I>, column 1809.  There was no royal recommendation 
required in the instance of the wheat bill.  Both bills passed 
both houses without being treated as taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my submission that Bill S-15 has nothing to do with public 
funds.  It distinguishes itself from the traditional definition 
of tax because there is no reference to public funding.  All 
money collected from the companies would go directly to the 
foundation and would bypass general revenue.  The government 
would not touch it.  The origins and arrivals would not evolve 
around the government or the public purse.  It would in no way 
impact in terms of a revenue generating source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, it distinguishes itself from any traditional definition 
of tax because there is no reference to public funding.  If one 
were to look at it from a Canadian analogy or perspective, 
perhaps one should ask if it would be proper to originate a 
private bill in the Senate which established an enterprise such 
as a railroad, a church or an international bridge.  In that 
legislation the enterprises were given the duty to carry out 
certain objectives and in return the right to make enforceable 
charges upon their clientele. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the situation that applies in this instance.  There is a 
willing customer and a willing vendor seeking the right to carry 
out an enterprise under the authority of the Parliament of 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker knows that private members' bills can and indeed 
regularly originate in the Senate.  All sorts of special 
conditions and powers are granted to those private situations. 
When a bill arrives here from the Senate, the House does not look 
into the question of how the Senate views the bill.  It arrives 
here not as a Senate public bill or a Senate private bill, but 
rather as a bill passed by the Senate to which the concurrence of 
the House of Commons is requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House is to restrict the right of the Senate to send us 
private bills which contain financial powers for the applicants, 
there will be a significant problem for canals and international

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McCallum (Markham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to participate in the debate on the Bloc motion 
regarding transferring tax points to the provinces.  I will 
broaden the discussion a little if I may because there are three 
components of the Bloc economic policy that form a logical and 
coherent whole.  That can be taken as a compliment, I suppose. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first component is today's motion, that is the transfer of 
tax points from the federal government to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second component, which coincides with that, is the Bloc's 
notion that the federal government's surpluses next year will be 
about $18 billion—according to the Bloc—rather than $7 or $8 
billion according to the economists. If that is true, it will be 
easier for the government to make such a transfer to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third component is the Bloc's idea that we should give up 
the Canadian dollar and use the U.S. dollar. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All three of these components are a logical and consistent whole 
because all of them separately and together lead to the same 
thing.  All three lead to a weakening of the federal government, 
a weakening of the Canadian economy and an increase in the 
likelihood of the separation of Quebec from Canada.  While they 
are logically coherent, I would for those reasons oppose them all 
very strenuously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through very briefly each of the three components of 
the Bloc economic platform.  First, on the transfer of tax 
points, which is the subject of the motion today, I will comment 
very briefly on the major elements of current transfers including 
tax points.  I will then give the House two reasons why I think 
the Bloc motion makes little sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now there are three major components of transfers from the 
federal government to the provinces.  The first consists of 
around $18 billion of cash transfers, which was increased 
recently by the health accord in the fall of last year and added 
some $20 billion of federal money for health over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, and this is something the Bloc Quebecois and indeed all 
the provinces tend to forget, we have transfers in the form of 
tax points because back in 1977 the federal government 
transferred tax points or taxing powers from the federal 
government to the provinces.  This amounts to a value of $16 
billion today whereas in 1977 when the transfer occurred it was 
about one-tenth of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Bloc and the provinces tend to ignore this tax 
point component is relevant, as members will see in a minute, to 
the subject of its motion respecting the transfer of further tax 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third component of special relevance and importance to 
Quebec concerns equalization payments made to have not provinces. 
This year those payments consisted of $11 billion of which nearly 
half or $5.4 billion went to Quebec.  This equalization payment 
has been among the fastest growing components of our 
expenditures, having increased by 33% over the last decade or so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the status quo. What the Bloc is proposing is that the 
federal government transfer more tax points to the provinces. In 
my opinion, this is not a good idea at all. What the federal 
government did last fall was to make the largest cut in personal 
income tax in Canadian history, a $100 billion tax cut, but a tax 
cut for Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois wants is not a tax cut for Canadian 
taxpayers, but a tax cut for Canadian provinces. In my opinion, 
it is a lot better for the federal government to cut personal 
income tax than to cut taxes for the provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any province wants more revenue it is entirely free to raise 
its own taxes, but if Ottawa has excess money it should cut taxes 
to the people, not to the provinces as the Bloc motion suggests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point is even more important.  It shows that the Bloc 
proposal is inherently and blatantly contradictory.  We have had 
transfers of tax points from Ottawa to the provinces since 1977. 
Whenever provinces say how much Ottawa is contributing to health 
care or other social programs, unfailingly they never include the 
tax points.  The provinces say Ottawa only pays 19% of health 
care or some amount like that because they have forgotten the tax 
points, which would more or less double the contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they want us to transfer further tax points.  Do we think 
that in the future they will acknowledge that transfer when they 
report the contribution of Ottawa to provincial social programs? 
Obviously they will not, given the history of the last 24 years 
when they have never reported tax points.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is obvious that the object of this motion on transfer of 
tax points is to reduce the importance of the federal government 
in the eyes of Quebecers. That is the true objective of the Bloc 
Quebecois because, if the importance of the federal government 
is reduced in the eyes of Quebecers, this will advance the cause 
of separatists. This is its objective. It has nothing to do with 
the economy. It is purely political and a good reason to oppose 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is related to the first. 
According to the finance critic of the Bloc Quebecois, all bank 
economists who make these economic forecasts are always wrong 
and only the finance critic of the Bloc Quebecois is right. He 
showed with graphs the huge forecast errors economists made and 
the small forecast errors of the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told him the other day that perhaps he should not be here in 
parliament. If his forecasts are so wonderful, he should start 
his own business and he would become a millionaire. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that if one can outperform the market in terms of 
economic forecasts one can be a millionaire. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But before the finance critic of the Bloc Quebecois makes this 
career change, if I were him, I would continue believing the 
economists. Consequently, it seems to me more reasonable to 
think that the federal surplus will be $7 billion or $8 billion, 
instead of $18 billion, next year. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be very brief on this final point because it is all part 
of the same separatist circle coming together.  It is the 
incessant clamour by the Bloc for Canada to give up its dollar 
and use the U.S. dollar.  It is evident from a separatist point 
of view that this would be a very nice thing, because come the 
great day of separation, if we were all using the U.S. dollar, 
currency would not be an issue.  However, if we were using the 
Canadian dollar, it would be a big problem.  Obviously from a 
purely political view the Bloc favours dollarization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one story to illustrate the point that there is very 
little support within the Canadian business community for 
dollarization.  We had a debate in Quebec on dollarization, which 
I participated before I got into politics.  Three hundred 
business people came to the Montreal board of trade meeting. Then 
the organizers wanted to have a repeat debate at the Toronto 
board of trade but there was no interest.  The dollarization 
issue is largely a Quebec issue, in particular a Quebec 
separatist issue, plus a sprinkling of academics across the 
country.  It has no general backing from the Canadian business 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I mention these three aspects of the Bloc program 
because they all hang together: the further transfer of tax 
points; the gross overestimate of next year's federal surplus; 
and the incessant clamouring to use the U.S. dollar.  They are 
coherent in the sense that individually and taken as a whole they 
would lead to: first, a weakening of the federal government; 
second, a weakening of the Canadian economy; and third, an 
advancing of the cause of Quebec separation.  On all three of 
these grounds I strongly oppose this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
listen to the member for Markham, a former chief economist of 
the Royal Bank, people would think that he would make a much 
better novelist than an economist, especially with such wild 
imaginings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of sovereignty alone, I say this to him: no motion 
of the House of Commons will bring it about.  If he thinks it is 
a step in this direction, he is mistaken.  We will decide on 
sovereignty at home in Quebec with a referendum the issue of 
which will be decided by the people of Quebec.  He will have 
nothing to say on the matter.  That is the first thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if the single currency is linked to separatism, is 
Thomas Courchene, North America's top macroeconomist—at least 
considerably better than he is—, who supports a single currency, 
a separatist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is David Dodge, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, who sees the 
single currency as unavoidable in the three Americas within the 
next 10 years, another separatist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member for Markham has a problem somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another problem with what he has just said.  He talks 
of economists' forecasts. 
He is looking out for himself.  He was one of the small group of 
four or five economists that gravitated around the Minister of 
Finance until last year.  Not all of them predicted such 
ridiculous surpluses as this gang, the buddies of the Minister 
of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the real non partisan economists—and here we can see he is 
partisan, he became the federal Liberal member for Markham—were 
consulted, they thought the forecasts of the Minister of Finance 
were laughable and forecast surpluses of about the same amount 
as we had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is here today, I put the question to him, is it because he 
lacked the ability to forecast at the Royal Bank, in fact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McCallum:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respond to these three 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the motion has nothing to do with separatism, at least 
not directly. This is not a referendum. What I said is that the 
more tax points are transferred to the provinces, the less 
important the federal government is in Quebec. This advances the 
cause of separatism. This is what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I said that it was actually Quebec which was in favour 
of a single currency, namely the U.S. dollar, because no one 
among Toronto business people wanted to hear about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said that a handful of academics including Thomas 
Courchene supported the idea. I admit to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally with regard to the finance minister's buddies, yes, I 
became a Liberal, but I am the only one. The other ones are 
probably more conservative. 
I did not make the forecasts, the big forecasting agencies made 
them, namely universities. They have no axe to grind, no 
political axe to grind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe they are right, maybe they are wrong, but they are 
politically neutral. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just wanted to point out to my colleague from Markham 
that before the election he said, 
“Mr. Martin has erred in his forecasts for political reasons so 
that the surpluses turn out to be larger than planned”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he have to say about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McCallum:</B> Mr. Speaker, as usual Bloc members are 
totally out of context. This is the same interview in which I 
said that the Bloc critic should join the private sector if his 
forecasts were truly so fantastic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said in this interview—he missed the important point—was: 
“It could have been said two or three years ago that Mr. 
Martin would do that—For the past two or three years 
economists have been making forecasts and they have no political 
agenda.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least, for two or three years, the surpluses could not have 
been deliberately inflated because they were forecasted by 
private sector economists. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address today's motion from the Bloc Quebecois, 
because I want to remind the House where these enormous 
surpluses come from. There have been a lot of them since 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half come from cuts to the employment insurance fund. These 
cuts, and the state of the economy, have helped the government 
generate surpluses year after year. These were planned 
surpluses. Every year, about six or seven billion dollars are 
paid by workers, even those who only earn $1,000, and by small 
and medium sized businesses that employ the largest number of 
workers with salaries that do not, or barely reach the ceiling 
at which one stops paying employment insurance premiums. This is 
a regressive type of contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government got these surpluses from the workforce and the 
small and medium sized businesses, which are said to play a 
critical role in our economic development, particularly in 
Quebec. They are the ones who made the greatest contribution to 
the surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government do with these surpluses? Essentially two 
things. When the surpluses came as a surprise, following a 
dubious planning process, at the end of the year they were 
automatically used to reduce the deficit. There was no debate. 
Yes, there were negotiations on health, but these came only 
after the government was put under a lot of pressure, after 
television and newspapers presented dramatic stories about what 
was going on everywhere in the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government also took these surpluses to use, if not 
abuse its spending power in provincial jurisdictions, 
particularly in Quebec. 
Of course, there was a referendum in 1995; the government knows 
there will be another one and has already started campaigning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one consequence of these cuts to the employment 
insurance plan and to transfers for health and education that 
has not been mentioned. I repeat, before they were increased, 
health transfers were drastically reduced. Yes, there was a 
slight increase, but it depends on how one looks at it; they 
went down from $19 billion to $11 billion, and then up to $13 
billion. The cuts are slightly less severe, but they are still 
huge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In education, there were even bigger cuts. 
When I sat on the industry standing committee, year after year 
we heard from university professors and researchers, health 
researchers for example, who were in a terrible situation. While 
funding for universities in the United States, including in the 
area of medical research, was increasing sharply, what was 
happening in Canada? Such funding was decreasing, and it was 
decreasing sharply. We have just begun to see again investments 
in that area. But, again, it is the federal government that will 
decide where the money is spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out something. 
Canada prides itself on the international scene of having very 
generous social measures. The OECD tells us that, in fact, as far 
as social spending is concerned, and I am including all social 
spending in the area of health, education, pensions and so on, 
from 1980 to 1997—when Canada invested a lot more—Canada ranks 
25 out of 29 in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some say that Canada is a generous country and that we should 
make even more cuts. This is the case of our colleague from 
Markham, for example, who says that we have to reduce income tax 
instead of transferring tax points to the provinces so that they 
can take care of health, education and all the rest of social 
spending. What else would he want to see? Would he like to see 
Canada drop a few more places, to the bottom of the OECD ranking?

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important because even in Canada, people think that 
they have one of the best social and educational systems in the 
world. Canada ranks 25 out of 29. Then there is the United 
States. We say “Oh, we are not like the United States”. We are 
close to Japan, where we all know that there is no such thing as 
a safety net, close to Turkey, close to Mexico—which is still a 
developing country—and close to Korea. Can the members 
appreciate who we are close to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is really dramatic. 
For one of our colleagues to argue that we have brought forward 
this motion urging the government to transfer tax points—not 
only to Quebec but to all of the provinces—only to promote 
sovereignty is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back in history, I would remind the House that the first 
to negotiate tax points for Quebec were the Liberals in the 
1960s, and then the Union Nationale. Although they were 
federalists, they did not agree with the way the money was being 
allocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Daniel Johnson, of the Union Nationale, was elected after 
promising to get his hands back on 100% of the corporate income 
tax, 100% of the personal income tax and 100% of the inheritance 
tax. Soon after he was elected, he came to Ottawa to try to 
negotiate. He was told for the first time by a young Trudeau, a 
former member of the NPD freshly out of university, who had soon 
realized that, if he wanted to become Prime Minister, he had 
better run as a Liberal candidate “I also speak for the people of 
Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The so-called sovereignist agenda we are supposed to be pushing, 
according to the government, focuses on change. Jean Charest, a 
Quebec federalist, is travelling to western Canada to meet with 
the premiers and ask for tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem here is not only Confederation, although it has not 
been working well for a long time and is increasingly so, now. 
What is in question is the ability of young people to receive a 
decent education, the ability of universities to continue to 
train intellectuals who will be able to receive scholarships 
from funds created by the federal government. The government 
creates scholarships, but to be able to receive merit 
scholarships in research, there must be a pyramid. This pyramid 
must be funded adequately, but it is not, at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health spending is growing rapidly. Although we are trying to 
cut everywhere, it continues to grow. We know the population is 
aging, but this is not all. Medication is more expensive. 
Surgeries and equipment are also. We know that in Quebec 
people working in hospitals do so at a lower cost than in the 
rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, what is happening is the country, which could 
compare itself favourably to progressive countries, will now be 
comparable to Turkey, Korea and the United States, because 
social spending has fallen. When the government says that taxes 
must be reduced further, it continues to say that the provinces 
will not pay for the spending that is essential to a minimum of 
well-being and to the rights of the citizens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil (Beauharnois—Salaberry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would just like to make a comment.  We must always pay 
attention to what we say, particularly when we know that people 
listen to the debates and also read news originating in the House 
of Commons.  Often we tend to exaggerate the facts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the members of the Bloc Quebecois say that there has been 
so many cutbacks to employment insurance, that the government has 
accumulated a huge surplus to wipe out the deficit, they neglect 
to point out to the public that this is the same phenomenon as in 
all provinces.  This was a period of heavy recession, and all 
provinces, the country as well, were heavily in debt.  Each 
government, therefore, accumulated a larger operating deficit 
with every passing year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the deficit was $42 billion.  According to the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Canadian government should have borrowed still 
more money in order to pass it on to the provinces.  That is more 
or less the mechanics of it. The more our budgets increase, the 
more the deficit increases, the more we borrow; the more we 
borrow, the more interest we pay on the debt.  Asking the federal 
government to transfer tax points to the provinces, money to the 
provinces, when there is an operating deficit in excess of $42 
billion, is like asking it to borrow money on behalf of Canadians 
and then give it to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So a deficit at one place is increased in order to try to 
decrease it at another.  When things like this are said, care 
needs to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that there is still reference to our ranking 
25 out of 29 as far as social spending is concerned.  I do not 
dispute that ranking of 25 out of 29.  It refers to social 
spending, not the quality of services provided in Canada.  The 
quality of services provided to Canadians is not what is involved 
here. They say Canada ranks 25 out of 29 in terms of social 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When spending in Canada is being considered, all social 
spending by the provinces is added in as well, not just federal 
spending.  It is the total of spending in the country by each 
provincial government, plus federal spending, that makes up total 
social spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to reply to 
the member, and I hope he will listen carefully.  As they say in 
English “I will put his record straight”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has just mentioned the recession as a reason for EI cuts.  As 
it happens, I was my party's EI critic during this period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We noted that, although this system had had a deficit of only $2 
billion, and even though the federal government had pulled out of 
funding and active employment measures, responsibilities which 
should normally have been assumed by the government, the fund 
immediately turned around and started paying for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth was that the fund more than paid for itself, because 
benefits were cut and the government continued to collect 
premiums, knowing full well—and I have been told this by a 
senior official who is now with the OECD—what the fiscal impact 
of the cuts would be.  I said to him “But you did not know how it 
would affect people, the regions, the social impact.  It does not 
make sense that you knew and that you went ahead anyway”.  So, 
yes, it knew what the tax impact would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is true is that, for other spending, the government 
borrowed from the EI fund, which is made up of the contributions 
of ordinary citizens and SMBs.  That is the truth.  This is what 
it borrowed from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for social spending, Canada ranks 25 out of 29 OECD 
countries.  This includes provincial spending and that is why I 
mention this.  When the government cuts transfers to the 
provinces, this has an impact on all social spending, including 
that of the provinces. I am not interested in hearing that there 
can be differences like those among all the countries in Europe, 
which are the world leaders, and that Canada, which is in 25th 
position, could aspire to the same quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to social spending, we know that quality resides 
not just in equipment, but in people in all the forms of 
assistance, and the duration of assistance.  Take a look at the 
duration of unemployment insurance benefits in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I am sorry but, through this policy, Canada has completely 
and significantly altered the Canadian values he is talking 
about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to speak to my colleague's motion. According 
to this motion, the government should call a federal-provincial 
first ministers' conference to discuss the federal government's 
surpluses and a possible transfer of tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was practically unbelievable to hear members, such as the 
Liberal member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, mention in the House 
that there were deficits and that is why the federal 
government must no longer transfer tax points to provinces, when 
we have surpluses coming out of our ears. The federal government 
has $19 billion in surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of my Bloc Quebecois colleague—duly recognized by 
the member for Markham—who, on this day last year, estimated to 
within 2% the surpluses forecast by the Minister of Finance. 
Again, my colleague is announcing that next year the federal 
surpluses will still be $19 billion. I tend to believe him more 
than any other member in the House. He was the only one, and I 
thank him, to tell all Quebecers and all Canadians about the 
financial situation of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider most timely his motion that the government should 
call a federal-provincial first ministers' conference to discuss 
the federal surpluses of billions of dollars and a possible 
transfer of tax points to the provinces, which certainly need 
them, for a very simple reason. 
For all those Quebecers who are listening today, I say our 
quality of life is provided to us by the provinces and their 
various entities, including the municipalities. Here is what I 
mean by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health is the main factor that contributes to a person's quality 
of life, and health services are provided by the provincial 
government. The same goes for education. We all want our young 
people to have a good education so they can succeed in life, and 
education is a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also public safety; we all want to feel safe. There is 
water quality, water treatment, household garbage collection and 
disposal, these are all services provided by municipalities, as 
well as transportation. These factors that contribute to the 
quality of life of all Quebecers and Canadians depend on services 
provided by the provinces and municipalities, their entities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That quality of life has been severely compromised. Let us all 
remember the year 1992. That is when the federal government 
decided to make the most drastic cuts to transfers to provinces 
in Canadian history. In 1984, these transfers were at 23%; in 
1993, they were at about 20%. They were cut by nine percentage 
points over six years before going back up slightly. Now, about 
14% of Quebec spending comes from federal transfers. But let us 
not forget that when the health system was put in place, the 
federal government paid 50% of the cost. Now, it is down to just 
14%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we all remember the year 1992, the year 
when, perhaps to eliminate the accumulated deficit, the federal 
government decided to make drastic cuts in transfers to 
provinces. 
It is only fitting that we should be debating my colleague's 
motion today, at a time when the government will rake in, year 
in and year out, a $19 billion surplus. The Canadian government 
should convene the premiers to discuss the federal surpluses and 
to transfer tax points to improve the quality of life of 
Quebecers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should never forget that by 2008 health spending will have 
doubled in Quebec, from $10 billion today to $20 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health and education will take up over 45% of the provincial 
budget. If that is true in Quebec, it will be the same in all 
Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should understand that since 1992, the federal government has 
withdrawn some of its support to try to erase its huge 
accumulated deficit. This withdrawal had a domino effect in the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1992, they had to make cuts in health, education and 
transfers to municipalities. I am well aware of this because I 
was in municipal politics. Until last year, I was president of 
the Union des municipalités du Québec. 
Prior to 1992, none or very few of Quebec's municipalities 
submitted applications to the federal government.  They always 
managed to reach agreement with the government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the cuts in federal transfers to the provinces since 1992, 
a crisis has developed in Quebec involving the municipalities and 
the government of Quebec.  In the past few months, without any 
reason, and even though the municipalities are the creatures of 
the government of Quebec, we have heard  statements made by 
ministers outside the House and even in the House that 
consideration should be given to amending the Canadian 
constitution so that money may be transferred to the 
municipalities. This is rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not even capable of transferring 
the proper amounts to the provincial governments in order to 
resolve education and health care problems, and it is prepared, 
for purely political reasons, to transfer funds and consider 
amending the constitution in order to transfer funds to 
municipalities to help them settle their problems. Prior to 1992, 
they had no problem, they could deal with provinces one on one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, because of the cuts to transfers and because provinces have had 
to put most of the money they could get hold of into health and 
education, which are major expenses, over 45% of Quebec's 
budget and, because of the federal government's drastic cuts in 
transfers to the provinces, they barely manage to maintain the 
portion the federal government could send them.  Some of the small 
increases are nothing more than what they were getting before in 
federal subsidies to keep up with the cost of spending in each 
of these sectors.  But the federal government still maintains its 
share of approximately 14% of all spending on health care and 
education and other public services.  The federal government pays 
only 13.9% of spending on all these services in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I know, we pay 50% of our taxes to the federal 
government.  What does it do with our taxes?  Simple. 
It is maintaining an old age security system that has hardly been 
indexed. The government has not even been able to index the old 
age security system to the cost of living. But it is keeping an 
army. In Saint-Jean, Quebec, they closed a military base. In 
Quebec, we have the army, but they are closing military bases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to airports, we have discussed in the past, here in 
the House, the developments at the Mirabel and Dorval airports in 
Quebec, the transfer of flights from Quebec to Toronto. This is a 
federal decision. This is what the federal government is doing 
with Quebecers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can talk about research and development, because I come from 
the Outaouais region. There are 50 research and development 
centres in eastern Ontario. Until last year, we had one on the 
Quebec side in the Outaouais; the government shut it down. This is what the 
federal government is doing with Quebecers' money. It has decided 
to spend money on economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, in the transportation area in the last two years, 
$10 million out of the whole budget was spent in Quebec. We are 
talking about road infrastructures, with an annual budget of $100 
million. Only $10 million was spent in Quebec. Elsewhere in 
Canada, over 50% of the budget was spent in the maritime 
provinces to help Liberals win the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are always political decisions that go against Quebec's 
interests. I hope that Quebecers will have understood that since 
1992 it is Canada, through the most drastic cuts in its history, 
that has hurt the most the health and education systems of 
Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal member for Beauharnois—Salaberry said that we were 
in a recession and that this is why the federal government had 
been forced to rob the provinces and the employment insurance 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague tell us when the last recession ended? 
Could he also tell us whether, since then, the surpluses from the 
employment insurance fund have been used to eliminate the deficit 
or to increase the surpluses of the Minister of Finance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. We all know that the last economic recession 
ended several years ago. We hope that there will not be another 
one. 
The last recession ended in 1987. Since then, the surpluses 
from the employment insurance fund have belonged to the workers 
of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI fund has been an independent fund since 1996. 
Contributions are made directly by employers and employees. The 
federal government no longer makes any contribution. This is 
quite something, considering that out of the $19 billion in 
surpluses, my colleague estimates that $7.5 billion comes from 
the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill that was recently passed by the House to amend the 
Employment Insurance Act, the government will directly 
appropriate the $7.5 billion that belonged to the workers and 
employers of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money allows the government to boast, declare surpluses and 
profits and unilaterally decide to reduce the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards employment insurance, the Bloc Quebecois has always 
held the same position in the House: let workers and employers 
discuss and decide what they will do with an insurance plan to 
which they contributed for their own benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let these people discuss the issue among themselves. As for the 
rest of the surpluses, let us give a chance to the provincial 
premiers, as my colleague suggested, to get together and discuss 
the future of the huge surpluses that my colleague estimated so 
accurately once again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask my colleague if he believes that when Jean Charest is 
campaigning in favour of repatriating tax points to Quebec, it 
is because he is in favour of sovereignty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course we are not stupid. 
Tax points have been a longstanding claim in Quebec. I will not 
reiterate all the statements made by my colleagues in the House. 
It is an historical issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec is asking for tax points for all kinds of 
historical reasons, and one in particular that Quebecers and 
people in other provinces will understand. It is because the 
quality of life is ensured by the provinces. Health care, 
education, everything we can think about, such as public safety, 
national safety, water, water treatment, garbage collection, all 
these services are provided by the provinces and their 
creatures, the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason why the provinces are asking for their fair 
share, to assure the quality of life of the citizens of Quebec 
and Canada. To answer my colleague's question, there is a reason 
why, like his predecessors, the leader of the opposition in the 
Quebec national assembly is also asking the federal government 
to transfer to the provinces the tax points they deserve in 
order to meet their ever increasing expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that in Quebec health care expenses will double by 
2008. The same will happen in every other Canadian province. New 
technologies are extremely expensive. When the system was put in 
place the federal government paid 50% of the expenses and, 
today, it only pays 14%. This is the harsh reality of being part 
of a federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will answer the member for Markham that I believe he is 
becoming machiavellian with all the things he is dreaming up 
against Canadian unity. They are showing daily that Canada is 
less and less united. It is with reactions like the member for 
Markham's that people in Canada will understand that trying to 
bleed the provinces to death is not a solution, because they are 
the ones who are providing services ensuring the quality of life 
of their citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is like Yogi Berra saying déjà vu all over again. We 
do seem to be going at this once again.  The provincial premiers 
meet in Saskatchewan and their surrogates coincidentally rise up 
in the House in order to bash the federal government for not 
giving them enough money.  Some tunes never change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem for the party opposite is that no amount of money 
will ever be enough.  No amount of cash, no amount of tax points 
and no amount of equalization payments will ever be enough for 
the sponsors of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the premiers had their way, Canada would become a collection 
of independent principalities and the Prime Minister would be 
nothing more than a bill collector.  He would be in the rather 
unenviable position of having to phone up a Mike Harris or a 
Bernard Landry in order to get enough money to cover the expenses 
for the army.  By that time, of course, in their generosity it 
would probably look like nothing more than a glorified police 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts, however, are somewhat less prosaic.  Provincial 
revenues in the fiscal year 1999-2000 totalled $181 billion, as 
opposed to the federal government's share of revenues which was 
$161 billion.  Provincial revenues for the past 25 years have 
exceeded federal revenues regularly and consistently.  Maybe the 
Prime Minister should have a meeting with himself to see if he 
can get the revenue flowing the other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces do very well in this scheme of loose federalism 
and have virtually the same access to revenues as the federal 
government.  The major transfers from the federal government to 
the provinces are through the Canada health and social transfer 
in the form of tax points and cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally at this point eyes begin to glaze over because 
Canadians, and indeed I would suspect many members, do not 
understand tax points.  I have some sympathy in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of a tax point is room given by the federal 
government to the provincial governments in the tax system.  The 
federal government reduces its rate by a certain percentage in 
order to give provincial governments room to increase theirs 
accordingly.  The tax point transfers make no difference to the 
overall burden on taxpayers.  It is in fact a break even 
situation for all taxpayers.  The provinces increase their tax 
base at the expense of the federal government and presumably in 
Saskatchewan that is exactly what the premiers are trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax points are one of the means of transferring revenues to the 
provinces based upon the strength of their provincial economies. 
If, for instance, Ontario does well, the revenue from tax points 
will go up and the money will come into the federal treasury from 
the provincial taxpayer.  It does a U-turn and heads directly 
back to the provincial treasury.  The federal government merely 
acts as a collector of those funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the dark period of federal fiscal difficulties, the 
tax points remained sacred.  There was no reduction and there was 
no change.  Whatever the economy of the province generated, it 
immediately went back to the provincial treasury.  It is a very 
simple system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc is in the unique position of arguing that tax points do 
not exist, but if they do exist then they want more.  The head 
office in Quebec City has dictated today's motion, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should call a 
federal-provincial first ministers' conference for the purpose of 
reapportioning the tax base among the federal and provincial 
governments through the transfer of tax points. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we really believe that premiers want to apportion more tax 
points to the federal government?  Really, and I have some 
swampland in Florida. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, very handily, the Bloc manages to answer the motion by 
setting up Quebec's own commission.  It is called the commission 
on tax disparity.  I am grateful to my colleagues opposite who 
see no need for the debate, as they have already prejudged the 
issue simply by naming this commission the commission on tax 
disparity. What could be more clear?  It is always handy to 
arrive at one's own conclusion before stating a problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the year 2001-02 the provinces and territories will receive a 
total of $34 billion in tax points and cash, $15.7 billion in 
points and $18.3 billion in cash.  It is anticipated that there 
will be a 19% growth in tax points over the next three or four 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September the federal government committed itself to an 
additional cash transfer of $21.1 billion over five years. Having 
worked the federal government over for cash in September, it is 
now time to work the federal government over for tax points in 
May and June.  Some would argue that the Prime Minister becomes a 
head waiter for the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government does not retain some control over the 
cash, the provinces would never have any meaningful national 
health standards and we would be even further down the road to 
absurd levels of devolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's policy of transfers to the provinces is 
a balanced one.  The cash component is large compared to the tax 
transfer component.  This means that not only does our government 
preserve and enforce national standards but the provinces can 
rely on stable sources of revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not begin to address the equalization program that is 
now at an all time high at $10.8 billion of which, by the way, 
Quebec receives the lion's share.  In the province of Ontario the 
CHST accounts for something in the order of 18% to 20% of 
provincial revenues.  It has remained fairly steady over the 
years as Mr. Harris has chosen to reduce his revenue sources by 
his commitment to tax cuts in preference to all other 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various provincial governments make their own choices about 
spending versus tax relief and the federal government has little 
say, some would say thankfully, over those choices.  It is now a 
little hypocritical for the provinces to come along and say that 
they need more federal moneys because of their own decisions. 
Having worked the so-called CHST cash cow in September, namely 
the cash part of the CHST, we are now in May and we are trying to 
work the tax points part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has repeatedly said that there is no 
financial space for large initiatives.  The federal government 
debt is still quite enormous even after the $15 billion paydown 
this year.  The first $40 billion of all federal revenues 
immediately goes toward the interest payment on the debt.  If we 
took away another $34 billion for CHST transfers and cash, and 
added in another $11 billion in equalization, we would have 
precious little money left over for other programs, such as 
direct transfers to Canadians on matters like EI and pensions. 
Spending pressures for research and development, for on reserve 
aboriginals and for pensions would continue to be enormous in the 
short and medium terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces do very well in this very devolved federal state. 
Their revenues actually exceed the federal government's and their 
debts are less than those of the federal government.  The 
government already transfers over $40 billion to the provinces. I 
for one say that enough is enough and I urge hon. members to 
reject the motion.

so many outrageous claims have been made that it is hard to know 
where to begin and what questions to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have about 25 questions I could ask my colleague, but first I 
want to make a comment. We are not looking for handouts. When the 
member says: “The federal government would be transferring tax 
points at its own expense”, he has to understand that the federal 
government does not exist for its own purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the members opposite finally understand that the federal 
government does not exist for its own purposes; it is there to 
stand up for the people who have elected it and who have agreed 
to have it speak on their behalf in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government realize that there are people in Quebec and 
in Canada who need health, education or income support services, 
but that these services are provided by the provinces under the 
constitution itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it recognize that in the next four years, even with all the 
various federal programs mentioned earlier, like the pensions and 
also equalization, the federal government will still have 
accumulated surpluses of $70 billion to $90 billion?

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government thinks that there are no problems, it is the 
one with a problem. There is a major imbalance. The provinces 
have huge responsibilities, particularly in the area of health. 
My colleague was saying a little earlier that in eight years 
health care needs in Quebec will have doubled and the situation 
is the same in other provinces. We do not have the resources to 
face that. The resources are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not understand that the federation does 
not work that way, with a superior government, with members who 
consider themselves superior to others, above everything, above 
provinces and above the needs of the population, I think it is 
mistaken. Will it understand my point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking by this motion is a conference between the 
provincial premiers and the Prime Minister of Canada in order to 
see what the situation is and where we are heading. The Minister 
of Finance has acted in such a hypocritical way in the last 
seven years that we have never seen in what state the public 
finances really are. Every year it is a surprise. There are 
incredible surpluses and everything is going toward the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all for reducing the debt, but there is quite a 
difference between allocating to the debt part of the surplus 
and all of it when the needs of the population are so important. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague opposite 
seems to want to have it both ways.  He wants money to be 
transferred to provincial revenues and simultaneously he 
acknowledges that there is an enormous debt which needs to be 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He ignores quite nicely the earlier part of my speech in which I 
said that provincial revenues far exceed federal revenues by 
something in the order of at least $25 billion.  He ignores the 
fact that the provinces have virtually the same access to revenue 
sources as does the federal government.  He also ignores the fact 
that the equalization program is one of the few programs that did 
not get cut.  His province is the major beneficiary of that 
program to the detriment, I would argue, in some respects of 
other parts of the country.  It is probably the equalization 
moneys which have grown the most in the past number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can ignore all of these sorts of things.  We can live in this 
fantasy world where we want it both ways, but I say to my hon. 
colleague opposite that we cannot have it both ways.  We do have 
a nation.  The nation has needs from coast to coast to coast.  We 
on this side of the House will address those needs in a fair and 
balanced fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to make a comment. 
I am outraged when I hear what government members are saying. 
They make it sound like the collection of revenues is a race 
between the federal government and the provinces. The member says 
that since the provinces have more revenues than the federal 
government, the federal government should not give anything back 
to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wait just a minute. Provinces have more revenues but their 
responsibilities are greater. They are the ones with 
responsibilities, not the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the hon. member compare the provinces' responsibilities with 
those of the federal government? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in some respects I do not 
disagree with the hon. gentleman opposite, but he should be aware 
of the fact that provincial revenues last year were $181 billion 
and federal revenues were $166 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We transferred $34 billion to the provinces.  We transferred a 
further $11 billion to the provinces to address their legitimate 
and real needs and areas of responsibility.  I think in some 
respects that is balanced.  I welcome the member to federalism. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the debate that has 
just taken place, especially when the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot argued that the federal government speaks 
for itself.  In fact the federal government speaks for all 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point those sovereignists cannot quite get through 
their heads.  The member for Champlain mentioned a race and 
jurisdictions, but what he neglected to understand and to realize is 
that we have jurisdiction under the British North America Act and 
under Confederation for certain areas of responsibilities as do 
the provinces.  We have had a long and glorious history of being 
able to work that out through co-operation and flexibility and 
the good, sound judgment that has been used over the course of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be it tax points or outright cash when it comes to provincial 
moneys and resources, the federal government is part and parcel 
of how the federation works and underscores the commitment of the 
Liberal government to make the federation work in a very 
meaningful and sound way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot talked about the finance 
minister being hypocritical and how he was stealing from the EI 
fund.  Unparliamentary or not, both those statements are 
absolutely wrong.  On the contrary, we have seen the present 
finance minister making adjustments by getting rid of the 
deficit, paying down the debt and giving balanced tax breaks and 
money back for important reinvestment initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That underscores the commitment of the government to all 
provinces and territories in this great country of ours.  It 
behoves us to think about these things from time to time to bring 
us back to clear thinking and balance because that is what the 
government has been able to do since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us is of some interest, but it is of more 
interest to the sovereignists in Quebec City.  It is no secret 
that Pauline Marois, the finance minister and Premier Landry have 
made it a habit in recent months to come hammering once again at 
the door of the federal government.  All I see are the 
sovereignists opposite, the Bloc in this case, being kind of head 
waiters for them, simply bringing their plea to Ottawa and almost 
acting, unfortunately, as a branch plant of Quebec City for the 
separatists and the sovereignists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, there are some genuinely important issues that we 
need to clear up in the debate.  For example, we should note that 
this has a long history since 1977 when the first tax point 
transfer was implemented.  There was a new agreement at that time 
called established programs financing, EPF.  It helped with 
education and health in those days.  At that time $13.5 billion 
of personal income tax points were given over to the provinces as 
well as $1 billion in corporate tax points.  We can see the 
beginnings of the federal government assisting in this tax point 
area along with cash as well which people always want and 
provinces especially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that I find unacceptable is the fact that the 
sovereignists, the Bloc and some of the provinces seem to think 
that tax points are not equal to cash, are somehow not as good as 
cash, or somehow do not provide the cash required.  In reality 
tax points are equal to, as good as and similar in that sense to 
cash.  In German one would say <I>macht nichts aus</I>.  It is the 
same thing. It is half a dozen of one, six of the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We keep giving tax points and cash, but why do we do it?  We do 
it because we are in a fiscally sound federation. We understand 
there are needs that the provinces and territories require, 
especially in their areas of jurisdiction.  The two that 
obviously come to mind very quickly are health and education. 
That is why for example in 1996-97 we established the Canada 
health and social transfers.  That is part of the kind of effort 
the government is prepared to make to ensure that we do the right 
thing when it comes to our great federation.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that all tax points are resources that flow to the 
provinces.  No matter which way we want to cut it, dice it or 
slice it, the fact remains those are resources to the provinces. 
I want to point out too that under the CHST in recent years, the 
ceiling was established at $11 billion in 1996.  It went up to 
$12.5 billion in 1998, and in 1999 an additional $11.5 billion 
over five years was added.  The CHST cash portion in the year 
2000 was $15.7 billion.  By the year 2005-06, that will represent 
$21 billion, which in straight mathematical terms, is a 35% 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That represents a government commitment to ensure that money, 
when we are in a surplus situation, be it tax points or cash, is 
transferred in a meaningful way to the provincial and territorial 
partners.  We do that to ensure that the federation works in a 
way that Canadians, wherever they live in this great country, 
think is appropriate and right and enjoy the fruits of the 
surplus situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax transfers provide provinces with additional revenue 
which increases as a result of economic growth.  Those tax 
transfers have increased sixfold since 1977-78.  That is an 
enormous increase and represents the growing flexibility and 
ability of the provinces to make sure the transfers are used in 
their jurisdictions in a way that makes the most sense for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By using a mathematical formula, it is projected to the year 
2005-06, that the tax transfers will rise to $18.9 billion, which 
represents a 19% increase over that period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that this is great news for the provinces and 
territories in terms of what we are doing by way of federal 
transfers, either points or cash.  It underscores the commitment 
of our government to ensure that things go along in a manner 
consistent with Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To recap, it is very important to note that in the year 2001-02, 
which we are in now, $34 billion will be transferred under the 
CHST. That represents $15.7 billion under tax transfers and 
another $18.3 billion in cash, for a total of $34 billion.  No 
matter which way we look at it, and Canadians understand, this is 
a lot of money that our federal government is prepared to give to 
the provinces so they can put in place the kinds of resources 
that the people in those provincial and territories want, need 
and demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our government commitment to ensure that kind of balanced 
approach.  Balance, after all, is the key, not twisting it out of 
joint in one way or the other.  Rather balance it out to have the 
flexibility inherent in good programming and sound fiscal 
judgment so the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and whole 
caucus on the Liberal side are able to deliver repeatedly in 
these all important areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply have to shake my head when I look at the motion.  Of 
course it is Bloc members trying to play games.  They are taking 
their marching orders as usual from Monsieur Landry and others 
who are intent on destroying this great country of ours. However, 
they neglect to remember that the country represents solid good 
governance and a good economy that has been good for all people 
no matter where they live.  It has provided employment, good 
salaries and good jobs for people.  At the end of the day 
individuals, families, communities and whole provinces and 
territories have benefited as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should rejoice in that because it is the very essence of what 
our government is able to deliver.  That is the very essence of 
who we are as Canadians, underscoring our values and judgments to 
make sure that Canadians wherever they live benefit as a result 
of our good, solid judgment.

we have heard many inaccuracies in what the hon. member opposite

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in terms of tax points transferred during the 1960s and

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, mainly during the second world war, had 
asked the provinces to give up their jurisdiction over personal 
income tax. The provinces, including Quebec, agreed as their 
contribution to the war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the constitution, which our colleague opposite says he 
respects, the federal government should never have had this 
jurisdiction. The federal government stole it from the provinces, 
because it refused to give it back to them after the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, it was during the 1964 constitutional 
conference in Quebec City, between Mr. Pearson and Mr. Lesage, 
and the 1977 conference, which was held with all provinces, that 
the federal government decided to give back a part of what it had 
stolen from provinces, as their contribution to the war effort, 
in the area of personal income tax, inheritance tax and corporate 
tax. These areas were not under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says that constitutional jurisdictions must be 
respected, but how does he explain, apart from that, another 
undeniable fact? During the last four years, namely since the 
federal government has been raking in huge surpluses with other 
people's money, it has exponentially multiplied its encroachments 
on jurisdictions that are exclusively provincial, like education, 
health, early childhood and the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that this member, a federal member, a government 
member, cannot understand the facts? He has just talked about 
principles that go against the practice of the past four years. 
The transfer of tax points during the 1960s and the 1970s was 
done as a matter of justice for the provinces, which had 
generously accepted to lend a jurisdiction which was exclusively 
theirs under the constitution. Will the hon. member, a superior 
member of a supposedly superior Canada, understand that? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we can get into a great 
history lesson.  We can go back to Sir Robert Borden in 1917 and 
talk about the temporary income tax.  We can talk about Lester 
Pearson and Jean Lesage until we are blue in the face, but the 
reality remains, despite the member opposite not seeing it nor 
would he ever want to, the government does not step in on other 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a solid, sound record of respecting other 
jurisdictions; Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, I can 
name any and we respect them.  We make sure the divisions of 
power are inherent, unlike the Bloc members opposite who want to 
rip apart the federation.  They want to destroy the jurisdiction. 
They want to keep chipping away every time and every way they can 
to bring Canada down yet another notch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those on this side and most Canadians, including 
Quebecers, who will have no part of that.  They want to get with 
other things such as providing food, shelter and clothing for 
their children.  They want to get with the business of carving 
out good lives for themselves, whether they live in Baie-Comeau, 
St. John's, Newfoundland or Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wherever they live respect the integrity of the 
government's ability to put us on a sound fiscal good judgment 
basis, and as a result provide good government and in the process 
give the tax points and cash transfers required for the provinces 
to carry out their jurisdictional responsibilities in areas like 
the environment, health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect to everyone involved, the beauty of this 
great federation is our ability to manage, be flexible and do the 
kinds of things Canadians want, wherever they live in this great 
country, a country that others in the world respect and say is 
second to none.  That is what we do on a constant basis.  Why do 
we do it?  We do it for our families, our neighbours, our 
communities and our country.  At the end of the day that is 
precisely what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go off on tangents all we want in terms of too much power 
here or too much power there.  The reality is, the federation has 
proven itself time and time again to work and work effectively. 
Is it perfect?  No one ever said it was.  Is it right all the 
time?  No one ever argued it was.  The reality is, this is a 
federation second to none in the world, worth celebrating, worth 
boasting about and worth defending.  This side of the House will 
do it every time.

people losing their homes.

the House are looking at ways to assist in this very problematic 
area.  We understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to the issue of tax points and tax credits. 
The member's party opposite would give up the store.  If we read 
its election platform, that party would give it all away to the 
provinces.  It would have Canada reduced to a shell.  Those 
members want provincial jurisdiction in everything, and that is 
unfortunate.  Canadians have and will continue to reject that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to briefly congratulate the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for 
raising such an interesting and important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future—we are talking mainly about the present—of this 
federation, which the members opposite think handles finances so 
well, is shaky. The money collected by the federal government 
must be redistributed to the provinces, which are responsible for 
health, education and municipalities.  These are responsibilities 
of the provinces and of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the federal government keeps on building up its surplus and 
distributing the money to the rich rather than giving it back to 
the provinces.  I say that it is distributing it to the rich 
because, when it uses the surplus to pay down the debt too 
quickly, this is not money that goes to the poor, but money that 
goes to the rich.  When the surplus is used to lower taxes, as 
was done last fall, this is money that has been taken away from 
the least well off, taxpayers, and redistributed to the richest 
members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, following the mini budget, which became the main 
budget, I had my accountant do two calculations for me. I wanted 
to know what two 35 year old men, one earning $33,000 a year and 
one earning $100,000 a year, would save in taxes as a result of 
the new budget.  The man earning $33,000 a year saved 
approximately $300 annually in taxes.  The one earning $100,000 a 
year, or three times more, saved seven times more in taxes, 
around $2,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is a fair distribution of money in a society that claims 
to look out for the poor, that says it wants to help low wage 
earners, some questions are in order.  When members opposite say 
that they are right to take pride in how they are running this 
country, I have my concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government takes $36 billion out of the EI fund 
and gives people to understand that the money belongs to it, we 
should be worried.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance fund is paid into by workers, and also 
in part by employers.  I have been an employer.  What do 
employers do when setting salaries, when looking at the payroll a 
company can pay out?  They take salaries plus benefits, plus the 
employer's portion of payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long run, employment insurance is entirely paid by the 
workers, because if there were no employment insurance, they 
would be paid a little more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear justifications like the one provided earlier in 
response to the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, whereby 
talking about grab in reference to the employment insurance fund 
is misleading the public, I disagree.  In my opinion, that is a 
precise and accurate description of what the government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money paid into it by the low wage earners has been used to 
build up a surplus.  Year after year, this continues to be done, 
at the rate of some $6 billion yearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A worker who has trouble making ends meet sees part of his pay 
taken regularly to be added to the federal government's surplus 
and distributed later to those least in need of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion being discussed today is one that relates to respect 
and honesty. As long as Quebec is part of this system, it is 
normal for part of the taxes we pay to the federal government to 
come back to us to help us—Quebec and the other provinces too, 
it is true—to deliver the services provided by the government of 
Quebec and the governments of the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is a provincial area of jurisdiction.  Health is a 
provincial area of jurisdiction.  The municipalities are a 
provincial jurisdiction.  So now we see the federal government 
giving some money back.  They are congratulating themselves 
because, within a few days of the last election, an agreement was 
reached in the health field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what was the cost of this negotiation?  How much did it cost 
in terms of time and energy?  What progress has been made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did we get what the federal government was supposed to be giving 
us in the area of health care? No. We have figures that show that 
the federal government is now paying about 14 cents for each 
dollar spent in the health care area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, this is a debate that should not even 
be taking place. People say that the federation is working 
properly. The member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has just said 
that, in the beginning, in the federal system, the tax points 
belonged to the provinces. If we have made our contribution to 
the war effort, and if all the provinces have done so, the tax 
points should be given back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has not been done so that, every year, regularly, people 
would have to come here to get what is owed to them, and to get 
it the way the federal government agrees to give it to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example. In the area of education, the government 
decided to set up the millennium scholarship fund. This is 
unbelievable. Roughly $2 billion has been put into this fund, in 
an area that is not under federal jurisdiction but rather under 
provincial jurisdiction. Moreover, the government has asked 
unelected people to manage the fund and it found a way, ignoring 
provincial responsibilities, to give out scholarships, when we 
had very good scholarship programs in Quebec. It could simply 
have given the money to the Quebec government, which is 
responsible for education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no, it found a way to ignore provincial responsibilities. It 
found a way to play petty politics. It found a way to interfere 
in areas under provincial jurisdiction, to play petty politics 
with money that belongs to the provinces. It is even going one 
step further in Quebec, right now.

adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca, Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon: </B>Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the 
floor again, but not for interrupting me. Once one has begun to 
speak, it would be nice to be able to go on uninterrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking about provincial jurisdictions. To exercise their 
responsibilities, the provinces need money, particularly the 
money which we send to the federal government and which should 
come back to us. If there were any semblance of political decency 
here, we would not need a motion such as this one. This 
reapportionment should be done as a matter of fact. When there 
are surpluses at the federal level, they should go back to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member opposite said that the federal government is assuming 
its responsibilities. Let me tell him something. As far as the 
environment goes, things are not pretty in Quebec, because the 
federal government just does not assume its responsibilities. 
Right now, we are trying to have clean up Lac Saint-Pierre, which 
has been polluted by Canadian army shells. This is under federal 
jurisdiction. We have been asking for this clean-up for years, 
but to no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to solve the problem along the shores of the St. 
Lawrence, which are being eroded. Land is being lost to erosion 
because of transportation. This is under federal jurisdiction, 
but nothing is being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The groundwater in Shannon, in La Baie and in Sept-Îles has been 
polluted. That is also under federal jurisdiction, but it will 
have to wait. The federal government likes to order studies, but 
it does not implement the recommendations. It says the problems 
have been taken care of because it has decided to distribute 
bottled water, and we should just forget about groundwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the federal government's responsibilities is to give back 
the money to the provinces for education, for health and for 
municipalities. We must stop having to beg on our knees, having 
to distribute flags to receive a part of the money that is 
rightfully ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to Quebecers that, with respect to the $33 billion in 
taxes that we pay to the federal government, I hope this problem 
will be solved as quickly as possible. In the meantime, out of 
this $33 billion federal surplus, some money must be given back 
to us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that today's debate, which is aimed at getting together 
the 10 provincial premiers and the federal Prime Minister to 
discuss tax points once again, is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for justice and honesty, an hon. member, who is a 
knowledgeable economist, said earlier that the Bloc Quebecois' 
discussion about this motion will diminish the value of the 
federal government for the provinces. If the importance of the 
federal government is diminished, it is not because of a motion 
such as this one, it is because of the government's behaviour. 
If Quebecers find more and more that Quebec has less and less 
space and that its future is increasingly doomed here in Ottawa, 
it is not because of the discussion that we are proposing today. 
Rather, it is because of the way the federal government has 
worked and continues to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that when we began talking about sovereignty 
for Quebec, about 20% of Quebecers were considering that option. 
We never lost any ground. At the last referendum, 49.4% of 
Quebecers voted in favour of sovereignty. Had it not been for the 
money spent in violation of Quebec's laws to bring people to 
Montreal to tell us how much they loved us, support for 
sovereignty would have exceeded 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec never wavered in its desire to stop begging, as we are 
doing, for the money that is owed to us. Quebec knows that 
someday, and that day is closer than some might think, we will 
exceed 50% and we will settle our issues among ourselves, 
because this is how it should be done in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the motion presented by the Bloc Quebecois today that 
makes me say this. It is a logical conclusion, it is the way to 
go for a people that will then fulfil its dream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, it would in the best interests of the federal 
government to discuss today's motion, to call a 
federal-provincial first ministers' conference and to look at the 
possibility of reapportioning tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the nasty PQ and BQ members who are asking that, 
but also the leader of the opposition in Quebec. All the Quebec 
governments, regardless of their allegiance, have always asked 
to recover these tax points so as to not be forced to beg and 
kowtow to get money for health, education, municipalities and 
everything that comes under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Sudbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
blackmail.  It is really something to hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Bloc Quebecois is the one involved in petty 
politics.  I have sat in this House for a long time.  I recall 
the time we had large deficits.  While we had them the Bloc 
members, the sovereignists, said “We have to leave this country 
because it is not working.  You can see it is not working”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have surpluses.  Things are very different.  The 
surplus belongs to them.  What blackmail.  We should not repay 
our debt, we should send all the money to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but I have always thought that when we repaid our 
debt we would avoid a lot of interest over the long term. We will 
have a lot more manoeuvring room than what we had before if we 
can pay the debt.  Let us not forget there are tax points and 
cash transfers.  We are maintaining a balance.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax points do not have the same value in each province.  A 
balance must be struck.  It is also important to be able to 
defend the things Canadians hold dear, such as the Canada Health 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to work with the provinces, despite the Bloc 
Quebecois' blackmail.  It is always the same thing.  When it is a 
matter of tax points, it is very important.  However, when it 
suddenly is a matter of transfers to the provinces,  they forget 
the tax points.  Cash is the only subject of discussion.  They 
say, “we have enough”.  They play little games.  It is not 
playing these little games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we sit down together and work, we can do extraordinary 
things.  We did it when we balanced the budgets.  We have done 
this with all Canadians, not just some of them.  This is very 
important for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know why they absolutely do not want the government to 
pay the debt.  Do they think we will get ahead of ourselves?  I 
think they are here for one thing alone, and that is to break up 
this country.  It is not perfect, but it works pretty well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, the hon. member must 
know a lot about blackmail, because the federal government she is 
a member of is certainly very apt in this area. It is 
blackmailing the people of Quebec with the way it is 
allocating the money and the conditions it sets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the debt is concerned, nobody said that we should not pay 
it off. We said that we need to seek some balance. We maintain 
that the $33 billion the government took from the EI account 
should not be used to pay off the debt. That money was paid by 
the workers, by only one segment of society, and not by society 
at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that the money the government is taking from the poor 
should not all be spent to pay off the debt, because the debt was 
not incurred by the poorest of the poor. We need some balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax points we are asking for are only what the government 
has taken away from the provinces. We only get 14 cents per 
dollar for health when a few years back we were getting 50 cents 
per dollar. With less and less money, provinces have to find a 
way to maintain the health system, while the federal government 
uses the money to pay off the debt. It is unfair. We want 
balance. The debt has to be paid off, but let us not forget that 
there is only one taxpayer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
say that is a speech I have been hearing ever since I was 
elected in 1981 to the Quebec national assembly, of which my 
hon. colleague was also a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if the same record were played over and over. All the 
faults in the world lie with the federal government: it is 
monopolistic, it grabs all the tax points, it keeps all the 
money in Ottawa, it sends nothing to the provinces et cetera. I 
have heard that so many times that a time comes when it feels 
like backsliding. It goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member a question. The federal government is 
grabbing, it is centralizing, it keeps all the money here and it 
gives no power to the provinces. What strikes me, as a Quebec 
citizen, is that the current Quebec government, which is 
responsible for municipalities, has passed the tax bill on to 
municipalities a few years ago, without any consultation. 
It has fobbed that off to municipalities which had to cope with 
it. There were signs in every municipality saying: “We do not 
want to take on your debts”. Then it passed the debt on to the 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, that same government is merging municipalities without 
any consultation. It has imposed legislation across the board. 
Today, in hospitals under its control, in all the hospital 
centres, the legislation has been changed so that members of the 
boards of trustees will no longer be elected because they say 
that people do not bother to vote.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Quebec will be appointing the board members. 
This is the irony of it all. For example, the members of the 
board of the Jewish hospital will be appointed by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what provincial decentralization is all about. It is the 
model— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I understand there is a 
debate, but I would hope that when one member is speaking, the 
others will listen. Their turn will come. When two or three hon. 
members are talking at the same time, it is very hard for me to 
hear and even harder to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln: </B>Mr. Speaker, I was asking my colleague, 
for whom I have much respect—we were together in the national 
assembly—if that was the model he wanted, the most centralized 
model of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about federal centralization here, about the most 
decentralized state in the world, including Switzerland. Is it 
the Quebec model that we want, a model that centralizes 
municipalities, that centralizes hospital boards since it will 
now appoint its members? Before long, everything will be 
centralized in Quebec and everything will be conducted by the 
government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I prefer this federal model where everything is decentralized 
and where we can at least discuss the issue and hon. members can 
have their say— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Champlain has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Lac-Saint-Louis 
brings back good memories. Indeed, we had this type of debate in 
the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he thinks that I have not changed my tune, I will tell him 
that federalism has not changed either. The problems are still 
the same. I was talking about how the idea of sovereignty was 
gaining ground in Quebec; in 1970, we were at 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member was in the national assembly with me, there was 
a referendum and we got about 39%. In the last referendum, we 
almost won. Why? Because federalism has not evolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that a great prime minister supposedly once said, “We 
are putting our head on the block to announce that changes will 
be made to the federal system if you vote no”. We saw the kind of 
changes we got. It was a step back for Quebec. Do not worry, 
there is progress toward Quebec sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the Quebec government, personally I am proud of 
what it can do, considering the fact that the federal government 
has constantly reduced the funding Quebec needed for hospitals, 
municipalities, health care and education. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to take part in this debate with my 
Bloc Quebecois colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time there is a debate with the Bloc Quebecois, I find 
myself in a difficult position. I certainly like the spirit and 
the passion of Bloc Quebecois members, but I have great 
difficulty accepting their ideas. I am a partisan of 
centralization and government intervention. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this issue today I could not be further away from where the 
Bloc Quebecois stands.  I come from a city, downtown Toronto, 
that every year sends $38 billion to the treasury of Canada. 
There is not a day that passes when I do not have municipal 
councillors and provincial members of parliament phoning me, 
sending letters or calling my office to say they are not getting 
their fair share in Toronto. 
They say Ontario is not getting its fair share from the national 
government.  Just the greater Toronto area alone last year 
received $38 billion.  This is a tremendous sum of money.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my friends in the Bloc that I came to this place 
because I believe that this Chamber is to take all the money that 
comes from the communities that are doing well, from Toronto, 
Vancouver or Alberta, and distribute that money in a fair and 
equal manner.  We are here to do that so that we can build a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that it is incumbent upon all of us in the Chamber to 
be like the Speaker was at one time, a referee.  We are the 
referees of that tremendous sum of money that comes to us.  We 
are here to make sure that if there are special circumstances, 
and I do not care which province it is, where there are 
difficulties, when remote regions need extra support, whether it 
is for infrastructure or for certain unforeseen situations, we 
are here to use the treasury of Canada to treat every region of 
the country in a fair way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me, the notion of further decentralizing the Chamber is just 
out of the question.  In fact I would say with respect to many of 
my own colleagues in the executive of the government, that they 
have gone way too far in decentralizing the national government. 
I think that at times we have gone further to the right than the 
previous prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was ever a moment in time when we needed to rethink the 
fiscal framework of the country and the distribution of funds to 
the provinces, it is this moment.  It should not be evolving 
more.  It should be reclaiming some of that responsibility.  It 
should be bringing it back so that we are in a position to reach 
out to those people in our communities who are most 
disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say to the members opposite and to the esteemed 
finance critic of the Bloc Quebecois that in our province right 
now we have a provincial premier who is very solid in his 
position.  We have a very difficult position with affordable 
housing.  We cannot get our federal-provincial relationship going 
in trying to get affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the House announced on March 5 that $500 million 
was to go to the farmers of the country.  As of this moment that 
money has not been distributed because the federal-provincial 
agreements have not been worked on and have not been signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as national members of parliament should have a mechanism to 
use when the provinces are not co-operating with us in the 
national interest, especially where low income Canadians are not 
being served.  I think we should intervene, we should go direct, 
in order to solve those problems.  It is for that reason that I 
do not think we should devolve any more dollars or tax points 
other than what is the basic amount now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to bring up a very important case for the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois and its finance critic.  The hon. member has a 
situation right now that exists in his province just outside of 
Montreal on the Kahnawake reserve.  It is the Mohawk Internet 
technology park.  The situation there is that our first nations 
people are trying desperately to become part of the mainstream 
economy.  They have hired expert advice and are attempting to 
become part of the main economy of Montreal, Quebec.  Their own 
province is walking away from support.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
immediately amend the Criminal Code to create a separate category 
of offences and punishments for computer hackers and persons who 
wilfully or maliciously export computer viruses, both of whose 
activities disrupt the normal conduct of electronic business in 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I decided I would join this debate because of an interesting 
first hour that was concluded a couple of weeks ago.  I noticed 
during that debate that the government side at first did not put 
up any speakers.  It put up a couple of speakers right at the end 
and more or less said the whole thing was silly because there 
were already areas of the criminal code that dealt with the 
issue.  Those speakers quoted areas of the criminal code that 
were introduced in 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing that struck me was that governments have never 
been known for their forward looking legislation.  How could it 
be that way back in 1985, when a lot of people did not even know 
what a computer was, the government had such a far seeing 
attitude to legislation that they incorporated something in the 
criminal code to take care of computer viruses that would not 
appear until the year 2000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took a closer look at this and am not quite sure what the 
government's motives are.  The way the government is approaching 
the motion is to say there is no need for it because it can be 
covered by the area of the criminal code that deals with 
mischief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What sort of deterrent is it to hackers and people who propagate 
viruses on the Internet that they might be prosecuted for 
mischief?  Even if the penalty, a maximum of 10 years, is 
reasonable it does not carry any feeling of deterrence when it is 
called mischief.  It is mischief to call it mischief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very serious crimes.  The fact that the private 
members' business committee, which determines whether or not a 
motion will be votable, determined that this motion will be 
votable indicates to me that the committee considers this a very 
serious topic.  The government members present, who dominate that 
committee, obviously felt there was nothing in the criminal code 
that dealt with the issue in enough detail that it should be 
dismissed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then have the evidence that the member who proposed the 
motion gave in his speech.  He said that police are frustrated 
because they too feel that the present provisions of the criminal 
code do not deal with the issue.  They are faced with charging 
people with mischief instead of charging people with something 
that has a much more serious connotation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would request that the government take a closer look at the 
position it is taking on the issue and at its motives.  What are 
its motives for not wanting to include something a little more 
specific that would act as a deterrent, that could be used by the 
police if they were talking to somebody suspected of being 
involved in this sort of crime?  Instead of simply calling it 
mischief, police should be able to tell such people that section 
such and such of the criminal code deals with what they are doing 
and that they are putting themselves into a position where they 
could be subject to prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us who have become used to working on computers over the 
last few years would have had some sort of experience with 
hacking or computer viruses.  I have had experience with both.  I 
have a computerized database set up between my riding and the 
Hill.  I do not use Microsoft Access which is the most common 
system here.  I use a program called Maximizer which co-ordinates 
the databases among my riding, my laptop computer and Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am on a flight from Vancouver to Ottawa I type up my next 
report for the <I>North Shore News</I>, a local newspaper.  When I 
get to Ottawa I simply go to a telephone line and, using dial-up 
networking, update my main office in Vancouver with whatever I 
have done.  That office is called the Superpeer.  It updates 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These activities go on all through the day.  It happens 
automatically every night, but through the day we can force these 
updates.  At any time I have three complete databases which 
contain all the information about all the contacts we have had 
with constituents over the years, every letter we have ever 
written, every fax we have ever sent and every e-mail we have 
ever sent.  It is all in these three different places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because part of that is done through dial-up networking, some 
hacker trying to find phone lines with computers on the end of 
them found one of my computers in Vancouver and tried to hack 
into our system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Luckily we had a pretty good firewall set up so no problem was 
caused.  However the opportunity exists for someone to do it. Our 
records from the computer indicate that somebody dialled in a 
number of times and spent up to two hours trying to break into 
our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is serious.  It was not just a passing, spur of the moment 
thing that someone did.  It was a concerted effort to break in 
perhaps without even knowing what computer it was.  Presumably 
they knew it was a federal government computer because the 
telephone number in Vancouver started with 666.  Incidentally 
many people say that number is appropriate for the federal 
government in that 666 is the sign of the devil or the sign of 
the beast.  They must have known it was a federal government 
computer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one experience.  Luckily it did not turn out too badly. 
However I had another experience.   I brought my laptop to the 
Hill and connected to the network one day last year before the 
last election.  Somehow a virus had got into the Library of 
Parliament system and it got on to my computer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that stage I did not have an updated InocuLAN.  We all have 
InocuLAN virus detection on our systems, but I did not have the 
updated version.  The virus ran amok on my computer.  It took 
about three days to get it rectified.  It was very serious. Thank 
goodness I had the other two databases in Ottawa and North 
Vancouver so that we were able to erase what was on my computer 
and start again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are serious problems.  They are not just mischief.  They 
are not something that can be covered by the section of the 
criminal code that the government spouts, something that was 
passed back in 1985, a catch-all phrase to catch little bits and 
pieces that might be a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a deterrent, something that can be publicized in the 
media saying that parliament has passed a law respecting a 
certain section of the criminal code so that anyone launching a 
virus or attempting to hack into a computer is subject to a 
penalty and a fine.  To do something more substantial like that 
is a much better idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance we should support the motion.  It was made votable 
for a good reason.  It is tough to get motions and private 
members' bills made votable.  The member achieved it in this 
case.  We should support what he is proposing and try to get an 
extra line or two into the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I say again that I do not understand the 
government's motives.  How hard can it be to pop something into 
one of the omnibus bills it has coming through here?  It could 
add an extra line to the criminal code.  It does it all the time, 
so what is the problem?  I hope government members will rise 
today and tell us exactly why they have a problem in this regard. 
If they cannot come up with a good reason they should be voting 
for Motion No. 80.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was unable to make it here at the appropriate time and 
I thank you and the House for providing me this opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to debate the private member's motion in the 
name of my colleague from Saskatoon—Humboldt.  It would create a 
separate category of criminal offences for computer hackers or 
people who wilfully disrupt the conduct of electronic business in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a minor introduction to this type of criminal activity for 
approximately one year when I was with the Calgary police 
department investigating commercial crime.  It seemed then like 
it was catch up.  The electronic media or communications aspect 
was growing at such a rate that police agencies across the 
country were not on the cutting edge of attempting to curb this 
illegal activity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT90"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT90"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1730

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is the way it always will be.  Communication is 
expanding at such a rate that it will always leave the agencies 
behind even though they will try to put the necessary resources 
into performing their investigations.  However the resources 
required to conduct investigations into electronic criminal 
offences will be horrendous.  I believe it would have to 
certainly be looked at from a national level.  National police 
agencies and national agencies of all kinds should and must get 
involved to counter it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few days ago I bought a little instrument called a 
BlackBerry.  Little did I know just how effective these 
instruments were.  It is like carrying a computer around with me 
everywhere I go.  Yes, I feel very high tech right now.  It is 
strapped to my side.  I am afraid to take it off as I might bleed 
to death.  It really is quite an instrument.  I can e-mail to any 
computer, definitely in North America, from this very small 
hand-held device.  I can send and receive messages from the palm 
of my hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other intriguing thing about this particular instrument is 
that it is a Canadian innovation.  It just shows how wireless 
communication systems are encroaching upon just about every form 
of activity we have.  It allows Canadians and others easier 
access to one another even though they may be thousands of miles 
away, in differing venues or circumstance.  Students in Victoria 
can research information at a library in Prince Edward Island or 
Toronto as easily as they can in their hometown.  Seniors can 
make daily contact with their grandchildren living at the other 
end of the earth for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the BlackBerry, it just went off on my side, so 
somebody right now is sending me a message.  It is certainly not 
within this House, so it could be from almost anywhere.  It is 
all written text.  It is quite a unique device. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This business has been revolutionized to the nth degree.  The 
speed of this communication certainly is not going to slow down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point that brings focus to electronic endeavours, or 
intrigue, is online marketing and the fact that we can bank with 
these machines.  There is no question that with all of this 
access there will be fraud.  It just seems more certain than not 
that fraudulent activity will take place as the electronic world 
develops at a pace that is almost unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet has become the essential tool for Canadian 
businesses and consumers, so it poses a serious security problem 
for all involved.  As more and more companies and government 
agencies computerize and network confidential databases, the 
privacy of Canadians is increasingly put at risk by hackers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not too long ago when I heard that even police 
departments and the military had their computers entered 
illegally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very significant concern when we start looking at 
confidential security matters.  As more Canadians use the 
Internet and more businesses collect increasing amounts of 
information, the security problems I have pointed out will 
increase.  That is why this is an area where the government needs 
to step in.  The current criminal code revisions are simply not 
strong enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's motion seeks to have the government introduce a 
bill that would provide specific provisions in the criminal code 
which police could use to charge people engaged in either hacking 
or exporting computer viruses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague that the penalty for such acts should 
be quite severe.  Malicious damage and manipulation of computer 
networks and databases should be treated as theft and vandalism. 
It is a deliberate attack on someone else's property and a threat 
to the privacy of all Canadians.  These are serious offences.  It 
is no different than physically breaking into someone's home or 
business and rummaging through their files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should do what we can do to ensure that Canadians gain unique 
benefits from the Internet, while knowing that there is a 
sufficient legal framework in place to protect them from unwanted 
intrusions.  I urge all hon. members to support Motion No. 80. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Clearly the House has rules about 
props.  I am not sure about commercials yet.  That is something 
we will have to research further. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt on his private member's motion. Before I deal 
with the substance of the motion, I would like to make a comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read the remarks of the sponsor of the motion. He 
reminded us that, besides the debate he wants to initiate on 
computer hacking, we need to discuss the private members' 
business process. It is not normal that mere chance should 
determine how and when members will be able to introduce bills or 
motions. 
It is a lottery system that determines which business will be 
selected for the consideration by the House. The same system 
determines also which motions will be made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that system has to be reviewed. In fact, we had a debate 
in the House on this very issue on a Tuesday night, in April if I 
am not mistaken. I hope the House leaders from every party will 
examine the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that the Bloc Quebecois can support this motion 
as it stands now. I say this regretfully, because we are always 
favourably disposed, in principle, toward private members' 
business. That is the opportunity, in the system, to stress 
initiative. In spite of what the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Solicitor General may think, we are always favourably disposed, 
in principle, toward private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the opportunity, in our parliamentary system, to 
encourage members' initiatives and also to distance ourselves, 
which is critical, from the executive and Cabinet, which, as we 
know, often plays an inordinate role in our parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For purposes of clarity, I would like to reread the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
immediately amend the Criminal Code to create a separate category 
of offences and punishments for computer hackers and persons who 
wilfully or maliciously export computer viruses, both of whose 
activities disrupt the normal conduct of electronic business in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first read the motion, I said to myself that it made 
sense. We all know that it would be very hard to live without the 
computer nowadays. We also know that a person who has no basic 
knowledge of computers and who does not have at least some 
ability to surf the Internet will soon be considered illiterate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New products are related to the computers and these products 
have a life cycle of five years. Every five years, new products 
are introduced, and we constantly have to adapt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind our viewers that each party leader has 
access to some computer facilities. We all know how computers are 
an integral part of our ability to do our work as 
parliamentarians, and this also holds true for a variety of 
sectors in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked myself if there is something in the criminal code 
to meet the objectives of our colleague, the member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT92"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT92"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1740

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read section 430 of the criminal code, and I do not understand 
how this section, which already exists and can be applied 
immediately, will not allow us to achieve the objectives pursued by 
the member through his motion, that is, punishing people who use 
computers to disrupt electronic business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people disrupt electronic business by introducing viruses, 
they destroy data banks and a part of the economy, because today 
we can pay bills and make business transactions through 
computers. With some financial institutions, we can even get 
authorized loans. There is a whole area of computer science that 
is developing, which is called domatique, and which will ensure 
that, as consumers, we will be able, from our homes, to make 
transactions that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 430 provides for an offence system. I remind members 
that the criminal code is a legislation. Several times in the 
House, we have amended the criminal code. We have amended it to 
include aggravating circumstances. Section 718 of the criminal 
code says that, when a person is abusing gays, for example, the 
judge assessing the case will have to impose a more severe 
sentence. This is the heinous crime legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuesday, in the standing committee on justice, we considered 
each clause of Bill C-24, which provides a framework on the whole 
issue of anti-gang legislation. 
Clause 24 says that certain offences or helping organized crime 
is punishable by 14 years in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could draw up a fairly long and comprehensive list of the 
circumstances for which the lawmaker saw fit to amend the 
criminal code. But I believe we should not overdo it. The 
criminal code is complex enough as it is, both in terms of its 
interpretation and its enforcement. Let us not forget that the 
criminal code is a federal act, but that the provinces have to 
enforce it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make it very clear that by taking part in this debate 
we will ask members of the Canadian Alliance—those who are 
still in it and those who have left—to explain why we need new 
provisions. We do not understand why section 430 would not allow 
the objectives sought by our colleague from Saskatoon—Humboldt 
to be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand, of course, that economic crimes are often 
committed through the Internet. Mafia boy is a case in point. In 
an article I read, it is said that the damage caused by this 
young computer whiz, who is just over ten years of age, when he 
broke in to a number of systems, including those of the FBI, the 
CIA and several big American bureaus of investigation, is 
estimated at $1.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we are right not to take this lightly. I 
suppose that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General 
of Canada, who is very vigilant regarding the RCMP's activities, 
will remind us that there is within the RCMP a section dealing 
with economic crimes committed through Internet and computers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we understand the hon. member's concerns. There have been 
fundamental changes in computers. Computers are no longer for 
recreational purposes only, as they were when I started using 
them. 
We used them to get information, and we used them a lot for 
recreational purposes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, many services are linked to economic development. 
Major economic players use computers as a matter of course, for 
their transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only last week, I had to get involved. In Quebec, the Mouvement 
Desjardins is rationalizing its services and facilities. 
Unfortunately, there is a relationship between the fact that 
people are relying less on bank tellers and more on computers. 
The issue is to maintain jobs. 
It makes us realize that computers have permeated many aspects 
of our daily lives that we would not have thought possible just 
a few years back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly do not want to give the impression that we are not 
aware or mindful of all the ramifications of the various 
computer applications. However, we do not believe that a new set 
of offences is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be able to reach our goals with section 430 of the 
criminal code. For all these reasons, we would hope to get more 
details on this issue, but unless we get some very convincing 
explanations, we will be voting against the motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will begin by thanking the 
member for Saskatoon—Humboldt for bringing this motion to the 
attention of the House.  It clearly is an issue of great concern 
and certainly is an issue of importance, not only nationally but 
internationally as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to express my appreciation of the views related to 
this issue that have been expressed by a number of members in the 
House.  For example, the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve made 
some very important points about the criminal code, mafia boy and 
others, some of which I will highlight later in my speech as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that issues relating to cybercrime, such as 
hacking and malicious virus dissemination, have been widely 
reported over recent months and have caused governments, industry 
and the public great deal of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say too that criminal conduct on the 
Internet has grown as the use of the Internet has grown.  As we 
know, Canadians are in the lead in its use in many instances, 
therefore it is important that this and related issues receive 
the proper attention of parliament and the government in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I would like to restate the government's 
commitment to ensuring that our laws keep pace with technology. 
We would like to continue to foster the relationships the 
government has created with law enforcement and industry to 
ensure that the laws and the tools used to combat cybercrime 
fulfil the needs of law enforcement without hampering our 
industries' competitive advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada continues to be a world leader in the area of battling 
cybercrime, crime that in many instances does not respect 
borders.  We have forged many international partnerships and will 
continue our involvement, for example, in the G-8 and the Council 
of Europe as well as the United Nations, to name just a few, in 
order to combat and deal with these kinds of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's motion, although well intentioned, is nonetheless 
redundant.  He has characterized it as a provision that will fill 
a void in Canadian criminal law.  I would suggest that in fact 
that is not the case.  It will not do that because sections 342.1 
and 431.1 of the criminal code were designed with the 
dissemination of malicious computer viruses in mind.  They were 
also worded in a manner that could be applicable to some future, 
still unknown, form of mischief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing that one of Canada's great legal traditions 
is to draft legislation in a general manner so that it fits not a 
particular thing but a number of things.  In other words, in 
Canada fraud is fraud, whether committed by a person or committed 
by a computer.  We do not need, then, a separate offence to cover 
computer fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that same line of reasoning, a section that was created to 
deal with any form of mischief to data, for example, including 
computer virus dissemination, should not be overridden simply 
because it does not include those words explicitly.  Again, 
Canada's legal tradition kicks in here in a very fair minded and 
actually a forward thinking way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the first hour of debate the hon. member for Fundy—Royal 
said it best when he stated that the current criminal code is 
adequate to deal with computer hackers.  He also pointed out that 
these serious offences carry a maximum penalty of 10 years 
imprisonment.  That is already in place.  Where the mischief in 
question endangers life, the penalty can be life imprisonment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from at least the government's point of view, then, 
that the criminal code already deals with these types of crimes 
in a very serious manner.  These provisions have been on the 
books for over 15 years and in 1997 were fine tuned and adjusted. 
Amendments were made at the time to reflect the realities of the 
day.  This is demonstrative of the government's ongoing 
commitment to update the laws as needed.  We continue to do so. I 
think that is the strength of the government:  to ensure that we 
are ahead of the game in these kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Minister of Justice agrees with the motion in 
principle, she cannot support it because it affects conduct that 
already has been contemplated by the criminal code.  I know that 
her parliamentary secretary agrees with that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice officials have been working to establish and foster 
partnerships with private industry, law enforcement and other 
governments.  It is our understanding from these sources that the 
criminal code adequately deals with the conduct described in the 
motion before us.  Law enforcement has and will continue to use 
these provisions successfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of the recent mafia boy case to which the 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve referred, where the accused was 
charged with 64 counts of hacking and mischief.  Internationally, 
Canada is recognized as a world leader.  In a recent independent 
international study on the readiness of national law to deal with 
cybercrime, McConnell International found that Canada's 
cybercrime laws are among the world's strongest.  That is worth 
celebrating.  It is worth it for all of us as parliamentarians to 
think about it.  Internationally we are well renowned.  We are 
known throughout the world in terms of having some of the 
strongest laws on the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada is a world leader in this regard, the government 
is committed to ensuring that our laws speak to our ever changing 
technological environment but that at the same time we have due 
regard for fundamental human rights.  Canada continues its role 
as a world leader and as an active participant in many 
international forums on the issue of cybercrime.  These include, 
and I will note them for the record, the G-8, the Council of 
Europe, the United Nations, the Commonwealth Secretariat, OECD 
and the Organization of American States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As observers to the Council of Europe, Canadian delegates have 
been integral in negotiating a draft convention on cybercrime 
that which will be adopted later this year and will stand as a 
benchmark for international instruments in this area.  Again it 
is something of which Canadians, wherever they live, can be 
justifiably proud.  At the G-8, Canada continues its leadership 
role on cybercrime issues and is looking forward to its 
presidency in the year 2002.  That underscores the leadership 
role that the country takes on matters of such grave and 
important substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because cybercrime challenges our notions of sovereignty, our 
participation in these international forums will require that we 
constantly review our legislation, not only to make sure that it 
keeps pace with technology but also that it keeps pace with the 
laws of our international partners.  We need to work together on 
this and Canada will take its lead, as it always has, in this 
very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the Minister of Justice is satisfied that the 
criminal code already covers the malicious dissemination of 
computer viruses and that no further action is required in this 
area and with respect to the motion.  I would ask all members to 
consider that and vote accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was deep in thought about what the 
member across the way said, however, I am thankful to the member 
for Saskatoon—Humboldt for introducing this private member's 
motion.  I believe every member should support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the criminal code is sufficient as it is. 
It is perhaps outdated regarding Internet crime and I believe it 
is yet another symptom of how we are failing to keep up with the 
times in having a judicial system that protects Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since the Internet entered the public domain there has been 
an enormous resistance to any regulation or interference by the 
government in the Internet. 
The Internet is believed by some to be the last bastion of pure 
freedom.  Some people believed it could not be regulated and some 
people want freedom without limits, without consideration for 
others and without any accountability.  However, freedom does 
come with responsibility, with limits, with consideration and 
with accountability.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Internet crime has proven to be harmful to personal property and 
will even destroy it.  My own son's computer contained the files 
for my personal website during the election campaign.  The night 
that he was to go home and finish that campaign site he found 
that a hacker had entered his computer and had actually destroyed 
the computer itself.  He actually had to replace the hard drive 
because of the action of that hacker.  We know it can happen.  We 
know that Internet crime can also interrupt business.  We believe 
it is time to shut down crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet came on in the early nineties.  It was the gateway 
to a new era.  It developed so quickly that it seems to have left 
a lot of things in its wake.  It moved so quickly that technology 
was perhaps slow in keeping up with the hackers, in keeping them 
out.  Also, though, I believe that we were slow in heading them 
off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving just as quickly, of course, were those we call hackers, 
who were attempting to destroy opportunities.  The word virus 
took on a new meaning.  Those who would destroy the opportunities 
and those who would create destructive viruses are the criminals 
that the member of parliament from Saskatoon—Humboldt and others 
want to shut down through this type of motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Existing crime legislation was never designed to deal with the 
types of Internet crime we are witnessing.  Some of this crime 
was never even imagined in those days and it continues to develop 
in things that are happening on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe amendments to the criminal code are required that will 
allow it to specifically deal with Internet crime.  Amending the 
criminal code would provide law enforcement agencies and the 
courts with the tools they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have benefited personally from crimes on the Internet.  It 
reminds me of the old protection racket in the old west, for 
instance, or in the Al Capone days.  It seems that one of the 
ways to get a good computer job is to learn how to be a good 
hacker, to hack into some company's files and then offer oneself 
for hire.  I do not believe that should even be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support those who want to keep the government from unduly 
regulating the Internet and I support measures that will secure 
the existing network for us and for future users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe there are things that we have not even 
mentioned and that this bill certainly does not address.  I 
believe, for instance, that we also ought to look at sites that 
would entrap children in pornographic sites.  I know this bill 
does not address that.  That is just an example of how things 
progress on the Internet.  We should broaden our look at what 
might be considered an Internet crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have information here which indicates that by May 10 of this 
year the number of viruses tracked by MessageLabs SkyScan virus 
scanning service passed 185,000.  That exceeds the mark reached 
in the whole year of 2000.  We are seeing this kind of steady 
increase.  Another consultant with another firm said “Around a 
year ago we would probably expect to see 1,000 new viruses each 
month.  Nowadays we aren't surprised to see 1,200”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been two major viruses this year, and we all know 
about the one last year, the love bug virus.  These viruses are 
developing very rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the laws need to be tough enough to punish those 
who would willfully spread computer viruses and those who write 
them.  We must take the cool out of writing viruses and we must 
not allow people to profit from it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that people who distribute viruses get the code 
from a virus exchange website where authors post viral source 
codes.  This in itself should be illegal.  To allow the tools for 
writing viruses to be on the Internet seems to me to be quite 
comical, but it is happening.  If our laws are so sufficient, why 
is it continuing to happen?  Why are those sites there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been stated that no one is ever shown anything useful 
about a computer virus.  It is bad and it only does harm and the 
law should treat it accordingly.  Peter Tippet, a chief 
technology officer for TruSecure Corporation, wrote a recent 
article in which he says that making a bomb is illegal while 
writing about a bomb is not illegal and with a computer virus the 
words are the bomb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virus writers are glory seekers.  They believe they are free in 
the wild, wild west of the computer Internet world to do whatever 
they want to do.  It is time that we introduced some effective 
crime legislation to deal with hackers.  I am pleased to support 
the bill which calls for some important steps to be taken toward 
the real control of Internet crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to 
the private member's motion that has been put on the agenda by my 
colleague from Saskatoon—Humboldt.  The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
immediately amend the Criminal Code to create a separate category 
of offences and punishments for computer hackers and persons who 
wilfully or maliciously export computer viruses, both of whose 
activities disrupt the normal conduct of electronic business in 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not one of us in this place who is not aware of the 
importance of the Internet and of the new technologies available 
to us to allow us to do our job.  There is no one in the House 
who does not understand the potential of the invasion of a 
person's privacy through the new technology that we use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry committee took many hours in looking at the new 
e-commerce, the privacy issues and how we protect information 
when using this new technology.  Companies in society have 
created an international environment through the use of the 
Internet and the use of new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague who spoke earlier gave a couple of examples of new 
technologies as his phone rang and his BlackBerry warning went 
off.  These new technologies have become part of how we conduct 
ourselves, how we do business, how we communicate with each other 
and how we share information immediately. I could write an e-mail 
message and send it to someone in Vienna, Austria, who would 
receive it immediately.  It is a technology that has advanced our 
business community.  It has allowed that community to be 
competitive in the international scheme of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about offences, about people who break into 
someone's system or about someone who deliberately plants a virus 
that will disrupt a communication tool, we need to have some 
vehicle or means of dealing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we are talking about high school kids who play 
around and mischievously plant things in computer systems, but we 
are talking about people who, for either their own personal gain 
or for a reason more serious than that, deliberately interfere 
with the ability of a company to communicate either within its 
own company or with others around the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know and have known for a number of years that there has been 
a concern within companies about people trying to hack into their 
computer systems for malicious reasons, either because they are 
disgruntled employees or because they want to remove or destroy 
information within the system that might affect them or might 
benefit them economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a whole new range of criminal activity.  I call it 
criminal activity because people are deliberately, maliciously 
and intentionally destroying the abilities of companies, 
corporations and banks to use the new technology in the manner it 
was designed to be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to deal with these individuals who are committing 
crimes.  People have used the analogy of someone who breaks into 
a home and rifles through papers, goes through closets and 
dressers and gets access to things that he or she has no business 
having access to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about hacking into a bank, we are talking about the 
ability to transfer money, to actually steal assets or to remove 
information that clearly defines who those assets belong to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other circumstances as well.  Someone who hacks into a 
defence equipment file or a police file has access to very 
sensitive information.  In the police scenario, someone could 
destroy the credibility of evidence to be presented in court.  In 
the defence scenario, someone might get information that is a 
risk to the security of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we deal with this?  Today there is no specific way of 
dealing with an individual who is hacking into computer equipment 
and programs.  To those doing business, the cost of trying to 
protect computer networks from outside hackers is incredible. 
They are constantly trying to be ahead of technology.  Businesses 
are constantly trying to figure out how to prevent people from 
hacking into their systems.  It must be very frustrating for 
businesses to have to put these costs into their system and their 
budgetary programming knowing that if an individual is caught 
hacking into their computer systems, it is questionable whether 
or not that individual would face a criminal charge or have any 
kind of meaningful sanction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we get into the issue of viruses and their potential to 
create the same kind of damage.  There it is not stealing 
information, accessing or transferring assets or anything of that 
nature, but if this is done deliberately to create confusion or 
to cause disruption to a company doing business, it should be 
considered a very serious criminal action.  That also is not 
happening because there is nothing in legislation that 
specifically sets up the issue for people who create viruses.  I 
do not think there is a member in the Chamber who does not know 
about the effect a virus can have and about the insecurity one 
has in dealing with computers knowing all these viruses exist.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently bought a new software program that is able to hunt 
out viruses when I turn on the computer.  It deals with viruses 
and removes them from the system.  Supposedly the software 
program can kill a virus brought in from the outside before it 
attacks any information in the system.  However, I found out that 
I am not protected from any new virus that comes in after the 
software program came on the market.  How many software virus 
programs does a person have to buy?  Does a person have to buy 
one every day because every day someone is creating a new virus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to consider this concern, as I am sure people are, with 
our reliance on new technology such as e-mail, the Internet and 
even storing information on computer networks.  Certainly here in 
the House of Commons we have that concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone were so creative as to come up with a virus that 
would shut down all the systems at the same time, I am not sure 
how society or commerce or banking would survive, because we have 
become very reliant on computer technology.  What about buying 
licence plates for my car or buying groceries or doing my 
banking?  Most people use debit cards in grocery stores, 
restaurants or Canadian Tire.  Debit cards are tied into a 
computer network.  I really wonder whether as a society we could 
manage to keep operating.  Because of our reliance on the new 
technology and on the security of the new technology, it is 
extremely important that we recognize computer hacking as a 
criminal offence and put sanctions on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt deserves a lot of credit 
for taking seriously what he heard as concerns of the industry 
committee, the business community and also the medical community. 
He is to be commended for hearing their concerns and for 
identifying a situation that our criminal code does not deal with 
sufficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should view the motion my hon. colleague has presented to the 
House as a positive thing, as something that can at least begin 
to address and support the study done by the industry committee. 
We need to be very concerned about the privacy, security and 
protection of the new technology, of the information highway, of 
information systems and of all the different areas of the new 
technology that can be interfered with and interrupted and 
undermined by a criminal mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to support my 
colleague.  I appreciate his diligence in putting the bill before 
the House.  I hope that all parties would see the need to support 
the legislation and ensure that it at least advances beyond a 
private member's motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the last 
speaker of the day, I can sum up basically the whole debate by 
saying that virtually everyone agrees computers are very 
important in our society and computer hacking is a terrible 
problem.  It is the remedy that we need to discuss:  whether 
section 430 of the criminal code is enough or whether the 
government should make additional amendments.  That is how people 
will vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make two points.  One is for my constituents and it is 
that to have these problems we need to be connected. 
I am very glad the Government of Canada in its recent throne 
speech put a lot of effort into connecting Canadians.  I have 
been urging and trying to get the towns of Faro and Ross River 
connected.  I hope every house in the small Yukon communities of 
Beaver Creek, Pelly Crossing, Carcross, Old Crow, Destruction 
Bay, Burwash Landing, Elsa and Keena will be connected one day.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on the day the motion was introduced, the person who 
introduced it also introduced something that was not very 
unifying.  I would like to induce him to perhaps take some 
private reflection or remember that softwares are languages on 
computers.  There are quite a few and they all bring strength to 
a computer.  If people understand a lot of languages on a 
computer then they have more strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the other initiative he brought forward, we want 
Canadians to be in the position of strength understanding that 
those many languages strengthen Canada.  I hope he will reflect 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>   The time provided for the

have been moved.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEALTH

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on April 27 I asked the Minister of 
Health a question concerning hepatitis C and why individuals who 
were infected outside the 1986-1990 border, who contracted 
hepatitis C through no fault of their own through 
tainted blood, had not been compensated.  The response I 
received was that the minister was frustrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring this up again because people who contracted hepatitis C 
through tainted blood do not need frustration.  What they need is 
leadership.  That is what will help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1978 and 1986, 14,000 Canadians contracted hepatitis C 
through no fault of their own.  We have to find out who these 
individuals are.  Many of them are unknown to the medical 
community because the time course for acquiring symptoms can be 
more than 10 years.  It can even be as much as 40 years before 
any symptoms accrue.  Some provinces are trying to find out who 
these people are, and the federal government ought to help them 
in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of victims who contracted hepatitis C was 
overestimated.  There is $1.1 billion available to compensate 
victims.  Because of the overestimation, there should be a 
surplus of money which should go to those individuals who have 
not as yet been compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the government has not done that.  These 
people are suffering at home.  They do not have the treatment or 
the medication they require.  They have simply slipped through 
the cracks to live their lives in quiet desperation through no 
fault of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have this problem in our ridings.  I am simply asking the 
Minister of Health to do the right thing.  I am asking the 
Minister of Health, while the money is there, to please 
compensate those victims who are outside the window of 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of fairness, and the money is there.  Rather 
than the money being chewed up by lawyers' fees, because these 
people are bringing cases to the court, why not make sure it goes 
to the patients for the care and medication they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also would like to draw to the attention of the members that 
the number of people who are contracting hepatitis C is 
increasing because of the explosion of intravenous drug use.  We 
also know that people who snort cocaine through the use of shared 
straws can contract the hepatitis C virus if they have open 
sores.  This is important for the public to recognize.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, on behalf of the 14,000 plus individuals who 
contracted hepatitis C through tainted blood that was not checked 
by tests that were available at the time and as a matter of 
fairness and compassion to those individuals, I plead with the 
government to compensate those individuals so they will have 
the treatment and medial care they require.  It is a simple 
request.  It is simple to do, and I hope the government does it 
as soon as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in March 1998 the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments agreed to offer 
compensation to Canadians who were tragically infected with 
hepatitis C through the Canadian blood system between January 1, 
1986 and July 1, 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments and lawyers for the class action plaintiffs reached 
a proposed settlement agreement and filed it with the three class 
action courts in June 1999.  The settlement was approved by the 
courts in December 1999.  It was recognized that the settlement 
was fair and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the court appointment in March 2000 of Crawford Expertises 
Canada Inc. and The Garden City Group as the arm's length 
administrator, Crawford has developed claims protocols and has 
had these protocols approved by the courts. Crawford has received 
and reviewed more than 5,000 claims and, since June 25, 2000, 
more than 2,000 individuals have received compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint committee, a group of lawyers appointed by the courts 
to supervise the administration of the settlement agreement, has 
assured the Minister of Health recently that they are taking 
every available step to review claims efficiently and promptly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's plans to assist people living with hepatitis C 
are not limited to the settlement compensation.  Following the 
compensation announcement in March 1999, the Government of Canada 
received representation from individuals infected outside the 
window period.  The Minister of Health listened to their concerns 
and as a result, in September 1998 a $525 million strategy was 
announced to assist all individuals infected with hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this proposal, the government is transferring to the 
provinces and territories up to $300 million to ensure that all 
those who contracted hepatitis C through the blood system, no 
matter when, will have reasonable and ongoing access to the 
medical goods and services needed for appropriate treatment.  The 
government has demonstrated care and compassion toward all 
victims.  This stands as proof in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada was proud to be the sponsor of a national 
conference for hepatitis C which took place May 1 to May 4 in 
Montreal this past little while.  This conference brought 
together all stakeholders to share their experience and knowledge 
of recent medical developments and strategies for disease 
prevention and control along with health promotion in community 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my contention, and I believe people will agree, that the 
government is doing everything it can for the victims of 
hepatitis C. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
