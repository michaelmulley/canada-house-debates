	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-311, an 
act to require the Minister for International Trade to retaliate 
against import restrictions introduced by the United States of 
America on Canadian refined sugar and sugar containing products, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a private 
member's bill which the all-party caucus, the sugar caucus, has 
proposed, Bill C-311.
<P>
	With six plants in six provinces sugar production is truly a 
national concern. An equally important statistic is that over the last 
10 years four plants have closed and nearly 1,000 Canadian jobs 
have been lost. Plants are located across the country from Lantic 
Sugar in Saint John, New Brunswick, to Rogers Sugar in 
Vancouver. Approximately 90 per cent of Canada's sugar 
production is refined from sugar cane and sugar beet. The 
remainder comes from the domestically grown sugar beet market, 
produced mostly in our western Canadian farms. Whether derived 
from cane or beet, Canada has an annual sugar production of about 
1.1 million tonnes.
<P>
	The sugar industry is one of significant and historic importance 
to Atlantic Canada and to the country as a whole. Sugar refining 
has provided stable employment and regional economic benefits 
for about 150 years. Given the employment challenges, especially 
in Atlantic Canada, that we face today, it is of paramount 
importance that the sugar industry be protected at all costs or more 
jobs will be lost.
<P>
	Protecting the jobs of Atlantic Canadian sugar workers and those 
of the rest of Canada's sugar industry is extremely important to me 
and to the many members of the House and the other place who are 
members of our sugar caucus.
<P>
	The Liberal Party's red book stated more power and opportunity 
would be given to members of Parliament to create and participate 
in a process that would benefit Canadians as a whole. I believe the 
all-party sugar caucus formed to protect our sugar industry from 
coast to coast is good evidence of this commitment.
<P>
	Last June sugar caucus members from the three official parties 
went to Washington to meet with our political counterparts, the 
House of Representatives ways and means committee, officials 
from the United States department of agriculture, and 
representatives from the United States sugar industry to discuss 
problems that currently plague our sugar industry.
<P>
	A notably difficult and separate issue from access is the 
Helms-Burton anti-Cuba legislation.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	While the anti-Cuba bills originally proposed to prohibit the 
importation of sugar, syrups and molasses from any country that 
does such trade with Cuba, I am very pleased that changes have 
recently occurred and that the pressure exerted on the United States 
by our Prime Minister during President Clinton's recent visit and 
our own sugar caucus has resulted in this deal being struck to 
remove the sugar provisions from the House version of the bill 
which was formerly voted on in the House of Representatives on 
Thursday.
<P>
	The Senate version remains to be formerly introduced but the 
redrafted version retains a narrower requirement for certification of 
origin in respect of sugar, syrups and molasses. It is likely the 
Senate version will also follow the lead of the House of 
Representatives in deleting the references to sugar.
<P>
	During our visit to Washington as a team of members of the 
House of Commons representing different regions of our country 
and representing all three major political parties we emphasized to 
our political counterparts that Canada was being unfairly targeted 
by the Helms-Burton legislation.
<P>
	The combined efforts have resulted in significant changes to the 
legislation. This is viewed by our sugar caucus as a major victory in 
our fight to protect the jobs of Canada's sugar industry. The sugar 
caucus is extremely pleased to have contributed to the efforts made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14782"> 14782 </A></B>
<P>
by our ministers of agriculture and agri-food, foreign affairs, and 
international trade on the anti-Cuba legislation.
<P>
	However we must continue to fight to protect these jobs. Today 
the sugar industry in Canada provides 1,400 direct full time jobs 
across Canada. In the west many more seasonal positions are 
provided during the annual beet harvest. Aside from the direct 
number of jobs created, many other regional benefits flow from 
having a Canadian based sugar industry. The direct employment 
figures do not account for those employed by sugar containing 
product industries which have located in Canada to take advantage 
of Canada's low sugar prices.
<P>
	Canadian industrial sweetener users employ thousands of 
people, with annual sales in the billions of dollars. The benefits 
also extend upstream. By creating demand for inputs the industry 
supports employment in supplier industries, including packaging 
and other inputs such as transportation, fuel and electricity.
<P>
	However the principal problem that still confronts our sugar 
industry is restricted access to the U.S. market while our American 
friends enjoy unrestricted access to our market. In Canada, in our 
open and unprotected sugar market, consumers and industrial sugar 
users enjoy prices roughly one-half of what they are in our 
protected markets of the major sugar trading partners.
<P>
	Canada's traditionally low sugar prices have had some very 
attractive benefits. Because of that Canada has attracted its 
processing sector which has benefited refiners, food processors, 
consumers and generally the economy as a whole. Canadian sugar 
producers continue to support free trade as being in the best interest 
of all Canadians. However that trade must be fair. The sugar caucus 
has proposed a solution to the problem of unfettered access of U.S. 
sugar to our marketplace.
<P>
	Bill C-311 is an act to require the Minister for International 
Trade to retaliate against import restrictions introduced by the 
United States on Canadian refined sugar and sugar containing 
products.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	In other words, the all-party sugar caucus wants to continue to 
fight to protect the jobs of Atlantic Canadians, western Canadians, 
sugar workers and the workers across this great nation by imposing 
the same restrictions on American sugar exports as those which 
have been imposed on ours.
<P>
	The arguments for the actions outlined in Bill C-311 are very 
strong. I invite my colleagues from all parties to speak on this 
extremely important issue. The workers of Lantic Sugar in Saint 
John and the workers from the rest of our sugar industry are 
anxiously watching the debate to see what we as elected 
representatives will do to address the most important problem they 
are facing, tackling the unrestricted access to our market which the 
U.S. sugar industry is basking in.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
extremely pleased to speak on Bill C-311, an act to require the 
Minister for International Trade to retaliate against import 
restrictions introduced by the United States of America on 
Canadian refined sugar and sugar-containing products.
<P>
	I said that I was extremely pleased to speak on this bill, and I am 
pleased to do so of course, but also somewhat distressed at having 
to speak on such a bill. I feel it is an unfortunate bill not because the 
initiative of my colleague from Fundy-Royal is an unfortunate 
one, anything but, but because I think it is unfortunate we are 
placed in a situation at this time which requires us to discuss or 
pass such a bill.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the two largest trading partners in the 
world, Canada and the USA, have reached the stage of having to 
envision bills such as this one. It is unfortunate that these two 
countries, which share the longest undefended border in the world, 
are forced to assess, to envisage, to discuss bills such as this one. 
This bill from my colleague from Fundy-Royal, who also heads the 
sugar caucus, the all-party caucus to which he referred a few 
minutes ago, was introduced to this House in reaction, essentially, 
to two things.
<P>
	First, to a decision by the United States to restrict unilaterally 
access to the American market by Canadian sugar products as of 
January 1 this year. On January 1, the United States decided to 
reduce Canadian sugar imports to the United States by 8,000 metric 
tonnes, and it will further reduce imports of Canadian sugar by 
22,000 metric tonnes as of October 1. This is a considerable 
reduction, since in three months, from October 1 to December 31, 
1994, we shipped more than 35,000 metric tonnes of sugar products 
to the United States. This is a considerable reduction.
<P>
	As a result, sugar refineries in Canada and Quebec stand to lose 
$135 million, while in the process more than 2,400 jobs across 
Canada and Quebec may be lost. These unilateral reductions 
directly contradict the provisions of NAFTA and the provisions of 
the Uruguay Round agreements that led to the creation of the World 
Trade Organization.
<P>
	The bill before the House today is also a reaction to legislation 
proposed in the United States, the Helms-Burton bill, which would 
prohibit any company importing sugar from Cuba from having 
access to the American market. The bill has already reached the 
floor of the House of Representatives and will soon be put to a vote 
in the U.S. Senate.
<P>
	The consequences of the passage of such a bill may be quite 
serious for Canada and Quebec, since the bill may further restrict 
access to the U.S. market for Canadian and Quebec sugar 
refineries. As the hon. member for Fundy-Royal said earlier, we 
went to Washington to  discuss the matter with our American 
colleagues, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14783"> 14783 </A></B>
<P>
and we found that they were influenced by two stubborn 
misconceptions, two misconceptions that will not budge.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The first misconception is that Canada is flooding the American 
market with sugar products. Let me say that this is totally false. It is 
totally false, because Canadian refined sugar represents only 1 per 
cent of the American market, and sugar containing products 
represent only 3 per cent of the American market, whereas the 
Americans occupy 13 per cent of our refined sugar market and 26 
per cent of our market for sugar containing products. I say this to 
show how wrong this misconception is.
<P>
	The second misconception that is very popular in the United 
States is the belief that Canada is dumping Cuban sugar on the 
American market-another belief that is totally wrong. It is totally 
wrong, because we differentiate in Canada between sugar produced 
in Cuba and anywhere else, and this differentiation is certified. The 
American authorities recognize this certification.
<P>
	A few months ago, American inspectors came to Canada to 
check and were satisfied with the differentiation we make between 
sugar products from Cuba and other sugar products.
<P>
	It is important to note as well that Canada imports more sugar 
from the United States than it does from Cuba.
<P>
	While we were in Washington, people asked us if our mission 
was not a bit dangerous, if we did not think the Americans would 
take advantage of our being in Washington to try to obtain 
Canadian concessions on farm product quotas? Of course we did 
not, because the two matters are completely different.
<P>
	Why are they completely different? The answer is very simple. 
In order to comply with the new provisions of the Uruguay Round, 
which gave rise to the World Trade Organization, Canada decided 
to transform its farm product quotas into tariff quotas, thus 
complying with the provisions of the Uruguay Round.
<P>
	The U.S. in turn did not convert already existing quotas into 
tariff quotas but imposed new restrictions in flagrant violation of 
the provisions in the Uruguay Round agreements, in flagrant 
violation of the Marrakesh agreements.
<P>
	This is a different situation because agricultural products were 
already subject to quotas. The Americans cannot claim that they 
were not aware of the situation since it already existed. All we did 
was modify it to comply with the provisions of the Uruguay Round 
agreement. As I pointed out earlier, the U.S. imposed new 
restrictions. So this is not a situation that existed before.
<P>
	The two situations are totally different. One cannot put in the 
same basket a discussion about access to the  U.S. market for 
Canadian sugar products and access to the Canadian market for 
U.S. agricultural products that are subject to quotas in this country.
<P>
	We also saw when we were in Washington that even if the 
Americans do not try to link the sugar issue with the issue of 
supply-managed agricultural products, they will link it with 
anything else. In Washington, they talked to us about durum wheat, 
about softwood lumber, even about peanuts, believe it or not.
<P>
	So the Americans are ready to link the issue of supply-managed 
agricultural products with anything. They will negotiate on 
anything to try to obtain concessions from Canada. They will 
negotiate on anything that relates to the sugar issue in order to 
extract concessions.
<P>
	Finally, what must be understood is that they imposed new 
restrictions on sugar, simply to exert pressure on Canada, to force it 
to make concessions, whether on supply-managed agricultural 
products or on something else, which is totally unacceptable 
because the situations are completely different.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	In this context, I think it should be pointed out that the 
government has been refusing for several months now to tie 
various trade issues to one another, considering them as completely 
separate issues, which are distinct from one another. I think that is 
desirable.
<P>
	Bill C-311, finally, was put forward to show our American 
partners how concerned we were about the situation, how 
deplorable we found these additional restrictions imposed by the 
United States on Canadian sugar containing products. As I 
mentioned earlier, it is unfortunate that we have to debate a bill like 
the one before us today. That is probably why our colleagues have 
decided to make this bill a non votable item, because this kind of 
petty, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth attitude of tying together 
discussions on completely different products does not fit in with 
our view of things, in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	We are for an open market and absolutely free trade, we abide by 
the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the 
agreements concluded as a result of the Uruguay Round. In that 
sense, we are definitely not crazy about this kind of legislation, be 
it Canadian or American.
<P>
	However, the purpose of this particular legislation is to clearly 
convey to our American partners that we will not tolerate such an 
attitude on their part and that, if need be, we are prepared to 
retaliate to make sure our rights as well as the partnership and trade 
relations between Canada and the U.S. are respected.
<P>
	Of course this bill will not be voted on. We will not have to vote 
on this bill, and it will not be passed. But not passing this bill does 
not mean that the Minister of  International Trade will not be 
authorized to retaliate or take other action against this kind of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14784"> 14784 </A></B>
<P>
action taken by the U.S. government. Of course, the Minister of 
International Trade and the Canadian government will remain 
perfectly free, if required, to retaliate against this kind of attitude 
displayed by our American partners.
<P>
	Nevertheless, as I said, I greatly appreciated the opportunity to 
speak on this bill, although it will not be voted on. But, as I said, 
the government has complete latitude and can count on our fullest 
support in any action it may initiate to strengthen economic 
relations between the United States, Quebec and Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when Canada and the 
United States negotiated the free trade agreement that came into 
effect in 1989, both sides reserved their GATT rights. As such the 
United States retained its ability to take action under section 22 and 
Canada retained its quantitative restriction under article XI of the 
GATT.
<P>
	The reservation of GATT rights was also incorporated in the 
North American free trade agreement five years later. In effect both 
sides, the Americans and the Canadians, agreed that a negotiated 
settlement on bilateral agricultural trade would be best achieved in 
the Uruguay round.
<P>
	From 1982 to 1990, Canadian exports of refined sugar to the 
United States were subject to an absolute quota representing 1.1 per 
cent of the total U.S. imports. This roughly amounted to about 
12,000 tonnes per year. Producers of raw and refined sugar from 
other countries were also limited to various shares of total U.S. 
imports.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	In 1989 a GATT panel, at the request of Australia, concluded that 
the United States mechanism for imposing sugar import 
restrictions was in violation of the GATT. In 1990 the United States 
implemented the panel recommendation by converting its absolute 
quota on sugar into a tariff rate quota that essentially had the same 
effect as the quota it replaced.
<P>
	For Canada, implementation of the GATT panel 
recommendation had an unexpected effect. The United States 
decided that due to the existence of the recently signed free trade 
agreement it would not apply the tariff restriction to Canada. That 
was a unilateral decision.
<P>
	As a result, our exports of refined sugar, which had consisted 
exclusively of sugar made from Canadian grown sugar beets, have 
increased since 1987 from the previous annual level of 12,000 
tonnes to an average of approximately 35,000 to 38,000 tonnes per 
year in the last three years. In fact we were able to triple the exports 
of refined sugar to the United States following the unilateral 
interpretation of the free trade agreement.
<P>
	With respect to products containing sugar, the United States had 
an absolute quota in place as far back as 1983. Canada, like other 
countries, has always been subject to these quotas. During the last 
three to four years Canadian producers, for example, due to the 
high quality of their products and very competitive prices, have 
accounted for the vast majority of U.S. imports of sugar.
<P>
	In 1989 the United States converted its old tariff schedule to the 
harmonized tariff schedule. In the process a U.S. custom service 
reclassified powdered drink bases, commonly known as crystal 
drink mixes, into a non-quota item. That has caused the Canadian 
exports of crystal drink mixes to the United States to increase 
rapidly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the case of refined sugar, the United States will apply a tariff 
quota of 22,000 metric tons, as of October 1, 1995. Canadian 
exports of refined sugar will be subject to that quota. As well, a 
tariff quota of about 64,000 metric tons has been in effect since 
January 1 of this year and includes crystal mixes for drinks and 
other products containing sugar.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government has pressed the United States to allocate to 
Canada a specific share of both sugar and sugar containing product 
tariff rate quotas but the United States has decided not to do so. We 
regret this decision but it must be recognized that the United States 
is under no international trade obligation to allocate the tariff rate 
quota by country.
<P>
	The imposition of unilateral retaliatory measures as requested by 
the bill would be a violation of Canada's international trade 
obligations as contained in the NAFTA and the agreement 
establishing the World Trade Organization.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	International trade agreements define the circumstances which 
can justify the taking of retaliatory measures, as well as the specific 
procedures to be followed before a party can invoke the right to 
impose such measures. A party must first ask that consultations be 
held to find a solution to the problem. If such consultations do not 
bring mutually satisfactory results, the aggrieved party can ask that 
a dispute settlement panel be set up. If the panel concludes that the 
contentious action violates the contractual trade obligations of the 
other party, and if that party refuses to amend its action or to 
provide satisfactory trade concessions then, and only then, can 
retaliatory measures be taken. Moreover, the panel must be 
convinced that the proposed retaliatory measure is not 
disproportionate, given the prejudice suffered. By proposing 
unilateral retaliatory measures, Bill C-311 goes against the 
arbitration procedure.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14785"> 14785 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Consequently, the United States might decide to challenge our 
action under NAFTA, or under the agreement establishing the 
WTO. Moreover, Canadian exports of sugar, and possibly some 
non-sugar products, might be adversely affected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-311 does not take into account Revenue Canada's 
anti-dumping duty investigation into imports of refined sugar from 
a number of countries, including the United States. The 
investigation was initiated following a complaint by the Canadian 
Sugar Institute earlier this year and a preliminary finding of 
dumping was announced on July 7 of this year. As a result, 
Revenue Canada assessed provisional anti-dumping duties on 
imports of refined sugar from the United States.
<P>
	The investigation is following its due course in accordance with 
Canadian trade remedies. The investigation has until October to 
make a final determination of dumping. This will be followed by 
the decision of the Canadian international trade tribunal on whether 
the Canadian industry is being injured by such imports. The 
decision of the Canadian international tribunal is also expected 
some time in November of this year.
<P>
	I would also like to mention an important development currently 
taking place in the United States that could further complicate the 
U.S.-Canada trade in sugar and products containing sugar. I am 
referring to the proposed U.S. legislation to expand the U.S. 
embargo on Cuba, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity 
Act, 1995, also known as the Helms-Burton bill.
<P>
	There were serious concerns earlier this year that the proposed 
legislation would lead to a ban on imports of Canadian sugar and 
possibly products containing more than 35 per cent sugar on the 
grounds that Canada imports raw sugar from Cuba. This would 
have affected over $500 million in Canadian exports of sugar and 
products such as confectionery, chewing gum, jams, jellies, gelatin 
mixes, as well as products already subject to U.S. quotas.
<P>
	Canada has been actively registering its opposition to the 
proposed legislation with the U.S administration in Congress. A 
strong diplomatic note was delivered to the United States 
administration and ministers have raised Canada's concerns with 
their U.S. counterparts on numerous occasions. Furthermore, the 
Canadian ambassador in Washington has written to many 
congressional representatives on the issue. The government has 
emphasized that if legislation is passed banning the import of sugar 
and products containing sugar, Canada would have no option but to 
respond firmly.
<P>
	We are pleased to see that subsequent revisions to those 
proposed bills have been made by congressional  committees in the 
weeks prior to the summer recess of Congress as a result of 
Canadian interventions. Changes to the legislation are now being 
proposed that could reduce the impact on Canadian exports in sugar 
and products containing sugar. Most of the sugar provisions in the 
House bill were removed before the bill proceeded to the floor.
<P>
	Unilateral retaliation not sanctioned by either the World Trade 
Organization or NAFTA dispute settlement mechanism would 
therefore not be helpful at this time.
<P>
	Finally, on behalf of the government I would like to recognize 
the enormous work and valuable effort of the sugar caucus led by 
my colleague, the MP for Fundy Royal. I assure the House as well 
as my colleague from Fundy Royal that the government is fully 
seized of the importance of resolving the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to the private member's bill introduced by the 
member for Fundy Royal, Bill C-311.
<P>
	I must confess that I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I can 
assure the member that I support the thrust of his bill. I am 
certainly not interested in seeing the Canadian sugar industry 
damaged in any way, especially not through unfair trade 
restrictions on the part of Americans. I know of the concern of all 
parties in the House regarding the possible damage to our sugar 
producers and I commend the work of the sugar caucus in this 
regard.
<P>
	I can imagine though that the bill comes at a rather awkward 
time for the government, since the Americans are taking us to task 
for tariffs we have put on that have precisely the same origin as the 
one the bill is attacking. I have to wonder if during the negotiations 
on the GATT we were outmanoeuvred and outnegotiated in this 
area when we allowed the Americans to expand the category for 
sugar into refined products as well.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I would like to give a bit of background. On January 1 of this 
year all countries that signed on to the Uruguay round of the GATT 
were required to replace existing import quotas with tariff rate 
quotas that would provide similar protection to vulnerable 
industries, with the proviso that these tariff rate quotas would 
eventually be reduced and dismantled.
<P>
	For those members who do not know what tariff rate quotas are, 
if they do not know the difference between a TRQ and an O Henry 
bar, I would like to tell them. A tariff rate quota is a cutoff level. Up 
until that cutoff level has been reached no tariff is payable. After 
the TRQ is reached a tariff comes into play, which is usually so 
sizeable that it discourages imports altogether.
<P>
	On January 1 the Americans put into place a TRQ of 64,000 
tonnes on all products containing sugar, such as drink mixes and 
<P>

gelatin desserts. At the same time, TRQs  of 8,000 tonnes until the 
end of September and 22,000 tonnes from October to December 
were put in place for refined sugar. Since Canada is not the only 
country that sells sugar and products containing sugar into the 
United States, our share of the TRQ will be substantially below that 
level.
<P>
	It is ironic that the GATT, which was intended to provide gradual 
expanded access, has actually led the Americans to restrict access 
in this regard. This is grossly unfair and totally contrary to the 
spirit of the Uruguay round. Furthermore, the Canadian Sugar 
Institute informs me that the Americans have taken advantage of 
the GATT tariffication by expanding this category to include items 
that were previously unrestricted. The Canadian Sugar Institute 
predicts that these restrictions could potentially lead to the loss of 
2,400 direct and indirect jobs. It is a very serious matter.
<P>
	I know that the hon. member who initiated the bill is concerned 
about the closure of one Canadian refinery, resulting in 700 
immediate jobs. He predicts an additional 1,700 jobs will be lost 
through the reduced production of products containing sugar.
<P>
	The hon. member proposes in his bill that consultation take place 
between Canadian and American governments to determine 
whether previous levels of access can be restored. If after 60 days 
no satisfactory resolution is reached, American access to Canadian 
sugar and the sugar products market will be restricted in direct 
retaliation. More precisely, the American share of the Canadian 
market will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the Canadian 
market share of the American market.
<P>
	Research indicates that prior to these restrictions the Canadian 
share of the U.S. market was quite small. It was said earlier that it 
was about 3 per cent. At the same time the American percentage of 
our market share is 23 per cent. Presumably, American imports 
would be held to 3 per cent, a reduction of some 20 per cent, if we 
took this step. This would allow for some of the displaced 
Canadian sugar to find a domestic home. That is the kind of thing 
we have to do. We have to give protection to our Canadian 
producers.
<P>
	The American sugar industry is highly protected. The U.S. 
government guarantees producers prices that are up to double the 
world market price and it maintains these high prices by restricting 
imports. The American government also provides loans to U.S. 
producers, loans which are guaranteed by their sugar crop. If prices 
fall too low and producers cannot repay the loans, the farmers 
simply forfeit a part of their crop or all of their crop, leaving 
Washington holding millions of tonnes of unwanted sugar. That is 
exactly what we were trying to stop through the Uruguay round of 
the GATT.
<P>
	Not too long ago Washington assigned allotments or quotas to 
domestic producers, which could now force a lot of the excess 
sugar northward across our border. It is  entirely possible, as the 
U.S. border closes to our Canadian sugar products, that our market 
could be flooded by the same American sugar products that are 
highly subsidized and trying to find a new home. In the past the 
Americans have sold Canada twice as much sugar as they buy from 
us, running up surpluses of some $230 million.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Another fact worth noting is that the industry in Canada is 
extremely efficient and only about 10 per cent of it receives 
deficiency payments when prices drop. I am referring to the refined 
beet sugar industry in Alberta.
<P>
	Even though I support the bill I wonder whether another 
approach might not be just as good, if not better. Since the 
American industry is heavily subsidized, I wonder whether 
instituting a countervail action might not be a more honourable 
way to proceed. We do not need to let the Americans get away with 
this underhanded action, yet it would be preferable if we could take 
the high road and not stoop to the same level. It is just a thought. I 
guess we need to bring the Americans to the table and negotiate an 
end to the situation.
<P>
	I support the bill. Should it become votable I will vote in favour. 
I certainly do not want anything to disrupt my supply of bonbons.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would ask the House for unanimous consent that 
Bill C-311 be given votable status and that it be voted on, on 
Thursday, October 5, 1995.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the bill before us to protest the trade practices 
exhibited by the United States against the Canadian sugar industry 
and against Canadians.
<P>
	The U.S. imposed severe new trade restrictions against Canadian 
sugar and products containing sugar on January 1, 1995, effectively 
closing its borders to imports of Canadian refined sugar and food 
products containing sugar. Its actions unfairly penalize the 
efficiencies of the Canadian sugar industry and unfairly penalize 
Canadians.
<P>
	The United States extended the coverage of a tariff rate quota on 
products containing sugar by including crystal drink mixes, for 
which Canada is the main supplier. Also, on January 1, 1995, the 
United States limited Canadian exports of refined sugar to 8,000 
tonnes until September 30, 1995, further eroding Canada's access 
to the U.S. markets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14787"> 14787 </A></B>
<P>
	The unwillingness of the United States government to act fairly 
in attempts to resolve the dispute and its disregard and violation 
of general fair trading principles has resulted in undue harm to 
Canadians, with potential consequences for the sugar beet 
growers, sugar beet processors and Canadian cane refiners in the 
long term.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is a severe reduction in sales of Canadian sugar and 
products containing sugar in the United States and an increase in 
American sugar sales in Canada. Canadian producers are paying 
dearly for this and Canadian jobs are being cut.
<P>
	Entire communities have suffered, and additional job losses are 
predicted. According to the Canadian industry, the Americans 
constitute about one quarter of the Canadian market, while 
Canadians represent only 3 per cent of the American market. That 
difference is remarkable. Far worse, while the American share of 
the Canadian market is on the upswing, the Canadian share of the 
American market is decreasing. American exports to Canada are 
four times greater than Canadian exports to the U.S.
<P>
	Our market is open and barrier free. On the other hand, 
Canadians are faced with tariffs which discourage free trade 
between the two countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
which include both Canada and the United States, agreed that they 
would reduce barriers to trade and increase market access over 
time, with the objective of creating a more open and stable trading 
environment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I myself have seen the damage to communities and individuals. 
BC Sugar Refinery Ltd. is located in the Port of Vancouver in my 
constituency of Vancouver East.
<P>
	On June first of this year, the company's western Canadian 
operations were consolidated under the name Rogers Sugar Ltd. 
Rogers Sugar is the main sugar outlet in the west but it has had to 
lay off 17 per cent of its employees in the last 16 months. Most of 
the lost jobs were in Vancouver, the others in Alberta and 
Manitoba.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Unless the restrictions against Canadian sugar are lifted, Rogers 
Sugar may be forced to lay off more of its employees. Across 
Canada the situation is equally as dire, if not more so.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Since 1980 we have seen the closure of four Canadian sugar 
refineries and job losses in excess of 40 per cent are a direct result 
of these practices. We risk the closure and the relocation of many 
Canadian companies to the United States lured by lower prices for 
sugar.
<P>
	The U.S. trade restrictions also hurt Canadians as consumers as 
they result in higher sugar prices and may lead to the decline of 
high quality domestic sugar.
<P>
	The sugar industry has enjoyed years of success and has 
provided meaningful employment for hundreds of Canadians 
across the country. It has demonstrated it is efficient and cost 
competitive, but the viability and very existence of our sugar 
industry is threatened by unfair trade practices. The Canadian 
government has acted in good faith throughout and has worked 
diligently to resolve this dispute and is left with this option, the 
measures contained in the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to conclude by stating how proud I am of the efforts 
of Canadian parliamentarians to resolve these differences. A 
parliamentary caucus has been set up by my colleague for 
Fundy-Royal and I am very proud to have also been a member.
<P>
	The participating MPs and senators represent all parties in the 
House. They, along with representatives of the sugar industry, have 
worked very hard to resolve the matter. I am sure that this 
co-operation will help Canada persuade the Americans of the 
importance of reducing tariffs in this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for the opportunity to speak to Bill C-311.
<P>
	I support the remarks of the hon. member for Fundy-Royal 
which were very appropriate, very accurate, very non-partisan and 
certainly appreciated by this side of the House. The Bloc 
Quebecois member and member of the sugar caucus, the hon. 
member for Verchères, also made very appropriate remarks. I 
totally endorse his remarks as well since they were a very positive 
and constructive contribution to the debate and to the support of the 
principle of the bill before us.
<P>
	I would also like to thank my colleague from Peace River as the 
Reform caucus trade critic for his support of the sugar industry 
whether in the area of production of sugar beet sugar or the import 
of sugar cane, which is refined in our country, and for supporting 
the industries that use Canadian sugar in a variety of products that 
are exported not only to the United States but to many other places 
in the world.
<P>
	I give those compliments on the grounds that it shows this issue 
can be dealt with in a non-partisan way. It is a basic issue to the 
country. It is a basic area where Canadians can compete in the 
world market, can make a contribution not only economically but 
also in an indirect sense can provide many social benefits to the 
Canadian fabric.
<P>
	I support the comments made with regard to the Helms-Burton 
bill. I am pleased like other members here that Congress and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14788"> 14788 </A></B>
<P>
Senate are seeing fit to make some  changes that will be of benefit 
to the sugar industry of Canada.
<P>
	The point I wanted to make is one of the reasons beyond 
supporting the concepts already before the House. It is with regard 
to the attitude I gathered of the American Sugar Alliance. The 
alliance is an executive group which represents not only the 
producers but also the refiners, the sugar beet producers, the cane 
producers and the refiners of those two respective products. I want 
to talk about that group's attitude with regard to the situation and 
the advice they gave us as a committee when we visited 
Washington.
<P>
	I would have to say very bluntly that we were stonewalled in our 
presentation. I raised a question with the alliance. I said to the 
alliance: ``I believe we have set before you the current Canadian 
circumstances. We are going to have limited exports. The exports 
will be reduced in terms of refined sugar from some 43,000 tonnes 
down to 22,000 tonnes. Of that 22,000 tonnes we in Canada have 
no idea. We may get some. We may get half. We may get a little 
more than that, but we could end up not receiving any portion of 
that 22,000 tonnes of export opportunity into the U.S. market''. We 
could be shut out completely if the Americans wanted to do that.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I also said: ``Between our two countries we have the concept of 
free trade. My sugar beet producers back home support free trade. 
The refiners support free trade. We are open to that concept. We 
feel that could work very well between our two nations''.
<P>
	I asked how we could work together, how we could improve the 
circumstances we face in Canada and what they were prepared to 
do as an alliance. Their remarks were very clear and forthright: 
``Why do you not go home and do what we have done in the United 
States? Why not do the same thing?'' What does that really mean?
<P>
	It means we would put on import quotas with regard to some 
products. Maybe we would have to use other products as leverage, 
but we would put a quota on the import of sugar and products 
containing sugar into Canada. We would be reversing a trend that is 
the essence of free trade. That was the first thing they asked us to 
do, to go home and do the same thing they were doing with regard 
to imports.
<P>
	I asked about pricing. They said to go home and establish a 
pricing system so there is a floor price for sugar in Canada, which 
there is not today, and our sugar producers are not asking for that. 
``Go home and do the same thing''. They said to go home and put 
on import quotas, go home and put a floor price on sugar.
<P>
	That is totally in contrast and is a negative interface into the way 
we want our North American economy and our economy relative 
even to Mexico to evolve. We want free trade and an open system 
by which we can work  together, compete together, but also profit 
together. It is totally in contrast and I was very disappointed in that.
<P>
	I raise that issue because underlying that attitude are political 
forces which exist in the United States. Congressmen who 
represent sugar beet areas, sugar producing areas or sugar cane 
areas, or refiners in their respective constituencies are faced with 
that dilemma. They are lobbied by the sugar alliance to work 
against opening the borders to Canadian exports so that we could 
again maybe export 43,000 tonnes of refined sugar.
<P>
	A major portion of that sugar was sugar beet sugar from southern 
Alberta. We can clearly understand the effect that has on my 
constituency of Lethbridge and the constituency of Medicine Hat 
which is adjacent to mine where there is a major industry. The 
sugar beet industry has been one of the solid foundations of the 
economy of southern Alberta. Losing it would be a drastic disaster 
to the cities of Lethbridge and Medicine Hat, the rural areas and 
Alberta as a whole.
<P>
	We are fighting against that kind of attitude and that kind of 
politics in these negotiations. I ask that when the government is in 
negotiations it understand that force is out there. Part of our 
strategy as Canadians and as a sugar caucus is that we must deal 
with it knowing there is this kind of anti-force when working 
toward free trade, a free exchange of ideas and free competition 
between our two nations.
<P>
	I certainly support the concept of the bill. It may be a lever to try 
and open up the discussions and to relax some of those political 
attitudes which now exist in the mill and which we have to deal 
with to come to the conclusion we think should be arrived at.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	I appreciate the work the chairman of the sugar caucus has done. 
I appreciate that the government has made representations on the 
issue but I urge it to work quickly. It was indicated to us that around 
September 15 the U.S. department of agriculture would be making 
a recommendation on what portion of the 22,000 tonnes we would 
get as Canadians. I hope the government and the ministers of 
agriculture and trade are making a strong recommendation.
<P>
	We should have at least two-thirds of that 22,000 tonnes for 
Canadian exports. If that were there at least we would be able to 
have some assurance that our sugar beet industry and cane industry 
in terms of refining would be stabilized and we would be able to 
continue in the year or two ahead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in closing 
the debate today I pay tribute to the new process which in many 
ways we as members of Parliament have brought about in a modest 
way in attempting to speak out for an issue that stands for all of us 
in Canada. That is the issue of our sugar workers, whether those 
workers are working in the fields of western Canada or producing  
and refining sugar in Montreal, Vancouver or Saint John. I am very 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14789"> 14789 </A></B>
<P>
gratified to express to all members of the sugar caucus my 
appreciation for their co-operation, guidance and advice.
<P>
	This is a complex issue which has affected all of our 
constituents. As I said in my opening remarks, we have lost almost 
four and possibly five plants over the last 10 years in Canada and 
1,000 direct jobs. We are very worried about the industry.
<P>
	Bill C-311 is a line in the sand, or a line in the sugar in this case. 
We as members of Parliament have said we are looking for levers. 
We are looking for ways to express our concern, our dissatisfaction 
and our outrage at the way Americans have access to our market. 
Yet we do not have unfettered access to theirs.
<P>
	I urge the House leadership and the ministers of agriculture and 
international trade, as the hon. House leader for the Reform Party 
has said, to make a very strong case to our American cousins. Tell 
them we need some of the rate quota that is being allocated over the 
next couple of weeks. If we can get some of that quota back, our 
caucus will have gone a long way in making some important 
statements to the Americans. They will understand this is not a 
political issue for us in terms of Liberals, New Democrats, Reform 
or Bloc; this is a Canadian issue and an issue affecting all of us. It 
affects all workers in our country.
<P>
	With that I want to thank the House. Perhaps because it is a very 
important issue and an issue of such strong national concern, I 
would like to make a last plea that we be given an opportunity to 
vote on the issue. I move for unanimous consent to have that voted 
on now.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since no more members wish to speak and the motion was not 
selected as a votable item, the hour provided for consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired and the item is 
dropped from the Order Paper, pursuant to Standing Order 96(1).

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-103, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act and the Income 
Tax Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to introduce the second 
reading stage of Bill C-103, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act and 
the Income Tax Act. The purpose of this bill is to support Canada's 
cultural industries, and especially the periodicals industry.
<P>
	Canadian periodicals are essential to cultural expression in 
Canada. They bring Canadians together from coast to coast. They 
provide a clearing house for the exchange of ideas and information. 
They disseminate information and points of view that are specific 
to this country and provide a voice for the country's artistic and 
cultural expression.
<P>
	Issues that concern Canadian periodicals are important to the 
public. More than 1,400 periodicals are sold in Canada. They are an 
integral part of the media environment of Canadians and, from the 
economic point of view, constitute a substantial part of the cultural 
sector.
<P>
	Today, more than 92 per cent of the content of Canadian 
periodicals is Canadian. Some of the more popular ones which 
have a long publishing history, like <I>Saturday Night</I> and <I>L'Actualité</I>, 
have become genuine institutions.
<P>
	Strong and diverse editorial content notwithstanding, limited 
circulation figures will necessarily restrict the volume and viability 
of Canadian periodicals. The problem is the relative size of the 
market and economies of scale.
<P>
	Over the years, Canadians have consistently shown that 
periodicals are important to them. For instance, in 1978 and in 
1990, an increasing number of families preferred to spend their 
recreation budget on Canadian or foreign periodicals as opposed to 
any other cultural activity, with the exception of buying 
newspapers.
<P>
	Bill C-103 provides for the implementation of two measures 
which I announced following recommendations by the task force 
on the Canadian periodicals industry. The first measure consists in 
imposing an excise tax in respect of split run editions of periodicals 
distributed in Canada. In these split run editions, publishers reuse 
content which was targeted at their own market and which made 
money there and insert new advertising intended for a foreign 
market.
<P>
	These so-called Canadian split run editions are inexpensive to 
publish and attract lucrative advertising. It is therefore not 
surprising that they pose a serious threat to the long term viability 
of the entire periodical industry.
<P>
	The second measure is an anti-avoidance rule with respect to the 
deductibility of advertising expenses. Let me explain. Advertising 
revenues are essential to the survival of the periodical industry; 65 
per cent of the revenues of Canadian periodicals come from 
advertising. Since 1965, two measures taken by the Government of 
Canada have helped inject advertising revenues into the  Canadian 
periodical industry. These revenues enable it to live alongside the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14790"> 14790 </A></B>
<P>
powerful American periodical industry, which has direct access to 
readers, to newsstands and to Canadian distributers.
<P>
	These two measures are custom tariff 9958, which prohibits the 
importing of split run periodicals, and section 19 of the Income Tax 
Act, which permits the deduction of the costs of advertising 
directed primarily at the Canadian market, on the condition that 
this advertising is placed in Canadian editions of Canadian owned 
or controlled periodicals.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	These measures paid off, because they led to the growth of the 
Canadian periodical industry. Thanks to them, the industry has 
expanded and prospered.
<P>
	In April 1993, however, <I>Sports Illustrated Canada </I>was launched 
in Canada. It was a split run edition, printed in Canada and 
transmitted directly electronically from the United States. 
Canadian advertisements were substituted for American ones, and 
a little Canadian content was added. Sports Illustrated Canada 
managed to get around custom tariff 9958, because most of its 
content was sent electronically from the United States. It was 
simply a loophole in the tariff laws since electronic transmission 
made it possible to avoid tariff regulations.
<P>
	In March 1993, the Government of Canada set up a task force on 
the Canadian magazine industry. The task force's mandate was to 
find ways to modernize the existing measures underpinning 
government policy on the magazine industry.
<P>
	After researching the problem, the task force concluded that split 
run editions presented a real threat to the Canadian magazine 
industry, which stood to lose up to 40 per cent of its advertising 
revenue over a five year period. According to the task force, such 
losses would put many magazines out of business and marginalize 
even successful ones.
<P>
	Task force members explored several avenues and finally 
concluded that the proposed excise tax was the best solution. It 
could be designed and implemented in order to avoid split run 
editions.
<P>
	The task force's main recommendation is therefore the key 
element of this bill, whose purpose is to amend the Excise Tax Act 
and address the problem of split run editions printed in Canada. 
This new excise tax would apply to all periodicals distributed in 
Canada and containing more than 20 per cent of reused editorial 
material as well as one or more advertisements aimed at Canadians.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Excise Tax Act will impose an 
80 per cent tax on the value of all advertisements appearing in a 
Canadian split run edition. Depending on circumstances, the tax 
would be paid by  Canadian publishers, distributors, printers or 
wholesalers and not by consumers.
<P>
	Periodicals otherwise subject to the tax would be exempted from 
the tax based on the number of split run editions that were 
distributed in Canada during the 12 month period ending on March 
26, 1993, the day the task force was set up.
<P>
	This tax would not restrict access to the foreign periodicals 
Canadians enjoy reading. It will make it possible to modernize a 
government policy that is already several years old.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act will add an 
anti-avoidance rule to section 19 of the act. The purpose of this 
provision is to ensure that newspapers and periodicals that claim to 
be Canadian are in fact Canadian owned and controlled for the 
purposes of the act.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The other recommendations of the task force deal with 
strengthening the industry through increasing the effectiveness of 
existing measures. Bill C-103, the legislation now before the House 
to amend the Excise Tax Act and the Income Tax Act, would not 
change or create new policy concerning Canada's magazine 
industry. It would simply provide a new tool to support a 
longstanding magazine policy. The tax would close the loophole in 
the existing policy framework.
<P>
	The emergence of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada as a new Canadian 
split run edition revealed to us that we should re-examine our 
policy instruments which support the Canadian magazine industry. 
This led to the formation of the task force, the resulting 
recommendations and the proposed new excise tax. In short, we are 
modernizing the policy tools that underpin this important sector of 
Canada's cultural industries.
<P>
	I repeat that the excise tax would not result in a tax for Canadian 
consumers. The publisher, the distributor, the printer or the 
wholesaler of any magazine subject to the tax would be responsible 
for paying the tax.
<P>
	Why is the tax necessary? In view of the challenge to federal 
magazine policy and in particular to custom tariff No. 9958, some 
means must be found to maintain an environment in which 
Canadian magazines can survive and flourish. Canadian magazine 
publishers would be at a grave disadvantage if they were forced to 
compete for advertising revenues with magazines that have 
recovered their editorial costs in markets which are much larger 
than the Canadian market. The average profit for a Canadian 
periodical is only 2.6 per cent. To compare, the average profit for 
U.S. consumer magazines is 12 per cent. Advertising is the most 
important source of revenue for magazines, accounting for 65 per 
cent of income. Ensuring adequate access to those revenues is 
essential in  main-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14791"> 14791 </A></B>
<P>
taining a healthy Canadian magazine industry, benefiting all 
magazines in all regions of the country.
<P>
	The <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada case has sent a signal that it is not 
possible for split run editions to enter the Canadian advertising 
market in spite of the policy measures in place. The threat to the 
health of the industry is real. The Canadian industry could lose up 
to 40 per cent of its advertising revenue over five years. The task 
force noted that such a loss would put many magazines out of 
business and marginalize even successful ones.
<P>
	Clearly we do not have the resources to provide the magazine 
industry with a direct subsidy program that would offset the split 
run problem. The proposed tax, however, would bring the support 
framework up to date.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is committed to the continued 
existence of a viable Canadian magazine industry. We recognize 
that advertising is key to the health of the magazine industry. The 
new tax is consistent with Canada's international trade agreements 
and obligations. Canada is the most open country in the world to 
imported magazines. The new excise tax will not limit the access of 
Canadians to foreign publications. Furthermore, the new tax will 
not be borne by the general consumer.
<P>
	Finally, the new excise tax updates the legislative framework 
supporting Canada's longstanding magazine industry. The 
Government of Canada agrees with the findings of the task force on 
the magazine industry. The best way to support the Canadian 
magazine industry is to adopt measures which will encourage 
original content, regardless of the country of origin. We do not 
want the kind of recycled editorial material that is commonly 
dumped into split runs. We want a Canadian magazine industry that 
reflects Canadian voices.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The legislation now before the House for second reading 
promises to provide the kind of environment in which the Canadian 
magazine industry can survive and thrive.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues in the House to promptly pass the 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my remarks today will focus on Bill C-103, an act to 
amend the Excise Tax and the Income Tax Act. This bill's purpose 
is twofold: to put an end to the distribution of split run editions in 
Canada by imposing a tax at the rate of 80 percent of the value of 
all the advertisements contained in these editions and, second, 
strengthen section 19 of the Income Tax Act so that tax deductions 
for advertising in Canadian newspapers or periodicals really apply 
only where the advertisement is placed in newspapers and 
periodicals  owned by Canadian interests or ones with Canadian 
content.
<P>
	How is split run edition defined in the legislation? Split run 
edition of a periodical means an edition of an issue of the periodical 
that is distributed in Canada, in which more than 20 percent of the 
editorial material is the same as editorial material that appears in 
the original foreign issue, and which contains advertising sold in 
Canada.
<P>
	Let us now ask ourselves what justifies the government in taking 
such action. Is it acting out of sudden concern for Canadian culture 
or is this a positive step taken by the heritage minister? No such 
thing. As usual, instead of acting on its own initiative, the 
government is merely reacting to legitimate pressure exerted by the 
Canadian periodical industry for many years.
<P>
	In fact, after Time Warner announced its intention to print a split 
run edition of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> in Canada, the Canadian magazine 
publishing community reacted strongly to this announcement, 
especially since this would considerably reduce Time Warner's 
advertising expenditures, thereby draining the magazine 
advertising market.
<P>
	The magazine industry began to exert this pressure, and sounded 
the alarm back in the spring of 1993. It would have been 
appropriate for the government to act then, since the Mulroney 
government had all the tools required to do so at the time. Instead, 
he shirked his responsibility and appointed a task force on the 
Canadian periodical industry. The Liberal Party, which then formed 
the opposition, denounced the Conservatives' failure to act 
regarding that issue, as well as their lack of energy in defending 
Canadian culture. Who would have thought that, once in office, the 
Liberals would do nothing in the first two years of their mandate 
for Canadian culture, except to sell it piece by piece on a silver 
platter to American interests.
<P>
	In March 1994, the task force released its report. It was not until 
June 1995, over a year later, that the government replied to the 
recommendations contained in that report by tabling Bill C-103, 
which we are debating today. Now that we understand what brought 
on this legislation, let us ask this question: Why did the Canadian 
periodical industry object to a split-run edition of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> 
on our market? First, because the situation of the Canadian market 
for magazines is precarious and even fragile.
<P>
	Indeed, in 1991, more than half of the 1,440 magazines sold in 
Canada had never generated any operating profit, while such 
profits for the industry as a whole stood at 2.36 per cent. To make 
things even worse, these operating profits were on a downward 
trend. From 1987 to 1991, operating profits for English language 
magazines went from 5.2 per cent to 2.6 per cent, while those for 
French language magazines went down from 8 per cent to 2.7 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14792"> 14792 </A></B>
<P>
cent. In fact, the Canadian market for  magazines must face the 
same pressures as our audio-visual industry.
<P>
	The six main factors which make this industry fragile were well 
summarized by the task force in its report entitled <I>A matter of 
Balance</I>.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	These factors are as follows: First, there is the massive 
penetration of imported magazines. According to the task force, 
foreign magazines account for 81.4 per cent of all magazines sold 
in newsstands, and for a little more than half of the total number of 
mass circulation English language magazines in Canada. As in the 
case of the audio-visual industry, that foreign penetration is mostly 
of American origin. For example, English language foreign 
magazines sold in Canada total close to 236 million copies, of 
which 233 million come from the United States. Therefore, Canada 
annually imports 25 times more magazines from the U.S. than it 
exports.
<P>
	Second, because of Canada's relatively small population and the 
fact that it is split into two different linguistic groups, the potential 
number of readers here is only one tenth of that in the United 
States. This severely limits the potential circulation of our 
magazines, as well as the revenues which can be generated from 
advertising.
<P>
	Third, Canadians are interested in foreign cultural products and 
are therefore avid readers of American magazines.
<P>
	The fourth factor is the price of imported magazines compared to 
Canadian ones, which have to try to be competitive. However, it 
must be recognized that foreign magazines, which have a greater 
potential number of readers, generate more advertising revenues 
and, consequently, produce magazines which may be more 
appealing and which are certainly cheaper.
<P>
	Fifth, competition by foreign magazines at the newsstand. Over 
81 per cent of English magazines which can be found in newsstands 
are imported from the United States. I believe that magazine 
subscriptions depend, to a large extent, on the visibility of the 
magazine at the newsstand.
<P>
	Sixth, the ban on tobacco advertising in Canada was very costly 
for Canadian magazines, depriving them of at least $10 million in 
revenues, based on statistics for the last year when advertising was 
allowed. Meanwhile, this type of advertising was still allowed in 
the United States earning American magazines $224 million in 
1992. Obviously, such an injection of money makes it possible to 
sell the product much cheaper.
<P>
	To protect the magazine industry, Canada took measures which, 
for years, satisfied the industry. The first one was the postal 
subsidy, which is 100 years old and which I will come back to later. 
The second one is section 19 of the Income Tax Act, which allows 
taxpayers to be granted a tax deduction if they advertise in a 
Canadian  magazine defined as being 75 per cent Canadian owned 
with 80 per cent Canadian editorial content.
<P>
	However, this measure is affected by the bill before us which is 
aimed at tightening this provision, following a recommendation to 
this effect by the task force. A number of witnesses reported that 
Taxation Canada was lax in controlling the application of this 
provision. Several taxpayers are said to have claimed 
advertisements in magazines which did not meet either of the 
above mentioned section 19 criteria.
<P>
	The third measure is Canadian custom tariff 9958 preventing 
split run editions from entering Canada. Spilt run magazines 
printed outside Canada were not allowed in. For thirty years, this 
legislation kept them from entering Canada, but <I>Sports Illustrated</I>, 
using technology, outsmarted Canada in its efforts to protect its 
periodical industry, transmitting via satellite the American content 
of the magazine to be printed in Canada.
<P>
	The bill before us today redresses this situation. If it passes, 
which remains to be seen, the distribution of split run editions will 
be banned or those involved will have to pay an 80 per cent excise 
tax on advertising revenues derived from this transaction.
<P>
	Without the prospect of earning a lot of money at the expense of 
Canadian culture, <I>Sports Illustrated</I> should disappear soon.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois agrees with the last two measures the 
government is proposing in the bill we are debating today, that is 
the tax and the limited application of section 19 of the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	We will support the government in its efforts to abolish this 
loophole which allowed <I>Sports Illustrated</I> to squeeze out of 
Canadian magazines 250,000 dollars' worth of advertising for each 
issue published.
<P>
	However, we feel that the government is stopping half way. The 
task force did recommend other measures to support the Canadian 
magazine industry. We would like the government to follow up on 
these recommendations as soon as possible.
<P>
	Let us come back for a few minutes to the postal subsidies 
program. Created more than a hundred years ago, this assistance 
program is really useful for readers. It allows all Canadians to 
receive magazines, books and newspapers through the mail since it 
helps pay for the real cost of transporting such reading material. 
Not so long ago, that program's budget was $220 million a year.
<P>
	At the beginning of the eighties, the government and the 
Magazine Association of Canada began negotiating the updating of 
that program. They even agreed on a replacement formula. But 
then the federal government decided to make some arbitrary cuts. 
The replacement program was never implemented. Nonetheless, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14793"> 14793 </A></B>
<P>
the resource envelope of postal subsidies will decrease from  its 
1990 level of $220 million to $50 million in 1996-1997.
<P>
	In its report, the task force wrote this about postal subsidies, and 
I quote: ``The viability of the Canadian magazine and periodical 
industry depends heavily on the postal subsidy. Canadian 
newsstands, particularly in the English language market, are 
dominated by foreign publications: only 18.6 per cent of the 
English language consumer magazines sold at newsstands are 
Canadian. The task force strongly urges the government to 
recognize the vital importance of this program to the industry and 
to preserve it for future years''.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois invites the government to follow up on the 
task force recommendation to freeze funds for the postal subsidy 
program at the level they were in 1995.
<P>
	The task force on periodicals put forward another measure on 
which the government remains surprisingly silent: the abolition of 
the GST on all reading materials. The task force wrote in its report, 
and I quote: ``The government should give serious consideration to 
eliminating any sales tax on reading materials in any new tax 
regime that includes exemptions''.
<P>
	This tax must be eliminated for several reasons. First, it was a 
Liberal promise. In March 1994, Carol Martin, a reporter, wrote in 
<I>The Canadian Forum</I> about the magazine situation. He was 
reminding us that the Liberal caucus had adopted the following 
resolution, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``A Liberal government would reaffirm the historical principles 
embodied in tax free stages for the printed word and remove the 
goods and services tax, GST, on reading materials''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	According to the Magazine Association of Canada, 50 million 
U.S. copies will not pay the GST and thus enjoy an undue 
advantage of 7 per cent over their Canadian counterparts.
<P>
	The subscription loss due to the introduction of the GST is 
another reason for eliminating this tax. The Canadian magazine 
industry had predicted that it would lose one percentage point of 
subscribers for each tax point that was introduced. Unfortunately, 
the facts proved it was right. During the first year of the GST 
implementation, the subscriber rate fell 6 per cent.
<P>
	Finally, among the G-7 partners, Canada holds, with Germany, 
the sad record of the highest tax on any reading material.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Another recommendation by the task force deserves 
consideration, and the Bloc Quebecois urges the government to 
implement it as soon as possible, given its financial situation. Here 
it is: ``That the federal and provincial governments, their agencies 
and corporations,  make every effort to support the Canadian 
magazine industry by placing magazine or periodical 
advertisements directed at the Canadian market in a way that is 
consistent with federal government policy regarding Canadian 
periodical publishing''.
<P>
	That recommendation is all the more meaningful when we 
realize that the Canadian government is one of the 30 biggest 
advertisement buyers in <I>Time Magazine</I>, a grandfathered split run 
periodical. Through its action, the government undermines its own 
directives concerning advertisements in foreign magazines.
<P>
	Finally, the Bloc Quebecois would have liked the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage to draw a lesson from his last two years' 
experience and swiftly implement the following recommendation 
made by the task force: ``That the Investment Canada Act be 
amended to provide that, when the Minister responsible for that 
Act issues an opinion or takes any step or makes any 
recommendation in connection with matters relating to Canada's 
heritage or national identity concerning magazines or periodicals 
and the applicability of the Investment Canada Act, he or she do so 
with the concurrence of the Minister of Canadian Heritage''.
<P>
	It is indeed surprising that the bill before us today remains silent 
on this crucial point for the heritage department, all the more so 
because that recommendation was not included in the report by 
accident. Here, in fact, is the underlying anecdote.
<P>
	In March 1993, when Time Warner thought about launching a 
split run edition of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> in Canada, they went to see 
Investment Canada. Time Warner wanted to know if Investment 
Canada would consider the coming of the split run edition of <I>Sports 
Illustrated </I>magazine as a new business and, in that case, subject to 
an investigation, or if instead it would consider it simply as the 
continuance of Time Warner's activities in Canada. At the time, 
Investment Canada informed Time Warner that it considered the 
coming of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> as the continuance of Time Warner's 
activities in Canada.
<P>
	When Canadian magazines owners heard that Investment 
Canada had given its approval to the coming of a split run edition 
of <I>Sports Illustrated</I>, they naturally went to the minister who was 
supposed to be their natural defender, the Minister of 
Communications. However, nobody in the communications 
department was aware of the authorization given to Time Warner 
by Investment Canada, neither the minister nor the deputy minister.
<P>
	Now I would like to let the members of the task force speak, 
since they reflect my way of thinking and that of the Bloc 
Quebecois. I quote: ``Indeed, the Task Force considers it essential 
that the Minister responsible for the <I>Investment Canada Act</I> obtain 
the concurrence of the Minister of Canadian Heritage before 
issuing an opinion on the applicability or non-applicability of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14794"> 14794 </A></B>
<P>
Act or  taking any other step related to a proposed investment in the 
magazine or periodical publishing and distribution sector''.
<P>
	By the way, I would like to take this first opportunity I get to 
remind the minister that we are still waiting for the government 
publishing policy he promised us following the Ginn Publishing 
incident. Now, our neighbours to the South, through their trade 
secretary, Mickey Kantor, have reacted to this bill now before the 
House. The Canadian government which has always been very 
impressed by this U.S. spokesperson until now, must not give in 
this time. We must see the process through and see to it that this bill 
is given assent.
<P>
	If the government does not put an end right now to these split 
runs like <I>Sports Illustrated</I>, if it does not set Time Warner straight 
right now, the task force on the Canadian magazine industry 
believes that, first, 94 per cent of all profitable magazines would 
move to zero operating profit; second, the viability of the Canadian 
periodical publishing industry would be at risk; and third, as the 
task force put it, and I quote: ``The Canadian magazine industry 
would be seriously hurt by the entry of split-runs, and its important 
contribution to Canadian communication and cultural development 
would be diminished''.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I am worried. I am afraid that the government will backtrack and 
I even doubt whether it will go through with this bill.
<P>
	In the last few years, in culture, the Canadian government has 
shown so many times that it was putty in the hands of the United 
States that I fear the worst.
<P>
	On September 15, at the Canadian Conference of the Arts held in 
Toronto, the heritage minister gave a so-called major speech on 
culture before an attentive audience. However, during his speech, 
he barely mentioned this bill which is one of the most important 
cultural initiatives undertaken by his government since it came into 
office. I have carefully read and reread his speech, from beginning 
to end. I would like to say a few words about that speech to you and 
to those who are listening today because the truth has to be told 
about the Liberals who were very quick to criticize when they were 
in opposition, but who have become a very passive and 
wait-and-see government. There is a clear lack of leadership from 
this government, particularly in the area of culture.
<P>
	Two aspects of the minister's speech captured my attention. 
First, the Minister of Canadian Heritage shared his feelings about 
our neighbours to the south. He reminded us, among other things, 
that, for many Americans, the word culture has no particular 
meaning, that it is only the forces of the products and of the 
entertainment industry that count.
<P>
	Concerning the information highway, the minister said, and I 
quote: ``We certainly have to keep in mind that the United States 
have already indicated, in international negotiations or through 
retaliation measures, their intention to limit the development of our 
Canadian cultural policy.'' Continuing his overview of our cultural 
policy, he then talked about the film and video sector. On that 
subject, he accused previous governments of not having done 
enough in this area. He said, and I quote: ``Today, a large part of 
this sector is owned by foreign interests and most of the revenues 
from this sector leave the country.''
<P>
	He added: ``As for our relationship with the American film 
industry, it is a different story. You are all aware of the American 
presence in our movie theatres and in our video market and you are 
also aware of the unsolved problem with regard to film 
distribution-We want a film industry that is truly Canadian- 
This requires fundamental changes in the American mentality and 
in the way Americans do business. They should stop considering 
Canada as being part of the American market. They know better 
than anyone how to finance new productions through the marketing 
of commercial rights. They also know that our ability to do the 
same is limited by the lack of a level playing field.''
<P>
	To conclude his thoughts about the United States, the minister 
said that he hopes, one day, to share the opinion and the optimism 
of Robert Lantos, president of Alliance Communications, who said 
at the Montreal World Film Festival that he sees encouraging signs 
on the Hollywood hills.
<P>
	In view of these signs, the Minister of Canadian Heritage is 
considering including in our film policy measures that will 
improve our position vis-à-vis the Americans. He will contemplate 
the opportunity. With such an hypothetical political will, you will 
understand that the minister did not succeed in alleviating my 
concerns regarding the American invasion of the Canadian cultural 
field.
<P>
	Finally, there is a last element of the minister's statement to 
which I would like to draw your attention. The minister quoted the 
red book where culture is defined in these words: ``Culture 
embraces our shared perceptions and beliefs, common experiences 
and values, and diverse linguistic and cultural identities: 
everything that makes us uniquely Canadian. Culture is the very 
essence of national identity, the bedrock of national sovereignty 
and national pride. At a time when globalization and the 
information and communications revolution are erasing national 
borders, Canada needs more than ever to commit itself to cultural 
development.
<P>
	Those are the fundamentals of the debate that is presently going 
on in Canada. In Canada, the minister speaks of Canadian culture, 
and that is only natural. In Quebec, there is a Quebecois culture 
which is just as normal and legitimate. If I take the definition of 
culture  provided by the minister and apply it to Quebec, here is 
what I end up with: The Quebec culture is the sum of various 
artistic, linguistic and religious expressions and of the intellectual 
and moral values of the country which we will create on October 
30, culture being what makes us different from other countries. 
Culture is the very essence of Quebec's national identity. Culture is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14795"> 14795 </A></B>
<P>
the very basis of sovereignty and pride in the country that is 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	For me, there is not even the shadow of a doubt. The land north 
of the 45th parallel which extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific 
to the Arctic is composed of two countries. One has ties to the 
English culture and the other to the French.
<P>
	In 1982, the Canadian portion outside Quebec became separatist. 
The constitution was unilaterally patriated and signed without the 
consent of Quebec. Since then, the people of Quebec have come to 
realize and understand fully that there is now only one founding 
people in this country-anglophones-and consequently, only one 
culture-the Canadian culture-enriched, of course, by the 
positive and remarkable contributions of all ethnic groups in 
Canada. In its very essence and uniqueness, the Canadian culture 
denies the Quebec culture.
<P>
	The people of Quebec do not see themselves reflected in 
Canada's artistic, linguistic, religious, intellectual and moral 
expressions. The people of Quebec form a distinct society. The 
people of Quebec know they are different. The people of Quebec 
know that they must express this difference on October 30.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
important to be very clear about the nature of the bill. In essence it 
is designed to kill international competition between magazines, 
more specifically magazines which come into Canada. The killing 
of that competition kills a lot of good things which flow from 
competition.
<P>
	The legislation is really an anachronism. It is a throwback to an 
earlier time when we did not have trans-global communications, 
when people did not always have a great interest in seeing what was 
happening in countries around the world. Clearly that does not fit 
the reality of Canada and the world today.
<P>
	With the bill the minister is walking up to our largest trading 
partner, the United States, poking it in the eye with a stick and 
asking: ``Now what would you like to buy from us?'' This is a step 
backward. Cultural protectionism is no more appropriate today 
than any other kind of protectionism.
<P>
	While the minister is putting forward this measure of cultural 
protectionism the international trade minister, the finance minister 
and others are very anxious about  the bill because they are trying 
to endeavour to liberalize trade in other sectors. We see other 
countries trying to liberalize trade, but for some reason we are 
taking a step back. That betrays an attitude about what the minister 
and people of this mind think about the Canadian periodical 
industry, the people who write for it and the people who read those 
magazines.
<P>
	Canadian magazines do well because they are good. As the hon. 
member from the Bloc pointed out, something like 67 per cent of 
magazines on news stands are Canadian. That is not because there 
is a dictate somewhere which says we must read Canadian 
magazines. It is because people are interested in knowing what is 
happening in their country. They are interested in knowing the 
Canadian perspective.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	According to the Canadian magazine industry task force referred 
to earlier, American magazines are already losing circulation while 
Canadian magazines are gaining circulation. There are good 
reasons for that. People want quality and they are getting it from 
their magazines.
<P>
	The minister pointed to one of the things that has really helped 
Canadian magazines. In that is the seed of the solution not only for 
Canadian magazines but also for anything to do with Canadian 
culture. He pointed to the fact that with the growth in disposable 
income more people are spending more money on Canadian 
periodicals. To me that is a very good indication of where we 
should be going with Canadian cultural policy.
<P>
	In 1988 members of the present government in the House and 
across the country argued against the concept of free trade. Since 
then it is no exaggeration to say that the idea of protectionism has 
been thoroughly vanquished. Not a country in the world that is at 
all prosperous does not believe to a large extent in the idea of free 
trade any more. Even the government since 1988 has turned around 
and decided it can support ideas like NAFTA, the GATT and the 
World Trade Organization because there are some laws of 
economics that are indisputable. Free trade does increase 
prosperity.
<P>
	In a sense Bill C-103 is an extension of an argument against one 
particular law of economics, the economy of scale. All <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> and some of these other split run publications are guilty 
of is utilizing the economy of scale. We do that in Canada and we 
see it all the time. We see it in other sectors. We even see it in the 
magazine sector where for instance <I>Maclean's</I> magazine, which has 
a much larger circulation because it aims at a national audience, is 
able to have a smaller overhead and can produce its product for a 
lot less than a regional magazine like <I>Ottawa Magazine</I> or <I>Alberta 
Report</I>. I do not see anybody railing against them for utilizing the 
economy of scale. It is good economics; it is good business to do 
that kind of thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14796"> 14796 </A></B>
<P>
	It is very misleading when the minister says in his speech that 
if split run publications are allowed to continue in Canada it would 
kill the magazine industry here. It will not be split run publications 
that will contribute to the downfall of any magazine. It will be 
consumers deciding for themselves what magazines they want to 
purchase. That is the key.
<P>
	Cultural policy has to be about what consumers want. They 
certainly have in my judgment more than enough knowledge to 
make those types of decisions.
<P>
	A moment ago I pointed out that we should be concerned about 
poking the United States in the eye with a stick, which is what I feel 
we are doing here because we rely on them to consume a lot of our 
exports. Thirty per cent of our national income comes from 
exports, the great majority of which goes to the United States. I 
wonder even for people of a protectionist sentiment if it really is 
worth it to go around doing these types of things.
<P>
	A moment ago a member of the Bloc Quebecois was talking 
about the need to get Canadian cultural products into the United 
States. Will we really be able to do that when we are on one hand 
closing down our borders to culture and then on the other hand 
saying that we need to get into the United States?
<P>
	We have some real inconsistencies between what is being 
proposed in the magazine industry by the government and what is 
currently happening on the Internet. I do not see this as just 
competition between magazines, American or foreign and 
Canadian. I see it as a competition between different technologies. 
The Internet does not have any kind of regulation that prevents 
people from getting whatever they want. If people are not able to 
subscribe to the magazines they want and get Canadian advertising 
through the periodicals industry, they certainly can get just about 
anything they want off the Internet.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The legislation indicates that the government is not in line with 
what is happening in the world of technology today. On direct to 
home satellite, where the minister's department also has some 
jurisdiction, there is what is called the grey market where all kinds 
of American signals are coming in, completely uninhibited, and 
people have complete access to them.
<P>
	The Canadian periodical industry has to be the same way. We 
must have that kind of direct competition and people can ultimately 
make their own judgments.
<P>
	One thing that is disturbing about the excise tax that is going to 
be put on revenues gained from Canadian advertisers in split run 
editions is that it is a punitive tax. A tax level of 80 per cent will be 
levied against the printers and distributors of these magazines. It is 
a punitive tax. I would argue there have been recent court decisions 
which point out that the purpose of an excise tax is not to be 
punitive, that it is to gather revenue. I  would also argue that this 
measure will not stand up in the courts. The government will have a 
lot of explaining to do when it brings this measure before the 
courts.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about what the minister is implying 
when he brings forward this kind of legislation. He implies several 
things. He implies that people do not appreciate Canadian 
magazines, which is why there needs to be protection for them. He 
implies that Canadian magazines somehow cannot meet the 
standards of quality of magazines from outside the country. He 
implies that Canadian magazine publishers are not as capable in the 
field of business as are American publishers.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I really do not think the minister believes those 
things, but he is implying them. With this legislation he is saying 
that for some reason Canadians do not want to buy Canadian 
magazines. There is a much more positive way to approach a 
cultural policy for Canadian magazines. We should ask what things 
can be done to ensure that Canadian magazines can compete in a 
free economy against magazines from around the world.
<P>
	Probably the best way to approach it is by a method the minister 
hinted at earlier but really did not expand on, which is that if there 
is more money available to Canadian consumers they will buy the 
types of products they want. I believe those will be Canadian 
products because Canadian products can compete with any in the 
world.
<P>
	If the government wants to come up with a cultural policy that 
really benefits Canadians and leaves them complete choice and free 
to pursue value and quality as they define it, it should ensure that 
taxes go down. The best way to do that is to battle the debt and the 
deficit which today is $564 billion. By the end of the government's 
mandate Canadians will be paying something in the order of $51 
billion a year in interest payments on the debt.
<P>
	I do not have to tell members or the people who are watching 
today that it is a very heavy tax load. With that very heavy tax load 
people have less disposable income. It is not only Canadian 
magazines that suffer because of that; it is all of Canadian culture. 
Leisure activities are the first to go when there is a crunch.
<P>
	If the Canadian cultural industry is to be expanded in all its 
permutations, the best way is to ensure that Canadians have more 
disposable income. If members think I am kidding, let us look at 
the United States. The population of the United States, relative to 
ours, has a lot of disposable income. It has a very healthy 
entertainment industry. The correlation between the two is 
absolutely direct. The solution for Canadian culture is not in the 
past or in Bulgaria. We do not have cultural protectionism here. 
The solution is in what has worked in other places in the world. It is 
in what works in other sectors in our own country.

<P>
	Therefore, if we want to find a way to enhance the ability of 
Canadian periodicals, television, the film industry and the book 
publishing industry to succeed, the best way is to knock down the 
barriers, get rid of all the impediments to trade and start levelling 
the playing field by ensuring that we have a tax regime that is 
somewhat comparable to that of our closest trading partner. When 
that day comes I can guarantee that Canadian cultural industries 
will prosper like they have never prospered before.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the United States has 
an advantage. It does not need paid lobbyists. It has 52 members of 
the Reform Party lobbying on its behalf.
<P>
	Bill C-103 is an act to defend the Canadian magazine industry 
and to support the government's longstanding policy on periodical 
publishing.
<P>
	The threat is split runs, a tariff dodge aimed directly at the 
lifeblood of the Canadian magazine industry: its Canadian 
advertising base. Reports commissioned by the task force inform 
us that this tactic, if left unchecked, could consume as much as 40 
per cent of total Canadian magazine advertising revenues, 
devastating the Canadian industry.
<P>
	Successive Canadian governments have had a longstanding 
history of implementing structural measures which provide support 
to the Canadian magazine industry. These measures have helped 
the Canadian periodical industry to survive in a challenging and 
difficult environment.
<P>
	The importance of Canadian periodicals has long been 
recognized. Thirty years ago the O'Leary Royal Commission on 
Publications observed that Canadian magazines provide the critical 
analysis, informed discourse and dialogue which are an 
indispensable part of Canadian society.
<P>
	The O'Leary report on the role of publications had a mandate of 
finding ways of furthering the development of the Canadian 
identity through a genuinely Canadian periodical press. The 
recommendations of this report have formed the basis of federal 
periodical publishing policy.
<P>
	As this commission pointed out in its 1961 report, the larger a 
periodical's circulation, the more advertising it can attract and the 
greater its advertising revenue. The more it can afford to spend on 
editorial content, the better are its chances of obtaining more 
circulation. In other words, advertising dollars are the key element 
which determines the business success of a periodical.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The O'Leary Report recommended that the Canadian periodical 
industry be supported by measures which would channel Canadian 
advertising revenues to Canadian magazines.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Two policy measures were introduced in 1965 which were 
designed to channel Canadian advertising revenues to Canadian 
magazines: section 19 of the Income Tax Act and customs tariff 
9958. Section 19 of the Income Tax Act limits tax deductions of 
advertising expenditures to advertisements placed in Canadian 
magazines for advertisements directed at the Canadian market. 
Customs tariff 9958 prohibits the fiscal importation into Canada of 
split runs or special editions of periodicals with editorial content 
substantially the same as the original edition except for the 
advertising which has been purchased especially to reach a 
Canadian audience. These two measures created a positive 
environment for Canadian magazines.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
Customs tariff 9958 proved to be an effective way to prevent the 
distribution of split run editions. However, technological progress 
has forced the government to review the effectiveness of code 9958 
which had well served the industry for more than 30 years.
<P>
	In particular, technology now permits to evade the spirit of 
custom tariff 9958 and the objective of the federal policy regarding 
periodicals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In January 1993 <I>Sports Illustrated</I> announced plans for a 
Canadian edition to be printed in Canada which would contain 
advertisements directed at Canadians. <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada is 
printed in Canada from texts electronically transmitted from the 
United States. Canadian ads are then substituted for American ads 
and some Canadian editorial content is added, thereby bypassing 
the border controls provided for with the customs tariff code.
<P>
	As a result it became apparent the policy measures the 
government currently has in place could no longer fulfil their role.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On March 26 1993, the government announced the creation of 
the task force on the Canadian periodicals industry. The act to 
amend the Excise Tax Act and the Income Tax Act implements the 
main recommendation contained in the report of the task force. The 
excise tax on split run editions of periodicals distributed in Canada 
will eliminate the loophole used by <I>Sports Illustrated Canada</I>.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14798"> 14798 </A></B>
<P>
	Amendments proposed to the Excise Tax Act would impose a 
tax equal to 80 per cent of the value of all the advertisements 
contained in the Canadian split run edition.
<P>
	Bill C-103 gives the following definition of a split run edition: 
An edition distributed in Canada in which 20 per cent or more of 
the editorial material does not originate in Canada and that contains 
one or more advertisement destined to Canadians.
<P>
	This tax will maintain the long standing governmental policy 
regarding periodicals. It shows the will of the government to 
support the preservation in Canada of an industry that is original, 
viable and dynamic.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Each member of the House can choose to support the bill, 
supporting the livelihoods of over 6,000 Canadians employed in 
the domestic magazine industry while at the same time keeping 
news stands well stocked with a broad choice of periodicals for the 
Canadian reader.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to discuss the 
second reading of Bill C-103, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act 
and the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Bill C-103 will impose an excise tax with respect to split run 
editions of periodicals. The tax will be implemented at a rate of 80 
per cent of the value of all the advertising contained within a split 
run.
<P>
	What type of publication are we talking about? A split run 
edition of a periodical is one that is distributed in Canada, one in 
which more than 20 per cent of editorial material is the same or 
substantially the same as the editorial material that appears in one 
or more periodical editions distributed primarily outside Canada. It 
is one that contains an advertisement that does not appear in 
identical forms in those other periodicals.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Ultimately the issue is split run editions of foreign magazines 
which are accused of dumping foreign editorial material into 
Canada to attract local ads through low cost rates. It is important to 
look specifically at the Canadian magazine market.
<P>
	Based on a 1993 study the 10 most popular U.S. magazines in 
Canada commanded the collective circulation of approximately 2.8 
million. Over the last 10 years the names of the magazines have 
changed. Yet the most popular U.S. magazines in Canada today 
have 25 per cent less circulation than their counterparts a decade 
ago. Interestingly enough, at the same time the top 10 Canadian 
magazines have increased their collective circulation by almost 15 
per cent. It appears Canadian magazines are winning the battle for 
readers. This is happening not because of government intervention 
but because of the quality of the articles.
<P>
	Even if we look at the amount of revenue generated for these 
split run editions through advertising, the lion's share is still 
remaining in the hands of Canadian based magazines. Last year 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> had six split runs in Canada which brought in ad 
revenues of slightly more than $2 million. That is peanuts 
compared with the $869 million in the Canadian magazine industry 
as a whole.
<P>
	Therefore as parliamentarians we need to fight the perception 
that Canadians read the same magazines as Americans. According 
to the past president of the Canadian Magazines Publishers 
Association a multinational ad buyer looking at news stands here 
would think the way to reach Canadians was through the same 
magazines as those on the racks in the United States. However high 
profile does not equal high circulation. Canadian publishers have 
found ways to reach readers other than through the news stand.
<P>
	For instance, magazines such as <I>Saturday Night</I> and <I>Modern 
Woman</I> are distributed through newspapers. Magazines such as 
<I>Chatelaine</I> and <I>Maclean's</I> have large subscription bases. Because 
many Canadian magazines are subscription based it would seem 
logical that they are by far more vulnerable to increased postal 
rates than to split run editions.
<P>
	I will take a moment to discuss the <I>Sports Illustrated</I> split run 
editions since it is this periodical which has caused the most 
controversy. Let us look at the example of the two issues of <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> from October 11, 1993. The contents show pages of Ron 
Grant watching a home run disappear. In the Canadian edition it is 
Doug Gilmour stretching after a puck. The college football 
department was dropped to make way for a story on Calgary 
Stampeder Doug Flutie. The ``Inside the NFL'' feature was 
replaced by the ``Inside the CFL'' feature. The section ``Faces in 
the Crowd'' is an all-Canadian selection rather than an 
all-American selection. The same type of changes were made for 
all Canadian editions.
<P>
	Granted this is not everything which nationalists would have 
wanted. However, instead of forcing an alien sport and culture 
down our throats, <I>Sports Illustrated</I> would be reflecting Canada to 
Canadians. Nor is <I>Sports Illustrated</I> displacing a home grown 
alternative.
<P>
	There is no Canadian general sports magazine. If there were it 
would survive not because of an end to split run editions of a 
competitor but because Canadians would want to read it and 
because it would be quality material. In other words it would stand 
on its own merits.
<P>
	Since it is true that most but not all of the articles in <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> Canada appear in <I>Sports Illustrated</I> United States, 
Canadian publishers argue the costs are already recovered from 
sales in the U.S. This means it can undercut the Canadian industry 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14799"> 14799 </A></B>
<P>
on advertising rates. In other words it would be dumping, selling its 
product for less than one does at home.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	However I feel the publisher's complaints are based on a much 
simpler concept referred to as economies of scale. To say that 
therefore economies of scale inevitably doom Canadian culture is 
to say domestic and foreign cultural products compete strictly on 
price, that is Canadians do not distinguish between them on any 
other basis. However, if there is one truth among nationalists, it is 
that the two are not perfect substitutes, that Canadian tastes are 
distinct and therefore indigenous production fills a need that 
foreign art cannot, in which case Canadians should be willing to 
pay a premium for the product.
<P>
	On the other hand if we were not all that different from the 
Americans the advantage of economies of scale should be just as 
open to us as it is to them. A rash of recent Canadian television 
shows such as ``Due South'' or ``The Boys of St. Vincent'' have 
been hits south of the border. It is for this reason that we should be 
encouraging free trade, not a trade war.
<P>
	A trade war with the Americans is precisely where Bill C-103 is 
headed. We as a government have the right under the NAFTA to 
discriminate against American cultural companies. However let us 
not forget the U.S. is also permitted to retaliate with roughly 
equivalent measures. According to many news reports the U.S. 
trade office is said to be drawing up a list of potential Canadian 
targets for retaliation largely in the cultural or media sector.
<P>
	For these reasons we on this side of the House oppose the bill. 
First, Reformers do not support the notion that state sanctioned 
cultural protectionism is a good policy to implement. Second, Bill 
C-103 conjures up the view that Canadian magazines are not of 
sufficient quality or merit to compete with foreign counterparts. 
We on this side of the House know this is 100 per cent false. 
Canadians are among the best in the world. We compete through 
our talent and products and not through government dictated 
protectionism.
<P>
	I cannot understand why the government has dragged the issue 
out, as it has been around for almost two years. Is this the best 
solution to the problem which could have been developed over the 
last two years?
<P>
	A final note which I feel sums up my sentiments toward Bill 
C-103 can be found in an extract from an editorial written on 
January 3, 1995 in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Americans have good reason to feel outrage at this piece of barefaced 
protectionism-and Canadians should not find any pleasure in it, because it 
only encourages continued mediocrity in the Canadian magazine industry. 
Worse, it now invites U.S. retaliation just when relations across the border had 
seemed to be moving into a friendlier phase.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The improved relationship is not worth jeopardizing for the dubious value of 
killing the Canadian edition of <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. Ottawa should reconsider this 
rash and ill conceived tax.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
	A country is more than an economic unit somehow linked 
together by rivers and lakes; it is much more than all of these 
things. A country is people working, living together and expressing 
themselves as a unity. Canada has a longstanding agreement with 
our publishing industry. That agreement is to support it within not 
only the North American context but also in the context of the 
world.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	It seems to me that advertisers who earn their living by servicing 
the Canadian market should also be prepared to support the 
distribution and consumption of material within that country.
<P>
	Is competition always invariably fair? The population of our 
southern neighbour is almost 250 million people and Canada is 
pushing barely 30 million. I do not have to give a lesson today on 
economics, but there is such a thing as economies of scale. As 
companies become bigger and their production lines become 
bigger, their costs go down. If we were simply a network of 
economic units, clearly all our cultural industries, indeed all our 
industries, should be in places where there is a higher density of 
population. This for us in North America would be our southern 
neighbour.
<P>
	That is not what Canadians want. Asked that question time and 
time again over their history, Canadians have chosen to maintain a 
separate entity on the northern part of the North American 
continent.
<P>
	I would like to put into context the broader context of the 
Canadian government having a place to support the Canadian 
magazine industry. It is relevant here to describe the importance of 
the Canadian magazine industry to Canadians.
<P>
	Canadian periodicals are an essential medium of cultural 
expression for all Canadians. They serve as a channel for 
conveying Canadian ideas, information and values. They are an 
integral part of the process whereby Canadians define themselves 
as a nation. Magazines inform, educate and entertain. They play a 
vital role in the exchange of information. Canadians need Canadian 
magazines.
<P>
	However, Canadian magazines face a unique challenge: the 
massive penetration of the Canadian market by imported 
magazines, the relatively small size of the Canadian population, the 
openness of Canadians to foreign cultural products, the effects of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14800"> 14800 </A></B>
<P>
the cover prices of imported magazines on the Canadian price 
structure,  and the impact of overflow advertising on the potential 
advertising market in Canada.
<P>
	The industry's total revenue in 1993-94 was approximately $800 
million. Though it has flourished culturally with over 1,300 titles, 
its financial position is fragile, with overall pre-tax profits of less 
than 6 per cent. Gradual changes in the rapidity of competition with 
people with higher production runs could clearly wipe that 6 per 
cent profit margin into losses, basically wiping out the entire 
industry.
<P>
	Because of the importance Canada places on having a means of 
expressing its unique identity and the difficulty and challenging 
environment the Canadian magazine industry faces, the need of 
structural measures of support for the Canadian magazine industry 
has long been recognized by successive Canadian governments. 
This policy is simply a reaffirmation of the policies government 
after government has taken before us in this country and it is in 
support of our cultural industries.
<P>
	A number of policies and program instruments to help to ensure 
the development of the Canadian magazine industry have been put 
into place. I mention postal subsidies. Canadian magazines have 
limited access to Canadian news stands. Less than one-quarter of 
Canadian magazine circulation revenue is delivered from news 
stand sales. As a result, the industry relies on subscriptions to reach 
its audience.
<P>
	The postal subsidy, which finances concessionary postal rates 
for Canadian magazines, has been an important instrument in 
helping the industry reach its market. By providing stability in the 
level of distribution cost the government has been able to assist 
publishers in developing and implementing viable business plans 
for the long term.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Two fiscal measures encourage Canadian advertisers to use 
Canadian magazines to reach Canadian readers. The first measure, 
section 19 of the Income Tax Act, has been in place since 1965. The 
legislation is merely an extension of that longstanding tradition of 
our government.
<P>
	For advertisements directed at the Canadian market, section 19 
limits tax deductions of advertising expenditures to advertisements 
placed in Canadian magazines. A Canadian magazine is defined as 
one that has 75 per cent Canadian ownership and control and has 
editorial content that is 80 per cent different from the editorial 
content of other periodicals. Here we basically disallow for tax 
deduction purposes certain advertisements placed in foreign 
magazines, which are basically to attract the Canadian market.
<P>
	The second measure is tariff code 9958, which prohibits the 
physical importation into Canada of split runs or special editions of 
periodicals with editorial content that is substantially the same as 
the original  edition except for the advertising, which has been 
purchased especially to reach the Canadian audience. This is 
basically why this law is before us today. Back then physical 
importation was considered to be the most important aspect of 
distribution but today it can be done electronically. We can 
communicate with Germany and other countries from our offices. 
This is simply updating that code to reflect modern times.
<P>
	Until recently the tariff code dissuaded offshore magazines from 
soliciting advertising in Canadian markets. It has also succeeded in 
doing so through voluntary compliance.
<P>
	Financial support is also provided to a number of cultural and 
scholarly publications through the Canada Council and the Social 
Sciences and Humanities Research Council. The Canadian 
industries development fund was established in 1990 with a budget 
allocation of $33 million. Its mandate is to provide Canadian 
owned and controlled firms within the cultural industries with a 
range of flexible financing services, which has an emphasis on 
investment loans.
<P>
	This is another area where the Government of Canada is 
assisting our cultural industries and possibly resisting the 
importation. This does not mean that we are developing a narrow 
and small country. We still obviously have the ability to access 
foreign periodicals in Canada. However it underpins the 
importance of maintaining and strengthening Canada's periodical 
industry.
<P>
	I see my time is gradually running out. I want to summarize by 
saying that I am happy to be part of a government that continues to 
support the concept of Canadian owned periodicals and the growth 
of the industry in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in support of Bill C-103. I must say 
at the outset that I find it supremely ironic that in Parliament 
support for the bill should come from my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois, who stand for promoting a separate culture, and that 
opposition to the bill comes from the Reform Party, which surely 
should stand to promote Canadian culture at any opportunity.
<P>
	I begin by making some comments on the remarks delivered by 
the member for Medicine Hat, who says that the bill represents a 
kind of cultural protectionism, which is no longer appropriate. This 
is a bill that deals with cultural protectionism and is very 
appropriate. I feel that some of my colleagues in the House, 
particularly in the third party, do not seem to appreciate the central 
role the spoken and written word has in the viability of a nation, the 
viability of its institutions as well as the viability of its 
entertainment and cultural industries.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	Certainly in English speaking Canada the publication industry, 
whether it is books, magazines or newspapers,  has been under 
economic pressure for a long time. In Canada we believe in free 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14801"> 14801 </A></B>
<P>
speech, which is tied with the independence of media agencies 
delivering the message from Canadians. Consequently, it is 
essential that these industries that deliver this cultural message in 
books, magazines or newspapers remain viable.
<P>
	The sad reality is, as other members have mentioned, that we are 
a country one-tenth the size of the United States. What happens, for 
example, in books alone is that an author who is lucky enough to 
persuade a publisher that his book is worth while and it might sell 
on the open market will be very fortunate if he sells enough copies 
to earn perhaps $8,000 or $9,000 a year from that one book. 
However, because the United States is 10 times as big, a similar 
author with a similar book can make a living at it. He can make 
from $70,000 to $80,000 from that single book. This is the way it is 
with books and with newspapers. Newspapers these days have 
come under enormous advertising pressure: the shortage of 
advertising, the lack of circulation and competition from the 
United States.
<P>
	When next in Toronto, Mr. Speaker, visit the Toronto <I>Star</I> at 1 
Yonge Street, Canada's largest newspaper. You will find outside on 
the sidewalk various news boxes. Among those news boxes you 
will see <I>U.S.A. Today</I>. There is a very active market in this country 
for American publications and newspaper publications.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will take you back to your childhood for a little 
bit. I will bet at one time you sold magazines. It used to be very 
common to sell magazines as a child to make a bit of money. I did 
that when I was a kid. I remember vividly that most of the 
magazines I had to sell were American magazines. The reality is 
that we are a country dominated by the American cultural 
industries. There is no getting around it. To ignore this is to ignore 
a fundamental reality.
<P>
	It is with irony that I listened to the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata. She spoke very finely on the issue of the 
need for Canadian cultural protection. The irony is that English 
speaking Canada is under the greatest pressure. Here we have a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois, a Quebecoise, defending English 
culture in this country. She is quite right that we have to subsidize, 
support and build a certain amount of protectionism around the 
magazine industry because of the phenomenon of split runs. That is 
a very real problem. It is true that the Canadian periodicals will 
suffer adversely from that.
<P>
	Ironically French language periodicals do not have the same 
problem. Therefore I was very pleased to hear her defend the 
government's initiative in this regard with respect to split run 
publications. However, best of all, she took the debate one step 
further, which I really like, and she raised the question of the GST.
<P>
	The one thing I could never understand as a former journalist and 
a some time author is any government that  could put a tax on 
books. We actually have in this country a tax on reading. If ever 
there was a regressive tax that has set us back, particularly in 
English speaking Canada, it is this tax on reading.
<P>
	I say to the Reform Party that it does not understand how 
difficult it is to get the word out as an author, a writer or as a 
journalist in this country, particularly when we are English 
speaking, because we are in overwhelming competition with the 
Americans to the south. The previous government put a tax on 
books which damages the periodical industry. It lost 6 per cent of 
its circulation. Authors of books suffered.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The member from the official opposition made a very good point 
when she suggested the GST be dropped from all publications and 
reading material. I support her 100 per cent on that. That 
recommendation from the task force on the magazine industry is 
not in Bill C-103, although I am confident the government will 
make that alteration when it addresses the problem of the GST. I 
hope we will see that change in the next budget.
<P>
	Finally I would like to make a comment concerning the 
member's comments on postal subsidies. Again I believe she is 
right on the money there. In this case it is a question of distributing 
Canadian newspapers as well as magazines. We would do well to 
do anything in our power to make sure the Canadian point of view 
gets out to Canadians. If we do not back up our own authors, our 
own writers, our own journalists, our own publications, then at 
least English Canada is going to slide into the United States and the 
separatists will get their way by default.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
heard Liberal member after Liberal member and actually Bloc 
members talk about how we are such victims in Canada, that the 
U.S. is exploiting us. I suppose that is one world view of the 
situation, but to me it is a pretty morbid and pessimistic way of 
looking at things.
<P>
	What I think is completely in alignment with how creative 
people think is that Canadians can overcome some of these things. 
They can overcome the fact that they have strong competition. The 
reason they can overcome it is that they are the same genetically as 
the Americans. Canadians can produce the same quality of books 
and music as anyone else. They have proven this time and time 
again.
<P>
	Constantly complaining and whining about our lot in life is not 
helpful at all to the debate. I am amazed the hon. member was so 
distressed to see a <I>U.S.A. Today</I> box in front of the Toronto <I>Star</I>. He 
must be shocked when he walks into a library and sees 
Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Montesquieu and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It 
must be a horrible experience for him. Imagine there not being 
enough John Brydens and David Suzukis. All kidding  aside, I 
know the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14802"> 14802 </A></B>
<P>
member would not be shocked by that and really would not oppose 
that.
<P>
	The point is not in the absurdity of the exaggeration. The point is 
in the premise, which is where there is real absurdity. Canadians 
are more than capable of making good choices. Every day we make 
thousands of decisions about all kinds of things, including very 
important things such as raising our children, et cetera. We are 
perfectly capable of deciding among the plethora of magazines and 
books available which ones we want to read and which television 
shows we want to view.
<P>
	If the hon. member's argument is sound, does he recommend we 
take it to its full extent? Would we put up complete barriers thereby 
protecting all Canadian magazines, books, et cetera, and not 
allowing others in at all? That is the logical end of his argument.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I would not do it to that extent at 
all. Bill C-103 addresses the problem perfectly and is entirely 
adequate as it stands.
<P>
	The hon. member for Medicine Hat should look at the Canadian 
Football League or the various sports industries in Canada. He 
would see what happens when a cultural industry driven by profit is 
in direct competition with the United States. We are losing some of 
those cultural sporting industries. In the case of the printed word 
we cannot afford to lose it in a similar fashion. It is essential to our 
democracy, our freedom and our identity as Canadians.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth expresses 
surprise that the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill. We say that 
Canadian culture must be protected in the same way as Quebec 
culture must be protected.
<P>
	How does the hon. member explain the Canadian government's 
spending so much money on advertising in foreign newspapers and 
not in Canadian newspapers, particularly in the ethnic press? There 
are some very important ethnic newspapers which do not have the 
necessary government support; they do not have their fair share of 
government advertising.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. 
member from the Bloc Quebecois. We are very much on side on the 
issue. The Government of Canada and all governments should 
favour, where they can, placing advertisements in Canadian 
publications.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this morning we have been listening to presentations from 
Reform Party members. They have presented us with a large 
collection of suppositions, perceptions and attributions. Many of 
them are based on personal feelings, personal perceptions and 
misguided  information. Clearly it is a position which would result 
in the death knell of the magazine industry in Canada. It would 
mean the loss of thousands of jobs. Millions of dollars would be 
taken out of the economy. That is the present position of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	Reformers are slow learners; there is no doubt about it. We know 
that one of the characteristics of an effective learning model is the 
use of repetition. My Liberal Party colleagues have clearly pointed 
out some very hard core facts which support the need for Bill 
C-103. It is through repetition that I will continue to present the 
facts. I hope Reform Party members will be able to handle the data 
in a much more effective and positive manner and will see the need 
for support by the Canadian people of the Canadian magazine 
industry.
<P>
	The key messages in Bill C-103 clearly point out that the 
commitments of the government made on December 22, 1994 will 
be supported. This is not a new policy. It is merely an extension of 
the government's longstanding policy to support the Canadian 
magazine industry, to channel Canadian advertising revenues to 
Canadian magazines and not to American magazines. These 
measures are not intended to restrict foreign magazines from 
access to the Canadian market. In fact our market is wide open to 
publications from all over the world.
<P>
	It is the government's view that the proposed bill is consistent 
with our international trade obligations. As a result, no one south of 
the border should be disturbed by the actions of the government.
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage has clearly pointed out 
that the new excise tax is not a new consumer tax. I must repeat 
some hard core data for this effective learning to take place.
<P>
	What is a periodical? A periodical is published more than once a 
year but not more than once a week. It does not have more than 70 
per cent advertising content. It is available to the general public.
<P>
	For the fiscal year 1993-94 a Statistics Canada survey reported 
on over 1,300 titles. The survey covered six types of periodicals in 
Canada. The general categories were: general consumer 
magazines, special interest consumer magazines, business and 
trade magazines, religious magazines, farm magazines and 
scholarly magazines. There we have in six categories publications 
in this country covering the field, tailoring to the needs of every 
man, woman and child.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Dealing with the hard core data, according to Statistics Canada 
advertising revenues fell to $485 million in 1993-94, an 8.3 per 
cent drop from the previous year and a 14.3 per cent decline since 
1989-90. From 1985 to 1991 periodicals saw their market share of 
advertising dollars drop from 6.6 per cent to 5.7 per cent, a clear 
indication that the Canadian government must do whatever it 
possibly can do to change that movement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14803"> 14803 </A></B>
<P>
	Advertising revenue is crucial to most magazines. It supports 
the cost of the editorial content and makes it possible for the 
publisher to provide the magazine at rates the reader can afford. 
In some cases, believe it or not, it provides the magazine at no 
cost to the reader. Approximately two-thirds of all revenues of 
Canadian magazines come from the advertising area. The main 
thrust of federal magazine publishing policy has been to direct 
Canadian advertising revenue to Canadian magazines.
<P>
	The effect of the recession on advertising revenue has been quite 
serious for the Canadian magazine industry. However Canadian 
companies have been very effective in competing even though the 
recession has taken place.
<P>
	The magazine industry has demonstrated a remarkable resilience 
in the face of a decline in advertising revenue. Periodicals have 
managed to earn profits and to increase them recently by keeping a 
tight control on costs. Since 1989-90 some cost cutting has been 
achieved by reducing the number of full time and part time 
employees. As well the use of contract work has increased. 
Salaries, wages and fees fell 3.9 per cent in 1993-94. Non-salaried 
costs fell 6.8 per cent during the same year and dropped 16.5 per 
cent during the previous four years. Clearly that is action of 
responsible companies.
<P>
	During the past five years profits before tax as a percentage of 
total revenue has ranged from a low of 2.1 per cent in 1990-91 to a 
high of 5.7 per cent in 1993-94. Profitability varies by category 
with business and trade periodicals earning the most profits and 
religious periodicals earning the least.
<P>
	As reported by Statistics Canada, paper costs will likely have a 
profound impact on periodicals in the near future. According to the 
industrial price index, paper prices rose 26 per cent in the first four 
months of 1995 compared with the same period last year.
<P>
	It is clear the magazine industry faces challenges on a number of 
fronts: increasing competition for audience attention, increasing 
competition for the advertiser's dollar, the need to adjust quickly to 
rapid price changes, and rapid technological change. The role of 
government policy has been to provide an environment in which 
magazines can meet their challenges.
<P>
	A range of government policy and program instruments have 
been put in place and will continue to be supported by the industry 
as well as by the government. These instruments include: section 
19 of the Income Tax Act, tariff code 9958, grants through the 
Canada Council, the postal subsidy for paid circulation Canadian 
magazines, and the lending programs offered by the cultural 
industries development fund.
<P>
	The Canadian magazine industry is an important pipeline 
between the generators of Canadian information, ideas, views and 
the Canadian public. As noted by the O'Leary Royal Commission 
on Publications  in 1961, magazines ``can protect a nation's values 
and encourage their practice. They can make democratic 
government possible and better government probable. They can 
soften sectional asperities and bring honourable compromises. 
They can inform and educate in the arts, the sciences and 
commerce. They can help market a nation's products and promote 
its material wealth. In these functions it may be claimed, claimed 
without much challenge, that the communications of a nation are as 
vital to its life as its defences and should receive at least as great a 
measure of national protection''.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	I could not have said it better. The government recognizes the 
importance of periodicals in Canada for and by Canadians, much as 
it did over 30 years ago when the O'Leary report was completed. 
We will continue to support the industry by implementing 
appropriate structural measures such as the ones proposed by the 
recent task force on the Canadian magazine industry.
<P>
	Bill C-103 is a key element in continuing that support. Therefore 
I urge all members to ensure the bill is quickly passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
beginning of the hon. member's speech he mentioned free trade in 
cultural industries was to be the death knell of the industry. Is this 
not exactly the same argument the Liberal Party made in 1988 
during the free trade debate? Did it not say the free trade was to be 
the death knell for all these industries in Canada?
<P>
	I ask the member if he was on that side. Was he making those 
same arguments? Will he not admit that many industries did not die 
but have prospered as a result of free trade? Will he admit that 
competition and the flow of capital back and forth have actually 
been good for all kinds of industries, and that ultimately the best 
way to help Canadian cultural industries is for the government to 
ensure a level playing field by getting taxes down so these 
industries can compete against their American counterparts?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague for Medicine 
Hat in a sense has misconstrued or has deliberately altered my 
presentation. I did not state the free trade deal was to destroy the 
magazine industry in Canada. I said the presentations being made 
by members of the Reform Party, especially by the member for 
Medicine Hat, with all the attributes and perceptions that were sort 
of misguided, would result in the death knell of the magazine 
industry. I was criticizing, debating and discussing the 
presentations of the members of the Reform Party versus the 
stability, sustainability and health of the magazine industry in 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with 
the criticism voiced by the hon. member from the Reform Party. 
They never see the need to protect the  Canadian cultural industry. 
That is their philosophy. But what surprises me somewhat is that 
the Liberals are weak not only in this area of culture but in others as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14804"> 14804 </A></B>
<P>
well. Fortunately NAFTA excludes culture. Here again, I would 
like to ask you the question I asked my colleague previously.
<P>
	What are your measures for giving a little more support to the 
ethnic press, the ethnic newspapers, whose circulation figures are 
low but which are very necessary to the ethnic communities? There 
is nothing in this bill to confer such protection or support to the 
ethnic press.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, the market forces play with the 
laws that exist on municipal, provincial and especially federal 
levels. They are all in harmony with each other and the industry 
will continue to prosper as it is at the present time.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak today to back up my colleagues from the Reform 
Party and to speak against the ill conceived Bill C-103.
<P>
	The bill will needlessly and rightfully attract retaliation by 
American trading interests. In my role as the critic for international 
trade for our party, that is a concern to me. Furthermore, it will 
cheat Canadian sports readers of the bit of Canadian content they 
presently enjoy.
<P>
	I offer some background and a bit of history to put the bill in 
perspective. Decades ago rules were written to protect Canada's 
cultural industries. Even though the importation of American 
magazines was and still is allowed, the government of the day 
imposed some severe restrictions on advertising. Canadian 
businesses can only deduct the cost of their Canadian magazine 
advertisements if they appear in Canadian publications. That is 
why we see so many American magazines on our news stands. 
They are strictly aimed at the American market and if Canadians 
are interested they can buy these magazines.
<P>
	However the government introduced customs regulations which 
prohibit the import of split runs. These are essentially American 
magazines that contain some Canadian content and some Canadian 
advertising and are trucked across the border.
<P>
	Furthermore, in the NAFTA regulations Canada did retain the 
right to protect its cultural industries. However, in so doing, the 
Americans were saying they at least retained the right to retaliate in 
kind. That is a very important feature. They are exercising that 
right to retaliate and we think that will happen.
<P>
	Furthermore, all these rules were written before any advances in 
technology could be fully understood or predicted. When it became 
possible to beam magazines across the border and have them 
printed in Canada,  <I>Sports Illustrated</I> took advantage of this new 
technology and circumvented the split run border rules.
<P>
	Since April 1993 it has produced several issues per year that are 
essentially American versions with some Canadian stories. There is 
a lot less American advertising but there is a problem. There is 
some Canadian advertising. The big concern is not that Canadians 
are being bombarded with American sports stories by trying to get 
their eager hands on some Canadian sports stories. The concern is 
that Canadian advertisers will spend their advertising dollars in 
these largely American publications even though these advertisers 
will not be able to deduct the cost of doing business.
<P>
	The fact that <I>Sports Illustrated</I> has not been successful in 
recruiting many Canadian advertisers does not seem to impress the 
government. It is bound and determined to enter into a trade war 
over the <I>Sports Illustrated</I> issue. It is a very serious matter, one the 
government needs to review.
<P>
	Therefore, what do we do? We have the Liberal government 
introducing Bill C-103, largely a protectionist bill. The bill 
imposes an excise tax on the highest level Canadian participant of 
split run ventures. The excise tax is 80 per cent of the value of all 
advertisements contained in such magazines or newspapers. It is 
assumed this excise tax will never be collected because it will 
effectively kill the Canadian edition of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> or any 
ventures that could come on to the drawing board. That is what I 
call protectionism.
<P>
	The Liberals in 1988 were opposed to the free trade agreement 
with the United States, although they have largely been converted 
since. It is sort of a revival. However, sometimes I wonder what 
their real commitment is. Are they committed to the free trade 
principle or not? Here it would indicate they are not.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage is quoted as saying 
Americans cannot retaliate against this protectionism move 
because the magazine is printed in Canada. I have news for the 
minister. There is more than one way to cross a border than by 
walking across it; planes fly and now we have computer beams 
from the satellites. We cannot stop progress. The Americans will 
retaliate against the bill and they have every right to. They can 
make life miserable for Canadian exporters in all kinds of ways, 
justified or not. We will not be able to cry foul because our hands 
will not be entirely clean in this matter. We are introducing a bill 
which is largely a protectionist bill.
<P>
	What about our artists, our writers and our publishers? What if 
they want to take advantage of the American marketplace which is 
much larger and more lucrative than our own?
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Approximately 500 new channels will be available by satellite. 
How will we control this type of information  flow? I say we 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14805"> 14805 </A></B>
<P>
control it in the marketplace. If we have a good Canadian cultural 
industry, it is a business and it will compete. If it is poor it will not.
<P>
	The government is being hypercritical in that it says it is trying 
to protect our magazine industry while at the same time crushing it 
to death with taxes. When we ask businesses in Canada why they 
are not expanding, the common theme has always been that taxes 
and the cost of doing business in Canada are too high.
<P>
	That is where we should be concentrating. We should be trying 
to balance our budgets and bring our Canadian businesses into a 
competitive position so they can compete in the international 
marketplace. I believe they will do very well. We are asking our 
Canadian industries to compete with one hand tied behind their 
backs. There is the GST. There is a very high tax level and they 
simply cannot compete under those circumstances.
<P>
	Some would have us believe our cultural industries cannot 
compete effectively on the basis of pure competition. That is 
nonsense. We have some very good Canadian cultural content. It 
would be even better if it had to face the true test of the 
marketplace. That test is whether there is a quality product. There 
are a number of Canadian cultural industry businesses which pass 
the test and some which will have to fall by the wayside because 
they simply are not quality products. The question we have to ask is 
whether we should be supporting the industry through subsidy and 
protectionism. I do not believe so and I will be voting against the 
bill.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to the standing orders, 
the House will now proceed to Statements by Members.

hidden agenda.

	Let us look at the UI reform they are hiding from those who have

representation from the people in Atlantic Canada and all 
Canadians. That is probably why he used the old-fashioned 
political trick of making the announcement late Friday afternoon.
<P>
	Without a doubt, the Prime Minister is running scared from the 
Reform Party's call for elections to fill all Senate vacancies. He 
reminds us of his 32 years in this House by insisting on the 
continuation of an archaic and dying system at a time when we 
need proper, fair, balanced representation from all regions of 
Canada.
<P>
	I condemn the continuing policy of political patronage

This kind of political patronage renders the upper house useless

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Supreme Court ruling on tobacco advertising is a wake-up call to 
Canadians concerned about the state of our democracy.
<P>
	The court's ruling adds to a jurisprudence that the advertising of 
large corporations enjoys the same protection as the free speech of 
individual citizens. The courts are transforming the charter from an 
instrument that protects the human rights of citizens from an 
arbitrary state into one that protects powerful corporations from the 
actions taken by citizens through Parliament to establish the social 
boundaries of commercial activity.
<P>
	The court is wrong in determining that corporations have a right 
to peddle an addictive and deadly substance, a right that overrides 
the democratic right of citizens to take measures to improve public 
health by regulating the promotion of dangerous tobacco products.
<P>
	The government and Parliament, all of us here, should find a way 
to stand up to the court by invoking the notwithstanding clause to 
regulate the marketing of tobacco. This is a good example of why 
the notwithstanding clause was put in the charter in the first place.

would expect the minister to accept Alberta's decision to deinsure 
tax funding of abortions.

Mr. Speaker, separatists are inviting Quebecers to vote at the 
upcoming referendum to decide on their future within Canada.
<P>
	The question concocted by the separatist leaders includes two 
very distinct aspects. First, Quebecers are asked if they want to 
separate from Canada; second, they are asked if they want to be 
economically and politically associated with the country that they 
are asked to leave.

question, as in the fact that separatists refuse to let Quebecers know 
about the details of such an association before the referendum.

Canada simply cannot be implemented the way separatists are

Quebec, the PQ leader often rejoiced over comments made by 
Salomon Brothers on the election of a separatist government and an 
eventual referendum. The firm said: Moreover, contrary to current 
rhetoric, the end of the debate on Quebec's separation will benefit 
Canada and Quebec, regardless of whether they remain together or 
separate.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that same firm, which the PQ leader was so happy 
to quote back then, just advised its clients to sell their Quebec 
bonds and to wait until the eve of the referendum before buying 
them back, so as to take advantage of the better interest rates which 
will be generated by the political insecurity that will prevail.

	Salomon Brothers is doing what it should in trying to ensure that

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government steadfastly refuses to unveil its 
plans and keeps postponing the tabling of its social program 
reform. Clearly the government wants to keep these cuts under 
wraps until the referendum. We know that the federal budget 
announced additional cuts of more than $1.5 billion in the 
unemployment insurance plan, but the details are still being kept 
secret.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How can he 
initiate the most massive cuts ever in our social programs, 
including unemployment insurance, cuts that are tantamount to 
repudiating the social equity that millions of Quebecers and 
Canadians depend on?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, more than a year ago, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development tabled a green paper in this House. He then 
conducted consultations with the opposition and members of his 
own party, followed by consultations with the public and with the 
provinces. In the February budget, the Minister of Finance clearly 
set out the fiscal parameters for a federal program review.
<P>
	All this is public knowledge. We intend to go ahead with the 
reform, because everyone in Canada agrees that the application of 
the Unemployment Insurance Act must be changed to adjust it to 
current economic realities. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development is now looking for a better way to use this money and 
make it easier for Canadians and all the provinces, including 
Quebec, to find jobs and to specialize in order to be better able to 
find work after a period of unemployment.
<P>
	We are not like one of the coalition members, Mario Dumont, 
who said in the May 1 issue of <I>Actualité</I> that he would even go so 
far as to say that unemployment  insurance should be privatized. I 
do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition or Mr. Larose 
agree with what Mr. Dumont said.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebecers face a fundamental choice, the choice of the 
kind of society they want. I think they have the right to know what 
kind of society this government has in mind.
<P>
	And among other things, I want to ask the Prime Minister 
whether we are to understand-and why not admit it, everyone 
knows-that the minister wanted to carry out the reform and that it 
was constantly postponed because of the referendum in Quebec. 
Why will the Prime Minister not admit that the reason for these 
successive postponements is that the government made the 
deliberate decision to put off announcing the dramatic cuts that will 
be inflicted on Quebec's unemployed because of the referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, these reforms will affect all workers in Canada. The 
impact will be exactly the same in all provinces, including Quebec, 
so this can hardly be used to argue that we are going to treat Quebec 
workers differently from workers in other provinces. The reform 
will be exactly the same, and, as I explained earlier, we have been 
working on this program for a long, long time.
<P>
	We never knew the exact date of the referendum. In fact, we 
expected a referendum in June. Now, according to the latest news, 
it will not necessarily be October 30. I do not know. The writs have 
not been issued. So the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is not operating in terms of the potential date of a referendum that 
is not yet official.
<P>
	We know there is considerable debate among the Yes side on 
whether or not they should go ahead. In any case, we are ready, and 
Canada will win.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister said that the forthcoming reform will 
affect all workers. First of all, this is an admission that all the 
unemployed in Canada will be affected. We know that now. 
Second, we know that unemployed workers outside Quebec will 
not be asked to vote on their political future at the end of October.
<P>
	I think he should understand that we now know what he meant, 
when he promised he would make us face the music. Is it not 
obvious to him as it now should be to everyone, that Quebec's 
unemployed workers will be the first to face the music, the kind of 
music the Prime Minister promised them, to the tune of more than 
40 per cent of the new cuts, which represents nearly $600 million?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the way in which the workers 
in Quebec, the workers throughout Canada, will be most directly 
affected is by programs that give them real support to get back to 
work; give them real tools to find new jobs; give them the kind of 
support to get them into the labour market in a way that they have 
not been able to do up to now.
<P>
	Even the Quebec government, when it is not debating 
separatism, comes forward with proposals. It had to change its 
social programs in order to help people find employment. It admits 
the old passive benefit programs do not work the way they used to.
<P>
	It strikes me as very strange and very odd that the Leader of the 
Opposition who on Sunday was saying that he is a member of the 
group for change is now defending the status quo. He wants to 
maintain unemployment. He wants to maintain benefits that do not 
help people get back to work.
<P>

supporting initiatives that the government wants to take to give 
Canadians the right to have the dignity of work throughout Canada.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Despite all the efforts made by the Operation Unity centre to 
hide from Quebecers the devastating cuts the federal government is 
about to impose on the UI program, a secret document on this 
reform package from the minister's office was leaked to and made 
public by CNTU president Gérald Larose.
<P>
	One of the things proposed in this document is to raise from 15 
to 35 the minimum number of hours of work per week needed to 
qualify for UI benefits.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that his reform will be especially hard 
on the thousands of women who work part time or on call, by 
depriving them of UI support?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the mistake the hon. member 
makes is to treat this document as if it has validity.
<P>
	The government has not made any decisions yet on the nature of 
the reform. What is being talked about is some speculation released 
by the head of the CSN that has no validity in terms of the actual 
package of reforms to be proposed.
<P>
	One of the stated objectives of the reforms, as we have said right 
from the very beginning, is to broaden the coverage of the 
unemployment insurance program to ensure that the new world of 
work, which includes a lot of people engaged in non-standard 
work, would now have more security and better protection. That is 
a commitment to which I intend to hold.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister did not say anything about improving benefits for the 
people who need it; he just talked about cuts. And your mandate is 
to cut at least another $1.5 billion in addition to the $1 billion you 
have already cut.
<P>
	Does the minister at least admit that the women who will be 
especially hard hit by this proposal you are trying to hide will have 
to work twice as long to qualify for UI benefits and that, if they 
cannot do so, they will end up on social assistance or be unable to 
find a way out?

will be like if they vote No.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canada of tomorrow will

with a great deal of fairness, equity and compassion.
<P>
	Before the House of Commons right now is legislation dealing 
with employment equity. The hon. member knows that the 
government is trying to ensure that the barriers which prevent 
women from getting full and equal access to the workplace are 
reduced. She stands up and somehow denies the very initiative that 
we are proposing today in the House of Commons.
<P>

union leader and says that is the truth when in fact I have sent to her 
office 24 different studies of evaluations of the UI system that show 
it does not work and Mr. Speaker-

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	For the past two years the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has been delaying every meaningful initiative in his 
department. Much promised reforms to social security have been 
gathering dust. The white paper on aging is growing older by the 
day. To top it off, this weekend we learned that changes to the UI 
system will be delayed until after the Quebec  referendum. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14811"> 14811 </A></B>
<P>
system was in a mess two years ago when the minister took over 
the department and it is in even more of a mess now.
<P>
	Why all of the delays? Is it because of the referendum or is the 
minister just unable to come up with any innovative ways of 
solving the problems in our social programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me answer the question by 
way of specific example.
<P>
	This morning I was able to announce with the Minister of Justice 
and the Solicitor General of Canada that we have introduced, along 
with the chiefs of police of Canada and representatives of all the 
school boards, a major program of youth employment which will 
involve hundreds of young Canadians working with local police to 
deal with the issue of public safety. That was an initiative which we 
took that makes a difference.
<P>
	A few months ago we announced a new program of student loans 
and grants to help young Canadians gain access to universities. We 
announced a total reorganization of our department to decentralize 
its activities so we can deliver programs at the local level.
<P>
	The reform is already under way. I just hope the hon. member 
will wake up and smell the roses.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
refusing to act immediately on such an important national issue, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development is being used as a 
separatist pawn. The government should have the courage to 
challenge the separatist confusion head on and stop playing hide 
and seek with the national agenda. That is what Canadians are 
worried about.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought the leader of the 
Reform Party was the separatist pawn.
<P>
	What Canadians really want is to get a program that works really 
well. That means taking the time and the interest to put together a 
combination of initiatives which will help people get back to work, 
which will give us an unemployment insurance system that is 
sustainable and payable over the long term and which will enable 
Canadians to make the kind of choices they want to make in the 
labour market. That is what Canadians really want.
<P>
	We started with a public process of consultation. We have 
received the views of hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Now we 
are putting down the details and working on it. When it is ready, 
when we have the best package possible, that is when it will be 
presented to the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
asking the Minister of Human Resources Development to end the 
confusion and to put an end to the separatist propaganda by 
announcing concrete proposals for UI reform.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Quebecers are telling us that the status quo is not working, that 
they are not interested in it. The minister has an opportunity to 
show the people of Canada, including Quebecers, that we will have 
the chance to work on a renewed federalism.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is the Liberal and Tory do-nothing approach to government 
that Quebecers and all Canadians are tired of.
<P>
	When the minister has a chance to offer Canadians positive, 
non-constitutional change, why is he sitting on the sidelines afraid 
to make a move? Why does the minister not grab his glove and get 
into the game?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member is really 
concerned about ending separatist propaganda she should stay 
tuned for October 30. It will be all over at that time and we can get 
on with building Canada.
<P>
	The best way in which the hon. member can make a contribution 
as the new spokesperson on this matter is to start putting forward 
her own proposals on behalf of her party. I suggest to the hon. 
member that we are working on developing the specifics.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	The member is quite right. The best way we can redefine this 
country is to do it day by day in the actions we take. It is one reason 
that as a government we had the initiative to start a major public 
process so Canadians would know where we wanted to go and 
could be involved in the process. We consulted broadly and widely. 
Now we are working on developing the details.
<P>

any discussion that makes any sense, would be the first to 
participate in this new kind of Canada.

<P>
	According to federal government sources, the minister is now 
considering erasing the government's line in the sand on medicare

ambiguous conditions. Will the minister confirm today her

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems ironic to the Canadian public that this minister and the 
government have lost the total moral authority to impose their will 
on the provinces. The provinces are no longer willing nor will they 
accept orders from Ottawa. The federal government is trying to get 
out of the corner it has painted itself into. It is nothing more than a 
sorry attempt at face saving.

contrary, Mr. Speaker, the Canada Health Act works. Medicare

October 2, 1993 and after the election: ``We want to amend those

some Canadians to pay at least a portion of their health care costs''.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development's responses would 
give one the impression that he has a present in mind for Canada's 
unemployed. Yet we know that the discussion paper, a virtually 
final document, one that originates in his office, calls for limiting 
access to unemployment and limiting the duration of benefits, as 
well as paying less benefits to the chronically unemployed.
<P>
	If his project were as great as all that, do you not think that he 
would release it before the Quebec referendum? We know those 
guys. If the Minister of Human Resources Development is hiding 
his project, it is because it contains cuts.
<P>
	Does the minister confirm that the order he received from the 
Minister of Finance in the last budget to cut at least $1.5 billion 
from unemployment benefits still stands and that his project 
responds to that order?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

obvious. The budget document of last February said that we want to 
achieve a 10 per cent savings in the existing unemployment 
insurance system so that we can convert those savings to the help 
and  development of

employment in this country. That was the whole purpose and is 
what the budget stated.
<P>
	The hon. member would be much better off if he would read the 
entire budget statement and not half of it, just as he would be if he 
would stop using speculative, partial, piecemeal documents to try 
to justify his own case. In both instances I suggest that he should 
expand his reading.

is going to so much trouble to conceal from the unemployed, the 
unemployed in Quebec in particular, that they will have to face the 
music, to use the Prime Minister's phrase, with the reform being 
planned for them, it is because he wants to conceal from Quebec's

sensitive point with his party.
<P>
	We have been totally open in this process. We first tabled a 
major consultation book. Consultations involved over 100,000 
Canadians. By the way, during those consultations it was very clear 
that over 64 per cent of Quebecers were in favour of major 
significant reform of the Unemployment Insurance Act. They have 
already said they want to have major changes.
<P>
	We have since gone through and tabled major reports on 
seasonal workers. We have had the House of Commons report and 
recommendations. We have just released 24 different studies by 
independent experts dealing with various aspects of the 
unemployment insurance program.

more clear in what we want to do than that. What we really need is 
to get off of the agenda of separatism and get back on the agenda of 
jobs.

Atlantic to be filled by an election. Even the Liberals endorsed the 
concept of an elected Senate although it was in a rather 
emasculated form in the Charlottetown accord. Given all of the 
above, why did the Prime Minister not use this opportunity to 
change  the upper house from one of a house of patronage to a 
house that would be truly representative of Canadians?
<P>

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The unemployed will be severely affected by cuts of at least $1.5 
billion in the unemployment insurance plan as of next year. Quebec 
alone stands to absorb more than $600 million worth of cuts. These 
will be felt particularly in regions with a high proportion of 
seasonal workers, whose benefits will be reduced, since from now 
on they will be treated as second class unemployed workers.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that by making Quebec alone absorb 
$600 million in cuts in unemployment insurance, he is practically 
putting whole regions like the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the North Shore, the Gaspé and the 
Saint-Maurice area on welfare?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

answered the question which has been asked several times.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14814"> 14814 </A></B>
<P>
	The answer bears repeating. The present unemployment 
insurance system is not working very well. Since 1983 until 1993 
we have seen its costs go from $8 billion to up to $20 billion. 
We found that in many cases it discourages people from taking 
more work. It is not providing the kind of resources people need 
to get back into the job market. It does not provide the kind of 
encouragement and the kinds of tools that are needed.
<P>
	Other countries around the world spend 30 per cent or 40 per 
cent of their labour market money on active employment measures. 
We spend 16 per cent. The fact is we want to make a change in the 
program to give a much stronger emphasis to the opportunities for 
employment.
<P>
	It strikes me as increasingly strange. Members of that party 
continually say they want change, they want improvement, but 
when they have an opportunity to make changes that will help 
people get back to work, they say absolutely no. It is too bad they 
do not say no to the referendum and yes to unemployment 
insurance changes.

reform is so good, he should table it now, so we can look at it and

<P>
	My supplementary is directed to the Minister of Finance. Would 
the minister confirm that the target he has set for his colleague at 
human resources development with respect to next year's cuts in 
the unemployment insurance program is still at least $1.5 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear, as the 
Minister of Human Resources Development said, that what we 
really want is to create a springboard for job creation. That is the 
basic purpose of these reforms. The minister said that the money 
would be reinvested in proactive programs in order to put 
Quebecers and Canadians back to work.
<P>
	Now I would like to ask the hon. member, who keeps talking 
about hidden agendas, why the Bloc, why the separatist movement 
refused to publish a study by Georges Mathews which shows that 
the deficit will triple. Why will the Bloc Quebecois and the PQ not 
put the partnership offer on the table? Because it is an empty shell?

freedom of speech in this House by using abusive, racist, or sexist 
language. In that regard, we studied briefly and intend to go back to 
studying the examples set in other jurisdictions where for example 
members are suspended for a more extended period than is now the 
case, where there is a loss of pay for members who engage in this 
kind of conduct, where there is a loss of travel and telephone

to 25,000 young Canadians to get major training as they move from

skills to meet the job requirements so that they can make that 
important bridge between formal education and the workplace.
<P>

of education in Quebec and Chrysler Corporation just a month ago 
to sign an agreement that will give us a new program of internship 
on car maintenance and repair in Quebec through a partnership. 
That to me illustrates how if we work together in partnership we 
can really help our young people, as opposed to always trying to 
split things apart.

slight increase in employment in 1994. In Quebec, the number of 
young people on welfare has remained at 75,000 since the last

<P>
	First of all, let me say that I do not accept the premise of the hon. 
member's question. I do not agree that all of the governments he 
has referred to are against the bill. Second, as I said last December, 
we engaged in continuous consultation with the officials of 
provincial governments as we went about preparing that 
legislation. The mere fact that some of them, for their own reasons, 
have found parts of the bill they do not agree with is no proof that 
consultation did not occur. It certainly did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, three of the 
attorneys general named in my earlier question appeared before the 
standing committee and said that they were not consulted. The 
aboriginal groups, as well, said that they were not consulted.
<P>
	Through clause 103 of Bill C-68 the Minister of Justice has 
granted the federal government the power to initiate proceedings 
under the Criminal Code, which is clearly an incursion into 
provincial jurisdiction as guaranteed under section 92 of the 
Constitution. Did the minister gain the consent of the provinces 
before expanding the federal government's criminal law powers 
into traditional provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

very tired and lifeless condition of the hon. member's crusade 
against this legislation that he is trying to revive an issue that was 
fully debated last year and put to rest with the facts. The facts are 
that there was consultation. There has been consultation throughout 
this process, both with provincial governments and with aboriginal 
organizations. If the results are not pleasing to the hon. member

as the basis for any kind of argument because it is simply not based 
in fact.
<P>
	Second, I would point out to the hon. member that included in 
the changes we brought in last year was a special measure that 
would provide direct assistance to the lowest-income UI users. As a 
result of that reform, over 400,000 Canadians, including over

Health. When we have an answer we will be happy to report to the

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
who claimed this afternoon to share or have concerns about the 
younger generation.
<P>
	If that is so, I would like to know why his government cancelled 
the Stay-in-School program designed to fight the problem of school 
dropouts, a problem so important that his own colleague, the 
Minister of Finance, criticized the Quebec government last 
summer for not paying enough attention to the problem of school 
dropouts.
<P>
	Why did his government cancel the Stay-in-School program 
then?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

<P>
program was funded by the previous government only for a 
five-year time limit. It was sunsetted after five years.
<P>
	I extended it for an additional year in order to give us time to 
work with various private sector and community organizations to 
enable them to pick up the program. As a result of that extension 
we have been able to negotiate a number of agreements.
<P>
	I am very pleased to announce we now have agreement with the 
new National Basketball Association franchises in Vancouver and 
Toronto which have continued to encourage the stay in school 
program as part of their community involvement. We now have the 
program continuing through the auspices of various important 
initiatives by the National Basketball Association and other 
community sponsors.

	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is directed to the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	We are all familiar with the rebuilding of infrastructure in the 
Middle East, especially given the improved peace initiatives in that 
region. We are also familiar with the important role Canada plays 
in Middle East affairs.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us what Canada is doing to ensure we are 
proactive in pursuing opportunities for contracts in the rebuilding 
of infrastructure in the Middle East?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question from the member for 
London-Middlesex is especially timely given the progress that 
has been made in the peace settlement process in the Middle East. 
Against that background the need for infrastructure and the need to 
sustain the economic development of the region is evident 
everywhere. It is in such products that Canada is eminently 
qualified to supply.
<P>
	We reopened our embassy in Beirut in January, indicative of the 
commitment we are making to the further progress in the Middle 
East.
<P>
	I also take this occasion to pay tribute to my parliamentary 
secretary, the member for Ottawa Centre, who has been particularly 
active in leading delegations and trade fairs to the Middle East.

<P>
	The petitioners to draw to the attention of the House that 
managing the family home and caring for preschool children is an 
honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value

against families that make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the

Mr. Speaker, I bring to the attention of the House a petition signed 
from people in Ontario and Nova Scotia.
<P>
	They state the Bloc Quebecois is comprised solely of members 
elected from only some constituents in the province of Quebec; that 
the Reform Party of Canada having only one less member in the 
House representing constituencies in five provinces and with 
constituency associations in every province of Canada more truly 
represents the interests of Canadians.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to preserve 
Canadian unity, parliamentary tradition and to protect the rights of 
all people of Canada by prevailing on the Speaker of the House of 
Commons to recognize the Reform Party of Canada as the official 
opposition during the remainder of the 35th Parliament of Canada.

containing over 6,500 signatures. Despite the fact that Bill C-68 
has passed the House of Commons petitions keep coming into my 
office. The people who have signed these petitions are reluctant to 
give up home that the law will be amended or scrapped all together.
<P>
	The petitioners believe the costs of the measures proposed 
within Bill C-68 have been severely understated and they feel the 
already strained resources of law enforcement agencies will be 
taxed beyond reasonable limits. They are therefore asking 
Parliament to carefully reconsider the problem of violence in 
Canadian society and enact legislation to deal with that problem 
without further burdening those of us as citizens.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-103, 
an act to amend the Excise Tax Act and the Income Tax Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill 
C-103. Nominally or technically the bill deals with revenue. It is an 
instrument to assist in the development of Canadian culture.
<P>
	I want to take a moment to congratulate the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage for his foresight in this area, as well as his very able 
parliamentary secretary for her dedication to this issue and others 
in the area of heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We heard a little earlier today the minister's eloquent speech 
about the advantages of this bill for an important component of the 
Canadian cultural industry.
<P>
	We also heard the comments by a member from the Reform 
Party, and I must say that I could hardly believe my ears.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some years ago I had the opportunity as a member of the 
Canada-U.S. Interparliamentary Association to attend a meeting 
with U.S. legislators, congressmen and senators of the United 
States. The issue of culture was on the agenda of that meeting.
<P>
	It was interesting to hear the debate. At the time it was the film 
industry in the United States that was protesting quite loudly what 
it perceived to be certain rules in this country which did not allow 
it, in its view, the opportunity to do the amount of business it felt 
was the correct amount.
<P>
	Today we heard a member from the Reform Party refer to some 
sort of cultural nationalism and cultural patriotism, describing the 
bill as being some sort of extreme right wing legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Needless to say, those comments are totally unjustified. The 
purpose of this bill, which comes from the minister and not from 
some extremist supporter of Canadian nationalism, is to reassure 
this country's cultural industry that we want to help promote the 
growth of Canadian periodicals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Coming back to the meeting with Canadian and U.S. legislators, 
those legislators at the time were telling us about the film industry. 
Obviously they had been lobbied very hard by groups in the United 
States. They explained to us how they had these provisions to deal 
with and how they were supposedly unfair.
<P>
	I remember the answer of one of my colleagues at that meeting. 
It was something like this: ``Would you as an American legislator 
tolerate it if 97 per cent of all the films shown in your country were 
made elsewhere? Would you tolerate it if you looked at films all 
day long, every day, all week for the rest of the year and never saw 
one single building, one single street or one single city located in 
your country?'' They shook their heads and said: ``No, we guess we 
would not''.
<P>
	This situation is similar. The member from the Reform Party 
who spoke about cultural nationalism and cultural protectionism, 
and those other adjectives he used, surely would understand that. 
Canadian cultural industries are not asking to dominate the world. 
They are asking to be able to operate and to enable us to see in 
magazines and periodicals the equivalent of what I described a 
little earlier of the problem in the film industry. It is the same thing. 
It is the same thing on paper.
<P>
	I do not want to oversimplify the problem but I believe that is 
what we are seeing. The issue of magazines is important. Members 
across say that surely the government is not saying that the 
magazine industry is so uncompetitive or so derelict that it cannot 
compete elsewhere. That is not the issue.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	There are economies of scale and entrepreneurs, particularly in 
the United States, are taking advantage of them. I did not invent, 
nor did the member opposite, the fact that the nation beside ours 
speaks the same language as the majority of Canadians and is 10 
times larger.
<P>
	That is the reality with which we live. We live beside a giant. It is 
not good, it is not bad, but it is there. Surely all of us understand 
that. I am sure the member opposite can. We should not pretend 
that we can compete-for specialty magazines particularly but for 
magazines over all-that we can lose the little bit of advertising 
revenue which we have, to people elsewhere and still be able to 
survive. I hope the hon. member is right in saying that we can do 
that everywhere. The reality is that the economies of scale make it 
very difficult for that to happen.
<P>
	Last year I subscribed to a magazine about skiing. They sent me 
about eight monthly publications. I did not know it at the time, but 
the magazine in question, even though it had a post office box in 
Canada, was produced in the United States. Not one picture of a 
Canadian ski slope was in those magazines. Not one advertisement 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14821"> 14821 </A></B>
<P>
was for a hotel room or anything else that I could recognize. I did 
not subscribe again. I had absolutely no use for it.  However I did 
not know that at the time I subscribed to the magazine. These 
things are not obvious when we subscribe to those magazines. How 
are we supposed to know?
<P>
	As communication develops more and more, the sophistication 
of the methods of advertising for some of these products also 
develops, such as the technique I have just described of periodicals 
using post office boxes. For some reason they always seem to be in 
the same town in southwestern Ontario. Now that I have subscribed 
to that particular magazine, I recognize the coincidence of so many 
businesses being located in a small village. Obviously they are not 
located there. A variety of methods are available to those 
businesses, such as using a post office box in Canada. An 
application is faxed by one person, probably on the Canadian side, 
to heaven knows where south of the border and then the people are 
put on a mailing list and the goods are shipped back this way.
<P>
	We are facing these things in this industry and in a variety of 
others as well. It is not a matter of Canadians not being smart, 
which the hon. member of the Reform Party said underlined the 
position of the government. It has nothing to do with that at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why we must recognize the problem inherent in a 
legislative loophole that allows some magazines to publish a 
Canadian edition by inserting a number of pages or articles with 
so-called Canadian content in what is otherwise a totally foreign 
publication and then trying to pass it off as a Canadian product.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The split runs, as they are referred to, with components of a 
particular periodical being Canadian or perhaps nominally 
Canadian, do not constitute Canadian publications per se.
<P>
	It is disconcerting that this bill is not receiving the support of all 
members of the House. We should be speaking with one voice 
about our Canadian cultural industry and about our Canadian 
cultural identity. That is the very least we could do on a bill which 
is perhaps to a degree housekeeping but to a larger extent is 
symbolic of what we must do as Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And I am disappointed by the position expressed by our 
colleagues from the Reform Party.
<P>
	I will support this bill later when it is voted on in the House of 
Commons. In the few minutes we have left, I hope that the 
members opposite-that is to say, the members from the Reform 
Party-will think long and hard, examine their consciences and tell 
the Canadian people that we must act together in a concerted effort 
to protect Canadian cultural industries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have a rich history and a strong cultural heritage. As 
Canadians we have not waved the flag very much. I am not an 
historian. I would love to say that I am, but I am a fan of history. If I 
was anything else but the MP for Glengarry I would probably have 
been kicked out of office if I was not a fan of history because the 
area I represent I like to say is the birthplace of Ontario.
<P>
	Glengarry is an area familiar to the minister. A few months ago 
he was nice enough to come and dedicate the Sir John Johnson 
House, the building where, one could argue, Upper Canada was 
founded in 1784. I thank the minister for his visit. I wish all 
members could see this very important, historical village in my 
riding where great Canadians such as Alexander Mackenzie, Simon 
Fraser, John Thompson and many other northwest explorers all 
lived. This one community was the birthplace of the province of 
Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Williamstown.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Williamstown was named in honour of Sir 
William Johnson who was the leader in the Mohawk valley of the 
United States. The town was named by his son Sir John Johnson 
when he came to Canada as the leader of the United Empire 
Loyalist refugees, as they were known then, and the Mohawks. He 
was the leader of both. He came with them to Canada and named 
the town in honour of his father.
<P>
	This is just one example of a strong, important cultural and 
historical site in the constituency that I represent. I have always 
thought that if Williamstown had been in the United States, not that 
I wished it were there, it probably would have been the equivalent 
of Gettysburg, a very important site. My point is that it is virtually 
unknown to many Canadians.
<P>
	As Canadians we have not recognized the importance of many of 
the sites such as that, the artefacts and knowledge that is historical 
and cultural in its content.
<P>
	Today we are discussing a bill which is not necessarily related to 
history, although I suppose it could be in the case of publications of 
that nature. However in a general sense it speaks to an issue which 
we should all stand up for today as Canadians, to the extent that we 
can in the House. I am speaking of the protection, preservation and 
enhancement of our culture and our heritage. I hope we will all do 
that later today when we vote on this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
assure the hon. member that our party stands up in favour of a 
strong Canadian culture. What we disagree with is how to get there.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to pose a question to the hon. member. First, the 
hon. member talked about economies of scale. I think he would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14822"> 14822 </A></B>
<P>
acknowledge that other industries over the last several years have 
utilized economies of scale but  this has not meant the complete 
collapse of various Canadian industries. In fact what has happened, 
which I think he would acknowledge, is that many of those 
industries have grown stronger and have gone on to compete 
around the world.
<P>
	Bill C-103 actually prevents that from happening for the 
Canadian magazine industry. I will give the member a perfect 
example of that. Télémédia, a Canadian company, which actually 
publishes <I>Harrowsmith</I> magazine out of the United States, had to 
be grandfathered into the bill so that it could continue to publish in 
Canada as well.
<P>
	When this legislation is put in place, assuming it will be, in the 
future Canadian companies will not be allowed to publish out of the 
United States and then have it come back into Canada. In effect, it 
stops Canadian companies from expanding. To me, that is 
absolutely ludicrous. It shows how provincial and inward looking 
this legislation is.
<P>
	I challenge the hon. member to defend that particular aspect of 
this legislation and ask him how that is going to promote Canadian 
culture around the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the hon. member is wrong. 
He says that the economies of scale that exist in other industries 
have not hampered Canadian businesses from operating. Perhaps 
there are industries where that is true. Obviously such is the case. 
However, I challenge the member to find people in the printing 
business who would not agree with the proposition I am going to 
make and say that when we are talking about printing and 
distribution of documents, periodicals and otherwise, economies of 
scale are not important.
<P>
	The small book publishers in Canada would agree that the 
economy of scale that exists south of the border has been very 
difficult for their industry as well. I have a company in my riding 
called Cormorant Books, which has published works from very 
famous Canadian authors. It always has this difficulty because of 
the huge size of the runs south of the border whereby one can 
publish books, perhaps not of the same quality. I think our authors 
are better. Maybe I am just a little biased in that regard. 
Notwithstanding, the fact remains that the cost of publishing per 
unit when we get into those absolutely large sizes south of the 
border is such that it makes it very difficult for the Canadian 
industry.
<P>
	All this bill hopes to do is to provide the small incentive that will 
make it such that we can help our Canadian industry a little bit in 
the area of periodicals and magazines. It is not a sinister plot. It is 
not cultural nationalism or cultural whatever it was the hon. 
member referred to a while ago. It is simply a reflection of the 
reality that we can and we should as a society have this kind of an 
industry based in Canada for the benefit of Canadians.
<P>
	Surely the hon. member would understand that. If he does not, 
perhaps his constituents or others can remind him of the benefits of 
what I have just referred to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems to me 
that many of us in this House have been struggling since we first 
went to school and then university and participated in Canadian 
society about the way in which we define ourselves as a country, as 
a society, and ultimately how we survive in a world that is 
becoming in some ways a globalized world. You can put it as you 
like, but it would be unrealistic for us as Canadians not to recognize 
that we have a unique culture in this country. We must work hard to 
preserve the existence of that culture.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	Our magazine industry is an essential component to the 
preservation of our culture because our magazine industry 
determines in some respect the news our citizens read. It 
determines the way in which our citizens perceive events. It 
determines our ability to reflect ourselves.
<P>
	We have a very rich cultural expression in our magazine 
industry. There are many magazines published in this country, and 
many of them provide extraordinarily beneficial insights into 
where we are going as a country and where, if I may say from my 
own perspective as chairman of the foreign affairs committee, 
Canada should place itself in the world. Those are very important 
voices, which we must maintain. Those are voices we must 
encourage. Those are flowers that must be nourished if we are to 
survive.
<P>
	We must recognize that if we allow our magazine industry to fail 
and after that our film industry and after that other industries, we as 
a country will be left without a voice, without an ability to express 
ourselves, without an ability to affirm ourselves here in this House, 
to affirm ourselves in our scholarly institutions, to affirm ourselves 
in our civic institutions.
<P>
	I do not wish to overemphasize this, but the richness and 
diversity of our magazine industry is an important component to 
the existence of our cultural identity. We can be proud of the 
richness and diversity of that magazine industry and some of the 
magazines we are able to read.
<P>
	The unfortunate fact is that our industry is not on a sound 
financial footing. The fact of the matter is that it does depend on 
advertising revenues. I have the figures here. It depends about 85 
per cent on its advertising revenues. Our magazine industry 
publishes for a much smaller population base than its competitors 
from the United States.
<P>
	This is where this bill seeks to do something. It seeks to redress a 
delicate balance with an enormous industry in the United States 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14823"> 14823 </A></B>
<P>
with tremendous export potential, with volumes against which we 
cannot compete in any way. I  am sympathetic to the point raised by 
my colleague from the Reform Party that we have to recognize that 
there is an export component to this as well. However, there will be 
no export component to this if the industry does not survive here 
domestically first. We have to preserve the basics.
<P>
	This bill does not seek to in any way give an unfair advantage to 
our domestic industry. It merely seeks to make sure that from a tax 
perspective American publications that come here are not taking 
advantage of that enormous market they have and in fact what is 
the equivalent of dumping in this country. They are dumping not 
only their product, but they are dumping ideas. They are dumping 
their civilization. I use dumping in the term of an international 
trade lawyer. It is coming in here in huge quantities, at a very cheap 
price and in a way we are not able to compete with.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	We must give ourselves the weapons we need to protect 
ourselves if we want our civilization, our culture, our country to 
survive in an increasingly globalized world. This is what 
Parliament, what all parliamentarians should try to achieve.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is a modest measure to try to achieve that important goal. It 
fits very well within what our government has said in respect of our 
trading measures. We have said clearly whenever we have sought 
to develop trade policy in this country that the cultural industries of 
this country and our cultural existence are not up for negotiation. 
We will insist we have a right to adopt laws and measures that 
protect our cultural existence.
<P>
	The magazine policy we are looking at here goes back over 30 
years. I can remember as a young man being at university and 
reading about the dispute over <I>Time</I> magazine and the tax policy. 
Many of the members of the House will remember the same thing. 
We have grown up on this. It is not an issue that is going to go 
away. It is not an issue we can afford to let go away. We owe it to 
ourselves to ensure that we create the sound financial basis in our 
country for the survival of our own cultural institutions and then 
deal with it from a trade perspective.
<P>
	This measure manages to achieve that balance. It gives our 
industry that breathing room, that sense that we can survive, that 
we are not going to be completely submerged in the weight and the 
volume of imports of American magazines that naturally come 
here. Nobody is saying we will not let magazines in. Nobody is 
saying we are going to stop anything. All we are saying is that we 
must ensure the financial viability of our industry, which depends 
on its advertising revenues for that viability and that vitality.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	I come from the community of Rosedale, which is proud of the 
vitality of the cultural industry in the city of Toronto and feeds on 
it. Toronto is becoming a cultural centre of international acclaim. 
Americans come in high numbers to go to our plays, to our musical 
festivals, to participate in the rich cultural life we have in the city 
of Toronto.
<P>
	Part of that rich cultural life is there because we have 
publications that feed it, fit into it, amalgamate with it and create a 
sort of a whole of a sense of a vibrant cultural existence that is a 
part of this country. We owe it to ourselves to continue always to 
encourage that, to build on that, which is what the minister is trying 
to do in the bill. It is commendable.
<P>
	These are extremely complex and difficult issues, particularly in 
the modern trade climate, which requires that we must recognize 
there is a balance to be achieved. Overall, what we get with this 
legislation is a recognition of a problem. The problem is a lack of 
funding for an important industry. We get a recognition that the 
way to deal with overwhelmingly powerful competition is to tell 
our local producers here is something that will give them some 
marginal ability to guarantee that their bottom line will allow them 
to survive.
<P>
	As such, the bill balances these and gives us the ability, when we 
get down to it, to preserve what is an essential industry in our 
country if we are to have a country where we know what our ideas 
are, are able to express them, get those ideas into print, share them 
with one another, and continue to make as a result a contribution to 
our country and ultimately to the world as a whole. For that reason, 
I support wholeheartedly the measure. I hope that other members in 
the House will support it as well.
<P>
	I look forward to working with the minister in other areas where 
we can ensure that the cultural dimension of our domestic and 
foreign policy will ensure that Canadian values and interests are 
not only dealt with here but actually have access to the world as a 
whole. To do that, we must first ensure we are on a sound footing at 
home. This is where we start. The bill is a modest but important 
contribution to that start.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> I listened to the hon. 
member's speech with interest. I do not know what his background 
is prior to being an MP, but I was in small business. I owned a small 
business and I employed 10 people. As I listen to this talk about 
giving special consideration to certain industries, whether it be 
through subsidies or tax concessions or grants or whatever, as a 
small business person who created jobs without any subsidies, 
without any help or special consideration from government, it 
really starts to irk me. And I know that it irks all the other small 
business people out there who are also creating jobs without this 
special treatment from government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14824"> 14824 </A></B>
<P>
	I realize we are talking about culture here and that this gets 
everybody very upset. However, why should there be any more 
protection for a magazine than for any other small business, 
simply because it is cultural?
<P>
	I have sold my business now, but were the 10 jobs I created not 
worth just as much as the jobs that are created by some magazine 
that is subsidized? Does it mean it was not important because I did 
not get a subsidy and it was not cultural? I had to compete with 
Office Depot and huge companies like B.C. Tel, which had millions 
of dollars to compete with me. Did I start whining and moaning, 
asking for the government to help me? No. I got out there and did 
what I did well and I made sure I concentrated on products and 
services that people wanted.
<P>
	What is wrong with the magazine industry looking around and 
taking a few surveys to find out what its customers want and 
putting it in a format people are prepared to buy, without needing a 
subsidy here and a subsidy there? They would do well to build a 
niche for themselves.
<P>
	For example, in New Zealand, where I am from, the film 
industry was subsidized forever by the government. When they had 
their debt crisis down there they pulled the subsidies for the film 
industry.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	For a change, instead of making a lot of rubbish the film industry 
started making worthwhile quality films which it could sell 
internationally which now win awards. I am sure some members 
here have seen those films.
<P>
	What possible excuse could the member have to denigrate all 
small businesses that fight to create jobs without these subsidies? 
How does he justify giving special conditions to these other 
industries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's observation is to 
some extent legitimate in the sense that we are struggling now to 
get away from the world of subsidization and special treatment for 
certain industries or certain products.
<P>
	However I do not think it is fair for him to suggest to the House 
or to members of the public that there is an exact parallel between 
an industry which manufactures a product which then goes out into 
the marketplace and a cultural industry.
<P>
	The member asked me my background. I taught international 
trade law at university and I am involved in a small business and I 
have some business interests in the United States, in the United 
Kingdom and in Europe. I have had the opportunity of working 
through a lot of business problems.
<P>
	I do not think the member would be wise if he said all businesses 
were the same and we treat them all the same.
<P>
	Why is it important to preserve or give special treatment to a 
threatened industry such as the magazine  industry where for 
example we might not choose to do that in the textiles industry, in 
the shoe industry or some other industry?
<P>
	The answer is that when we are talking about trade and when we 
are talking about competition it is one thing to speak of 
competition in normal products and goods but another when we are 
talking about competition in ideas, through which the hon. 
member's children will determine their view of the world, we have 
talked a lot about violence in the House. We have talked a lot about 
the need to preserve our society from violence. Members of the 
Reform Party continually day after day speak in the House about 
the need for better criminal legislation to deal with the issue of 
violence but the member now wants magazines which come across 
the border espousing and pushing violence on the same footing as 
everything else.
<P>
	The reason we need special treatment for this industry is we need 
a Canadian view of life. We need a way of being able to express 
ourselves. That is why it is different. It is ideas. It is the future of 
our generations that we are talking about here. We are not talking 
about a pair of shoes. We are not talking about a shirt or a tie. That 
is why we are desperately determined to preserve something that is 
the way in which we will be able to express ourselves. That is why 
when we look at radio, television, magazine publishing or 
newspaper publishing we always consider it with a special 
provision.
<P>
	The United States is no different. It pushes its industries in that 
area extraordinarily hard. Everywhere we go in the world, if we 
talk to French politicians, to Australian politicians, if we talk to 
anyone, we are all concerned about the preservation of our cultural 
values and identity. Why? Because we do not wish to have them 
submerged in somebody else's concept about what we are about 
and what we are trying to do.
<P>
	That is what this bill is directed toward. That is why it is really 
worth an exception from the general principle.
<P>
	I subscribe entirely to the member's point that we must get away 
from a system where government is involved in subsidizing 
average industries. I strongly urge him to consider that there must 
be a difference always between industries making ordinary 
products and those products of the mind which represent our ability 
to be stable, to be civil, to be tolerant and exist in a world which is 
becoming more complex, more violent and more difficult to 
survive in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of the 
member for Rosedale.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14825"> 14825 </A></B>
<P>
	If we truly had a protectionist attitude maybe we would not have 
ABC television or CBS television. Maybe we would not be exposed 
to any television programs come from the United States or 
elsewhere. Maybe the  NHL would never be in the United States 
and maybe we would not have t he NBA coming to Canada now.
<P>
	There is a contradiction the member is espousing but obviously 
does not see when he talks about protectionism and in the same 
sentence talks about the global economy and how we must 
compete. I am wondering if the member could again try to explain 
to the House the reconciliation of what he is saying.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is an American conservative 
philosopher we may have seen on television, George Will. He has 
often said that free trade ranks somewhere between Christianity 
and jogging as an item which is much talked about but little 
practised.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member that if he looks at other nations and 
at other countries he will find they too seek to protect their cultural 
industries for the very reason which I urged on him today. Please do 
not take me as being a protectionist. I am not some sort of Luddite 
who says we should build up a wall and not let in U.S. television 
programs. We know technology will make all of that totally and 
utterly irrelevant. It would be ridiculous to try to do that.
<P>
	Given that technology is driving more open borders and more 
access, we should not shut other things out. It is all the more reason 
to ensure that at least our local industries are operating on a level 
playing field. That is all we are asking. That is all this measure 
seeks to do. This measure is not trying to erect some enormous 
wall. All the other things will still come in. What this measure is 
seeking to do is to ensure that this frail industry we have in Canada 
has sufficient financial means that when the bottom line is there it 
will continue to survive. The bottom line for it is finance, but the 
bottom line for us as a country is survival. That is why I am in 
favour of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his answer. 
However there is still a contradiction and I was wondering if he 
could clarify it further.
<P>
	The government is planning on introducing legislation regarding 
neighbouring rights. Here is legislation which will affect an 
industry in Canada, the broadcast industry, which is in severe 
trouble. It is losing millions of dollars a year and yet the 
government has plans to tax that industry. How can it justify that 
when it will look after another industry? There is a protectionist 
attitude toward one industry and yet there is a failing industry in 
Canada, the radio broadcasting industry, and the government will 
do nothing except increase its taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the short time remaining I am not 
able to give an extensive answer to the hon. member's question. 
However, the member well knows that what seems on the surface a 
contradiction in public policy often reflects that different situations 
call for different measures.
<P>
	To suggest the magazine industry is in all respects exactly the 
same as the broadcasting industry would be wrong. We have 
learned through watching what takes place at the heritage 
committee that with the new information highway the print media, 
books, film, radio and television all require quite different 
solutions. However, ultimately it is the same principle, to guarantee 
a healthy industry in Canada. That is the principle by which the 
government operates. We want a healthy industry, whether 
broadcasting, books or magazines. To get that healthy industry we 
will have to adopt different measures in different fields. That is the 
reason for the difference.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CULTURALPROPERTYEXPORTANDIMPORTACT">CULTURAL PROPERTY EXPORT AND IMPORT ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.) 
</B>moved that Bill C-93, an act to amend the Cultural Property Export 
and Import Act, the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14826"> 14826 </A></B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce, at second 
reading, a bill which seeks to allow appeals of decisions made by 
the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board.
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export and Import Act was proclaimed in 
1977 to ensure the conservation, in Canada, of important objects 
which are part of our movable cultural heritage. To that end, the act 
provides export controls, as well as tax incentives to encourage the 
donation of cultural objects to designated museums, archives and 
libraries in Canada.
<P>
	Moreover, the act established the Canadian Cultural Property 
Export Review Board, whose mandate includes three major 
responsibilities: to hear appeals filed when an application for an 
export permit is rejected; to determine whether cultural property 
given or sold to a designated Canadian institution is of outstanding 
significance or of national importance; and, to determine the fair 
market value of certified cultural property.
<P>
	The fair market value of certified cultural property can be 
eligible for a tax credit, just like a charitable gift. However, unlike 
in the case of a charitable gift, the eligible amount is not limited to 
20 per cent of the net income. Moreover, any capital gain realized 
following such a gift is exempt from the capital gain tax.
<P>
	From 1977 to 1991, the board only had a mandate to hear appeals 
related to the rejection of an application for an export permit, and 
to determine whether cultural property was of outstanding 
significance or of national importance.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	In 1991 responsibility for determining fair market value of 
cultural property was transferred from Revenue Canada Taxation to 
the Board. At that time, there was no provision for appealing Board 
decisions in this connection. Thus the right of appeal provided by 
the Income Tax Act was inadvertently lost.
<P>
	The number of gifts of cultural property has increased constantly 
since 1991 and the Board received a record number of requests for 
the 1994-1995 fiscal year.
<P>
	In performing this new function, the Board carefully examines 
the fair market value proposed for a gift. In the majority of cases, it 
accepts as the fair market value the amount indicated in evaluations 
made in good faith by at least two independent assessors and 
obtained by the recipient institution.
<P>
	If the Board requires additional information, the recipient 
institution may seek another opinion, or in certain cases the Board 
itself may have an assessment done by Canadian or foreign experts. 
After it receives this information and approves the proposed 
amount, the Board issues a tax certificate for the cultural property 
in question for the amount established.
<P>
	In approximately 10 per cent of cases between 1991 and 1994, or 
some 150 cases annually, the Board determined that the monetary 
value of the gift was lower than the evaluations accompanying the 
application.
<P>
	In conformity with the current provisions of the Act, if 
additional information becomes available, the applicant may 
request that the Board redetermine the fair market value of the gift. 
If the Board does not change its initial assessment, the applicant 
will then have no further avenue of appeal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Donors in custodial institutions have complained about the lack 
of an appeal process. In the interest of natural justice, they have 
suggested that donations to institutions might decline if it is not 
possible to appeal review board decisions.
<P>
	In 1993 the former department of communications hired KPMG 
Peat Marwick Thorne to undertake an independent assessment of 
the needs for an appeal of determinations of the review board. 
During this study using professionals, art dealers, donors, 
collectors of cultural property and members of the review board 
were interviewed about the need for an appeal. Agreement was 
unanimous: an appeal process should be established.
<P>
	As a result in June 1993 it was announced that the Cultural 
Property Export and Import Act would be amended to allow donors 
of cultural property to appeal determinations of the review board to 
the Tax Court of Canada, a right that had been in place before 1990.
<P>
	At the same time it was announced that amendments would also 
be included to extend the circumstances under which donors would 
be able to request determinations by the review board. Donors, 
institutions and some professional associations such as the 
Canadian Museums Association have advised me that they 
continue to believe it is essential that there be an appeal of the 
review board's determinations.
<P>
	It is expected that the expanded circumstances whereby the 
review board can redetermine fair market value will mean that the 
donor and the review board will be able to come to an agreement 
about value. It is expected that this will significantly limit the 
number of appeals to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	The question of who is eligible to request a redetermination of 
fair market value has been the subject of some discussion with the 
Department of Finance. The legislation states that either the donor 
or the applicant can request a redetermination while only the donor 
can appeal to the tax court.
<P>
	These proposed amendments will benefit donors, museums, 
archives, libraries and art galleries throughout Canada. While 
donors do receive a tax credit, their donations enrich public 
collections for the enjoyment and education of all Canadians. This 
program is open to all. Many important objects of Canadiana have 
been donated by individuals from every sector of society, gems of  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14827"> 14827 </A></B>
<P>
history, heritage and culture that may have been in their families 
for generations.
<P>
	In conclusion, the tax incentives for donations of cultural 
property continue to enrich public collections. They ensure that 
objects which might otherwise be lost to Canada are retained here 
for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	I also believe that the establishment of an appeal process is 
sufficiently important that we will be reallocating resources within 
the department of heritage to ensure that it will function 
effectively. The establishment of an appeal of determinations by 
the Canadian cultural property export review board is in fact only 
the reinstatement of the right of appeal that was lost in 1990.
<P>
	This legislation will help to ensure that Canadians do not lose the 
evidence of their heritage. I would ask for support of this initiative 
which will strengthen legislation that has been instrumental in 
preserving our national heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it will be a pleasure for the Bloc Quebecois to support the 
bill tabled by the Minister of Canadian Heritage. We think it is 
extremely important for this bill, whose purpose is to amend the 
Cultural Property Export and Import Act, the Income Tax Act and 
the Tax Court of Canada Act, to be passed as soon as possible.
<P>
	The only point I would like to make as opposition critic is-and 
speaking of bureaucracy, I think this is a good example-that back 
in 1991, it seems that after the legislation was adopted, they 
realized, at least that is what I was told, that through an unfortunate 
oversight they forgot to include the right to appeal. It seems to me 
that at the time, the government should have turned around and 
said: ``Listen, we forgot something. We will immediately amend 
the legislation we just adopted to correct this oversight''.
<P>
	Fortunately, four years later-and I hope we will have time to 
finish the process-it will be possible to adopt the legislation and 
correct this oversight, to ensure that Canadian cultural property 
remains in Canada. There is a weak spot in this legislation, an 
omission, and we would have liked to see stricter controls on the 
export of cultural property.
<P>
	I once saw a television program that provided clear evidence that 
many items of Canadian cultural property are readily passed across 
the border between Canada and the United States. It seems that 
controls are so lax this is not a problem.
<P>
	I think it is important to remember that the right of appeal is a 
fundamental right. If someone makes a decision, he must have the 
right to appeal, the right to be heard if he is not satisfied with that 
decision.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	That is exactly what is happening here. You donate something, 
its fair market value is assessed, you are not satisfied, and you 
appeal to the board which can then decide to make certain changes.
<P>
	If you are still not satisfied with the board's decision, you have a 
second chance to appeal, this time to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	I think it was an excellent decision in 1991 to take the 
responsibility for this decision away from Revenue Canada, since 
the board has the real expertise. The people there are 
knowledgeable about the value of cultural property. They are 
experts, so it is much easier for them to determine the value.
<P>
	I think the minister's speech was very clear. The Bloc is prepared 
to support this legislation, which is very technical and is based on a 
natural right. This is a bill the Bloc can go along with because its 
purpose is to correct an oversight, the kind of technical legislation 
we have become accustomed to getting from the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. In fact, I would like to see the minister 
introduce fundamental legislation on Canadian policy, and we are 
really waiting for the new copyright act. I am launching one more 
appeal in this House.
<P>
	However, it is not my intention to take up too much of the time 
of this House, for whatever reason, and I think that the minister 
gave a very clear explanation of a technical bill. I mentioned 
omissions that are of some concern to the Bloc Quebecois, but he 
has our support, and that will be it for now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address Bill C-93. When addressing an amendment it is 
important when doing research to look at the actual act and make 
some judgments about whether or not the act in itself is a good 
piece of legislation and whether or not it is appropriate for a 
political party such as ours to support the act overall. I will touch 
on the amendment and speak a little more broadly about the overall 
act.
<P>
	Both the minister and the hon. member who just spoke talked 
about the appeal process. Previously there was an appeal process 
which permitted people to go to Revenue Canada and ultimately to 
the tax court to get a ruling on the value of a piece of art being 
donated to a recognized Canadian cultural institution. We do not 
have problems with that. One big concern we have with respect to 
the whole issue is the potential for bureaucracy and the potential 
for abuse. I want to talk about that in a little more detail.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14828"> 14828 </A></B>
<P>
	One concern we have is that there is a potential for a board 
which has been appointed by a government to be very cosy with 
people in the arts community. Very often they come from the arts 
community. I am very concerned that we will have a situation 
similar to what we have in the Canada Council today where artists 
sit in judgment of other artists. It is a ``you scratch my back and 
I will scratch your back'' situation. I can see some real potential 
for abuse.
<P>
	To be a little more specific, when appointees are passing 
judgment on the historical value of papers belonging to former 
prime ministers who may have appointed them to the board, there 
is some real concern in my judgment about those types of things. 
We have to be mindful of this and ensure there are processes in 
place so that people are not caught in a conflict of interest position.
<P>
	I know my hon. friend from Okanagan will be talking about that 
a little bit later.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Another concern is that a lot of these things are going to end up 
being appealed to the tax court. In my judgment there is very little 
doubt about that. People will say: ``I am getting a raw deal'' when 
they bring their work of art forward and ultimately say: ``We want 
to take this on to the tax court''.
<P>
	This was not something told us officially, but when we were 
researching this, someone in the department told us there are 22 tax 
court judges across the country but something like 6,000 cases 
before the court, an astonishing number. That is a tremendous 
backlog of cases for determination about the value of these various 
articles. Given that backlog it may be advisable to allow this to 
remain in the hands of people who are experts in this field.
<P>
	I want to talk a little bit more about the actual tax credit system 
itself. This is an area in which I have grave concerns. This is a tax 
loophole that definitely benefits wealthy Canadians more than 
anyone else. In the last budget the government talked very 
enthusiastically about the need for tax fairness.
<P>
	I would argue very few ordinary Canadians are going to be able 
to take advantage of this legislation. Somebody who is a 
subsistence hunter in northern Canada, a wheat farmer in 
Saskatchewan or somebody who works in the coal mines in Glace 
Bay is not going to be able to take advantage of this loophole. The 
people who are going to take advantage of it are going to be the 
crème de la crème, the top 1 per cent of income earners. If anyone 
does not need a tax loophole it is them.
<P>
	I would encourage the government, when it is engaging in this 
rhetoric about the need for tax fairness, to think about that for a 
little while. Not only does this legislation reward them in so far as 
they are the ones who are most likely to have the important pieces 
of art that institutions  want, but it rewards them in how it has 
skewed the tax system for them.
<P>
	Let me give some detail on that. It is amazing. In fact when I 
read it I could not believe it. Right now the department issues about 
$60 million in tax credits every year through this legislation. It 
works like this. If something is donated to one of these institutions 
the tax credit is far greater than is available for any other type of 
charity in the country. In fact, normally if you donate to the food 
bank you can get a tax credit up to 20 per cent of your income. That 
does not apply to people who are making cultural donations. They 
can get a tax credit for all of their income. They can carry the tax 
credit forward into years down the road so that it can be applied 
against income.
<P>
	It is an amazingly lucrative way of avoiding paying taxes for the 
wealthiest of Canadians. If one has an income of several hundred 
thousand dollars and gets a tax credit through the cultural export 
review board for $300,000 one will pay no tax. To me that is 
absolutely ridiculous. I wish the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood was here.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> May I have the House's 
attention. I want to caution members not to make reference to the 
absence of members in the Chamber. I do concede there was no 
deliberate intent but certainly it is worthy of mention as we 
continue debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. The hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood has campaigned long and hard in the 
Liberal Party for a flat tax system that gets rid of the very type of 
loopholes that wealthy Canadians are taking advantage of today 
through this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	Lately the Reform Party has talked long and hard about the need 
to have legislation that treats everybody fairly. Reformers believe 
in equity and this is very inequitable legislation. I really do have a 
tremendous problem with its essence which is special treatment for 
people who donate these objects of art. That is of great concerns.
<P>
	I challenge the government to review this matter and to ask 
itself, in its heart of hearts, if this is really fair. I am sure on 
reflection members across the way who in good conscience stand in 
the House and tell us that they do not like to see privilege go to 
wealthy Canadians, if they understood the essence of this bill they 
would have a tremendous problem with it. That is one of the things 
that concerns me greatly about this legislation.
<P>
	Our party views this as Robin Hood in reverse. It is not only that 
wealthy Canadians are getting a tremendous tax advantage here. It 
is the lack of revenue that is created by the $60 million in tax 
credits. It means that when taxpayers have to pay for things the 
government views as priorities, average Canadians have to be taxed 
to  a greater extent in order to bring that revenue in. In a day and 
age when the talk is about cutting social programs, reforming UI 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14829"> 14829 </A></B>
<P>
and possibly looking at pensions for seniors, that $60 million 
would be extremely valuable.
<P>
	I will be moving a motion in just a moment on the need to bring 
this type of legislation in line with what currently exists in the 
income tax system. Ultimately Reformers would like to see a flat 
tax implemented which would get rid of these types of abuses and 
privileges for the wealthiest of wealthy Canadians.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that I recognize that wealthy people are 
discriminated against in this country. Being wealthy is quite a 
burden. People are not protected in the Canadian Human Rights 
Act for being wealthy. Wealthy people are not protected under Bill 
C-41, the legislation that extended protection in the justice system 
to people based on certain categories. I do not believe wealthy 
people are protected in employment equity legislation either.
<P>
	I appreciate that wealthy people have a tremendous burden to 
bear. I appreciate that sometimes people say snide things about 
them behind their backs and talk about them as though they are 
better than rest of us. I can see that is a large concern, but I do not 
know that we have to go so far to correct that abuse and that 
inequity as to give them the $60 million in tax credits every year.
<P>
	I am going to conclude by moving a motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' 
and substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House declines to give second reading to Bill C-93, an act to amend the 
Cultural Property Export and Import Act, the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court 
of Canada Act, since it fails to address the issue of the burden the tax credit 
system places on middle class taxpayers who are asked to pay for a potentially 
endless stream of donations of questionable cultural and artistic value claimed 
by wealthy Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment is in order. 
Debate is now on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have seen an 
example of the shallowness of the debate by the Reform Party. 
When people look back on the Reform record they will find 
Spanish eyes on the turbot, green eyes on unity and closed eyes on 
the cultural industry at large.
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export and Import Act ensures the 
preservation in Canada of our heritage in movable cultural 
property. Through the combined provisions of export controls, 
grants and tax incentives for donations to designated Canadian 
custodial institutions, the legislation has been highly successful in 
enriching the collections of public institutions and thereby 
providing Canadians access to their heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The legislation also established the Canadian Cultural Property 
Export Review Board and defined its mandate. From 1977 to 1991, 
the Board's mandate was to hear appeals in the case of denied 
export permits and to determine whether the cultural property 
given or sold to designated institutions met the criteria of 
``outstanding significance and national importance'' contained in 
the legislation.
<P>
	In 1991, the Cultural Property Export and Import Act and the 
Income Tax Act were amended in order to transfer responsibility 
for determining the fair market value of certificated cultural 
property from Revenue Canada to the Review Board.
<P>
	There was no provision, however, for appeal of decisions by the 
Review Board, and the right to appeal under the Income Tax Act 
was lost.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The need for an appeal process was identified and acknowledged 
in 1993 following widespread consultation with custodial 
institutions, donors of cultural property, dealers in art and antiques 
and members of the review board. The museum community is 
convinced that an appeal is necessary to ensure that donors will be 
confident their donations will receive a fair hearing.
<P>
	By establishing the right of appeal, potential donors will be 
assured that if they are dissatisfied with a review board 
determination they will have recourse to the Tax Court of Canada. 
With the concurrence of the Tax Court of Canada the appeal to the 
tax court has been made retroactive to January 1992, thereby 
providing all donors who have made a gift since the right to appeal 
was lost and who wish to pursue an appeal with both the 
opportunity and the legal right to do so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill also covers situations in which donors may ask the 
Review Board to reconsider its initial decision. The increase in the 
number of situations in which the Review Board may redetermine 
the value of a gift will provide donors not wanting to spend the 
money involved in an appeal to the Tax Court of Canada with an 
opportunity for a new hearing on the circumstances surrounding 
the gift and the determination of its value by the Board. This 
approach will mean that most of the applications for appeal will be 
handled directly by the Review Board, eliminating the need for 
court proceedings and thus making the process accessible to all.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	It will also ensure that any disagreement on fair market value is 
discussed by experts in this highly specialized field. Applications 
for redetermination made to the Review Board will be studied in 
depth by members of the Board and other experts as necessary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14830"> 14830 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The provision for two appeal processes is also cost efficient 
because it is anticipated that the majority of appeals will be 
resolved directly between the donor and the review board and will 
not necessitate a formal appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. In a 
time when we are all concerned with reducing government 
spending, the ability to resolve differences of opinion about fair 
market value with an existing organization, the review board, 
whose members serve on a part time basis, will result in savings of 
both time and money.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The review board is an agency operating at arm's length from the 
Department of Canadian Heritage and it is resolutely in favour of 
establishing a procedure whereby one could appeal its 
determinations regarding fair market value. The review board is 
made up of specialists in museology, collectors or traders, who are 
well aware of the difficulties custodial institutions and donors of 
cultural property have encountered because there was no appeal 
procedure. The determination of the fair market value is currently 
done and will continue to be done by individuals who are skilled in 
various areas relating to cultural property and very active on the 
markets where this property is sold.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The determination of the fair market value of any object and 
particularly cultural property involves an element of subjectivity 
that can lead to disagreement. These disagreements occurred when 
the responsibility for determining fair market value resided with 
Revenue Canada. There have been disagreements among the 
experts in the time since the review board has assumed this 
responsibility. This debate is both healthy and inevitable when 
dealing with often unique material. An open and transparent 
process at the time the review board determines and if necessary 
redetermines the fair market value of cultural property is essential.
<P>
	The right to pursue the matter in the courts if no resolution can 
be found is consistent with both the Canadian legal system and the 
concept of natural justice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The staff of designated institutions argued that the absence of 
any appeal procedure caused the number of donations made by 
collectors to drop. All designated institutions would therefore 
welcome the implementation of such a procedure, since it would 
foster an increase in donations while at the same time eliminating 
the potential for tension in dealings between donors, custodial 
institutions and the review board.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Donors of cultural property have also reacted positively to the 
introduction of the bill, as they believe that it removes a major 
deterrent to donating. Any  perceived denials of natural justice 
have been resolved, as donors will now be able to appeal to the tax 
court if they disagree with the review board's determination of fair 
market value.
<P>
	There is also strong professional support for these amendments 
in the communities that are most affected by the availability of tax 
credits for donations of cultural property. The Canadian Museum 
Association and the Canadian Art Museum Directors Association 
have expressed strong support for the bill and the establishment of 
an appeal process. Both associations, whose members include 
museums and art gallery personnel from across Canada, have 
issued policy statements in support of the establishment of an 
appeal process.
<P>
	These amendments to the Cultural Property Export and Import 
Act to create an appeal process to the Tax Court of Canada of 
decisions of the review board should not be viewed as a shift in 
government policy, nor should they be interpreted to be a reflection 
on the work or credibility of the Canadian Cultural Property Export 
Review Board. Instead the bill must be recognized for what it is: 
the reinstatement of a right to appeal that was lost in 1991 when 
responsibility for determining the fair market value of certified 
cultural property was transferred from Revenue Canada to the 
Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	The amendments to the Cultural Property Export and Import 
Act, the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act 
contained in the bill will ensure the continued preservation of our 
heritage in movable cultural property. The appeal process will 
ensure continued confidence in the donation system and will in turn 
lead to an increase in donations to museums, art galleries, archives 
and libraries.
<P>
	This bill also ensures that there will be public confidence in the 
fairness of the procedures of the review board and that there is no 
denial of natural justice. Furthermore, a right of appeal that was 
lost in 1991 when responsibility for determining fair market value 
was transferred to the review board will be restored.
<P>
	These amendments will also remove any obstacles, real or 
perceived, to making donations to Canadian custodial institutions. 
Through these donations all Canadians will benefit, as we will be 
ensured of the continued preservation and access to Canada's 
heritage in movable cultural property.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member.
<P>
	What we are seeing today in the House of Commons is the 
hypocrisy of the Liberal government. It talks of fair taxation. It has 
the nerve and the audacity to talk of fair taxation. Is the bill before 
us fair?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14831"> 14831 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not just donated works of art that are eligible for the tax 
credits; it can be anything that is deemed to be of outstanding 
significance and national importance. For instance, prominent 
retired politicians such as Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Turner and Mr. 
Mulroney have all donated their personal papers to the National 
Archives in return for very high tax credits. It will amount to 
hundreds of thousands of dollars over many years. Who is it being 
funded by? It is being funded by the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	Fair taxation? Is it fair that this will be used by former prime 
ministers and people the government deems important, but not by 
the dual income family that is having a difficult time making ends 
meet? Is it fair tax policy when something like this will be used 
mainly by the extremely wealthy in Canada and not by the disabled 
worker who is on a very low income or by the mother of two who is 
struggling to survive?
<P>
	What we are seeing today is the hypocrisy of the government, 
which in its last budget told Canadians that there would be a tax 
increase for those mothers who will have to get work to make ends 
meet, to the dual income family and to the disabled person.
<P>
	The government raised gasoline taxes by 1.5 cents per litre. That 
hits home. That hits the average Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	What we are seeing today is a tax measure that is for the elite of 
our society.
<P>
	Would the hon. member like to comment on that?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are so many fallacies in the 
hon. member's statement that I am at a loss where to begin. Let me 
try to tackle them one by one.
<P>
	I am not surprised by the limitations of the member's discourse, 
as his party refused an earlier briefing on Bill C-103. Had they been 
briefed on that bill and this bill they would be more erudite in their 
comments.
<P>
	There are very few programs that are not vulnerable to abuse. We 
are not going to abandon our cultural institutions because there is 
one dishonest person or maybe two who might be participating in 
fraud or tax schemes. However we will make every effort to 
safeguard programs that have value. We are not going to paralyse 
all our programs in support of the Canadian cultural industry 
because of abuse to a program that has on the whole served 
museums and the Canadian cultural institutions well.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	It is important-and this is the limitation of the member's 
argument-to understand that cultural property is not just paintings 
and fine works of art; it extends to our natural history.
<P>
	I know the hon. members of the third party really do not 
appreciate our heritage and our history and would perhaps prefer to 
adopt a <I>Fahrenheit 451</I> policy to literature.
<P>
	I remind the member that the hotels in Ottawa are packed with 
people who come to see our works of art and our museums. They 
are not coming here for the Reform Party. As much as they might 
have delusions, there is nothing much artistic about their 
arguments, as abstract as they may be.
<P>
	On their attack on the wealthy, what they forget is that people 
who have money do contribute and sponsor the arts. They make a 
considerable contribution in that regard. The best possible 
treatment a donor may receive is a refund equivalent up to 50 per 
cent of the fair market value of the object or collection they are 
donating.
<P>
	We understand that the members of the third party would rather 
see all our collections of art shipped to the United States or 
elsewhere to foreign markets. However, we feel there is merit in 
keeping them in this country, because Canadians appreciate them 
even if members of the third party do not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, would 
the hon. parliamentary secretary acknowledge that this tax 
legislation also applies to works of art that are not Canadian, that it 
applies for instance to American works of art as well as Canadian 
works of art?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Maybe the members opposite really do not have 
an appreciation for art in any form, but Canadians do not hold their 
heads in the sand like ostriches. There is a world there and we 
would like to have access to that world in any form and in a cultural 
form as it may occur.
<P>
	Is the hon. member suggesting that we build a little cocoon 
around ourselves? I suspect that the hon. members have no 
appreciation for anything of a cultural nature. If it were up to the 
members of the Reform Party, the only place they would find 
culture would be in yogurt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
certainly appreciate the fine edge of wit spewing forth from the 
other side.
<P>
	The third party, as the hon. member has put it, has raised some 
serious issues, not the least of which is the fact that it is the 
wealthiest of the wealthy Canadians who are taking advantage of 
this. This is not something that is available to everybody. She has 
continually skated around that issue.
<P>
	I would ask her to address this very specifically and tell us how 
she can reconcile this piece of legislation with all the rhetoric of the 
last budget about the need to have tax fairness.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had opened his 
mind to have a briefing from the department he would have learned 
that it is not just wealthy Canadians who donate art; it is individuals 
who for instance have had Canadiana in their family for 
generations. These may be objects that benefit Canadians  in 
general to know their history. The individuals have chosen to 
enrich the collection of local or national institutions, rather than 
selling them. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14832"> 14832 </A></B>
<P>
If the member wants to reduce this just to a dollar figure, they 
might make more on the foreign market if they were to sell their 
objects of art.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	I can list a countless number of objects that have been donated to 
museums. What I might suggest is that the member might benefit 
from a little trip to the museum to get a fuller education.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
hon. parliamentary secretary knows, there is a warehouse full of 
alleged art which used to belong to the art bank. This art is going to 
sit there in storage probably for years upon years upon years. The 
fact is that every year the amount of tax credits that are requested 
and granted goes up, not down as both the minister and the 
parliamentary secretary have suggested.
<P>
	Given this, does it not make sense that there should be some kind 
of a limit placed upon the amount of available tax credits? We 
would then not ding people so strongly in the middle class because 
we are having to pay for the wealthiest Canadians. Also, where are 
we going to store all this stuff? We already have one warehouse 
full. I am wondering what the parliamentary secretary is proposing 
to do with the rest of it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the question indicates 
the ignorance of the third party. If we have objects of art that are 
worth seeing, I think we will find a place to put them so that 
Canadians can benefit.
<P>
	Members of the third party really thrive on misinformation. For 
instance, the same member mentioned that the annual value of 
certified cultural property is approximately $60 million. That was 
the figure he cited. What he did not tell Canadians is that the results 
in foregone revenue are approximately $25 million to $30 million 
annually.
<P>
	Having said that and since we know the Reform Party never tells 
the whole story, it is the position of this government that we do not 
like to see a situation where flaws in the tax act cause us to lose 
precious works of art.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the fact that members of the third party feel that 
natural justice should be tossed out the window, I think even with 
the limitations that the members of the third party have shown 
themselves to have today, I believe Canadians will agree with me 
that we do not want headlines such as: ``Canada loses art donation 
due to tax rule hang-up''. I think most Canadians would not want to 
see situations like that occur because of a housekeeping matter, 
because of a right that was lost as an oversight, even if members of 
the third party do not believe in natural justice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address Bill C-93 and also speak as to why 
I believe the amendment put forward by my colleague should go 
through.
<P>
	Government members talk of abuse. This government has been 
full of abuse since it has been here. It has never stopped. They have 
lived off the backs of the taxpayers since day one. They have never 
changed. They said when they came to power how they would 
change things, how they would be different from the 
Conservatives. They are now called the con-lib party because there 
is no difference; they are in bed together and have been for a long 
time.
<P>
	When the hon. member from across the way says there was no 
abuse in the system, let us look at what the Canadian public-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> I never said that. Do not misrepresent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Misrepresent. I am afraid I cannot do that with 
you.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know colleagues obviously 
want to debate the issue, but I would remind the House to direct 
their interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. Let us look at the <I>Gazette</I> 
where it says: ``Former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will find 
out this week of his approval for a tax break for donating his 
papers. Members of the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review 
Board will decide whether to accept an approval of the value of the 
papers which date from before Mulroney was Prime Minister in 
1984''. It goes on to state that is unlikely Canadians will ever find 
out what the deduction is worth to him, the former Prime Minister. 
This appraised value of the papers is private but could eventually 
amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Do we not think the 
public has a right to know what they are paying and giving up for 
the so-called works of art or donated papers?
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau also received a tax break 
by declaring his papers.
<P>
	In 1993-94 the archives staff under Michael Swift, assistant 
national archivist, completed organizing two sets of papers for 
Prime Minister Mulroney. The first set, which will take up to 15 
metres of shelf space, covered Mulroney's time as a Montreal 
lawyer and businessman in the 1970s and 1980s. I do not think the 
Canadian taxpayers, who pay for the system, really care. If they 
had really cared they probably would have kept him in office, but 
here we go on and on.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member across the way talk about Canadian 
culture and heritage. Back in the late 1800s there was a gentleman 
who lived in Aspen Grove, British Columbia. They nicknamed him 
the Grey Fox. The Grey Fox is part of our history. He robbed banks  
and stage coaches and was one of Canada's great train robbers. Yes, 
I think maybe he was one of the first Liberals of the day but at least 
he had the common sense to use a mask. Today we see what I call 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14833"> 14833 </A></B>
<P>
the great Canadian tax grab right off the backs of the Canadian 
people.
<P>
	Here is a caring, sharing government and what does it do? It 
takes away the $100,000 capital gains for the working class 
because they have probably already claimed it so they no longer 
need it. That was the first kick. The second kick is allowing these 
things to go on knowing full well that working class Canadians will 
have to pick up any shortfall in the taxation system.
<P>
	We can go on. The <I>Gazette</I> of March 24, 1995 states: ``Under the 
scheme which dates back at least 20 years, a donor buys a work of 
art for well below the artist's usual fee. The donor will then have 
the work evaluated for four or five times the amount he or she has 
paid for the work and then donate the piece to a gallery, museum or 
a registered charity and write off 100 per cent of the evaluated 
amount, art experts explained''.
<P>
	Let us go on a little bit further: ``Rolland's Art-Transit has paid 
Montreal artist Catherine Widgery 20 per cent of the usual price for 
her work. `If it is $10,000 for the work, I get $2,000', she said, `but 
they will still be allowed to claim that $10,000 if it is valued at that 
price''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is a good deal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> It is a win-win situation, as a Montreal artist also 
says in the same article. Museums are happy to get things for free. 
That raises another question.
<P>
	I was brought up to believe that a gift is a gift and a gift given is 
free. How do we get into a tax deduction situation for giving a free 
gift? Why do we call it a gift? Only in Liberal language would this 
ever be allowed. I do not know, maybe I have to look up what a gift 
means but it sure has changed from the time I went to school.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Back to museums which are happy to get things for free. Artists 
are happy because they have a bit of money in their pockets. 
Everybody is happy. What is not, in the words of the writer, kosher, 
is that a client is buying a work at below its value and getting the 
write off for a different amount. Still, the artist added, ``I find the 
whole thing a little bit fishy but everybody is doing it''. Doing it the 
Liberal way.
<P>
	What is the difference between this government's taxation policy 
and the previous government? Nothing. It is business as usual.
<P>
	The Liberals hold up the red book as a great work of art. We 
found out how good that work of art was in western B.C. It was in 
every outhouse. We found out it was only half-ply strength and you 
all know what happens when you use only half-ply strength.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This is a place of debate, but 
the Speaker wishes to be involved to the extent he is able to from 
the Chair. Please do not direct comments across the floor to one 
another. That word ``you'' inevitably leads sometimes to another 
debate which I do not think is something we really want to 
entertain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, let us look at what the red book has 
done for Alberta or Saskatchewan. They found that if they shaved it 
up really fine and mixed it in with the fertilizer it helped the crops 
grow. The trouble is that most of the crops turned black.
<P>
	It has been a great benefit for the jobs program in Ontario and 
Quebec. It has plugged every sewer system in the provinces.
<P>
	We can now also look at what it has done for Atlantic Canada 
and Newfoundland. It is the only fishy thing they have left down 
there.
<P>
	I am hoping over the course of time this does not become part of 
our culture and heritage that goes into our museums.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is nice to hear some fiction being put out by the 
hon. member. My question is very simple. He talks about tax free 
allowances for the rich and does not agree with it. I wonder if that 
means he does not agree with his leader's clothing allowance given 
to him by the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, concerning clothing allowances, I 
have not heard anybody mention the $285,000 or is it $585,000 the 
Prime Minister gets for his toothbrushes. As the hon. member 
knows, there is no clothing allowance. It is a figment of their 
imagination, but the Liberals are good at figments of the 
imagination.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> I beg your pardon. No way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> I believe there is an expense allowance that we all 
give our leaders and the Prime Minister gets far more than anybody 
else. He gets a lot I understand, a whole bunch. Somehow it is 
written off. I do not know how, but that is the Liberal way of 
balancing things. The Liberals have a funny way of justifying one 
but not the other. It is strange but if we fall into the Disneyworld of 
Liberal philosophy we will find that Mickey Mouse and Goofy sit 
side by side. When they draw these things up it becomes a cartoon 
scenario the Canadian public is just about fed up with.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I resume the question 
and comment period it is my duty, pursuant to  Standing Order 38, 
to inform the House that the question to be raised to night at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14834"> 14834 </A></B>
<P>
time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Shuswap-a question which was transferred for 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am certain 
that not too many people will be paying for the Reform Party 
cultural document.
<P>
	It amazes me to hear the hon. member mention this legislation is 
all for the wealthy and the rich and yet the same person turned 
around and defended the capital gains tax. The capital gains tax 
was purely directed to people of higher incomes. I can prove the 
people who received the benefits of that deduction were the higher 
income, wealthier people, the very people the Reform Party 
represents in the House.
<P>
	There is a little problem with arithmetic here. The bottom line is 
anybody who is making a donation of, for example, $10,000 will 
get a $5,000 tax credit. It costs them money. This is not some kind 
of gift to the wealthy. They made a donation of their cultural 
property, be that the group of seven artists or Cornelius Krieghoff, 
so that it would stay in Canada and be the property of the people of 
Canada. This is something the Reform Party fails to understand.
<P>
	The other thing that seems striking to me is that the Reform 
Party talks about getting rid of this and having a flat tax. I want to 
put things in perspective. The Reform Party does not want to admit 
this but the flat tax is designed to assist and help anybody who has 
an income of over $200,000.
<P>
	The president of the United States with all of his analysts went 
through the whole concept of a flat tax years ago. He asked them to 
prove to him how it would not be the major system for people with 
over $200,000 income. It stands to proper reason that if we are 
trying to collect <I>x</I> dollars from the taxation system and there is a 
flat tax we will allocate taxes from the upper income groups to the 
middle income earners. That is what the Reform Party would have 
us believe. That is who the Reform Party is representing in the 
House.
<P>
	The reality is the cultural products some people have are usually 
part of an estate. As part of settling that estate they give a good 
portion of these artefacts to the government through the museum 
system. These are things our museums would not be able to 
acquire. It is not a loophole, it is an incentive to keep those 
products in Canada.
<P>
	How can he defend the capital gains tax system but not this 
system and how can he defend a flat tax system but not this system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know it is hard for the hon. member 
to understand that under capital gains the $100,000 is for the small 
investor, the person who tries to put a little aside to get ahead 
because they know darn well with what is happening underneath 
the government  there will be nothing there for their old age unless 
they look after themselves. The government will take it all away 
from them anyway while its members make sure their pensions are 
well kept and they are well fed before they think about the poor 
average working class person. It is a shame.
<P>
	When the member asks about capital gains at the $100,000 level 
it creates investments. It gives the Canadian working people a 
chance to get ahead where the government cannot weave and sneak 
in between and take it from their bank accounts, which this 
government is so very good at.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, really. The everyday worker, the 
plumber, the electrician? In my riding we have General Motors 
workers. I did these people's tax returns for years and I do not ever 
remember them claiming a capital gains tax exemption. Be serious. 
Level with the people.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	These people are supporting the professional class, lawyers, 
doctors and accountants. That is who they are talking about. They 
are not talking about the everyday person in the street.
<P>
	Will the hon. member please tell us who he thinks is claiming the 
$100,000 capital gains tax exemption?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can well tell him who worked 
toward getting the $100,000. It was the person who invested in the 
nickel and penny shares in the stock exchange who tried to keep the 
exploration companies going. It was the person who tried to put 
something away so they could claim it to further their children's 
education.
<P>
	The hon. member maybe has never dealt with the small business 
people in Canada. If he had problems helping people to do their tax 
returns maybe he should look at changing the policies he is so hard 
set on keeping so he can keep people like that working.
<P>
	Maybe that is a question the hon. member might like to answer. 
Why has he not come up with some kind of a change in the 
program? Why is it always a Conservative-Liberal program or a 
Con-Lib policy that we go along with? We have bunk beds, Bloc 
beds and now Con-Lib beds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have enjoyed the debate this afternoon. It indicates a 
philosophical difference between the Liberals and those people in 
the Reform Party. I suppose that is no surprise.
<P>
	I have a copy of the little book of reform. This is the gospel 
according to the leader of the Reform Party. Let me read a bit from 
the booklet. From page 23: ``The Reform Party supports the 
responsibility of the state to promote, preserve and enhance the 
national culture''. I wonder if the hon. member opposite has ever 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14835"> 14835 </A></B>
<P>
read the  little green book of the Reform Party. I recommend it to 
the member. It is very interesting reading, provided it is not done 
on an empty stomach. Otherwise it is quite good and I highly 
recommend it to the member.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the responsibility of the state to 
promote, preserve and enhance the national culture. Let us 
remember what we are doing today. We are adopting a bill which in 
a small way does precisely that. One would think the Reform Party 
would be saying it is about time the government did something it 
recommended in its handbook.
<P>
	No, of course not. What happened is there are Reform members 
who did not read the little green book and they obviously do not 
know we are trying to do what they advocated.
<P>
	The Reform Party seems to believe the cultural industry benefits 
only rich people. Let us talk about the whole industry of museums 
and cultural industries generally. Two of the largest cities in the 
world thrive and make as their main business culture: Paris and 
London. Those fortunate enough to have see the Louvre, I believe 
the second largest museum in the world, will agree it is beautiful 
and almost impossible to describe. The treasures are such that it 
would take weeks to see everything in it. Millions and millions of 
people have seen and will see the Louvre. One could probably open 
any fourth or fifth door of any building in Paris and the same would 
be true of so many things there. Many people go to Paris for that 
reason, because it is so lovely, because it is such a wonderful city 
and because all those cultural amenities are there.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Other museums are the Musée d'Orsay, which focuses on 
paintings, and the Centre national d'art et de culture 
Georges-Pompidou, which features modern art.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is the same in London. I have been to the Royal Albert 
museum where the Magna Carta is displayed, one of the most 
important historical documents in the western world. There were 
people standing to have a glimpse of the Magna Carta. They must 
have been four or five abreast and a queue of them several feet deep 
waiting to look at it for seconds just so they could go back home 
and tell people they had seen it.
<P>
	The Mona Lisa at the Louvre is the same thing. There were so 
many people around it you could barely see it at all. I had the 
previous misconception it was a very large painting. It is a little 
painting and one has to almost fight one's way to see it. Many 
people go there for no other reasons than to see that.
<P>
	That is true of how many other works of art? How many people 
in this city reap the benefits of that? They are not just rich people. 
People visit Ottawa to see our  beautiful museums. I highly 
recommend the Queen's collection, although it is no longer here. 
How many people travelled here from many communities, stayed 
in hotels, gave tips to waiters, gave jobs to those transporting them 
from the airport and so on? It has contributed to the local economy.
<P>
	Culture is a business, a very big one in many cities in the world 
and in our country. It is big business. It provides meaningful jobs.
<P>
	That is a concept people across never raise. They think somehow 
the whole cultural industry has half a dozen beneficiaries getting 
rich and no one else is benefiting so that two or three artsy-fartsies 
can watch this stuff. It is not like that. It is the way the Reform 
Party would like to depict it to Canadians and to the House. It is a 
wrong way of viewing things.
<P>
	In my riding there is the Nor'Westers and Loyalist Museum in 
Williamstown.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Cumberland Township Museum in Cumberland and other 
local museums hold historical artefacts, old documents, and so on. 
Many visitors end up spending some time in the community and 
supporting local businesses.
<P>
	This bill applies to Canadian and other cultural property. Earlier, 
a Reform member asked the hon. parliamentary secretary whether 
someone who owns a foreign work of art would be eligible for this 
deduction? I am asking you: What difference would this make?
<P>
	If someone wanted to give Canadian taxpayers or a Canadian 
museum a work by Leonardo da Vinci, would we refuse the offer? 
What kind of narrow minded values are some of our colleagues 
trying to convey in this House? If some valuable cultural property 
was available, I think we would want it so we could enjoy it and 
show it to others. And even if we looked at this from a strictly 
economic point of view, we as a society would want to capitalize on 
the fact that people would come from abroad to see it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	How many tourists come to this city to see these things, not just 
locally, not just people from 10 miles away, but people from across 
the country? They cross the border from the United States. They 
come from everywhere to see some of the things we have.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	That is equally true elsewhere. My very distinguished colleague 
reminds me that we are not even talking about the educational 
benefit. If you bring a child to the museum and show him or her a 
copy of our Constitution, a copy of the original flag proclamation 
or other such artefact, there is a tremendous educational benefit as 
well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14836"> 14836 </A></B>
<P>
	We are talking about whether we should give a tax benefit to 
someone who donates an object of art. What is the test? First, the 
object in question has to be determined to be one that qualifies 
for such a tax credit. It is not arbitrary. I cannot empty out my 
desk and call it art or cultural property and get a tax credit for 
it, although maybe some day the little green book of the Reform 
Party could be put in a museum. However I do not think I would 
get much of a tax credit.
<P>
	The first test is that the object has to qualify. The second test is 
what the parliamentary secretary said in her speech a while ago if 
members across had been listening, which is giving a credit of 50 
per cent of the market value. My other colleague from Durham is 
very knowledgeable with numbers as he is a accountant. I am sure 
he would agree that if you start off with that proposition the taxes 
saved are a proportion of that, whether it is 50 per cent, 60 per cent 
or whatever the number is depending on the tax bracket the person 
is in.
<P>
	Let us now assume a 50 per cent tax bracket. That means that if 
one gives a $1,000 object one does not get $1,000 from the 
taxpayers. One receives $250, assuming a 50 per cent tax bracket 
working on 50 per cent of the appraised value of the original work. 
That is the way I see it. If those numbers are even slightly off the 
principle remains the same. It is not a matter of only rich people 
getting a credit for a piece of cultural property.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us not forget that the Reform Party, despite the comments 
made by some of its members today, launched its last election 
campaign by calling for the promotion, the furthering of Canadian 
culture. I am totally confused. I must tell you that I am having 
difficulty in following the logic used by Reform members. Their 
thoughts and actions seem to lack coherence. What are these 
objects they are talking about?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some members across have alluded to the fact that former Prime 
Ministers gave their personal papers. Let us look back in history. 
Let us not measure things as they are now. I am not here to defend 
Brian Mulroney. I probably criticized him more than all the MPs 
across put together. However, that is not the point here today. The 
point is not whether I happen to agree with that person's policy at 
the time he was the Prime Minister. I think the verdict is already 
out on that one. Read Stevie Cameron's book and you will find out 
in case you are still in doubt.
<P>
	The point is whether there is value to these objects. That is 
determined by an independent panel, not by members of this House 
and least of all by political opponents such as I. It is looked at 
historically. As I said earlier today speaking on another bill, if we 
were to evaluate today whether the documents of Sir John A. 
Macdonald are of historical value we would be hard pressed to find 
people who do not think they are. They  are obviously very 
significant. Probably three years after he left office the discussion 
on the issue would have been a little different. The same applies for 
many other people.
<P>
	Some time ago the Hudson's Bay Company gave some important 
historical documents of that very old business which was founded 
in the 17th century. For a period of time that company owned part 
of what is our country today. It was the physical owners of the land, 
a quasi government of its own with administrative powers, et 
cetera. Some of these documents have been given to the country.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I suppose there were times in the past when a trapper who 
brought things to be exchanged at the Hudson's Bay store did not 
get what he considered to be the proper value. He would not have 
thought much about the cultural value of the documents that 
belonged to a company that did not give him what his material was 
worth. But that was measured in the contemporary. It is not 
necessarily the way in which we can measure objects of value for 
the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our museums across the country can avail themselves of certain 
tax measures to take advantage of donations made to them. That is 
right, sometimes rich people donate works. It is great when they do 
so. This way, the rest of us get to see these works, because only the 
rich can afford to have a private collection at home. I will not see 
them often myself, but if these people can give some away, that is 
just fine.
<P>
	In our society, there are also people who own works of art, say a 
painting bought some 30 or 50 years ago by a relative, and who 
now want to donate it to society in exchange for a tax benefit. What 
is wrong with that?
<P>
	I would like to put forward a final argument: Without these 
measures, would it be possible for individuals richer than myself 
and many of our fellow citizens to buy this cultural property and 
put it in their private collections, where it will be impossible for the 
rest of us to see and appreciate it? I urge Reform Party members to 
think about this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This measure can, has been and will be beneficial for all 
Canadians. However I do not feel the policy of the Reform Party is 
reasonable in its approach. Cultural property that is sometimes 
given to the public and to museums could very well end up in the 
hands of very small groups and would be lost to the rest of us.
<P>
	I am reminded that parts of the Lord Beaverbrook collection, for 
instance, were given through tax credits. I do not know whether 
colleagues from the Reform Party have ever been to the 
Beaverbrook Museum in Fredericton. I highly recommend it if they 
have not. They would see the extent of the collection and how  
precious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14837"> 14837 </A></B>
<P>
it is to have that as a property of the people of Canada. Again, one 
has to see it to appreciate it.
<P>
	The Ontario government through cultural agencies owns the 
McMichael collection in Kleinburg. No doubt a portion of those 
works were acquired utilizing devices such as this.
<P>
	Notwithstanding tax credits, which I am not too crazy about 
either, I am happy to see those works stay here for the Canadian 
public to see rather than in private collections in another country 
such as the United States or elsewhere, where people are either 
richer or have the advantage of a tax credit and can acquire 
property which I hope will stay here for the benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed hearing the hon. member's intervention. He talked about 
the Beaverbrook museum in Fredericton. I have not been there but I 
have been to the National Gallery. I have seen what has purchased, 
either through tax credits or directly with cash, which is the way I 
would prefer to see it done because it is a lot more transparent and 
you can hold people accountable that way.
<P>
	One of the things my hon. friend from Wetaskiwin pointed out 
was a display that hangs from the ceiling there. It is a toilet hanging 
from the ceiling of the National Gallery. Is that not a wonderful 
purchase by the people of Canada? I wonder how many tax credits 
we handed out for that? Perfect. Does that not speak volumes about 
state funded art? It speaks volumes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I walked into a room at the National Gallery where in one corner 
are Brillo pads stacked to the ceiling. That is art. That is 
unbelievable.
<P>
	I walked into another room where I thought they were 
undergoing renovations because there was a bunch of underlay 
lying on the floor. Do you know what, that was the display. Two 
hundred and fifty-six pieces of felt is what it is called.
<P>
	I have a picture sitting on my desk of a display at the National 
Gallery. It is a large woman reading a newspaper and she has got a 
wig on and all of that sort of thing. According to the people at the 
National Gallery who were telling people about these displays, 
someone was paid $750,000 for what in my judgment is an 
absolutely ridiculous piece of junk.
<P>
	When we talk about the government's prescient ability to choose 
art with other people's money let us go and take a wander through 
the National Gallery and find out just how good it is at this.
<P>
	The hon. member from Glengarry-Prescott-Russell pointed 
to Reform's policy on culture. Let me address that. Our party feels 
very strongly that the federal government does have a role, but we 
also feel that these institutions have to be accountable. I also 
remind the  hon. member that these things have to be put in context. 
Reformers also believe in a flat tax system. We believe that we 
cannot be going around giving wealthy people a special privilege. 
That is ridiculous. It is even more pronounced, more ridiculous in 
this day and age when middle income Canadians are being 
squeezed so dramatically.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to put these things in context. I 
would much rather see private individuals, private groups, lower 
levels of government like municipalities and provinces run the 
museums and galleries to the greatest degree possible because they 
are a lot more accountable. When it is all funded through the 
federal government and people who are appointed by the federal 
government make the selections, they are absolutely 
unaccountable.
<P>
	Has the hon. member gone through the National Gallery at any 
time in the recent past and seen some of these ridiculous, what can 
only be described as abuses, this mocking of taxpayers which is 
exactly what it is. Somehow we feel we have to support this counter 
culture, the people who mock a lot of the ideals that really enabled 
them to have freedom of expression. They mock us and we still 
give them money.
<P>
	Has the hon. member seen this lately and how he can justify the 
government being involved in purchasing that kind of garbage?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very attentively to the hon. 
member and have come to the conclusion that Reform Party 
politics has no artistic value.
<P>
	The member across said that he prefers to see the purchase of art 
for cash rather than tax cuts. That was in his first or second line. Let 
us calculate that mathematically. The hon. member for Durham is 
an expert with numbers and so are a couple of other members of the 
Liberal caucus who are accountants. They know these things far 
better than I.
<P>
	If you start off with the proposition that a work of art valued at 
$1,000 gives you a credit for 50 per cent of the value, which is $500 
and you are in the 50 per cent tax bracket which is $250, it costs the 
government $250 to get a $1,000 item.
<P>
	He prefers to pay $1,000 rather than $250. I think that is Reform 
math. I want no part of it and I do not think Canadians do either.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	The art critic for the Reform Party wanted to tell us that a 
particular work of art at the national gallery in his view was 
ridiculous or that he did not like it. That may be so. I do not pretend 
to understand everything in a museum of modern art any place, not 
just this place. I have been to the centre Georges Pompidou. I do 
not understand some objects there either. However, that is neither 
here nor there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14838"> 14838 </A></B>
<P>
	The issue is whether the museum should have bought that work 
of art. I do not even know if the member across knows who owns 
the work of art in question. He assumes everything in there 
belonged to the Canadian public through our tax system. That is 
not necessarily how it was acquired. It does not necessarily belong 
to the museum. It could belong to another museum but here on 
a travelling exhibition.
<P>
	I ask the member to take a little more time to go to the 
museum-this or any other one-speak to the curator and others 
and learn a little about how these things work.
<P>
	I have never seen the object in question. Perhaps I would not like 
it either, which is a different issue. I do not even know who owns 
the item in question. Judging from the comments of the member in 
his speech I would bet a dollar to a penny he has not asked the 
curator of the museum who owns the piece in question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just 
finished speaking on the telephone to an 86-year old constituent in 
my riding who has been watching some of the debate this 
afternoon. You will have to excuse me, Mr. Speaker, because he 
said to me: ``What the hell are you politicians doing over there 
wasting my money?''
<P>
	The members opposite can wax eloquent about all the wonderful 
things they want to do with other peoples' money. It is other 
peoples' money. The majority of Canadians, whether watching this 
or reading about it in the newspaper, know it is their money. They 
are getting s bit fed up with this place which is not a travelling 
museum but a stationary museum wasting their money.
<P>
	I get plenty of calls like the one I just had. I know that now at 
least my constituent will know I am trying to do something to 
change that system which is a disgrace. The sooner the other side 
recognizes it, the better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the disgrace is in the quality of the 
remarks I have just heard.
<P>
	The member referred to a stationary museum. I have never been 
inside the Reform Party caucus so I cannot comment on that. 
Perhaps the member is right to that extent. We all know dinosaurs 
are usually found in museums. To that extent perhaps he is correct.
<P>
	Concerning the issue, it is a serious one. The member across may 
not think cultural property is important to anyone. He has a right to 
think that. I think he is wrong. The heritage of this country is worth 
preserving. That heritage may involve the community museum we 
have in Williamstown in the great riding of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the Nor'Westers and Loyalist 
museum where people like Simon Fraser, Alexander Mackenzie 
and others worked and lived, then eventually went on to explore the 
great Canadian west. All of these things are important. Perhaps the 
member across does not think so. Perhaps he does not have an 
appreciation for these things which is his right. I do not contest 
that.
<P>
	If he says those things, historical objects, works of art, our whole 
heritage and past are worth nothing, then he has a right to think 
that. However, I remind him of the famous words of George 
Santayana that those of us who do not remember history run at least 
the risk of repeating it.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise this afternoon and participate in this debate on Bill 
C-93, an act to amend the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, 
the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act.
<P>
	What we are talking about is tax fairness. Fairness is something 
all Canadians are really looking for today, fairness in their tax 
system. I hear members opposite talking about the red book and 
talking about the green book. The only book that is really important 
and the one we are concerned about for Canadians is the bank book. 
Canadian bank books are paying for all these open ended and over 
generous tax credits. We are talking about $60 million in tax 
credits; $60 million in unfairness that is actually not in the system 
at the moment.
<P>
	I am a Rotarian and Rotarians have a four way test. These tests 
apply to all the things we do and say. One of those tests is: Is it fair 
to all concerned? Bill C-93 misses the mark about being fair to all 
concerned by a very wide margin. It is unfair to the average income 
Canadian taxpayer who is overtaxed, has no paintings or sculptures 
in his or her home and he or she is the least able to pay the tax 
burden he or she is presently under.
<P>
	It does benefit the very wealthy, the very rich in our society who 
have the art works and who have the sculptures and who have the 
ability to pay. Here we are subsidizing them. Those who have the 
sculptures, those who have the art works also have the bucks and 
are not deserving of the overly generous tax credits we are talking 
about in Bill C-93.
<P>
	We should be looking for tax relief for the average taxpayer. I 
hear lots on the other side about their ability to deal with numbers, 
how good they are with numbers. I wonder about that when I see 
we are rushing toward bankruptcy, $550 billion to $560 billion in 
federal debt, and deeper every day, and then sleep walking to 
bankruptcy. I do not know where all the experts in numbers are but 
they sure do not know how to balance the books very well. We are 
still spending in excess of $35 billion more than we are taking in. 
They had better reclassify their experts. They are failing the mark 
there.
<P>
	In Bill C-93 we are missing the mark in three areas when I talk 
about fairness. Bill C-93 introduces two new levels of appeal. 
There is more bureaucracy and more costs. On the second point 
there are tax credits for charities that are treated differently than the 
tax credits for the rich who have their works of art. That is grossly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14839"> 14839 </A></B>
<P>
unfair. The third is it is an open ended system with tax  loopholes a 
mile wide for those with the money and ability to look for them.
<P>
	Let us take the first one where we are introducing two new levels 
of appeal. Prior to 1990 Revenue Canada decided the value. That 
was the way it should have been. After the 1990 budget the 
Canadian cultural export review board was brought into being with 
no appeal, or at least no appeal without reason.
<P>
	Today Bill C-93 adds two steps to that. We now can have an 
appeal without a reason. We do not need a reason for an appeal. I 
cannot understand the logic of that but we can appeal without a 
reason. Perhaps someone over there can explain that to me.
<P>
	Then there is an appeal to the Tax Court of Canada-more delay, 
more bureaucracy and more cost. In the end we have taken it right 
back to where we were in 1990 where the tax department makes the 
final decision. What have we accomplished other than more delay 
and more costs to the taxpayer who is footing the bill?
<P>
	These appeals will escalate the cost. Take the scenario in which I 
have a piece of art in my home. I would be lucky to have a piece of 
art worth $1 million. I say it is worth $1 million. The review people 
take a look at it and say it is only worth $.5 million. What do we do 
for the next step? We go to the tax court. Judges being what they 
are will say they will meet me half way and it ends up being worth 
$.75 million. Who is the winner there? It is not the overtaxed 
taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	Let us look at the tax credits to charities. The limit is 20 per cent 
of net taxable income. It is money going to food banks and the 
Salvation Army, money to help those really in need and we have a 
limit on it. They are crying for help. They are under constraints 
from the government. No, it is a 20 per cent limit. That money goes 
to charities to help people really in need.
<P>
	Now we look at works of art donated by the rich and the wealthy 
of this community and there is no limit. The government will give 
them whatever they want. It is all right. It is a blank cheque. It 
makes no sense at all. It is grossly unfair. It is Liberal mathematics. 
The number crunchers have come up with this and the deficit will 
increase, the debt will increase and our tax burden will increase.
<P>
	It is an open ended system. I do not think there are any qualifiers. 
They can keep dumping art on us until the warehouses are full. 
There is no regulation which say we can only take so much or we 
have only so much money to put into this. It keeps increasing and 
we will keep putting it into warehouses. It might eventually find its 
way into museums. I would certainly hope so when we are 
spending $16 million a year and it is increasing. It seems to be 
acquisition for acquisition's sake.
<P>
	Is this bill fair? Is Bill C-93 fair to all concerned? I am not just 
talking about the artsy-fartsy; I am talking about the hard working 
taxpayers who are paying for all of this art which they rarely ever 
get to see. It is only fair to the top 1 per cent of our community. It is 
grossly unfair to 99 per cent of our overtaxed taxpayers. It is unfair 
to the charities looking for relief. They are looking for help and for 
donations from Canadians. Art donations have a higher priority 
with the government than does the Salvation Army. The Salvation 
Army is helping those in need and those looking for assistance.
<P>
	To say that if we defeat the bill it will be the end of art donations 
is rubbish. They will not stop, they will continue. We are not the 
ones out to destroy the cultural community, but we will not buy it 
with money we do not have and give it to people who do not need 
it.
<P>
	If we defeat the bill it will close a very big loophole of which the 
very rich in the community can take advantage. That is wrong. The 
ordinary taxpayer is incensed by it and wants something done about 
it.
<P>
	Let us do what is right for the majority of hard working, 
overtaxed Canadians who have no loopholes, just empty pockets. 
Let us be fair to all taxpayers and defeat Bill C-93.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did enjoy the address of the hon. member for Simcoe 
Centre on Bill C-93.
<P>
	I will give a brief review of one of the small historical museums 
in my riding. It is run entirely by volunteers. The artefacts and 
historical objects are donated through projects such as this. Two 
years ago that small historical museum had to sell off some of those 
artefacts in order to pay its operating expenses. This is the 
Colchester historical society museum.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Simcoe Centre talks about the 
fairness of the bill and the cost of maintaining art, culture and 
objects of historical significance in Canada, is it not better and of 
more value to Canadians to give these artefacts through a tax credit 
than for the taxpayers to have to use tax dollars to purchase art of 
value and historical artefacts that maintain the integrity of the 
history of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question of the hon. member. I was certainly pleased to hear that 
there are volunteers running the artefacts museum in her riding. 
That is wonderful. We need more volunteers working in our 
communities.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	I do not buy the premise that we have to offer tax credits in order 
to get these works of art these different paintings and sculptures to 
remain in Canada. I believe there are many Canadians who have 
done well in businesses in Canada who are prepared to make those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14840"> 14840 </A></B>
<P>
donations tax free without any tax credits. The  government is 
making the assumption that we have to do this to encourage it and I 
do not believe that.
<P>
	We certainly cannot and should not be doing it at this time in our 
history when we are in the financial mess we are in. We just do not 
have the dollars to throw away in the form of tax credits to the very 
wealthy in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am still 
mystified by the economics. Why is it that a $1,000 painting that 
we can acquire for $500 is not a good one?
<P>
	The member made the analysis between this kind of 
consumption of art work as part of our cultural history and identity 
with donations to charitable organizations. I am not clear at all on 
the member's point of view. Should we be raising the tax credit for 
charitable donations or should we be lowering the tax credit for 
works of art to 20 per cent? It is not at all clear what his analogy is 
and where that is taking us. Maybe the member could address that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to 
address that. I am not surprised that it is not clear when somebody 
thinks that spending $1,000 or $500 of money we do not have 
makes sense. That kind of logic escapes me.
<P>
	I am attempting to get across that the tax credit for these works 
of art is overly generous. We should be more generous in tax 
credits for the charities in our communities that are helping those 
who are in need. I thought I made that very clear. As I mentioned 
earlier, the mathematics on the other side escape me and their 
inability to grasp the seriousness of the debt position this 
government is in at the moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
were talking a little while ago about the acquisitions government 
has made and just how credible it is when it comes to making these 
acquisitions.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member is aware of the current display at the 
National Gallery by the artist Paul Wong entitled: ``On Becoming a 
Man''. It depicts a man and a woman laying buck naked in a bed 
with a couple of blow up dolls. I am certain there are all kinds of 
wonderful reasons to acquire this kind of art and probably no price 
is too high to pay for this wonderful art, but I am wondering if the 
hon. member from Simcoe has seen this. If so, can he tell us 
whether or not this is a worthy acquisition and an appropriate role 
for our federal government to be playing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must admit I 
have not seen this wonderful piece of art. Having it now described I 
do not think I will take the time to go and look at it. It is another 
example of the terrible waste of our tax dollars. Thousands and 
thousands of Canadians will never get to see it and many more of 
them would never want to see that kind of art. It is a tragedy that 
money is being spent in that area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
moment ago my colleague from North Vancouver mentioned a 
phone call from an 86-year old.
<P>
	In Wild Rose a lot of people watch the parliamentary channel 
and the things that go on. In my colleague's view, just exactly 
where would this type of bill fit in the list of priorities of today's 
problems we have in government? People in Wild Rose are saying 
there is a $600 billion debt. Parents of 10-year old children like 
Melissa are worried sick about what may happen to them. Bombs 
are blowing up all across the country because gangs are claiming 
turf or making sure they get their turf if they do not have any. We 
sit around and talk about all kinds of things that crop up because the 
magicians over there and their highly paid lawyers come up with 
all kinds of documents and legislation that we have to look after.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	People in Wild Rose want to know when we are going to get 
down to business. In two years we have not accomplished anything 
in their view. They would say that right this minute the Prime 
Minister and a lot of other people over there should be in their 
seats.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, I fully respect 
that this is the place to have the debate of the day on this particular 
matter. Clearly, we have all been here long enough now that under 
no circumstances can the Chair accept any reference to any other 
member of any party not being present in the Chamber. I would ask 
all of us to please keep that in mind.
<P>
	I ask the member for Wild Rose to please complete his question 
or comment because I must continue with the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, people in Wild Rose would 
wonder why we have not filled this place with all members of 
Parliament, getting down to business, working hour after hour in 
here trying to solve the problems of the nation. I would like to 
know what priority my hon. colleague puts on legislation of this 
type.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for Wild Rose for his question. Very simply, I would give 
it an extremely low priority. It would actually be below gun 
control, which is another waste of a minimum of $90 million of our 
hard earned tax dollars.
<P>
	I find it appalling that we are dealing with issues such as this 
while the country is heading into bankruptcy. We are going deeper 
and deeper into debt and we are talking about tax credits to the rich. 
We are not dealing with the real serious problems we are facing as a 
nation. We are dealing with issues that should not even be in front 
of us at this time in the history of the country.
<P>
	If we would do something about balancing our budget so that we 
can start offering some tax relief to the citizens  of Canada we 
would see the economy grow and jobs being created. The overly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14841"> 14841 </A></B>
<P>
high unemployment level would then be reduced to something 
which is far more acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, from the level of the debate particularly from the 
opposition benches this afternoon, I can see that the dinosaurs from 
the west are not only in Drumheller. Some of them appear to be 
alive and kicking and present in the Chamber today.
<P>
	It is important to understand that cultural property is not just 
paintings and fine art. It extends also to natural history, 
paleontology and mineralogy, all aspects of human history, 
archaeology, military history, antique furniture, antique firearms, 
which I am sure my friends like very much, scientific and 
technological objects and a full range of archival and library 
materials. There have been some significant examples recently of 
donations which help to illustrate the diversity of cultural property 
that is included in the legislation.
<P>
	Last summer several pieces of a meteorite fell near St-Robert, 
Quebec. These have been donated to institutions in Quebec and to 
the Geological Survey of Canada to enable scientists to enhance 
their knowledge of space and the history of the universe.
<P>
	The Hudson's Bay Company donated its extensive archival 
collection of business records dating from the 17th century to the 
present to the archives of the province of Manitoba. This collection 
includes information rich documentation that is being consulted 
and analyzed for such diverse information as arctic exploration, 
Canada's economic development and even climatic changes and 
weather patterns.
<P>
	Native run museums in British Columbia have been able to 
retain important and in some cases sacred objects in their 
communities through donations facilitated by the act.
<P>
	Some people like to characterize these tax credits for donations 
of cultural property as loopholes for the wealthy.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	I am thinking today of some constituents of mine. They are not 
people who drive $70,000 Cadillacs to Parliament Hill. For 
instance there is a research scientist for the federal government 
who has a group of seven painting which he inherited from his 
grandmother. He has loaned it to the art gallery of Windsor. A 
grade school teacher who is a friend of mine has collected primitive 
Inuit pieces over many years which I am sure she will ultimately 
donate. There is an anthropologist retired from the University of 
Windsor who has a collection of native relics. On Pelee Island in 
southwestern Ontario there are retired farmers who have exquisite 
collections of fossils and native relics. These are not wealthy 
people. These are not people for whom these  so-called loopholes 
are gaining extraordinary advantage. These are people who would 
like to be able to make a donation of their precious collections.
<P>
	Even if somebody is wealthy, and some donations are made by 
wealthy Canadians, this is consistent with their support of 
performing arts, of the arts community and of collecting 
institutions. Without their support Canada's museums, archives 
and libraries would not have the quality collections they now 
possess. Nor would we be able to actively participate in the 
international exchange of exhibitions and scholarships. Without 
strong collections in our custodial institutions we would have a 
reduced sense of our own identity and a diminished role 
internationally in the cultural domain.
<P>
	Many individuals who have donated important objects of 
Canadiana have donated those objects from collections which have 
been with their families for generations. They have contributed to 
the preservation of Canada's history. These individuals have 
chosen to enrich the collection of a local or national institution 
rather than exporting the object for sale with the result that it would 
be lost to Canada forever. While they may receive a tax credit for 
their donation, it is nevertheless a philanthropic act on their part 
because the money they receive is equivalent to about 50 per cent 
of the fair market value of the object.
<P>
	Donations ensure that we are able to maintain a record of artistic 
development in Canada and that artists receive the recognition and 
exposure in Canada they so richly deserve.
<P>
	In today's economic climate few collecting institutions have 
funds to purchase objects and we must therefore rely on donations. 
By offering incentives for donations to custodial institutions that 
have demonstrated they meet professional standards, the 
Government of Canada is able to provide assistance to ensure that 
their collections continue to reflect our country's heritage. This is 
something that is certainly valued by the government if not by the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	Responsibility for determining fair market value of cultural 
property has been transferred from Revenue Canada to the 
Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board. This happened 
in 1991. However this arm's length board was making decisions 
which could not at that time be appealed. The establishment of an 
appeal process of the determinations of the Canadian Cultural 
Property Export Review Board proposed in this bill will permit any 
donor of cultural property who disagrees with its decision the 
opportunity to pursue this ultimately with the Tax Court of Canada. 
What could be fairer?
<P>
	The amendments in this bill should be reviewed as a guarantee of 
the donor's right to natural justice through an appeal to the judicial 
system if that is warranted. These amendments should also be 
viewed as the reinstatement of the right of appeal that was lost in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14842"> 14842 </A></B>
<P>
1991  when the responsibility for determining fair market value 
was transferred to the review board.
<P>
	The announcement of these proposed amendments was 
applauded by members of the public who enjoy and who value our 
cultural history, by collectors, by custodial institutions and by 
members of the review board itself. We believe that the 
establishment of this appeal process will strengthen the incentive 
for individuals to collect and ultimately to donate cultural property 
to designated institutions or public authorities rather than to sell it 
on the international market.
<P>
	In recent months articles have appeared and comments have 
been made even in this House suggesting that tax avoidance 
schemes have extended to donations of cultural property.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret having to interrupt 
the member. Certainly she will have the opportunity to conclude 
her remarks when this bill comes back to the House for further

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 is 
deemed to have been moved.

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on April 26, 1994 I put a question on the Order Paper 
which the government still has not answered.
<P>
	I asked as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the $3.3 billion in 1994-95 and the $3.1 billion in 1995-96 the 
government will spend for grants to business, (a) what agency dispenses these 
grants, (b) what criteria does the government apply to determine which 
businesses receive grants and (c) how do these criteria differ from those used by 
the previous government?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I did not ask the government to provide me with a list of grants to 
businesses. Instead I merely asked the government to explain how 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14848"> 14848 </A></B>
<P>
it decides who will receive  these generous payouts of taxpayers' 
dollars, who does the paying out and how the Liberals' actions 
differ from practices followed by their predecessors.
<P>
	These are questions which Canadian taxpayers have every right 
to expect their government to tell them. What possible reason could 
there be for the government to take 17 months and still not supply 
an answer? Could it be that the government does not know what 
standards it applies in deciding what businesses (a) or (b) should be 
given a grant? Somehow that does not really seem likely. However 
if the government did know what standard it uses, why would the 
government not simply have answered my question?
<P>
	The conclusion most taxpayers will probably draw from the 
government's refusal to reply is that the standards it uses dare not 
be exposed to the light of day, that it would expect more trouble 
from supplying the answer than it could get from simply not 
answering.
<P>
	This conclusion will probably lead many people to assume that 
Liberal Party patronage is one very big criterion for receiving 
money from the current Liberal government, just as it has been so 
often charged that Conservative Party patronage was one very big 
criterion for receiving money under the Mulroney Tories. 
Liberal-Tory, same old story.
<P>
	I raise this question after listening to many discussions in the 
Standing Committee on Industry. Since that time I have moved 
over to the natural resource committee, serving as the the Reform 
forestry critic. I attended meetings with representatives of the 
forest industry all across Canada.
<P>
	A question I often asked these members of the forest industry 
was: What can we do to get the federal government out of the 
natural resource area which according to the Constitution should 
fall under provincial jurisdiction? One of the answers I often heard 
was to put an end to federal grants to the forest industry. The forest 
industry may apply for those grants but they apply only because 
their competitors do so. If one business in the field gets a federal 
grant and another business in the same field does not, it gives the 
first one an unfair competitive advantage over the other.
<P>
	Nobody is more competitive than a logger. I feel certain that the 
same is true of Canadian business and industry across this great 
country. Individual business owners want to be free of government. 
They want to be free of the red tape required to complete the 
application forms. However, if their competitor is applying for and 
likely getting a grant, then businesses needing to compete must do 
the same.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to emphasize that grants to businesses and 
industry must end. They must end for several reasons. They are a 
needless burden on the taxpayers at a time when government is 
struggling to find money for essential services like health care and  
education. They must end because they are like the apple in the 
Garden of Eden as a temptation to politicians to favour their old 
friends and their party supporters in a system of pork barrelling and 
patronage which is a disgrace to honour and integrity in 
government.
<P>
	Grants to businesses and industry must end because they 
subsidize those less able and least trustworthy to succeed at the 
expense of those most able and most worthy to succeed. In short, 
grants to businesses and industry are readily used to reward failure 
and to penalize success. Canadian businesses and industry deserve 
better.
<P>
	As I conclude my remarks I ask hon. members: When will I get 
an answer to the question I raised 17 months ago?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the hon. member. 
As he knows, having transferred his question for debate, he now 
will not get an answer except what I tell him tonight and I do not 
have an answer for him tonight. He can put his question on the 
Order Paper again, perhaps in a slightly modified form, and maybe 
he will get an answer in due course.
<P>
	I want to recall what happened. The question was put on the 
Order Paper on April 26, 1994. Officials in the Privy Council 
Office dispatched the usual inquiries to the appropriate government 
departments and were advised that four departments or four 
agencies of the government would be able to provide a satisfactory 
response to the question.
<P>
	When the response was received in July, after the House had 
adjourned for the summer, I had an opportunity to review the 
response. I take some personal responsibility for this. I concluded 
that the response was unsatisfactory because only four agencies 
had been canvassed when in fact the question was not specific as to 
which agencies might have dispensed the money. In fact it was a 
question directed to all government departments. Accordingly I 
asked that all government departments be contacted to ensure that a 
full answer was given to the hon. member, that the answer be 
accurate in all respects and to provide an answer in respect of all 
government grants to businesses.
<P>
	My request resulted in the answer being sent back to the 
appropriate government department. The government department 
in question has not produced an answer to date, despite many 
memorandums, despite many requests.
<P>
	I can only say that this particular department is one which in my 
experience, and that of other members of the House, is slow in 
responding to this kind of request from the House and from its 
committees. I am sorry that is the case, but there is nothing further I 
am able to do at this time except to assure the hon. member that if 
he puts  a question on the Order Paper along similar lines I will 
personally speak to the minister of the department and urge that 
speed follow in the preparation of the answer to his question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 
38, a motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.51 p.m.)
