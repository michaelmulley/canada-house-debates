	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I have 
two petitions to present to the House.
<P>
	The first is with regard to the Community Action Program for 
Children. It is signed by people right across Prince Edward Island. 
The petitioners ask the government to forgo the cuts that are being 
proposed to the program. Possibly there is good news in today's

	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the second 
petition is with regard to the national highway system. The 
petitioners are citing that 38 per cent of the national highway 
system has fallen below accepted standards and they are looking 
for a directed tax in order to build up our trans-Canada system.
<P>
	These petitioners are from right across Prince Edward Island, 
from the western end of Prince Edward Island to the riding of 
Egmont.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to present a petition pursuant to Standing 
Order 36 concerning our national highway system. I think this is 
the fourth such petition I have presented from residents of my  
constituency. The residents signing this petition come from the city 
of North Battleford, the town of Cochin, Unity, Gallivan, Wilkie, 
and Meota.
<P>
	The undersigned petitioners note that 38 per cent of the national 
highway system in Canada is substandard and that the national 
highway policy study identified a number of matters including job 
creation, economic development, national unity, saving lives and 
avoiding injuries, lower congestion, lower vehicle operating costs 
and better international competitiveness as benefits of the proposed 
national highway program.
<P>
	The petitioners urge the federal government to join the 
provincial governments to make the national highway system 
upgrading possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
petition from people in and around Edmonton, some of whom live 
in my riding of St. Albert.
<P>
	These petitioners draw to the attention of the House that 38 per 
cent of the national highway system is substandard, that Mexico 
and the United States are upgrading their national highway systems 
and that the national highway policy study identified job creation, 
economic development, national unity, saving lives, avoiding 
injuries, lower congestion, lower vehicle operating costs and better 
international competitiveness as benefits of the proposed national 
highway system.
<P>
	They have petitioned Parliament to urge the federal government 
to join with provincial governments to make the national highway 
system upgrading possible.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
petition from some scores of people in the Peterborough riding who 
are concerned about literacy and the taxation of reading materials. 
The petitioners urge all levels of government to demonstrate their 
support of education and literacy by eliminating sales tax on 
reading materials. They ask Parliament to zero rate books, 
magazines and newspapers under GST.
<P>
	As the provinces and Ottawa consider harmonizing their sales 
taxes, reading materials must be zero rated under provincial sales 
taxes as well as GST.

residents of British Columbia concerning the mandate review of 
Canada Post, co-ordinated by the Canadian Union of Postal 
Workers, Pacific region.
<P>
	The petitioners note that the Liberal government has ordered 
Canada Post Corporation to withdraw from the delivery of 
economy unaddressed ad mail, that this withdrawal reduces the 
options of companies that wish to advertise their products and 
services at an economical rate.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners wish to have economy ad mail 
delivered to their homes by Canada Post ad mail employees. They 
believe that Canada Post Corporation has been providing an 
excellent and reliable service  through the delivery of economy ad 
mail, which they wish to see continued.
<P>
	They call on the government to reverse its decision with respect 
to economy ad mail and allow Canada Post Corporation to continue 
to provide this economical and reliable service to citizens of 
Canada. I certainly concur with this petition.

China and notes that the export of CANDU reactors to China places 
the Government of Canada in an indefensible economic, political

<BLOCKQUOTE>December 3, 1996-The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food-Second 
reading and reference to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food of 
Bill C-72, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8235"> 8235 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-72, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be referred forthwith to the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
begin the debate on the motion referring Bill C-72 amendments to 
the Canadian Wheat Board to the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	Once again we have decided on this route in order that members 
who serve on the committee and interested groups may, if they 
wish, make submissions and the opportunity to speak in advance of 
the proposals that will improve the bill. Today I would like to 
outline in general the thrust of the legislation before this House 
which will modernize the operations of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	While no set of proposals could possibly satisfy all the sides in 
that it is all too often a sharply polarized debate among farmers 
with respect to grain marketing, the government's approach is 
aimed at meeting the responsible expectations of the majority of 
western grain producers. Our policy objective is to build upon the 
improved strengths of our existing marketing system while 
modernizing the governance structure of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, enhancing its accountability, improving its responsiveness 
to changing producer needs and opportunities, providing more 
flexibility and faster cashflows and minimizing future 
complications in international trade.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	Many of the changes we are proposing will empower farmers 
with a bigger and more direct say in how their marketing system 
works, consistent with the majority of recommendations put 
forward by the western grain marketing panel. Overall, the changes 
fall into three broad categories, governance and accountability 
being the first.
<P>
	The first relates to the governance and accountability of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. The overall governance of the wheat board 
will be placed in the hands of a board of directors consisting of 
between 11 and 15 members, the majority of whom will be farmers. 
To help make the transition to that new corporate structure a full set 
of interim directors will be appointed by the Government of 
Canada in 1997. Again the majority will be farmers. Then 
beginning in 1998 the producer majority among the directors will 
be replaced by directors elected by the farmers themselves.
<P>
	Bill C-72 is written in such a way as to enable all this to happen. 
This is consistent with the advice of the western grain marketing 
panel, that is, to structure our amendments in the form of enabling 
legislation.
<P>
	A number of farm groups appear to want the new law to be more 
precise in this area: specifying the date by which directors will be 
elected; confirming that the number of directors so elected will 
constitute a majority; and making this governance change 
irreversible, except of course by future amendments to the act.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture has no difficulty with these ideas. 
They are completely consistent with the policy principles 
announced last October. The existing draft of Bill C-72 will enable 
them to be implemented. If the arguments presented to the standing 
committee are clearly to the effect that farmers would be more 
comfortable with the new law being more precise and less flexible 
with respect to the election of producer directors, then the minister 
would be happy to entertain the appropriate amendments to bring 
that about.
<P>
	On the matter of accountability, Bill C-72 provides for a big 
change. For nearly 62 years the Canadian Wheat Board has been a 
crown corporation accountable only and solely to the Parliament of 
Canada. Under Bill C-72 it would evolve into a mixed enterprise. 
For the first time in history it would also become accountable to 
producers directly.
<P>
	The essence of the Canadian Wheat Board's accountability to 
farmers will lie in demonstrating its marketing success and 
effectiveness. If the Canadian Wheat Board's performance is not 
satisfactory, then its board of directors including a majority of 
elected farmers can implement operational changes or ultimately 
trigger a process to change its marketing jurisdiction.
<P>
	The essence of the Canadian Wheat Board's accountability to 
Parliament will lie in demonstrating its financial competence. This 
flows from the unique guarantee which Bill C-72 provides in 
relation to all of the Canadian Wheat Board's borrowing, not just 
initial payments, not just credit grain sales, but also all of its day to 
day financial transactions on the world's money markets. This 
amounts to billions of dollars annually backstopped by Canadian 
taxpayers if and when necessary.
<P>
	As an agent of Her Majesty accountable only to Parliament, the 
Canadian Wheat Board automatically had this type of broad 
guarantee. For this mixed enterprise it is not automatic. It has to be 
written into law as Bill C-72.
<P>
	The track record of the existing Canadian Wheat Board in 
relationship to its global financial transactions as a crown 
corporation is superlative. It enjoys a strong international credit 
rating. It has managed its day to day finances in a profitable 
manner gaining the benefit of the best possible interest rates and 
thus augmenting its pool returns to producers.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	Will these exceptionally high standards be maintained as it 
becomes a mixed enterprise under a different governance system 
and will the different accountability expectations be reached? We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8236"> 8236 </A></B>
<P>
fully expect so, but since Bill C-72 will provide the new Canadian 
Wheat Board with a unique legislated guarantee backed by 
taxpayers, it is not unreasonable for the new law also to include 
some safeguards to protect the taxpayers' position.
<P>
	That is what Bill C-72 seeks to accomplish: getting the balance 
right between accountability to producers and accountability to 
Parliament. It will be important to weigh the pros and cons of 
having fewer safeguards for the taxpayer against having a less 
comprehensive guarantee.
<P>
	It should also be noted that the Canadian Wheat Board has now 
and will continue to have decision making authority over matters 
which affect producers elsewhere in Canada outside its designated 
area, the authority to issue export permits for example. This is 
another reason why accountability to Parliament will continue to be 
important.
<P>
	The second group of changes relates to more flexible operations 
and improved cashflow. Under these changes the wheat board will 
be able to make cash purchases of wheat and barley; manage 
adjustment payments during any crop year on an expedited basis; 
terminate pool accounts at any time and pay out farmers' returns as 
rapidly as possible thereafter; issue negotiable producer 
certificates; fully utilize modern risk management tools in dealing 
both with farmers and with consumers; defray farmers' grain 
storage and/or carrying costs; allow open farm deliveries to condo 
grain storage facilities; and procure grain using new technology, 
such as on farm mobile elevators.
<P>
	These new flexibilities will help put more money from wheat 
board operations into the hands of farmers more quickly. To 
backstop cash purchases and to help the Canadian Wheat Board 
manage adjustment payments more quickly, the board will be 
allowed to establish contingency funds as a financial cushion.
<P>
	The third category of changes relates to the Canadian Wheat 
Board's mandate. The legislation does not alter the Canadian 
Wheat Board's existing mandate but we are putting more decision 
making authority into the hands of the farmers themselves. In 
future the wheat board's mandate may be adjusted conditionally 
upon three things: first, a clear recommendation to that effect by 
directors of the Canadian Wheat Board; second, if the quality 
control issue is improved, the concurrence of the Canadian Grain 
Commission that a change can be made safely without damaging 
Canada's reputation or quality and consistency; and third, if the 
proposed change is significant or fundamental, then an affirmative 
vote among farmers would need to be a prerequisite.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is a very effective marketer of 
Canadian grain. It has the support of the majority of western grain 
farmers. They want realistic and sensible Canadian Wheat Board 
changes but they do not want a scenario that would lead inevitably 
to the board's destruction.
<P>
	Now just how valuable in the overall scenario and scheme of 
things is the Canadian Wheat Board? It sells some $5 billion worth 
of grain per year at a marketing cost of a few pennies per bushel. It 
retains no profit margin; all the rest goes to the farmers.
<P>
	The board is one of Canada's most significant business 
enterprises. Doing business in more than 70 countries around the 
world, it is the fifth largest exporter and our biggest net earner of 
foreign exchange. It has earned for itself and for Canada a positive 
reputation in the eyes of the global customers, not so much on 
pricing issues-the board targets to extract price premiums-but 
on intrinsic quality, cleanliness, consistency, technological 
support, long term dependability, customer service and contract 
execution. The Canadian Wheat Board has been rated by its 
customers as number one in the world.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	These characteristics coupled with the size of the board, its 
global reach and its marketing clout result in Canada having 
roughly a 20 per cent share of the world market and realizing the 
best possible returns from those markets. The Government of 
Canada believes that it is worth preserving.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is much committed 
to the principles that have been announced and which are embodied 
in the legislation presented before the House. Nevertheless there 
are a number of mechanical ways by which these principles to 
which I have referred can be accomplished. The minister is open to 
input from members of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food as to how the legislation could be improved.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak today at second reading of Bill C-72, an act 
to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other Acts.
<P>
	Bill C-72, which is under debate this morning, is of little concern 
to the agricultural community in Quebec. While there are some 
wheat and barley growers there, their numbers are far fewer than in 
western Canada. However, because of the mission and role that 
have been given the Bloc Quebecois, it is our duty to express our 
opinion on the matter and more importantly to try to ground the 
current government's aspirations to control just about every field of 
activity in this immense country.
<P>
	Our intervention in the issue is all the more important because it 
permits an objective analysis of the situation that will lead to a 
better understanding between the government and the 130,000 
wheat producers and because, first and foremost, it allows us to 
fulfill the role we were given of protecting Quebec's interests.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8237"> 8237 </A></B>
<P>
	So long as Quebec continues to pay billions of dollars in taxes 
to the federal government, we will continue to demand equal 
services and, more importantly, equitable financial benefits for 
Quebec.
<P>
	This morning, the headlines in most of the francophone dailies 
read: ``The Minister of Finance in Ottawa again denies Quebec's 
claim for justice in the collection of the federal GST within 
Quebec''. Quebec will have a shortfall of nearly $2 billion. The 
Minister of Finance, a man of intelligence, said yesterday that 
Quebec is not losing any money in harmonizing the GST with its 
sales tax, whereas the maritimes would lose five tax percentage 
points.
<P>
	However, he must be aware nothing is created and nothing is lost 
in nature. The maritime provinces preferred to have a higher sales 
tax rather than personal income tax, which was not the case in 
Quebec, Ontario and Alberta, for example.
<P>
	However, this five per cent means we are paying the equivalent 
of $250 million to enable three maritime provinces to harmonize. A 
fine example of inequity. So, as long as Quebec continues to pay its 
$30 billion in income tax to the federal government, we will be 
around to demand justice.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	You know as well as I do how difficult it is for the Liberal 
government to grasp this rather simple concept of equality. This 
prompts me to add that the government should devote as much 
energy to developing a long term dairy strategy promoting the 
growth of the dairy industry, particularly in Quebec, since more 
than 47 per cent of all industrial milk in Canada is produced in 
Quebec.
<P>
	In this context, I must warn the government that we will not be 
satisfied with a policy statement based on little more than empty 
promises, as the Liberal government has a habit of doing. In our 
view, while representing a laudable effort to modernize the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the blueprint for changes to the 
commission is clearly insufficient in the present situation.
<P>
	Several wheat and barley producers called for a more flexible 
operational framework for the board, especially at the higher 
management level, and mainly for increased input from the 
producers themselves in the development of long term marketing 
strategies.
<P>
	Whether the hon. parliamentary secretary agrees or not, Bill 
C-72 addresses to some extent these long-standing demands of the 
producers, while at the same time not giving them the freedom and 
flexibility they want and need to achieve their production 
objectives.
<P>
	I was listening a moment ago to the parliamentary secretary who 
said over and over that a majority of western grain producers were 
happy with this bill. It is not normal for groups of western farm 
producers to hold referendum after referendum calling for changes 
to the Canadian Wheat Board. Granted, the Canadian Wheat Board 
has played and continue to play a major role in the sale and 
marketing of wheat and barley in western Canada. I am speaking 
honestly when I say that no one in this House can tell what would 
have happened to the economy and the farming industry in the 
three western provinces had it not been for the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>
	However, after 62 years, time has come to update this institution 
which, unfortunately, has strayed slightly from its goal. And when 
the government keeps making partisan appointments without-and 
that is a shame-looking at the primary qualifications of the 
commissioners, this goal is lost.
<P>
	I am saying it and I will say it again. The secretary of state might 
get annoyed and say: ``Sure, but the member for Frontenac sits in 
the opposition and knows full well he will never have to appoint a 
director to the Canadian Wheat Board''. This is true. However, in 
my riding, for example, one can see that, over the last three years, a 
number of appointments were made strictly because of services 
rendered to that party, because of the funding provided to that 
party, with little consideration being given to qualifications.
<P>
	This pattern is becoming the trademark of the Liberal Party and 
therefore of this Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	It is well known that the Liberals give with one hand and take 
away with the other. Instead of acceding to the producers' requests, 
the government is trying, through devious and illusory means, to 
maintain control over the CWB. The bill provides that the board's 
social structure and the directors' status will be changed by 
electing a board of directors that will include a number of people 
from the industry.
<P>
	However, given that this body will no longer be an agent of Her 
Majesty in right of Canada, producers should have priority as 
members of the board. Unfortunately, the government refuses to 
make a greater commitment to this issue. It refuses or at least fails 
to specify the number of farmers who will sit on a rather flexible 
new board of directors that will have anywhere from 11 to 15 
members.
<P>
	I am concerned about the Liberal Party's attitude, a party which 
has managed to appoint a fair number of its supporters to various 
government bodies since it came to office. Given its new structure, 
the Canadian Wheat Board will continue to leave the door wide 
open to this kind of partisan appointments, rather than give 
producers the place that is rightfully theirs in managing their 
interests.
<P>
	I will conclude by pointing out that the Canadian Wheat Board 
accounts for close to 23 per cent of world exports of wheat and 
barley, which reflects the importance of its role. This is very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8238"> 8238 </A></B>
<P>
significant. These exports are estimated at close to $5 billion, in 
current dollars.
<P>
	Since we will support the bill at second reading, we will make a 
few suggestions to improve Bill C-72 and if you accept them-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. member's time is 
up. The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster has the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are addressing the motion to refer Bill C-72 to 
committee. This is something that we have pressed the government 
to do, not because the legislation is good but simply because the 
public, particularly the farm community, needs to be exposed to 
this legislation so they realize how bad it really is.
<P>
	The minister has made absolutely no progress on reforming 
grain marketing under the Canadian Wheat Board, just like he has 
made no permanent progress to reduce transportation inefficiencies 
in the movement of prairie grain, and just like he has made no 
progress in correcting the wrong-headed approach to cost recovery.
<P>
	This is not because the minister is unaware of the issue. He is a 
Saskatchewan boy. He wandered around in the political wilderness 
of Saskatchewan for what seemed like 40 years as the leader of the 
provincial Liberal Party, after he was elected for a very short period 
to the House of Commons. The people of Saskatchewan very 
seldom vote for the Liberals but when they do, they boot them out 
sooner rather than later.
<P>
	There is a real possibility, if the Liberals call a spring election, 
that this bill will not receive final approval from Parliament. It is 
unforgivable that the government has delayed bringing forward 
reforms to the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	We are now in the second half of February and this bill is just 
being referred to committee. It needs to be dealt with by the 
committee, come back for third reading, go to the Senate and 
receive royal assent. On top of that, it is a very flawed bill and 
needs a lot of work.
<P>
	The probability of this bill passing at this point seems rather 
remote unless the government has a change of heart and is prepared 
to make significant changes to the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-72 is a clear message to the prairie grain industry that the 
minister wants to fail at market reform. If he does not want it to 
fail, then he thinks he can pull a fast one on the industry by trying 
to mask minimal changes to the board, particularly its governance, 
leaving himself securely as the commandant of the board.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-72 is badly drafted legislation that needs a series of major 
changes, and I stress major changes, to make it acceptable to the 
prairie industry and, more importantly, to individual farmers who 
are going to find out that this board is not the more accountable, 
more flexible Canadian Wheat Board that they were promised by 
the Liberal government.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to change the governance, to make the 
board of directors an elected one rather than appointed 
commissioners. It is supposed to make it a more responsive, more 
communicative and more open marketing institution but it does not 
accomplish this.
<P>
	We believe the government's proposed amendments to the board 
are weak, ineffective and a slap in the face to prairie producers. The 
government is telling them that they cannot manage their own 
marketing affairs, that in some way they are inferior to the 
producers of Ontario, Quebec and other commodities within 
Canada where producers are able to very effectively and capably 
manage their marketing affairs.
<P>
	It is a matter to be seen whether or not the Liberal government 
will allow the wholesale changes to Bill C-72 that are permitted 
under the rules where a bill is referred to committee prior to second 
reading. Based on our experience we have found that amendments 
have been few and far between, usually cosmetic in nature and not 
very substantive.
<P>
	Many farmers are beginning to believe that the minister of 
agriculture has manipulated the wheat board reform process. This 
has resulted in uncertainty, division and fear among western 
farmers. I have never seen an issue develop into such a divisive 
issue with the encouragement of the minister. At every opportunity 
he has poured gas on the fire rather than try to bring some positive, 
constructive and conciliatory measures forward to bring an end to 
some of the division and hard feelings that are mounting in the 
prairies over this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> No leadership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> The member from Peace River says that the 
minister has failed to show leadership and I certainly concur in that 
observation.
<P>
	First he delayed making any changes to reform the board for 
more than two years. That allowed the uncertainty and mistrust to 
fester. Next he created a political charade in the form of the western 
grain marketing panel. After it came out with a half decent report, 
he ignored it, particularly the most important compromises it 
suggested. Based on the results of secret polls the minister decided 
the only way he would win a vote on barley marketing was by 
basing it on an all or nothing type question: no flexibility, no 
middle ground.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8239"> 8239 </A></B>
<P>
	Now the minister thinks that by appointing a partially elected, 
part time board with minimal power that farmers demanding 
significant change will be satisfied. Then he will be able to wash 
his hands of the issue. The minister is certainly mistaken.
<P>
	Some of the more substantial problems with the bill include the 
fact that it strengthens the government's control over the board 
rather than passing that control and responsibility on to the 
producers who actually pay for the services of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. The board will only be partially elected. The bill states that 
one or more directors may be elected. We know that the minister 
will agree to changes to that clause in the bill simply to mask some 
of the other controls that he does not want to let go, such as the 
government will appoint the chairman and president or chief 
executive officer instead of those people being selected by the 
directors who are elected by the farmers.
<P>
	The government can dismiss a director at any time without 
cause. This is extremely unacceptable. This is the way tin pot 
dictators operate. I am ashamed that the minister of agriculture 
would bring in such an inferior piece of legislation. It shows no 
confidence in farmers to elect capable and competent directors to 
run the board.
<P>
	The new board of directors must follow any directions it receives 
from the federal government, even if the directors believe such 
orders are not in the best interests of farmers.
<P>
	The legislation allows the board to restore its authority over the 
feed grain market. This has been fairly controversial. Lorne Hehn, 
the chief commissioner of the board said it was a mistake, an error, 
and that it should be changed. However, the minister said no, it was 
not an error and that people misunderstood the bill. It certainly has 
the minister of agriculture for Alberta rather concerned. It is 
absolutely necessary to change this in the bill to make sure that we 
do not revert to 1973 marketing of prairie feed grains where barley 
could not even be moved across a provincial boundary without 
breaking the law. It is bad enough that our farmers cannot move 
their grain across international boundaries without breaking the 
law. If this bill is not corrected we may be breaking the law by 
moving our grain from Alberta to Saskatchewan or vice versa. This 
has to be changed.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	This bill reduces the possibility of future changes to the board's 
mandate. In order to make a significant change to the board's 
mandate farmers must go through an excessive approval process. 
First the board must recommend change. Then the Canadian Grain 
Commission must approve the change. Then there must be a 
producer vote held with a question determined by the minister. It 
sounds pretty rigged to me and it is certainly not showing any 
confidence of farmers to manage their own Canadian Wheat Board. 
Even after the vote, however, the minister would not be compelled 
to act on the results. Talk about arrogance and a lack of  confidence. 
I find this measure in the bill absolutely disgusting.
<P>
	No other political party has stated its position more clearly and 
more openly than Reform on matters related to the Canadian Wheat 
Board and the current barley plebiscite. Reform has repeatedly 
stated that we support and will work toward a reformed Canadian 
Wheat Board that is more accountable, more flexible and a board in 
which participation is voluntary. That is the debate that is out there 
among prairie producers and we know that is where support is 
growing. No matter what the minister does, eventually farmers will 
persist and will accomplish what they want.
<P>
	We believe that only constructive changes to the board today will 
ensure its survival and effectiveness into the future and we do not 
advocate destruction of the board; only our political opponents are 
making those claims on our behalf.
<P>
	In closing, the minister of agriculture has done more to damage 
the board, more to bring its usefulness into doubt in farmer's minds 
and more to hurt us internationally than anyone, all of us who have 
suggested that the board should be changed constructively to 
prepare producers to market in the 21st century.
<P>
	The minister is moving us backwards; we want to move forward. 
This is bill is unacceptable in its present form and must changed 
substantially. I call on members of the committee to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague in our party who spoke earlier very clearly indicated 
that the wheat board is one of the institutions in the agricultural 
enterprise that is working solely for farmers. It is sharing with the 
farm community all the benefits of single desk selling at a fraction 
of the cost of revenues that are earned by that institution.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has 
explained the main objectives of Bill C-72 and I would like to 
discuss how we arrived at this legislation.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board has been serving Canadian farmers 
efficiently and effectively for over 60 years. During that time it has 
helped our grain sector build an international reputation for quality 
and reliability and has realized the best possible returns from the 
market for Canadian farmers. And as my colleague indicated 
earlier, shipload and boatload after boatload, the consistency is 
there and it is well received by those who are doing business with 
us.
<P>
	The business environment is changing. We are doing business in 
an increasingly liberalized and competitive international 
marketplace. At the same time changing customer demands, 
reducing subsidization, new applications of biotechnology, 
booming markets for value added food products and a host of other 
changes mean that today's grain sector must be more innovative, 
more  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8240"> 8240 </A></B>
<P>
self-reliant and market responsive than it was historically in the 
past.
<P>
	In that context, the future of the Canadian Wheat Board has for 
several years been the subject of a sometimes very intense debate 
among farmers and other stakeholders in the grain sector, 
particularly in western Canada. As an aside I might indicate that in 
my riding of Brandon-Souris there have been court cases for 
those individuals who feel that they need to challenge the very 
authority of the Canadian Wheat Board Act and, for that matter, the 
whole method of marketing grain throughout the world.
<P>
	The purpose of these amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act is to respond to some of the chief concerns that have been 
raised during that debate and to ensure that the Canadian Wheat 
Board is well positioned to continue as a reliable, responsive, 
single desk seller of Canadian wheat in the years ahead.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	In preparing this legislation our goal has been to ensure that 
everyone on all sides of this tough issue has had a full and fair 
opportunity to have their say.
<P>
	In 1995 the minister established the Canadian Western Grain 
Marketing Panel to develop recommendations in consultation with 
all stakeholders in the grain industry. That panel did an excellent 
job in fulfilling its mandate and in providing a forum for producers 
and other stakeholders to discuss the future of the Canadian Wheat 
Board rationally, openly and transparently on the facts rather than 
on rhetoric.
<P>
	It was the most extensive consultation regarding western grain in 
modern history, one which involved a series of town hall meetings 
in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. It was in this forum that 
farmers and others gave their perspective on the current marketing 
system for western Canadian grain. Alternative arrangements were 
also brought forward.
<P>
	The panel also held 12 days of hearings in Winnipeg, Regina and 
Edmonton, during which it heard 69 briefs and an additional 78 
submissions from individuals and organizations who did not appear 
before the panel but made submissions for its information.
<P>
	Following the publication of the panel's report last July, the 
minister invited interested parties to forward written responses to 
those recommendations. After the panel submitted its report last 
summer the minister further distributed a summary of its 
recommendations to every farmer in western Canada and invited 
their feedback.
<P>
	All in all, from that process, 12,000 individuals and 
organizations responded. I am confident that the legislative 
changes we are putting forward today represent the views of the 
vast majority of western farmers and will address many of the key 
recommendations of the Western Grain Marketing Panel report.
<P>
	One way or another we are taking action on all points raised by 
the panel with regard to wheat board governance. One of the major 
recommendations of the panel in this area was that the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act be amended to provide for a change in 
governance of the Canadian Wheat Board and to provide for 
greater flexibility in its operations and in the services which it 
provides to farmers. In fact, of all the recommendations contained 
in the panel's report, this one received the strongest consensus of 
support among farmers.
<P>
	Under this legislation the overall governance of the board will be 
placed in the hands of a board of directors, most of whom will be 
farmers. To help ease the transition of the new corporate structure, 
an interim board of directors will be appointed by the government 
next year and the intention is that by the beginning of 1998 a 
majority of the directors will be elected by farmers.
<P>
	The election of directors will have some fundamental impacts on 
the operations of the board, mainly because the board will be no 
longer a crown corporation. As much as possible, however, we 
have tried to minimize those impacts.
<P>
	For example, as an agent of Her Majesty, the wheat board's 
borrowings are automatically guaranteed by the Government of 
Canada. To minimize changes, the Government of Canada will 
continue to guarantee the board's borrowings. In addition, the 
government will continue to guarantee initial payments and the 
Canadian Wheat Board's credit grain sales.
<P>
	Nevertheless, there are still implications of moving to an elected 
board of directors that need to be fully examined. That is why the 
legislation is permissive in this area. Farmers need to be aware of 
what they have now and compare it to what they will have with an 
elected rather than an appointed board so they can make an 
informed decision regarding their ultimate preference in this 
particular area.
<P>
	Another major group of amendments relates to more flexible 
board operations and improved cash flow. Under these 
amendments the board will be able to, first, make cash purchases of 
wheat and barley. Second, it will be able to manage adjustment 
payments during any crop year on an expedited basis. Third, it will 
be able to terminate pool accounts at any time and pay out farmers 
returns as soon as possible. Fourth, it will be able to issue 
negotiable producers certificates. Fifth, it will be able to defray 
farmers grain storage and/or carrying costs. Finally, it will be able 
to fully utilize modern risk management tools in dealing with both 
farmers and customers. In addition, to allow cash purchases and to 
help the board manage adjustment payments quickly, the wheat 
board will be allowed to establish a contingency fund.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8241"> 8241 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	It is important to note that these amendments do not constitute 
the Government of Canada's full response to the concerns of 
Canadian grain producers and the recommendations of the Western 
Grain Marketing Panel. We are also pursuing many other avenues 
to address other issues related to grain marketing and 
transportation. Last November our government introduced 
legislation to modernize the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Among other things, these amendments stipulate that while grain 
handlers and their employees will retain the right to strike and 
lock-out, in the vent of a work stoppage involving other parties in 
port related activities, services affecting grain shipments must be 
maintained.
<P>
	With the amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act and 
many other changes we are making with regard to grain 
transportation and marketing, the Government of Canada is 
demonstrating that it is listening to the concerns of grain producers. 
It is taking actions to address those concerns and to lay the 
foundation for continuing growth and prosperity in the grain sector 
and Canada's rural communities into the next century.
<P>
	I call on all members of the House to lend their support to this 
important legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to be able to rise today and speak to Bill C-72, an act to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. As you know, I represent an agricultural 
riding in Quebec, but it has no wheat or barley producers.
<P>
	To be frank, the area governed by the Canadian Wheat Board 
covers the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and 
British Columbia. However, as a member of the official opposition, 
to the great displeasure of our colleagues in the Reform Party and, 
naturally, of the member for Calgary Southwest, I must take part in 
the debate, as will my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois later on, 
concerning this bill of such importance for many producers.
<P>
	I know that we are here in this House to defend the interests of 
Quebecers. We are in this august place for the purpose of 
promoting sovereignty, but we must also use this forum to which 
we have access through our functions as members of the official 
opposition to speak to other nations. This also includes the nation 
of Canada. There is a lot of talk, with the Bloc Quebecois 
leadership race, about partnership between equals.
<P>
	It is very simple: with 52 members, we are the representatives of 
the nation of Quebec, whether the members for Saint-Maurice and 
Sherbrooke like it or not. In addition, I must add that, for as long as 
Quebec is paying taxes to the federal government, it will be our  
duty and our right to find out how this money is spent. I would add 
that we must claim our fair share.
<P>
	The bill before us was tabled following a clear and urgent 
recommendation for change by the panel of experts. The Liberal 
government stepped in in order to serve its own interests. Of 
course, it wants to see a democratic approach. It wants to give 
general responsibility for managing the Canadian Wheat Board to a 
board of directors.
<P>
	At first blush, the Bloc Quebecois can only be pleased with the 
government's proposal by which this board of directors would 
henceforth be composed of a majority of producers, instead of 
three to five commissioners appointed by the minister. This shows 
a wonderful spirit of democracy. Perhaps we will influence the 
Liberal members with our fine example of democracy. I refer to my 
party's leadership race, and if that is the case, fine.
<P>
	I am, however, still sceptical about the attitude and the real 
motives of the Liberal government, and here is why. According to 
the bill, future members of the board of directors will be elected by 
their peers or by the grain producers. The Liberal government, 
however, is taking care not to specify how many of these 
producer-elected members will be on the board.
<P>
	In the documentation on this bill, care is taken not to set out a 
number of elected farmer members. It is stipulated that the 
majority of the new board will be composed of elected farmers, but 
there is no indication of when this will happen. What is more 
certain is that we are proposing an interim board for 1997.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Obviously, never a day goes by on this Hill without talk of the 
possibility of a 1997 election. It is certain that we will be having 
byelections at least, in Jonquière and Calgary West. That I can 
announce, if we go by the established rules, but as for a general 
election, I will leave it up to the hon. member for Saint-Maurice to 
tell us when that will be held.
<P>
	I am making reference to a possible election so as to clearly 
situate ourselves in a pre-election context. You will understand 
that, when the Liberal government speaks, through its minister, of 
appointing an interim board in 1997, it would be a real temptation 
for them to make political appointments, what we call patronage 
appointments. This would not be the first time, and it is a pretty 
sure bet that it will not be the last, either.
<P>
	I always find it scary to see one or another minister making 
appointments. It is not very reassuring at all, frankly. It was not 
reassuring with the Canadian food inspection agency, so why 
things be any different a few weeks later? Now the minister 
confirms that a majority of members of the CWB board of directors 
will eventually be elected producers, which assumes that there 
could be some members selected by the minister. The minister 
would always be tempted to appoint friends, partisans of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8242"> 8242 </A></B>
<P>
regime, or financial backers. There is nothing new under the 
sun-a well-known, and unfortunately very true, saying.
<P>
	My party, the Bloc Quebecois, can only support the federal 
government's principle of finally giving grain producers a voice on 
the Canadian Wheat Board. One cannot help but be pleased to see 
such a change taking place. We know that the government is not 
doing this willingly. It is prepared to make changes, not as an 
unselfish gesture or out of a sudden desire for a more democratic 
approach but because it has been pressed to do so. By whom? By 
farmers who keep telling the government that the system is 
obsolete and does not meet their needs. Why do you think the panel 
recommended changes in the executive? Why would they want to 
switch from a board of three to five commissioners to a board of 
directors consisting of duly elected farmers? Because the latter will 
be in a better position to respond satisfactorily to their needs.
<P>
	It does not take a genius to realize this. It is plain common sense. 
Now, western farmers have some very specific complaints. 
Transborder farmers are demanding a double grain marketing 
system, in other words, to be able to choose between a free system 
or working through the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	It was high time the government decided to look into this. You 
will recall that not long ago, the hon. member for Wild Rose 
presented a motion demanding a two-year opting out right. This did 
not come out of the blue.
<P>
	I commented on this motion as follows: ``Producers could be 
granted more control over the board's operations, or the board 
could be given more room to manoeuvre''. It is true that a number 
of producers know there are some good business opportunities out 
there. I know why they want to market their grain without going 
through the Canadian Wheat Board. In the present situation, the 
board, through its sales on the American market, is taking 
advantage of rising prices.
<P>
	In any case, the board has been around for more than 60 years. 
Its job is to sell a quality product, to offer customers outstanding 
service and to maximize returns for western farmers. Here again, 
the system is not perfect. There is always room for improvement. 
Does this mean government will have to forego these opportunities 
for patronage in order to adopt a bill that provides for more flexible 
operations and improved cash flow? No, hon. members. I see the 
benefits, but I also see the opportunities for patronage.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	They will have to get people from the agricultural sector, people 
who know this area, and who better than farmers, grain farmers, as 
members of the board of directors of this Canadian Wheat Board?
<P>
	And then they will have to be elected. I think this is an excellent 
decision, but wait, let us see how this works. The government 
wants to make the rules. I do not think it will call on an outside firm 
as they do for the 6/49 draws or ask Mr. Kingsley, the chief 
electoral officer.
<P>
	That being said, in spite an apparent willingness to make 
changes, the federal government wants to maintain its control over 
the Canadian Wheat Board with this bill. How? You will not 
believe this. Did you notice that in subsection 3.6(2), our 
government reserves the right to remove all elected members of the 
board of directors, including the farmers?
<P>
	Earlier I mentioned how they could be elected, but I forgot to 
point out that the chairperson of the board is still appointed by none 
other than the minister. He is appointed by the Governor in Council 
on the minister's recommendation, so we might as well say he is 
appointed by the minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to 
join in the debate on Bill C-72 which is amendments to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act and consequential amendments to other 
acts.
<P>
	I was reading through the bill and was rather surprised when I 
read sections 3.93 and 3.94. Section 3.93 starts off with an 
innocuous statement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) The directors, officers and employees-shall</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Corporation; 
and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would 
exercise in comparable circumstances.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is good stuff. We would hope that these patronage 
appointments the government is going to put on this board would 
live up to that promise. However, when I read on, I find that while 
they may act with honesty and good faith and exercise good 
diligence, they are indemnified if they do not. Section 3.93(3)(a) 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) Directors, officers and employees are not liable for a breach of duty-if they 
rely in good faith on</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) financial statements of the Corporation represented to them by an officer of the 
Corporation or in a written report of the auditor of the Corporation as fairly 
reflecting the financial condition of the Corporation;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This tells me there is a problem with the financial statements. If 
they have the annual report of the Canadian Wheat Board for 
1994-95 which has been audited by Deloitte and Touche and seems 
to be a fairly reasonable audit report, and if we find that someone 
relies on that financial statement and that financial statement is 
wrong, they are now going to be absolved from liability. My rather 
devious mind asks the question: What is wrong with the financial 
statements if they are to be indemnified if they rely upon these 
financial statements?
<P>
	I read on in section 3.94:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8243"> 8243 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Corporation shall indemnify a present or former director, officer or employee of 
the Corporation-against all costs, charges and expenses, including an amount paid to 
settle an action or satisfy a judgment, that are reasonably incurred by them in respect of 
any civil, criminal or administrative action-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What are we talking about here? Are we going to indemnify 
these people against criminal action? That is what it states. Let me 
read it again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Corporation shall indemnify a present or former director, officer or 
employee-against all costs, charges and expenses-incurred by them in respect of 
any civil, criminal or administrative action-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What kind of stuff is this? First we have them indemnified 
against relying on audited financial statements. Then we find out 
we are indemnifying them against criminal action taken in the 
nature of their duties. These are pretty strong words.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Bear in mind also that the wheat board alone is protected in that 
it is excluded from the Access to Information Act. We cannot 
obtain information on the Canadian Wheat Board because by law it 
is protected. No one can use the Access to Information Act to get 
information from the board. To make matters worse, as far as I am 
aware the auditor general is denied the right to take a look at the 
Canadian Wheat Board and pass comment on it.
<P>
	Let us add all these things up. The auditor general cannot take a 
look at the wheat board. No Canadian can take a look at the wheat 
board because they are denied access through the Access to 
Information Act. And now its officers are being indemnified 
against criminal activity and there is some shadow of doubt being 
cast on its financial statements.
<P>
	When we add all that up what do we get? There seems to be some 
kind of conspiracy to cover up around here. There seems to be 
some doubt being cast on the integrity of this government and on 
the management of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	I would like the minister of agriculture to stand up in this House 
and tell us what is going on. I do not see any reason why we should 
pass legislation that creates a monopoly that is protected by 
legislation and is given the greatest secrecy imaginable and its 
officers are indemnified against criminal activity. Surely we, as all 
Canadians do, deserve real answers. Why are these two sections in 
this bill?
<P>
	I have not heard one word out of the minister of agriculture 
explaining why he feels he has to indemnify the employees of the 
wheat board who rely on financial statements that have been 
audited by an independent auditor. I do not know why he has to 
indemnify the employees of the wheat board if they are sued in a 
criminal action. Mr. Speaker, can you give me any  reason? Can 
anyone else give me a reason? I do not know.
<P>
	This is indicative of the way this government has been managing 
its affairs. We have seen it in the Somalia inquiry; it gets 
embarrassing and the government shuts it down. We have seen it in 
the Krever inquiry seeking information and it is stonewalled. We 
talk about the Pearson airport and now we go to court. There is the 
Airbus fiasco which the government has bungled from day one. It 
has cost the taxpayers millions of dollars and we found out the 
other day that the Minister of Justice spent $160,000 of taxpayers' 
money so he could sell us a bill of goods. It has got to stop.
<P>
	Criminal activity cannot be condoned under any circumstances 
whatsoever. To indemnify through legislation has to be the worst 
thing I have seen since coming here three and a half years ago. To 
put that in a bill on the wheat board which is protected against 
inquiry by the auditor general and against inquiry by any Canadian 
through access to information, is something even communist 
Russia would be proud of. That is what we are getting from this 
government today.
<P>
	We have had it before and we will have it again. Whitewash. Pull 
the wool over Canadians' eyes. Do not tell them what we are doing 
with their money. Do not tell them that perhaps, and I say perhaps, 
somebody is cooking the books in the financial statement and now 
when it may come out, the government wants people indemnified.
<P>
	The point is that questions are being raised. I do not have the 
answers but I am quite sure the minister of agriculture has the 
answers. It is his responsibility to stand up in the House and tell us 
what he is trying to cover up by these two sections. If he is covering 
up illegal activity and fraudulent statements we need to know about 
it. We need to know whose head is going to roll.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	Maybe it is the minister's head that should roll because this type 
of activity in a democratic country cannot be tolerated. I hope the 
minister comes in, stands up in the House and tells us what his 
intentions are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
are debating a motion to refer Bill C-72 to committee before 
second reading. I support that move because so much of this 
legislation needs to be debated and discussed before the bill is 
allowed to be passed.
<P>
	People have three main concerns regarding the Canadian Wheat 
Board. The first is the lack of accountability of the board. It has a 
security level equal to that of CSIS. The second is that farmers do 
not have control of the board yet it is their money entirely that 
funds the operations of the board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8244"> 8244 </A></B>
<P>
	The third issue is that the Wheat Board has a monopoly that was 
only given to it under the War Measures Act but which has not been 
removed. Farmers want a choice. They want to make it extremely 
clear so that no one can possibly say otherwise.
<P>
	Most western farmers and certainly most Reformers support 
keeping the Canadian Wheat Board as a marketing agency. That is 
not the issue here. We support that. We support giving farmers a 
choice. In a democratic country, it is almost unimaginable that they 
have not had that choice.
<P>
	I want to deal with these three issues. I know I will not have time 
to cover them adequately but I will give it a try. I will relate them to 
this legislation. By the time I finish it will be abundantly clear that 
scrutiny of the bill is necessary before second reading.
<P>
	First, the Canadian Wheat Board has a level of secrecy the same 
as CSIS, almost unimaginable. Yet it is not accountable. People 
have to ask themselves why that level of secrecy is in place.
<P>
	The auditor general, for example, does not have access to wheat 
board documents and to information from inside the board. 
Therefore, we cannot rely on an auditor general's report to deal 
with the operations of the board and to determine whether things 
are being done as they should be done. That is the level of secrecy.
<P>
	For example, the only way we found out that a commissioner 
who quits or is fired is entitled to a severance package of 
somewhere around $290,000 was through a leaked document. Yet 
as a grain farmer, as someone who pays for the board's operation, I 
was not entitled to know that. We do not know the salaries of 
commissioners. We do not know, certainly, the benefits package of 
commissioners.
<P>
	Farmers believe generally that the benefits package is totally 
beyond anything that is reasonable. As the people who are paying 
for these benefits, paying these salaries and paying this severance 
package, we have a right to know exactly the dollar amounts that 
are involved.
<P>
	Accountability is the first issue. Has this bill changed 
accountability?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, it is worse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Has it dealt with accountability? Yes, but it has 
made it worse as my colleague says.
<P>
	I refer to section 3.93(1) and read from the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The directors, officers and employees of the Corporation in exercising their 
powers and performing their duties shall:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) act honestly and in good faith-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It talks about what the officers should do. When we read section 
3.93(3), it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Directors, officers and employees are not liable for a breach of duty under 
subsection (1) or (2) if they rely in good faith on</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) financial statements of the Corporation represented to them by an officer of the 
Corporation or in a written report of the auditor of the Corporation as fairly 
reflecting the financial condition of the Corporation; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) a report of a lawyer, notary, accountant, engineer, appraiser or other person 
whose position or profession lends credibility to a statement made by that person.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	The bill says they should act honestly. Section 3.94 goes on to 
state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Corporation shall indemnify a present or former director, officer or employee 
of the Corporation or a person who acts or acted at the request of the Corporation-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It indemnifies former directors or officers or employees. We 
have to wonder why. I would like to ask the minister why this 
protection has been given to former officers and directors of the 
board. To my way of thinking the only reason is that there is 
something to hide. That subsection certainly cannot be left in the 
legislation.
<P>
	Because of time restraints I will go on to my second area of 
concern. Farmers do not have control over the board. They pay for 
the operations of the board but they have no control. Has this been 
changed? The answer is not necessarily. The legislation may not 
give farmers one bit more control over the board than they have 
now.
<P>
	I refer to section 3.6(1) which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On the recommendation of the Minister, the Governor in Council may, by order, 
designate one or more positions on the board to be filled through election by 
producers in accordance with this section and the regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does this mean necessarily that even one director will be 
elected? The answer is no. It is unbelievable. ``The minister may 
decide to have an elected director''. That is not what he has been 
telling farmers.
<P>
	The minister will probably change that because it certainly will 
not be tolerated. If that is slapped into place, the backlash from the 
farm community will be unimaginable. I think the minister can see 
that and the clause will be removed. However, that does not excuse 
him for this being in the legislation.
<P>
	It is one of two things. Either he has intentionally deceived 
farmers and the public when he said that there would be elected 
directors, or he is showing incompetence. This is sloppily drafted 
legislation and that is intolerable. Either one of those two 
possibilities are completely unacceptable and the minister has to 
answer to that. Are farmers given more control? Not necessarily.
<P>
	The third concern is the monopoly, the whole issue of giving 
farmers a choice. Farmers generally want the wheat board. But they 
also want to have the choice of marketing through a grain company 
or on their own. It is a choice that is given to anybody else in the 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8245"> 8245 </A></B>
<P>
	Will the bill give them that choice? Absolutely not. The 
monopoly power is maintained absolutely and that is 
unacceptable, especially when we look at how the monopoly was 
given to the wheat board in the first place.
<P>
	In the memoirs of Mitchell Sharp, a former Liberal member of 
Parliament and cabinet minister under the Trudeau government and 
a close colleague of the Prime Minister, he spoke about when he 
was a high level civil servant in the finance department during the 
war in 1943, when under the War Measures Act the Canadian 
Wheat Board was given its monopoly powers. What did Mitchell 
Sharp say about that? Every Liberal in the House should read what 
Mitchell Sharp said. He said that because we were in a situation of 
war it was reasonable to give the wheat board a monopoly to 
control the supply for wheat. He acknowledges that it drove prices 
down. That was the purpose, to drive prices down so the 
government could afford to help Canada and Britain in the war 
effort.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	What Mr. Sharp said was that he believed at the time, and he still 
believes, that it was absolutely wrong that this monopoly was kept 
in place after the war. He believes that it has cost farmers a pile of 
money.
<P>
	In particular, he acknowledged that the five year contract that 
was put in place after the war cost farmers hundreds of millions of 
dollars. That was only allowed because of the monopoly that was 
given to the board. The farmers have never been compensated for 
that.
<P>
	The books are closed. Secrecy is there. The board is 
unaccountable. The monopoly remains. It makes no sense. It has to 
be changed and it has to be changed soon. Farmers are absolutely 
sick and tired of this issue not being dealt with and we have to deal 
with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-72, the amendments to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act. This is an important bill. It is an 
important issue which I have been following for a long time.
<P>
	I have discussed this matter with many producers throughout 
Canada and, in particular, throughout Saskatchewan and the 
prairies. I attended meetings of the Western Grain Marketing Panel 
when they were held in the province. I attended the meetings in 
Kindersley and North Battleford. Little of what was talked about is 
reflected in Bill C-72.
<P>
	Bill C-72 is not being given the usual second reading in the 
House. Instead it is being introduced here for a short three hour 
debate and then sent directly to the agriculture committee for study. 
I definitely support the committee study but I oppose the process of 
fast tracking debate in the House in principle.
<P>
	This process of sending a bill to committee before second 
reading is a recent innovation in the legislative process. In some 
cases it works very well, but in other  cases it does not work well at 
all and I believe that is the case with Bill C-72. Bill C-72 is 
important to all Canadian farmers. Therefore, it is important to 
Canada.
<P>
	Second reading is traditionally a time when members of 
Parliament address the principle of recently drafted legislation. It is 
a time to examine in public debate the concepts on which the bill, 
as written, are based. It is a time when MPs who have discussed the 
legislation with their constituents can put those comments on the 
record and share them with other MPs in the hopes of influencing 
the clause by clause discussion which follows when the committee 
studies the bill.
<P>
	Not all MPs can speak during this shortened three hour debate. 
Not all MPs are members of the agriculture committee. Therefore 
not all MPs and, most importantly, not all of their constituents will 
have their voices heard on the principles contained in this 
legislation before third and final reading, when it is too late to 
make substantial changes to the bill. This process is simply fast 
tracking the legislation, despite the fact that perhaps there will be a 
shortened committee stage.
<P>
	The process of shortening debate at second reading was designed 
for highly technical bills and not for ones like the Canadian Wheat 
Board legislation which also has political and subjective economic 
content. I object to this process being used for Bill C-72. I believe 
the minister of agriculture is simply using it to avoid lengthy public 
debate on a bill which he knows is flawed and which he does not 
want to fix.
<P>
	I use as an example the fact that the day this legislation was 
introduced the minister said he was prepared to accept 
amendments. The next day the agriculture committee chairperson 
said: ``This bill will in fact be amended''. Today the parliamentary 
secretary, when introducing the debate, said that the minister would 
look at amendments to the bill. If the minister knew the bill was 
flawed and needed amendment he should have written it as such to 
begin with and not have introduced it the way it is today. He should 
have simply said: ``I am prepared to listen, talk to me''. If he knew 
it needed amending he should have done it originally.
<P>
	I also object to the timing of the debate. It falls in the middle of 
the voting process on the future of barley within the jurisdiction of 
the Canadian Wheat Board. I and others had asked that the bill be 
delayed until voting had concluded on the barley motion to ensure 
that both these matters got the full attention of the public which 
they deserve. I am sorry that the minister has chosen not to listen to 
this advice.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, so as not to seem entirely negative, I am 
pleased that the agriculture committee to which this legislation is 
being sent is talking about travelling outside of Ottawa to make 
itself accessible to farmers, farm groups and communities on this 
bill. I would argue that the success of the Canadian Wheat Board 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8246"> 8246 </A></B>
<P>
certainly depends on the legislation changing, as the views of the 
farmers and the farm communities are important.
<P>
	The committee, if it chooses to travel and if this House gives the 
approval of the committee to travel, would be doing the right thing 
in this regard. I can only hope that it has given everyone enough 
time to prepare adequately to respond to the challenge that is in 
front of all of us.
<P>
	This is an important bill and therefore I want to once again 
express my concern and disappointment that the minister chose not 
to seek the face to face advice of the farmer elected Canadian 
Wheat Board Advisory Committee in drafting the bill. The 
advisory committee, which is being replaced in this legislation, is 
made up of the farmers most knowledgeable about the operations 
of the Canadian Wheat Board and the affect those operations have 
at the farm gate.
<P>
	The minister should have involved the advisory committee 
immediately right from the beginning but he did not. Obviously the 
flaws in this bill are there because he chose not to consult and 
therefore it is obvious that we could be avoiding unnecessary 
debate, saving lots of time and money had the minister done this 
differently. The advisory committee's advice in designing and 
drafting this legislation should have been sought as a matter of 
course.
<P>
	Many in the House today are not farmers and certainly not 
farmers of grains under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. Therefore they may not realize that the economies of grain 
farming during the last 10 years have been stressful. Last year's 
crop and price were probably the best in that 10 year period which 
generally was characterized by low prices, low yields, low grades 
and lower and lower morale. Bankruptcies and quit claims were 
high, as were farm debts, suicides and on farm accidents.
<P>
	At the same, time huge changes in the international marketplace 
have been taking place, not the least of which have been the 
subsidy talks of the Uruguay round of GATT and the subsequent 
establishment of the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	Canada agreed with the United States and Europe to do away 
with a number of programs identified, I think incorrectly, as 
subsidies, and as a result Canadian farmers have lost their ad hoc 
emergency programs, the Crow benefit and certain supply 
management guarantees. I might add that Canadian governments 
under Mulroney and the present Prime Minister have done this 
without seeking similar moves by Europe and the United States, 
both of which are maintaining their GATT identified farm support 
programs.
<P>
	Into this volatile mix is thrown the Canadian Wheat Board, the 
agency that sells Canadian wheat and barley to the international 
marketplace. This agency which maintained sales and prices during 
the turbulent times of the last 10 years has been targeted by the 
United States as an unfair trading practice with support from a 
number of Canadians, many of whom are seeking ways to escape 
huge debts they have built trying to survive through the very tough 
times.
<P>
	This is a most vulnerable time in the history of the Canadian 
Wheat Board and this government should be doing everything in its 
power to support and sustain it from those outside attacks. This 
legislation and, I might add, the barley vote as well are only fueling 
the debate which has the possibility to weaken the board and 
therefore jeopardizes its future and therefore the future of farm 
income.
<P>
	If nothing else, the minister of agriculture should resist all 
pressures to make substantial systematic changes to the board. He 
should give the board his unconditional and unqualified support 
and ensure that on the operational side the board has the flexibility 
it needs to address the internal and domestic challenges it faces.
<P>
	Therefore in looking at Bill C-72 we have to look at the bill in 
that larger context. Perhaps the best thing the minister could do 
right now is to withdraw the bill because it weakens the position of 
the board and jeopardizes the future income of Canadian farmers 
across the prairies at a time prior to an election when we should 
discuss this during the election campaign.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He should resign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I hear comments from my colleagues that the 
minister should resign. I want to put it on record that I support that 
move. It sounds like a good move. The minister should resign but 
withdraw the bill before he does that.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	We certainly need a stronger, not a weaker, Canadian Wheat 
Board working for us. Anything less is an abdication of farmers 
interests to the corporate controls of the artificial international 
marketplace.
<P>
	In committee I hope we will look at the legislation in a lot more 
detail, so I will not be too specific today. However, there are a few 
matters I want to put on the record while there is still time. I note 
that in this shortened three hour debate members are allowed 10 
minutes whereas there would be longer speeches provided for in a 
debate at second reading. Many of us would have much more of an 
opportunity to express our detailed concerns about the bill.
<P>
	First and foremost is the question of governance. It seems very 
clear that farmers want more say in how the board is run. There are 
numerous ways to achieve this goal but the minister and the 
government have chosen in this legislation to create an elected 
board of directors with a government appointed chair and a 
government appointed chief executive officer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8247"> 8247 </A></B>
<P>
	Although the minister says that the vast majority of the board 
will be elected by producers, the legislation does not say how 
many members of that board will be elected. So we have some 
serious problems in dealing with a matter on which there appears 
to be a general consensus, more farmer control of the board's 
operation. Not only is there no guarantee that more than a couple 
of farmers will be elected to the board, but there is no guarantee 
that their influence will have any value. As long as the government 
appoints some members to that board and controls the 
appointments of the Chair and the CEO, the board will not be 
accountable to producers.
<P>
	As a representative of Saskatchewan, of New Democrats and of a 
lot of producers in Saskatchewan, I feel there has to be some 
assurance of the long term guarantee represented in the legislation. 
Most of us in Saskatchewan support amendments that make the 
board more flexible and more responsive to producers, but at the 
same time we want a better balance between responsibility to 
producers and fiscal responsibility to the federal government. That 
needs to be struck.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are probably a lot of people across Canada listening 
to the debate today via the parliamentary channel. They will be 
wondering what we are talking about. Why are the MPs from the 
west concerned? I am from Saskatchewan, some of my colleagues 
are from Alberta and Manitoba. We are concerned about 
agriculture and a very specific matter with the Canadian Wheat 
Board. That is what we are discussing today.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I rose to 
speak in the House. Is there not a rotation with respect to speakers?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary was not 
seen by the Chair. I am sorry for that. If I had seen her I certainly 
would have recognized her. She is quite right that it is a rotational 
system. Is the hon. member, being a perfect gentleman from the 
west, prepared to give his place up?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, would I still 
be able to speak? There has been a real absence of members from 
the government side to address this issue. We have had no 
response. This has not been a debate. It has simply been a raising of 
issues by the Reform Party and one NDP member with regard to 
this issue. If government members would have something to say we 
would be happy to hear it. We have not even heard the minister 
address this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think the hon. member is also indicating 
he would be happy to hear from the member and I take it the hon. 
member is in agreement that the parliamentary secretary speak 
before him?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> That is fine as long as I 
get to speak.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources, with thanks to the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a member of 
Parliament who represents the rural constituency of 
Dauphin-Swan River, as a grain farmer and as a strong supporter 
of the Canadian Wheat Board, I am more than pleased to speak on 
behalf of Bill C-72, the amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act.
<P>
	This legislation is the result of recommendations made last 
summer by the Western Grain Marketing Panel. The Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada commissioned the Western 
Grain Marketing Panel to hold extensive hearings and to come up 
with a set of recommendations to reform western grain marketing 
so the system can function more effectively.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	After an exhaustive consultation process involving countless 
letters, phone calls, faxes, E-mails, petitions, public and private 
meetings, demonstrations, parliamentary debates, surveys and the 
hard work of the panel, it is clear that most farmers do not hold 
extreme irreconcilable viewpoints.
<P>
	This was evident in the recommendations of the panel that, along 
with views of members of Parliament and provincial governments, 
helped the Government of Canada to decide on the contents of the 
bill we are debating today.
<P>
	I know there are differences of opinions among farmers and 
parties and that in the end one cannot make decisions that will 
please everyone.
<P>
	Indeed, given the historic fractiousness of the western grains 
industry and the deep divisions that exist between those farmers 
who hold the most extreme views on grain marketing, it is not 
possible to satisfy all sides.
<P>
	I believe most farmers want the board retained but with some 
degree of change. They want the board to be more contemporary in 
its structure. They want more accountability. They want a bigger 
say in how things are done. They want more responsiveness to 
changing producer needs and changing producer opportunities. 
They want more flexibility in board operations. They want a 
greater cash flow from their grain as quickly as possible. And, of 
course, they want to minimize their vulnerability to trade attacks or 
trade limitations imposed by other countries.
<P>
	On the other side of the equation, most farmers also value the 
proven strengths of the Canadian Wheat Board, its global reach, its 
market clout, the sheer size and skill to go head to head with the 
world's largest and most powerful grain traders and win, the ability 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8248"> 8248 </A></B>
<P>
to minimize the effects of the European and American trade 
distorting export subsidies, the board's world leading market 
intelligence and weather surveillance systems, and its sophisticated 
and comprehensive before market and after market customer 
services.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board currently serves more than 100,000 
prairie farmers as a single desk marketer for wheat and barley for 
export and domestic human consumption. Its annual sales revenues 
are close to $5 billion, making the board one of Canada's most 
significant business enterprises. It is the country's fifth largest 
exporter and Canada's biggest net earner of foreign exchange. It 
carries on business in more than 70 countries and has earned for 
itself and Canada a very positive reputation in the eyes of its global 
customers.
<P>
	However, we cannot rest easy about these achievements. There is 
a new world out there that requires regular change in business 
methods to cope with changes which this legislation addresses.
<P>
	The changes contained in this legislation fall into three broad 
categories. The first category includes changes related to the 
Canadian Wheat Board's structure, governance and accountability. 
The second includes changes related to more flexible wheat board 
operations and improvements in cash flow. The final category 
includes changes related to the Canadian Wheat Board's marketing 
mandate and the empowerment of farmers.
<P>
	I would like to discuss the second group of changes in greater 
detail. To backstop cash purchases and to help the wheat board 
manage adjustment payments quickly, the board will be allowed to 
establish contingency funds as a financial cushion. The Canadian 
Wheat Board is currently limited to purchasing grain from farmers 
in elevators or in rail cars at the initial payment and subsequently 
issuing those individual adjustments, interim and final payments.
<P>
	Under the amendments, the Canadian Wheat Board will be 
allowed to buy grain on a cash basis. This authority will provide the 
board with more flexibility in acquiring grain by allowing it to buy 
grain at prices that represent one time settlements with producers. 
When used to complement pooling operations, cash trading will 
tend to reduce delivery uncertainty and increase pool returns, for 
example by reducing demurrage costs, facilitating additional sales 
at attractive prices and by improving the overall efficiency of the 
Canadian Wheat Board's sales program. With this authority the 
Canadian Wheat Board will be able to bid on varying prices for 
grain, thereby securing supplies more effectively and improving 
the efficiency of its sales program and returns to farmers.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	The board will be able to manage adjustment payments during 
any crop year on an expedited basis by removing the need to first 
obtain cabinet approval.
<P>
	The federal government currently guarantees Canadian Wheat 
Board initial payments and adjustments to initial payments made 
during the crop year. The current requirement that all such 
payments be approved by cabinet hinders the speed with which the 
Canadian Wheat Board can adjust prices during the crop year.
<P>
	Providing for the board to operate in a more businesslike manner 
by adjusting payments to producers more quickly, the current 
system of government guarantees and approvals eventually will be 
amended to apply only to initial payment established at the start of 
each pool period. After a sufficient Canadian Wheat Board 
contingency fund has been established, the Canadian Wheat Board 
will be authorized to make all subsequent adjustments and issue 
related payments to farmers at its discretion.
<P>
	I should point out that in its 61-year history the board has never 
incurred a deficit on an adjusted initial payment on any of the farm 
pools. The few deficits that have occurred in the Canadian Wheat 
Board's history have all been relative to the initial price established 
prior to the start of the crop year.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board will thus be authorized to establish 
the appropriate contingency funds to guarantee adjustment 
payments to farmers and to back cash trading operations. Options 
for building up such funds include the board's profits on lending 
operations which totalled about $80 million last year and a check 
off on producer sales.
<P>
	These new flexibilities will help put more money from the 
Canadian Wheat Board operations into the hands of farmers more 
quickly. There are some additional changes designed to increase 
flexibility, most of them recommended by the western grain 
marketing panel.
<P>
	These amendments will enable the board to offer storage 
payments, interest payments or other delivery related payments on 
farm stored grain. This change is intended to encourage producers 
to sign delivery contracts early in the crop year and will also 
authorize the Canadian Wheat Board to pay bonuses for good 
delivery performance by farmers.
<P>
	Payment of carrying costs will reduce the need for the Canadian 
Wheat Board to draw grain evenly from across the prairies during 
the crop year and thus help in logistical planning. Greater logistical 
efficiency results in higher net returns for farmers.
<P>
	Under the proposed amendments, the board will be allowed to 
issue final payments well before January 1 which is not possible 
under the current act. The Canadian Wheat Board will be 
authorized by the legislation to close pools on short notice during 
the crop year and establish a second pool for the balance of the crop 
year.
<P>
	Transferable producer certificates will offer greater flexibility by 
allowing farmers to negotiate how and when to receive payment for 
grain delivered to the board. Specifically the board will be allowed 
to establish a program that would provide farmers with a mecha-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8249"> 8249 </A></B>
<P>
nism to trade their producer certificates at mutually agreeable 
terms.
<P>
	The development of condo storage facilities and the removal of 
delivery quotas on non-board grain crops have put out of date a 
provision that said deliveries of grain to an elevator facility must 
not exceed established quotas. Because it is necessary for the board 
to be involved in authorizing the flow of grain to condo facilities, 
this change will formalize open access by farmers to condo 
facilities.
<P>
	With the changes proposed in Bill C-72, the Canadian Wheat 
Board will be able to become an even more effective marketing 
agent for western Canadian grain farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am disappointed once again. I thought that by allowing 
the member to go ahead we might get the answers to some of the 
questions we have been raising but we never got any such thing. We 
just heard another one of those speeches written by the bureaucrats 
in the backrooms. The member never got down to discussing some 
of the concerns being raised by farmers in my constituency and as 
the member knows, by farmers in her constituency as well.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	I will outline what this debate is all about for the hundreds of 
thousands of people across the country who are wondering what we 
are talking about today. Most of the western MPs who are 
concerned about agriculture are debating the issue. The issue deals 
with the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	In agriculture the government has singled out the Canadian 
Wheat Board as a special area of concern. The government has 
been maintaining a lot more tighter control especially over the 
marketing of wheat and barley. It maintains this tight control 
through the Canadian Wheat Board. That is the essence of the 
debate we are having today.
<P>
	Most people in Canada may not realize why the debate is 
important to the people of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It 
is because they do not have the freedom to sell their grain, wheat 
and barley that the people in Ontario and Quebec have. They are 
being treated very differently. People need to understand the 
context of the debate.
<P>
	Who am I representing? Why am I standing up to speak about 
the issue? It is because many, many people in my riding have come 
to me. I am their representative. It is my duty to analyse legislation 
the government puts forth in a certain area and to critique what the 
government has done and to suggest changes.
<P>
	The biggest concern people have is the delay which is occurring 
in making some of the changes that will give farmers the tools they 
need to market effectively in today's world. Why is the delay a 
concern? The delay has been horrific. We are three and a half years 
into this government's mandate and it still has not made any 
changes. The people in my riding are very concerned about the 
weakness of a minister that would allow this kind of situation to 
develop.
<P>
	The hon. member for Dauphin-Swan River mentioned that the 
government must be sure it is making the right changes and that 
there are huge divisions developing within the farming community. 
Why have those divisions developed? It is because of inaction and 
the frustration farmers have experienced. The minister has created 
those divisions and he is continuing to widen them by the 
ineffective legislation he is introducing in the House.
<P>
	I do not know why the minister has not bothered to speak to this 
but farmers want an answer. They want to know why he continues 
to review the situation. In 1993-94, during the first year of this 
Parliament, we asked the minister to begin to make some of the 
changes. He gave us the standard answer: ``I am reviewing the 
situation''. He has been saying that for almost two years. Then he 
put a panel into place. Now he is going to study it even further.
<P>
	Every delay tactic possible has been used not to make changes 
that would give farmers more control over the marketing of their 
products. Farmers on both sides of the debate no matter what their 
perspective is are asking for the same thing. They are asking for 
more control over the Canadian Wheat Board. I did a survey in my 
riding and the vast majority, 90 per cent of the people who replied, 
want the board to be controlled by farmers. Not by the bureaucrats 
and not by the politicians in Ottawa; they are much too slow to 
respond.
<P>
	One of the biggest problems with the bill is that it reduces the 
possibility of future changes to the Canadian Wheat Board. It is 
entrenching and putting more power into the hands of the minister 
of agriculture rather than giving farmers more control over their 
own affairs. To the people across Canada who are listening, if you 
do not think this is an injustice, then what is? We need to have that 
and farmers are asking for it, no matter which side of the debate 
they are on with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board issue.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues have pointed out some sections which 
are of a huge concern. An example is section 3.94 where the 
corporation will pay the bill for any one of its directors or officers 
who may make a mistake. The farmers will still be liable to pay the 
bills.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	The wording of course is lawyer talk: ``The corporation shall 
indemnify a present or former director, officer, employee of the 
corporation or a person who acts or acted at the request of the 
corporation'' and it goes on to describe it. In other words, it 
removes  accountability on the part of the people who are transact-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8250"> 8250 </A></B>
<P>
ing business on behalf of the farmer. It removes their 
responsibility. Why is that a concern?
<P>
	We are all aware of what is happening on the west coast. 
Demurrage charges by the ships that are waiting in the harbours are 
being charged to farmers who have absolutely no control over the 
situation yet the farmers have to pay the bill. Now we have 
legislation which puts that into law with respect to the Canadian 
Wheat Board. It is absolutely wrong that farmers should have to 
pay the bills for things they have no control over. Why is the 
responsibility not put on those people who are causing the 
problem?
<P>
	Farmers are coming to me every day saying that their 
transportation costs have gone up astronomically, especially since 
the government removed the Crow rate without any warning. They 
have appealed to me asking if there is something I can do.
<P>
	The problem is that the people who are causing the problem are 
not accountable. They do not have to pay. It is entrenched in this 
legislation. It is a huge concern.
<P>
	The government says it is implementing the recommendations of 
the panel. Again it is simply cherry picking. It is only picking those 
minute things which it feels it can do without lessening its power.
<P>
	The essence of the problem farmers have is that they are battling 
big government. They are being held down. Their freedom is being 
limited by the minister and the bureaucrats in Ottawa. They are not 
being given more control over their own affairs. That is of real 
concern to them.
<P>
	I noted some of the words the government used in the 
introductory speech that would sound good to farmers. For 
example, it said that the Canadian Wheat Board will be evaluated 
on its marketing success and performance or on its financial 
competence. Is there anything in the bill that allows an arm's length 
third party such as the auditor general to evaluate the performance 
of the board? Farmers do not even know what is happening. They 
have a very difficult time deciding whether the board is doing a 
good job.
<P>
	The minister knows what is going on. No one can tell me that the 
minister does not know what farmers want. They want control over 
the Canadian Wheat Board. Why does it have to be controlled by 
the bureaucrats here in Ottawa? That question has not been 
answered.
<P>
	If the minister set out to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board, he 
could not have done a better job of destroying it than he is doing 
right now with this delay and the way he is handling the situation. 
People on both sides of the debate are telling me that the minister 
of agriculture is destroying the Canadian Wheat Board. Farmers 
are frustrated. They are very concerned about what is happening.
<P>
	If we are to have an effective marketing tool, we must begin to 
make some of the changes which Reformers have been asking for. 
This process does not facilitate that. Sending the bill to committee 
now is simply another delay tactic as far as I can see. I do not think 
the debate this morning will facilitate the changes which need to be 
made to the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake made a statement 
about committees being inaccessible to members and therefore 
many members will not be able to debate the bill when it is before 
the agriculture committee.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to correct the record and point out that every 
member in the House has entitlement to speak at any standing 
committee. There is absolutely no restriction. For the hon. member 
to make such a suggestion is fallacious to say the least. To my hon. 
friends across the way, when this bill goes to committee, these 
concerns can very definitely be aired.
<P>
	The bill makes changes to the Canadian Wheat Board. It gives 
farmers more power on the wheat board. The suggestion of my hon. 
friend from Yorkton-Melville about the demurrage charges when 
wheat is not getting through to load the ships right now is rather 
interesting. I wonder where he would like to lay those charges.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> On the railroads.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> On the railroads. I notice his leader made that 
statement in the press. I suspect the next move his leader will make 
is to call for the railroads to be taken over again by the government 
so those charges can be absorbed out of the public treasury. Is that 
what the hon. member wants?
<P>
	One of the wonderful things about the wheat board and the 
service that it provides to grain growers is that it allows them in 
times of difficulty to level out those costs. Right now when grain 
prices are relatively higher than they have been in a number of 
years-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> No, they are not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Yes, they are and the hon. member knows it if he 
watches the grain prices. The temptation and the desire is always 
there to want to escape from the wheat board and deal 
independently. When prices are low then that opinion shifts and 
some of those grain growers then want the protection of the wheat 
board again.
<P>
	They want a dual system where grain can be marketed 
independently or not. How in the world is the wheat board going to 
survive in that situation? In a year of higher prices there will be a 
shift 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8251"> 8251 </A></B>
<P>
away from the wheat board and all of those employees and all of 
that wonderful infrastructure that is set up to market wheat  sits 
idle. Then in a year when prices go down there will be a run back to 
the wheat board again and all of sudden it has to get back in gear.
<P>
	It is totally unacceptable to operate in that way in international 
markets. Either we go all the way in marketing grain outside of the 
wheat board or we keep the wheat board. Let me tell the hon. 
member that as long as there is a majority of farmers in Canada 
who want the wheat board maintained then the wheat board will be 
maintained. If there was a great movement away from the wheat 
board, if the majority of farmers did not want the wheat board, the 
government would not be forcing it down their throats.
<P>
	My hon. friends will have all sorts of time to debate this at the 
agriculture committee. They will be able to go there whether they 
are members of not and sit down and express their concerns. They 
will be listened to. I happen to sit on that committee and I will 
make sure that they are listened to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to take part in the debate today to discuss Bill C-72 which 
makes amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to move 
those discussions to committee.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	My son and I and our families operate a 1,500 acre grain farm in 
Alberta in part of the area designated to be under the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I have a lot of colleagues on this side of the House 
who are farmers as well and who have experienced firsthand the 
Canadian Wheat Board's operation. It always amuses me to hear 
speakers, like the hon. member from Ontario who spoke just before 
me, express their views on how great it is under the Canadian 
Wheat Board when they have not had any actual experience under 
the board. Ontario is exempt from being under the Canadian Wheat 
Board operations, and I know there is another member from 
Ontario ready to speak here.
<P>
	Between the members who are not under the board's operation 
and the lawyers from the other side who extol its great virtues, it 
seems they are being a little hypocritical. If it is so good, why does 
the Canadian Wheat Board not operate in Ontario and Quebec as 
well?
<P>
	Bill C-72 has been very badly drafted. It will enhance the control 
and the power of the minister of agriculture. That is exactly the 
opposite of what is wanted in the agricultural community currently 
under the Canadian Wheat Board. It is so bad that I think the 
minister should resign. It is not just for this reason. The minister 
has established a clear record in the past three and a half years since 
he has come to this Parliament and become the minister of 
agriculture. I will go through items and I suggest that he has failed 
on every account. He has made those on all sides of this issue angry 
at him for the way he has handled the amendments to the Canadian 
Wheat Board and the whole marketing debate throughout the 
prairies.
<P>
	Some historical background is necessary in order to talk about 
the Canadian Wheat Board with some knowledge. The Canadian 
Wheat Board was established in 1917 during the first world war as 
a war measures act. I can understand quite fully why that would be. 
In a war you want control over food supply. We had some 
commitments to Britain at the time and we wanted to have stable 
prices during wartime.
<P>
	After the first world war the Canadian Wheat Board was 
disbanded as it should have been. The grain trade operated in a free 
market economy until 1935 when the Canadian Wheat Board was 
re-established. It was brought back as a dual market with private 
grain trade. It operated in that way for eight years until the 
beginning of the second world war. At the height of the second 
world war, in 1943, the Liberal government decided that the 
Canadian Wheat Board should be brought back in a monopoly 
capacity. There again was the factor of war conditions.
<P>
	I support the move that was made at that time. We were 
supplying grain to Britain again. We were supplying grain to our 
allies. We wanted the price to be kept down in order to support the 
war effort.
<P>
	However, after the war other factors became involved. There 
were some five-year contracts. As one of my colleagues said 
earlier, Mitchell Sharp, who has been a minister in government, has 
been quite critical of the fact that the board continued as a single 
desk agency when it was not required after the war.
<P>
	That sets the context for the debate that has taken place in 
western Canada for the past several years. The debate is all about 
marketing choice. Some farmers want to pool their products, have 
the Canadian Wheat Board do their marketing for them and accept 
an average price. Farmers on the other side of the issue want to 
market their own grain. They think they can do better than the 
board is doing. They have their own special needs. It may be that 
they have a big farm payment to make at a certain time of the year 
and need cash flow when some of their neighbours may not need it.
<P>
	That is the debate that is taking place. It is a matter of whether 
we should have complete restrictive measures and marketing 
through the Canadian Wheat Board or whether there should be 
choice. I understand fully both sides of the issue. We live in a free 
democratic country and my belief is that farmers should be given 
the choice to either haul to the Canadian Wheat Board and accept 
an average price or to go on their own. I suggest that farmers will 
decide with their produce which system they like best. I think it 
should be left that way.
<P>
	This is the background to that issue. In the last three years, the 
Liberal government has taken away the subsidized Crow freight 
rate even though our competitors have not removed subsidies to the 
same extent that this government has. We have moved faster than 
all our international obligations suggest we need to. These days 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8252"> 8252 </A></B>
<P>
farmers are paying the full cost of freight. As such, they have had 
to scramble to try to find the best possible market prices in order to 
survive. Many of them are doing just that.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	However, I suggest that the minister of agriculture is tying one 
hand behind the back of those farmers who want to survive. He is 
suggesting that the farmers simply could not market their wheat 
and barley internationally. He is saying that it is not possible. I 
think he is actually suggesting that farmers are not smart enough to 
do that.
<P>
	Let us look at the facts. I farm myself. We market a number of 
products and my neighbours market a number of products already 
and there are companies out there that facilitate that. Canola is 
right up there in terms of dollar value with wheat as to which is the 
biggest export outside the country in dollar value per year. Canola 
is not marketed through the Canadian Wheat Board. Peas are not 
marketed through the Canadian Wheat Board. Farmers are 
marketing these products: fescue, clover, flax, rye, lentils. The list 
goes on. They are marketing beef. There has been a 40 per cent 
increase in the export of beef since the free trade agreement. The 
wheat board does not have to do that. There is no monopoly 
situation. It is a market economy.
<P>
	For those who want to market through the Canadian Wheat 
Board and accept a pooled average and not have to do their own 
research and marketing, I suggest they keep that method in place. 
However, for those who do not want to market through the wheat 
board but want to look for other alternatives, that should be a 
matter of choice.
<P>
	This brings us to the current round, 1993. Let us go through the 
list. Besides losing the Crow rate, the minister decided to increase 
pressure on the grain marketing debate and set up a grain marketing 
panel about a year and a half ago. This was a hand-picked Liberal 
panel. The chairman of the panel is a Liberal buddy of the minister 
of agriculture. I am sure the minister thought this guy would do 
what he wanted and come up with a favourable report. In fact, I 
think maybe that was the original plan.
<P>
	However, once farmers and farm groups started making 
presentations to the panel, the members of the panel had their eyes 
opened up. In fact, there was so much demand for the panel to 
travel to different parts of the country that it had to finally agree to 
go to Edmonton and Regina. It was just going to hold hearings in 
Winnipeg.
<P>
	In my riding, a group in the Grand Prairie-Peace River area said 
it did not make sense travelling to Winnipeg to make a presentation 
to the committee. Surely the  committee should be out listening to 
the farmers in their communities. Some kind of compromise was 
reached and the panel ended up going to Edmonton. The panel was 
not even anticipating that in the beginning. However, there was so 
much pressure from producers that is what happened.
<P>
	Members of the panel had their eyes opened up and, to their 
credit, they wrote a credible report suggesting that compromises be 
reached in certain areas and a consensus be reached in certain 
areas. They then made a series of recommendations. However, the 
minister of agriculture did not comply with those 
recommendations. In fact, he even refused to meet with the panel to 
discuss its recommendations. That is how contemptuous he was 
because the panel did not write the kind of report he wanted.
<P>
	Further to that, the panel had recommended that barley should be 
outside the Canadian Wheat Board. However, the minister could 
not accept that and decided to hold his own vote. He knew from an 
Angus Reid poll he had taken earlier that farmers wanted a choice 
in how they marketed their barley.
<P>
	He knew he could not ask the farmers whether they wanted a 
choice in how they marketed their barley because he would lose 
and that was not what he wanted. Therefore, he designed a question 
that was all or nothing: Do you want to deal with the Canadian 
Wheat Board on all sales of barley, malt or feed grain, or do you 
want to have the board not involved in any of that and deal with the 
entire free market?
<P>
	That is not the debate that is taking place out there and this 
ballot, when it is finally tallied and the minister gets the result he 
wants, simply will not end the debate because it has not addressed 
the real issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> A dishonest question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Absolutely. That brings us to the amendments to 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act that the minister has decided to 
bring in. What are the amendments? They give more control to the 
minister and the government, more control at a time when they are 
asking farmers to accept more risk. That is not tenable. If members 
look at this legislation they will see countless times that different 
matters ``have to have approval by the minister of agriculture and 
the Minister of Finance''.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Specifically, section 18(1) has been added to the act, requiring 
the directors of the new board to follow any directions given to 
them by the governor in council. It is apparent that the board has 
become merely a puppet board to be controlled by the minister of 
agriculture.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is absolutely essential that the agriculture 
committee travel to western Canada. It will fill its members' ears 
as should be because this is a badly drafted piece of legislation and 
does not reflect what farmers want. I encourage the committee to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8253"> 8253 </A></B>
<P>
take as much time as possible and travel where people live to 
discuss this as a very important issue to farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to address two issues that have not 
been fully discussed in this debate on Bill C-72.
<P>
	First I would like to put to rest, once and for all, an issue some 
have raised which really is a non-issue. I am referring to the notion 
that this proposed legislation either rescinds or intends to rescind 
the existing free interprovincial movement in the domestic feed 
grain market.
<P>
	Grain farmers in western Canada have been able to sell feed 
barley and feed wheat domestically in designated areas on a private 
basis outside the Canadian Wheat Board since the government 
passed an order in council way back in 1974. It is not being 
changed.
<P>
	This point has been made a number of times: in the policy 
announcement the minister of agriculture issued October 1996, in 
printed material circulated to all farmers in December, in 
comments the minister made in this House, in remarks he delivered 
at a meeting last month of Alberta's Wild Rose agricultural 
producers, and in a statement he made in Regina on January 21. 
Officials of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada also reiterated the 
point that the existing domestic feed grain market is not being 
changed.
<P>
	The minister said in a statement on January 21: ``Those who 
persist in raising this red herring are mistaken''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Do you even know what you are talking 
about?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Yes, I do. If you want to listen, you will understand. 
The argument appears to be based on the idea that by repealing 
paragraph 46(b) of the existing Canadian Wheat Board Act that we 
are repealing the legislative authority for the order in council which 
authorizes free interprovincial trade in feed grains in the designated 
areas. Consequently that order in council would be null and void. 
This is not true and I will try to explain now why.
<P>
	The order in council has nothing to do with that paragraph of the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act. It is not even mentioned. Several other 
provisions in the act are cited. It is as necessary, legislative 
authority, but not paragraph 46(b); therefore there is no substance 
to the suggestion that repealing this paragraph somehow undercuts 
the order in council.
<P>
	If members do not want to take my word for it they can look it up 
in the SOR/93-486 on pages 3872 and 3873 of the <I>Canada Gazette</I> 
Part II, Volume 127, Number 20.
<P>
	Even if the order in council did rely on paragraph 46, it would 
still be valid unless it were inconsistent with the new act as 
amended. Since this is not the case, the order in council is not in 
jeopardy.
<P>
	Again I quote the minister's own words: ``It is not now and has 
never been the intention of the Government of Canada to restrict 
trade in the domestic feed grain market which was liberalized in 
1974''.
<P>
	This simple point is adamantly clear from the very wording of 
the questions that are being asked in this winter producer vote 
about barley marketing. The continuing existence of the domestic 
feed market is written right into the words on the ballot.
<P>
	I hope this ends this discussion, but if it does not and if a 
reasonable doubt about this issue surfaces during the standing 
committee's detailed study on Bill C-72, the minister has already 
assured the sector that he would be happy to receive the 
committee's advice as to what its members believe should be done 
to make the point even clearer.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The other matter I would like to raise is the legislation 
introduced last November to amend the Canada Labour Code. 
Grain exports are very important to Canada in earning foreign 
exchange. These sales are of course dependent on our ability to 
deliver high quality grain consistently on time.
<P>
	Most of the time we have been able to do this but there have been 
several occasions when work stoppages at western ports have 
significantly curtailed grain exports. Since 1972, for instance, there 
have been 12 work stoppages that have adversely affected grain 
exports, although only on 3 of these occasions has the handling of 
grain been the cause of the stoppages. The other 9 involved 
longshore operations.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour last November introduced into this 
House legislation to modernize the Canadian Labour Code, 
including amendments to the industrial relations section to clarify 
the rights and the obligations of the parties during a work stoppage. 
The amendments benefit the agriculture and agri-food sector by 
promoting the continued movement of grain to market and 
reducing the cost of work stoppages to farmers.
<P>
	In all, Canadian ports engaged in longshoring and other ports 
activities as tugboats and mooring for instance would be required 
to continue providing services to grain vessels if they become 
involved in a work stoppage. Grain handlers and their employers 
retain the right to strike and lock-out. I am pleased that this 
legislation will help ensure that farmers can get their grain to the 
market in the event of work stoppages at Canadian ports.
<P>
	The agriculture and agri-food sector is one of the most 
significant sectors of the Canadian economy. If we continue to 
work co-operatively with this sector to improve the way that we 
operate, I am confident that this sector will generate more growth, 
more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8254"> 8254 </A></B>
<P>
wealth, more trade, more jobs and more innovation for all 
Canadians. There can be no doubt that we are living in an era of 
unprecedented change, change that is occurring at a faster rate than 
we have ever experienced before. That change is driven in part by a 
shrinking world brought about by new world trade regulations and 
new world trading opportunities.
<P>
	For 61 years the Canadian Wheat Board has been one of the 
cornerstones of our successes in the agricultural industry. With the 
changes that we have introduced to build on that success, providing 
the board with more modern governances and in its accountability 
to farmers and more flexibility and being responsive to that, 
farmers will be empowered with more to say in their marketing 
system, more power to take on the very real challenges and 
opportunities that lie before us.
<P>
	The amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act that we are 
currently debating and the changes to the Canadian Labour Code to 
improving grain handling in the western coast ports will help keep 
Canada on course into the next millennium.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this bill today.
<P>
	Unlike my very informed colleagues from Vegreville, from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, from Yorkton-Melville, from Peace 
River and from Lisgar-Marquette, I admit I do not have the 
expertise that they have when it comes to the operation of the wheat 
board and the history of the wheat board. But in reading over this 
bill there is one thing I can do: I can smell a rat. There is something 
that stinks in this bill and I want to talk about those two clauses.
<P>
	There is something that this minister is trying to cover up before 
it happens and that is section 3.93(3) where it talks about the 
directors, the officers and employees of the wheat board not liable 
for a breach of duty under subsection (1) or (2) with regard to the 
financial statements, with regard to the operation of the wheat 
board and with regard to lawyers reports, accountants reports, 
engineer appraisers reports, all sources that could show the wheat 
board up for what it is.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	What is the minister of agriculture afraid will come out? What 
does the Liberal minister of agriculture fear so much that he would 
take the time to put in a clause like this to protect the employees of 
the wheat board? What is coming down the pike? What does the 
minister of agriculture know that Canadians and Canadian farmers 
do not know? Is there something going on there? Is there 
mismanagement? Is there corruption? Is there criminal activity? 
One can only assume that could be a possibility  when looking at 
the clauses that have been put in here. What is the minister 
anticipating?
<P>
	Section 3.94 stinks like a barn as well: ``The Corporation shall 
indemnify a present or former director, officer or employee of the 
Corporation or person who acts or acted at the request of the 
Corporation, and their heirs''-they cover them all-``and legal 
representatives, against all costs, charges and expenses, including 
an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment''-sounds 
a little strange-``that are reasonably incurred by them in respect 
of any civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding to 
which they are a party by reason of being or having been a director, 
officer, employee or person'' employed by the wheat board.
<P>
	What is the minister expecting to come down the tube that would 
justify putting in a clause like this which gives such blanket 
protection to any director, officer or former employee of the wheat 
board? It mentions criminal or civil charges.
<P>
	One has to suspect that the people who are out there taking a 
good look at the Canadian Wheat Board operation may be getting 
close to something. Is that the case?
<P>
	We just heard the Liberal member talk about how good the wheat 
board is. If the wheat board is so good, if it is doing such a 
wonderful job for Canadian farmers I would like to ask a question 
of the member, but I cannot of course. Maybe I will get a reply 
some time. If the board is so good, why is the board not doing 
things like putting Ontario corn under the wheat board operation? 
Corn can be used for food or for feed, much the same as barley can. 
So why has the Canadian Wheat Board not brought corn into the 
operations of the wheat board? One wonders exactly what direction 
the board is taking.
<P>
	I want to stay on this blanket protection that the minister of 
agriculture in this bill is giving to all the directors, officers and 
employees who were ever associated with the wheat board. One 
only has to say that something stinks in this bill. Is it because the 
minister of agriculture fears that something will stink in the 
Canadian Wheat Board? Is that why he has tried to give it such 
immunity and protection in the bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> There is certainly an incentive to be dishonest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> As the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
just said, what a wonderful insurance policy for someone if there 
was an intention to commit some sort of criminal or other 
fraudulent act or gross mismanagement in an area of trust. It is 
great insurance to know that these things can be done and one 
would not be touched. I am surprised, given some of the things the 
Minister of Justice has put out in this House that the Minister of 
Justice has not come out with something like this for every crook in 
Canada. For  goodness sake, what an insurance policy to have. If I 
work for the Canadian Wheat Board I can do anything I want with 
complete immunity from any kind of prosecution, financial 
compensation or costs. Maybe we should tell the Minister of 
Justice about this. He could put it in the Criminal Code. He has put 
a lot of other dumb legislation in the Criminal Code.

<P>
	Let us be fair to Canadians. If we can give immunity to 
employees, directors and officers of the Canadian Wheat Board and 
give them that kind of protection should they wish to be involved in 
any kind of questionable opportunities, why not be fair, treat all 
Canadians equally and give it to everyone, including the crooks?
<P>
	As I said when I started my speech, something stinks in this bill. 
These two clauses are nothing more than an insurance policy to 
protect someone who may have some questionable activities in 
mind. On these two clauses alone the government should take this 
bill and stick it where the sun does not shine.

<BLOCKQUOTE>December 12, 1996-The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development-Second reading and reference to the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern  Development of Bill C-79, an act to permit certain 
modifications in the application of the Indian Act to bands that desire them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-79, an act to permit certain modifications in the application of the 
Indian Act to bands that desire them, be referred forthwith to the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my hon. colleagues for 
considering the motion to move this important piece of legislation 
to committee for study before second reading.
<P>
	From the outset this government has sought to form a new 
relationship with First Nations, a relationship founded on the 
cornerstone of self-government. We have made significant 
progress toward that goal and look forward to the day when the 
inherent right of aboriginal peoples to self-government is fully 
implemented throughout this country.
<P>
	While we are working to reach that goal we must also remove 
existing impediments to the social, economic and political 
development of First Nations. Some of the provisions of the Indian 
Act are such impediments.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	As self-government negotiations are completed and ratified, and 
we are currently involved in about 80 different self-government 
negotiations across the country, the Indian Act will have less and 
less application to First Nations and no application to First Nations 
which have concluded their self-government agreements. But 
self-government will not come overnight and until these 
negotiations are completed and all First Nations are again 
self-governing, the Indian Act will continue to be the governing 
legislation.
<P>
	For many years the Indian Act has occupied a unique place in the 
minds and lives of First Nations. It has been seen as both unwanted 
and necessary, as both offensive and protective, as both a prison 
and a shield.
<P>
	In its chapter on the Indian Act, the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples quotes Harold Cardinal, a Cree leader who 
eloquently sums up the ambivalent feelings that many First Nations 
have toward this act. Cardinal says: ``No society with even 
pretensions to being just can long tolerate such a piece of 
legislation, but we would rather continue to live in bondage under 
the inequitable Indian Act than surrender our sacred rights''.
<P>
	This has been a dilemma. Until now, to move away from the 
oppression of the act could also have meant moving out from under 
its protection and from its recognition that First Nations have a 
unique legal position in Canada which includes a special 
relationship with the federal government. Not surprisingly, there 
has been great reluctance to change the status quo, yet the status 
quo cannot and should not be sustained.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8256"> 8256 </A></B>
<P>
	This situation had to change. The approach had to be different. 
That is why we have introduced the Indian Act optional 
modification act. The bill takes a step away from the Indian Act 
but it does not distance First Nations from their rights under the 
act, nor does it distance the federal government from its 
responsibility to First Nations. But just so there will still be no 
room for confusion or misunderstanding, we have included a 
non-derogation clause in the bill to emphasize that the bill should 
not be interpreted to reduce protection of aboriginal and treaty 
rights given by section 35 of the Constitution, including the 
inherent right of self-government.
<P>
	We also recognize that not all First Nations will want to adopt 
the provisions of this new act. First Nations will want to study this 
legislation and understand its implications. That is why the entire 
bill is optional. Those who choose to opt in will be able to apply the 
provisions of this legislation to local governance and their day to 
day business. The current Indian Act will continue to apply to First 
Nations who choose not to opt in. It will also apply to all First 
Nations in areas where the proposed act is silent.
<P>
	Why are we providing this alternative to the Indian Act? Why 
are we proposing the first major initiative with respect to the Indian 
Act in 45 years? The answer is simple: fairness requires it; justice 
requires it; circumstances require it. We have no other choice.
<P>
	The Indian Act reflects an earlier time, a time when First Nations 
were treated as wards of the state. It was a time when 
non-aboriginal governments did not trust First Nations to manage 
their own affairs and to run their own lives. It was a time when big 
brother in Ottawa was given the authority to intrude and regulate 
the most minute aspects of the lives of First Nations. It comes from 
a time when aboriginal religious and cultural beliefs were 
suppressed and aboriginal demands for justice and land claim 
settlements were opposed.
<P>
	But today is a very different time. Does it make any sense in this 
day and age that I as minister should have the authority to operate 
farms on First Nation lands, purchase and distribute seeds and 
decide how to spend the profits? The Indian Act says that I can 
without the consent of First Nations and without any notice. The 
Indian Act also gives me the power to dispose of wild rice and dead 
or fallen timber on First Nations land without their permission. On 
the prairies, First Nations farmers cannot even legally sell their 
wheat or other agricultural produce without my consent.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	This is absolutely ridiculous and should not be tolerated. This is 
not the way to engender self-sufficiency. This is not the way to 
foster a spirit of economic independence. This is not the way to 
conduct relations with First Nations in this country.
<P>
	The simple fact is that an option is necessary. It is necessary to 
get the government out of the areas that should be within the 
exclusive domain of First Nations. It is necessary to remove 
barriers so First Nations can create their own opportunities and 
build their own futures. It is long overdue.
<P>
	No government should make these sorts of changes to a specific 
group in society without consulting them and without offering 
them every opportunity for input. That is why we have consulted 
widely and why we propose to consult even more broadly through 
the committee study. That is why we are making this legislation 
optional.
<P>
	There is nothing radical in what we propose. The optional 
modifications are minor but taken collectively they would increase 
the power of First Nations while reducing the powers of both the 
minister and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.
<P>
	The approach is incremental, to act where there is a base of 
support and consult where there is not. That is the best way to 
proceed and that is the way we are going. First Nations and 
governments agree that discussion and dialogue must continue for 
that very reason.
<P>
	It is appropriate that this bill should be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development 
before second reading. This referral to committee is important 
because it allows us to remain open to further changes to Bill C-79. 
If we were to go the normal parliamentary route and refer the bill to 
committee after second reading, there would be a perception of 
greater limits on the extent of amendments that could be made at 
committee. It is important not to leave that impression.
<P>
	We believe there is a need for open public discussion. We want 
the committee to have the freedom to conduct the broadest possible 
consultation and to have maximum flexibility in its handling of 
these proposals. By sending this bill to committee now, there will 
be an opportunity to hold in depth hearings and to consider further 
additions to and deletions from the bill.
<P>
	It is time for this House to consider the establishment of a more 
formal mechanism, an annual review of the Indian Act by the 
standing committee through which First Nations may bring 
forward their concerns about particular aspects of the act. In the 
meantime the government will continue to focus its energies on 
implementing the inherent right of aboriginal self-government, 
settling land claims and improving socioeconomic conditions.
<P>
	The Indian Act optional modification act will give more power 
to First Nations which will make it easier to get things done. It 
represents not a destination but a means to take us there.
<P>
	I have had this job for three years. I thought that the trail of tears 
aboriginal people have travelled down for  hundreds of years was 
just that, a trail. It is not a trail. On the way back they thought it was 
a trail but it is a wall. I see aboriginal leaders across this country 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8257"> 8257 </A></B>
<P>
almost taking spikes in their hands and driving into that wall to get 
over it. We have to destroy that wall. I do not care if the UN has 
said for three years in a row that Canada is the best country to live 
in. Until we have destroyed that wall, until we can bring aboriginal 
people back to where they were at the time of the first encounter, 
we do not deserve that title. This is one way to a better and more 
equitable future that we can all be proud of as Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
say right off that the minister's plan of action is somewhat 
incoherent. I will elaborate a little later.
<P>
	To announce today that this bill is going to amend the Indian Act, 
which the government has been saying it wants to get rid of for the 
past three years now, and to say that consultations were very broad, 
when 550 of 600 native communities in Canada are opposed, is a 
bit misleading.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I would say first off that the Bloc Quebecois will oppose this bill 
and the fast track approach. Things are not being speeded up to give 
the committee a better opportunity to introduce amendments, but to 
have the bill passed quickly.
<P>
	I also find it odd that the bill is before the House on the very day 
the budget is being presented. There is a whole circus underway 
outside the House, and everyone is focussing on the budget and not 
on this bill. I think the minister has created a smoke screen. There 
is a historical context. Before we know where we are going, we 
have to establish where we are. We have to set out the background.
<P>
	Before the Europeans came to North America, as the great 
capitals of the 14th and 15th centuries, like London and Paris, 
gained international stature, they had no idea that there was another 
continent with a native population spread across its entirety. There 
was no problem, because the two continents perhaps had no 
knowledge of each other.
<P>
	The problems began at the moment of contact. I am talking about 
the period that goes from the 16th century to the 19th century. 
Curiosity and mutual mistrust are normal when two civilizations 
first meet. Neither knows what the other wants and what the others 
are up to. There is a period of adjustment. Gifts are exchanges, 
items are traded-a bit like today's diplomacy. That is the way it 
was at the time.
<P>
	These relations evolved. Eventually, relations were established 
between the First Nations and the Europeans in a wide range of 
areas, including not only trade but also military co-operation and 
coalitions. This marked the beginning of the whole treaty era.
<P>
	Of course, on one side there were the Europeans, vested with the 
authority of their king and equipped with their seals to stamp on the 
treaties they signed, while the aboriginal peoples, on the other side, 
had a totally different philosophy.
<P>
	In fact, I have a few lines to read you because references are 
often made to the wampum and I think it is important to explain 
what it is. The aboriginal peoples' philosophy is clearly explained. 
Their equivalent to the royal seal was a wampum exchange.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A white wampum background symbolizes the purity of the agreement. Two rows 
of purple beads represent the spirits of our respective ancestors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
They had respect not only for their own ancestors, but also for the 
ancestors of those they were dealing with.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Between these two rows are three wampum beads symbolizing peace, friendship 
and respect. The two rows represent parallel paths, two boats moving side by side on 
the same river. One is a birch bark canoe, representing the aboriginal people, with 
their laws, customs and traditions, and the other is a ship, representing the white 
people, with their laws, customs and traditions. We travel together, but in our own 
boats. Neither shall try to steer the other's boat.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was the aboriginal peoples' philosophy, a far cry from that 
of the Europeans who were thinking in terms of <I>terra nullius</I>, land 
waiting to be conquered. The treaties were signed in good faith by 
the aboriginal people. They may not have stamped a royal seal on 
them, because the custom in those days was to exchange wampum.
<P>
	Then there was the royal proclamation, and, again, the 
paternalistic tone the minister uses was very prevalent at the time.
<P>
	Let me read you an excerpt of the royal proclamation: ``And 
since it is fair, reasonable and essential to our interests-the 
crown's interests-and to the safety of our colonies-the crown's 
colonies-that the various nations of savages-as they were called 
back then-with whom we have some contact and who live under 
our protection, be neither disturbed nor bothered regarding the 
ownership of such parts of our domains or territories that were 
neither bequeathed to us, nor bought by us, these areas are reserved 
for their use as hunting grounds-'' and so on.
<P>
	This gives an idea of the tone. What is important however, is 
that, at the time, native people felt this was from nation to nation. 
They considered that the king was dealing on those terms, even 
though the tone was definitely paternalistic.
<P>
	It is in regard to the issue of protection that the federal 
government resorted to subtleties and developed its scheme to 
assimilate native people.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8258"> 8258 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	In the 19th century, the quasi-equality began to erode. The 
famous immigration policy was in effect, and boats full of people 
kept arriving on the continent. By 1812, there were ten times more 
new immigrants than natives, because the latter had been 
decimated by various diseases.
<P>
	The fur trade was also suffering badly. So, the colonies, the 
Dominion, no longer needed the manpower provided by native 
people for the fur trade. Things began to change. The economy's 
new sectors were the forest, wood, agriculture and mining 
industries.
<P>
	Then the natives started to be perceived as people who should be 
removed. With the new economy, native people became an obstacle 
to the federal government, and I dare say that, given the measures 
that are being taken and the paternalistic attitudes of this 
government-they are almost hereditary in government-things 
have not changed much. The idea that Europeans were superior 
continued to develop.
<P>
	The minister is telling us that he will ram through these 
amendments to the Indian Act. Why is he doing that, if not because 
he has some authority and is making full use of it in deciding the 
future of Canada's native people? There are some 500,000 native 
people in Canada. The minister is saying: ``I have the authority. I 
know you are against this measure, but I will do what is good for 
you''. Things have not changed much since the early days of the 
colonies.
<P>
	At the time, the subtlety was in using the famous protection of 
the royal proclamation, which, for the government, for the 
Dominion, became a domination-assimilation process. And then 
the machinery of assimilation kicked in.
<P>
	In 1849, government, democratic institutions, did something 
terrible: they created residential schools. The government began 
taking children from native bands and putting them in residential 
schools in order to stamp out their culture and their language, so 
that they could be assimilated with immigrants, who were ten times 
more numerous. White people outnumbered native people ten to 
one at the time.
<P>
	In 1867, a date we keep hearing in all the praise coming from the 
Liberal party and from all the federalist parties, the Constitution of 
Canada was signed by the Fathers of Confederation, but no natives 
were present. In fact, the then newly elected Prime Minister said he 
wanted to do away with the band system and completely assimilate 
Indians into the Dominion.
<P>
	So now we can see a little better why the government at the time 
felt it had to stamp out the native system of government. It was at 
this point that the Indian Act, which is completely consistent with 
Confederation, was introduced in order to regulate all aspects of 
native people's lives. Not only were children placed in residential 
schools but, as well, native peoples were told: ``Your governments 
will no longer operate like that. You will elect them in the manner 
we tell you. We will drive you from your lands sometimes and, if 
there is no game in one location, we will send you somewhere else. 
We will decide''. In addition, if there were important minerals in a 
particular location, the government said: ``There is no longer any 
game in this location, so we are going to send you elsewhere'', 
using that excuse to move them so they could make money.
<P>
	Things went on this way. These displacements were considered 
to be ``in the national interest'' at the time.
<P>
	In 1969, the present Prime Minister, then Minister of Indian 
Affairs, presented his white paper. It was the same thing all over 
again: the machinery of assimilation continued forward. He said 
the Indian Act would have to be abolished. We are hearing the same 
thing from the minister today. This was the equality they were 
talking about. Once again, native peoples rose up.
<P>
	Finally, the native peoples took charge of their destiny. There 
was an international movement and, relying on the legal aspect, 
natives began to say: ``There are people elsewhere on the planet 
who are victims just like us''. Finally, the Supreme Court and the 
superior courts in each of the provinces kept handing down 
decisions in favour of native peoples, with the result that, in 1982, 
the government had to add to the Canadian Constitution section 35, 
which protects their ancestral rights.
<P>
	This is the tradition in which the minister follows. He has not 
kept the promises in the red book. Furthermore, David 
Nahwegahbow and Russell Diabo, who wrote the book themselves, 
said: ``They broke their promises, so we are withdrawing''.
<P>
	There were phoney consultations, as I have said. In addition, 550 
aboriginal communities want nothing to do with this bill, but the 
minister is forging ahead anyway, confronting the opposition 
parties, the official opposition and the Reform Party, and flying in 
the face of the philosophy contained in the Erasmus-Dussault 
report.
<P>
	History will judge the minister. It is not too late for him to do 
something. If he withdraws his bill, perhaps history will remember 
him as someone progressive, but if he goes ahead, he will be seen 
as part of the machinery of assimilation like all the others.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased again to speak to Bill C-79.
<P>
	I attended the news conference when the minister introduced this 
legislation. I was not impressed then and I now have had the chance 
to study the bill and I am still not impressed.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the minister's concluding remarks. He 
talked about the need to destroy the wall. Yes, there probably is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8259"> 8259 </A></B>
<P>
wall there called the Indian Act. The only way it will be destroyed 
is to repeal the Indian Act.
<P>
	However, I do not think that is a good analogy. I think this is a 
pit. It is a pit that we have put the aboriginal people into and they 
cannot get out. Now we are providing another pit, we are giving 
them a choice between two pits by introducing Bill C-79.
<P>
	After the minister spoke at the news conference, Assembly of 
First Nations Chief Ovid Mercredi spoke on behalf of 500 Indian 
bands which oppose this legislation. He said ``we do not like Indian 
act No. 1, why should we like Indian act No. 2?''. He was referring 
to this. He referred to the Indian Act as a cage. He said ``why 
should we be happy because the government says `look at the new 
cage we made for you?'''
<P>
	The minister of Indian affairs promised to amend the Indian Act. 
Bill C-79 is not an amendment to the Indian Act. It is an act that 
allows Indian bands to opt out of the current Indian Act and into a 
new one.
<P>
	Specifically, Bill C-79 removes the need for ministerial approval 
for the sale of agricultural products and certain artefacts. It is not 
clear whether they can also bypass the Canadian Wheat Board, 
which we were debating earlier this morning. The question should 
be answered as to whether they would have to comply with the 
regulations of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Additional bylaw making powers are conferred on band 
councils. Fines levied for violation of the Indian Act, the 
regulations or band bylaws are increased to $5,000 and are payable 
directly to band councils. None of this revenue needs to be 
accounted for nor does it have any effect on the amount of tax 
dollars flowing into the community. Again, we need an answer. We 
need to know why this is so.
<P>
	Bill C-79 allows bands to create a voluntary ticketing scheme in 
order to expedite law enforcement.
<P>
	Also by virtue of Bill C-79 the minister, rather than the governor 
in council, is given the opportunity to set aside elections. The term 
of office for a chief and council is extended from two to three 
years. This will not make many of the native people I know who are 
living under anti-democratic band councils very happy.
<P>
	The minister is authorized to enter into agreements with band 
councils for educational purposes. It seems this is already 
happening. Is the minister simply putting into legislation what is 
already happening today, legitimizing it?
<P>
	The minister's authority for road construction and repair is 
removed in Bill C-79. However, the bill does not say who will be 
responsible and liable for public safety on these roads and bridges 
under band control. There are a lot of unanswered questions.
<P>
	Bands are now given the authority to manage natural resources 
on band held land. However, the revenue flowing from these 
resources is once again unaccounted for. Nor will this revenue 
reduce the amount of grants and contributions flowing from the 
federal government. The fundamental relationship between crown 
and aboriginal peoples is not changed.
<P>
	Bill C-79 includes a non-derogation clause. Aboriginal treaty 
rights remain protected under section 35 of the Constitution. 
Nothing in Bill C-79 affects taxation, Indian registration, band 
membership or the protection of reserve lands. Bill C-79 is like its 
cousin, Bill C-75.
<P>
	First Nations land management which was introduced December 
10, 1996 creates two categories of bands with special status for 
those who opt into Bill C-79.
<P>
	Bill C-79 does not meet our party's litmus test for equality, 
financial accountability or democratic accountability at the band 
level. Those are the three tests we measure legislation with.
<P>
	Bill C-79 is the first bill introduced by the minister that is not an 
initiative of the previous Tory administration. Bill C-79 does not 
fulfil the minister's promise to amend the Indian Act. Bill C-79 
stands on its own. It is not an amendment to the present Indian Act.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-79 was rushed to fulfil a promise and respond to the royal 
commission on aboriginal peoples. Review by justice officials is 
suspect because changes were being made until the evening before 
it was tabled.
<P>
	The Assembly of First Nations claims that only 100 of the 600 
First Nations support Bill C-79. Bill C-79 does not bring 
democratic equality, and raises serious concerns with powers 
granted to chiefs and councillors.
<P>
	Bill C-79 does not bring financial accountability and reduces the 
minister's scrutiny. The auditor general is still excluded from 
auditing band books, just like he is excluded from scrutinizing the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Bill C-79 will probably be constitutionally challenged as a 
consequence of this opting in provision. It will create a 
bureaucratic nightmare and a field day for lawyers and consultants. 
That is a major concern of ours.
<P>
	Like Bill C-75, it lets the minister off the hook and allows him to 
wash his hands rather than take on those elements of the Indian Act 
that warrant amendments and/or repeal.
<P>
	Canadians, both native and non-native, were looking for 
leadership and vision. They got neither. Why is the minister afraid 
of giving equality a try? Here are some of the crucial steps we need 
to take toward equality. When I talk about equality, it does not 
mean assimilation.
<P>
	The Indian Act must be repealed and replaced with legislation 
that will move us closer to true equality. Maybe we should call it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8260"> 8260 </A></B>
<P>
the equality for Indians act. We need to agree on a definition of 
self-government, something that has not happened.
<P>
	The majority of Canadians, including grassroots Indian people, 
will support aboriginal self-government as long as the federal 
government's relationship with Indian reserves is similar to the 
relationship between provinces and municipalities. Most of 
Canada's aboriginal people-there are about 500,000 of 
them-already live in municipalities under provincial jurisdiction. 
The federal government retains responsibility for about 350,000 
treaty Indians currently living on reserves or crown land across 
Canada.
<P>
	Treaty Indians deserve the same rights and freedoms and should 
share the same duties and responsibilities enjoyed by the tens of 
millions of municipal residents across the entire country.
<P>
	For self-government to work, Canadian law, including the 
charter of rights and freedoms, must apply equally to aboriginal 
people and Indian governments. We cannot have two systems.
<P>
	Local Indian governments will never be truly democratic nor 
financially accountable until and unless a normal local government 
to taxpayer relationship is established. The federal government 
must make treaty entitlements payable in part directly to individual 
treaty Indians living on reserves. The local band administration 
could then establish a local tax system to pay for local services. 
Government payments for welfare and housing could easily be 
transferred in this manner. All treaty entitlements and benefits 
should be considered a taxable benefit in accordance with the 
Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Every treaty Indian should pay income taxes, excise taxes and 
the GST, just like every other Canadian. Every treaty Indian 
entitled to compensation benefits or services promised by a treaty 
should have the choice of receiving those entitlements directly 
from the federal government or through local Indian governments 
and should be able to exercise this option at any time.
<P>
	Both the federal government and the Indians should fully honour 
the commitments they made to each other in the treaties. Land 
claim settlements should be negotiated publicly. They should 
outline specific terms. They should be final. They should conclude 
within a specific timeframe and they should be affordable to 
Canada and the provinces. All reserve or settlement lands should 
remain part of a sovereign Canada.
<P>
	There should be public discourse on the value and extent of all 
land claims. That should be the first step in addressing Indian land 
claims. For the equality alternative to work, every treaty Indian 
entitled to land under the formula articulated in each treaty should 
have the choice of taking personal possession of the property or 
having the land held in common and administered by the local 
Indian government.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Any treaty Indian who wishes to permanently move off the 
reserve should have the option to negotiate with the government a 
personal compensation package to help with the transition to a new 
job and a new life living off the reserve. The compensation should 
constitute a fair exchange for treaty entitlements.
<P>
	Bill C-79 creates two classes of natives. It will make the equality 
and accountability issues worse, not better. Like Bill C-75, it will 
become a bureaucratic and constitutional nightmare, further 
dividing natives and non-natives, creating a money pit for lawyers 
and consultants. The best thing we could do is to let Bill C-79 die 
on the Order Paper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is an 
ancient Oriental proverb that most of us know by heart: the journey 
of a thousand miles begins with the first step.
<P>
	Three and a half years ago the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development took the first step, the second step and the 
third step and moved into an area that had not been tackled with a 
view to making great progress, as he has in the last three and a half 
years. The minister must be commended for his vision, 
determination, hard work and the level of consultation that he has 
had over these years with every Indian band in Canada.
<P>
	It is a privilege for me to speak to the motion on Bill C-79, which 
is designed to refer the bill to committee for further input, 
consultation and possibly for further amendment. The bill 
addresses concerns too long ignored and inefficiencies too long 
endured. It presents First Nations with an option. If they want they 
can remove themselves from certain parts of the Indian Act or they 
can choose to continue under its provisions.
<P>
	The design of the bill is to reduce the powers of the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development and put more authority 
for the day to day management of their affairs into the hands of the 
First Nations.
<P>
	Some have suggested that the government has not adequately 
consulted before introducing this legislation. Those people would 
like to see more delay, more paper shuffling, more hand wringing, 
with a view to living with the status quo. That may be good enough 
for some members, but it is not good enough for the First Nations. 
It is not good enough for the minister. It is not good enough for the 
government.
<P>
	The truth is that the Government of Canada has been trying to 
improve the Indian Act not just for one year, two years or three 
years. It has been trying to fix it for 50 years. Minor tinkering 
began almost immediately after the Indian Act was passed in 1876. 
Since then there have been a number of attempts to make the act 
more relevant, more just and more responsive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8261"> 8261 </A></B>
<P>
	The first major series of amendments came in 1951, following 
a report by a joint committee of the House and the Senate. These 
amendments were far reaching, but they still did not change the 
fundamentally paternalistic nature of the original act. While the 
minister's powers were reduced, they still remained extensive and 
intrusive.
<P>
	Efforts were made again in 1960 with a commentary on the 
Indian Act prepared for a joint committee. This report was not 
taken up and the act remained unchanged.
<P>
	In 1969 extensive consultations took place examining the whole 
relationship between the government and the First Nations. In their 
submission the United Interior Tribes of British Columbia said 
something which everyone then and everyone now knows to be 
true. ``The Indian Act is definitely not the answer to the problems 
of the Indians of today''. That was in 1969. Just as the Indian Act 
was failing First Nations then, it continues to do so today.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	The Indian Act was revisited in 1970 when the Alberta chiefs 
released their citizens plus report. That report recommended 
amending but not abolishing the Indian Act. No amendments were 
made and the status quo continued.
<P>
	In 1982 the House established a parliamentary task force on 
Indian self-government. This task force included, as ex officio or 
liaison members, representatives from the National Aboriginal 
Association as well as the Native Women's Association. It tabled 
its report, commonly known as the Penner report, in November 
1983.
<P>
	If implemented, that report would have fundamentally altered 
the relationship between First Nations and the federal government. 
The Indian Act would have become largely irrelevant, but again 
there were few results to show for the effort and the Indian Act 
remained in place.
<P>
	Further consultations were held with chiefs across the country 
and the government did produce legislation in 1984. Unfortunately 
First Nations opposed that bill and the legislation died after second 
reading.
<P>
	The government of the day introduced another bill, C-31, the 
very next year. That legislation dealt with several specific 
provisions of the Indian Act which discriminated on the basis of 
gender and made the application of the act much more equitable. 
That legislation passed but the underlying problems of the act 
remained unchanged.
<P>
	In 1986, the auditor general conducted the first comprehensive 
audit of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. That report focused on lands, revenues and trusts, 
areas governed by the Indian Act. As a result of the auditor 
general's report, the department undertook an extensive review of 
these areas, culminating in the government's introduction of Bill  
C-115. The amendments proposed by that bill grew out of 
recommendations by the Kamloops band in British Columbia.
<P>
	These recommendations had been studied by the government 
and band councils and were then referred to all chiefs, provinces 
and MPs for comment. From April to December 1986, further 
consultations were held with bands, organizations, provinces and 
federal officials. These amendments, known as the Kamloops 
amendments, were finally passed into law in 1988.
<P>
	It was also in 1988 that Bill C-122 was introduced. This 
legislation was aimed at a very narrow issue with respect to the 
Indian Act emerging from a report of the standing joint committee 
on regulations. That bill did not proceed beyond first reading.
<P>
	Further modifications were made to the Indian Act in 1988 
through Bill C-123, which dealt with the provision of support for 
minors and Bill C-150 which cleared up a technical error which 
was discovered in 1985 Indian Act.
<P>
	We come to the present time. I have gone into some detail with 
respect to the past efforts to alter the Indian Act because it is 
important to put the Indian Act optional modification into 
perspective. The legislation before the House has its genesis in 
many years of frustration, many years of study. Government after 
government has revisited this issue. Government after government 
has consulted, debated, reviewed and considered. The Indian Act 
has become one of the most studied pieces of legislation in our 
history. However, all of that study has produced few results.
<P>
	We find ourselves in 1997 with an act that has remained largely 
unchanged since 1951. We find ourselves with an act that First 
Nations understandably find demeaning. We find ourselves with an 
act that treats First Nations as wards of the state and which gives 
the minister authority to intervene and intrude in the lives of First 
Nations' communities.
<P>
	The time has come to provide an alternative, to begin to step 
away from the paternalism of the Indian Act. Before introducing 
this legislation we conducted our own consultations with First 
Nations and I will briefly review that process.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The minister first raised the idea at the Alberta chiefs summit in 
March 1995. The next month he wrote to every chief, councillor 
and leader of First Nations organizations asking for their views and 
suggestions about changing the act, the one step at a time along that 
journey as described in the Chinese proverb.
<P>
	Based on numerous discussions with First Nations and the input 
he received, in September 1995 a package of proposed-

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8262"> 8262 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to hold up the progress 
of the House.
<P>
	In conclusion, the minister has carried this vision along this 
journey and these amendments which are very important will go to 
committee, will be discussed and if necessary will be amended. We 
hope that the minister's dream will be realized.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
wondering about the timing of this bill, but I hear my colleague for 
Halton-Peel referring in his conclusion to the fact that the 
minister has finished his journey.
<P>
	Yet this bill, Bill C-79, merely amends the act of which we all 
are ashamed, the Indian Act. This act infantilizes aboriginal 
people, makes them into incapable minors. It imposes upon them a 
government system which, to all intents and purposes, has been 
such that some of them have lost their own system of government, 
or are unable to make use of it. With this bill, the native peoples 
have been more or less forced, in a roundabout way, to accept that.
<P>
	What I find the most shocking in this bill is the nastiness of its 
nature. It holds out a few little goodies and forces band councils 
who want them to accept the principle of this hated act, an act 
which is, in their eyes, a symbol of subserviency.
<P>
	This bill is shocking for other reasons as well. It is also shocking 
because no one among those who addressed the aboriginal 
question, as a commission or otherwise, has thought that not only 
the solution, but the beginning of the path toward a solution, lay 
with amendments to the Indian Act.
<P>
	Yet the red book, with its generosity, its understanding, its 
compassion, with all the illusions that it held out, never made any 
reference to even minor amendments to the Indian Act. Now we 
find the minister wanting to be able, on the eve of an election, to 
say: ``Mission accomplished''. There is one thing you can be 
certain of: he will not be able to count on us to help him be able to 
say that.
<P>
	The native people of Canada-if I may use that term-have a lot 
of grievances. I have long had an interest in these matters. I was a 
minister in the Lévesque government when René Lévesque gave 
official recognition in the National Assembly to the ten Indian and 
Inuit nations. This arose out of a process begun in 1983 when 
representatives of the aboriginal groups were brought together and 
certain proposals were advanced. Not all were judged to be enough, 
but this did mark the beginning of a process of change.
<P>
	Obviously, as on the one hand the Indian Act was supreme, and 
on the other a process of transformation was initiated, beginning on 
the federal level with the Penner commission and later with the 
Erasmus-Dussault  commission, the native people of Quebec chose 
to respond: ``Very nice of you to offer, but we will continue to call 
for recognition on the federal level of the rights we feel we are 
entitled to''. In Quebec it was felt this was a valid option.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	But what has happened since then? Not long ago we had the 
Erasmus-Dussault report which is far removed, I would say light 
years removed, from Bill C-79. We hear nothing about this report. 
We do not know where it has been shelved, and what we see now is 
this pitiful excuse for a bill which hardly deserves to be called even 
an attempt to deal with aboriginal issues.
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Quebec, the Parti Quebecois, which later formed 
the government, worked hard on preparing proposals for aboriginal 
people, proposals that were made to the various groups, to the 
leaders of aboriginal communities. What we have managed to do is 
create an opportunity for change that would get rid of the Indian 
Act once and for all and let each community, moving at its own 
pace, take over the management of its resources, develop its 
economy and become aware of the need to protect the environment 
beyond the limits of its territory, and I am sure aboriginal people in 
Quebec are starting to understand.
<P>
	They are starting to realize that it will be in their best interests to 
negotiate with the government of a Quebec that is sovereign, 
because if they wait for Canada to deliver on its futuristic promises, 
they will never get anywhere.
<P>
	Even today, and this is not something to brag about because 
much remains to be done about improving the circumstances of 
aboriginal people, but anyone who is aware of these issues knows 
perfectly well that aboriginal people are much better off in Quebec 
than anywhere else, whether we are talking about knowledge and 
retention of mother tongue, demographics, education or the 
poverty rate.
<P>
	We also had the James Bay agreement signed by Robert 
Bourassa which remains a model of its kind. In spite of the 
unhappy events in Oka, which I will not discuss here, there is no 
comparison between the relationship between Quebecers and 
aboriginal people, although coloured by a past which both sides 
have to live with, and what we see elsewhere.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that this government, instead of making real 
progress on aboriginal issues, and we can draw a parallel here with 
the national question, preferred to take the easy way out, an easy 
way I would call pernicious because it will force aboriginal 
communities to go along with the fundamental principles of the 
Indian Act if they want to take advantage of certain changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8263"> 8263 </A></B>
<P>
	I may add that it is rather unusual that this bill is optional. It 
will be up to the band and the band council to decide, and once 
they decide to go along with the new legislation, they cannot go 
back.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Now this can cause major divisions, and here again, the 
settlement process will remain in the hands of those who 
administer the Indian Act. Instead of improving, the situation has 
become even more complex and the future does not look very 
promising.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in the debate on sending the Indian Act optional 
modification act to committee before second reading. The minister 
has already outlined the contents of this legislation. He has referred 
to the government's overall objective to reduce federal control over 
the lives of First Nations people.
<P>
	This legislation does not replace or amend the Indian Act. 
Rather, it provides an option to parts of it. First Nations can decide 
for themselves whether to opt for its provisions or to remain under 
the terms of the Indian Act.
<P>
	Eventually the Indian Act will no longer be needed. It is 
outdated. It is paternalistic. It is cumbersome and costly. It gives 
the minister powers that he does not need. I anticipate that by the 
time the last nail is driven into the coffin of the Indian Act, very 
few First Nations will still be affected by it. That is because this 
government has set in progress a pattern of building 
self-government from the ground up. So this legislation must be 
seen within a larger context of the government's efforts to promote 
the inherent right of self-government of aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	Over the long history of the relationship between governments 
and aboriginal peoples we have seen an ebb and flow of 
self-government. It is not a happy history. It demonstrates a 
fundamental lack of understanding on the part of past governments. 
They did not appreciate the sophistication of aboriginal cultures 
and forms of government. The history of legislation concerning 
First Nations demonstrates a degree of arrogance and paternalism 
that causes us today to shake our heads and wonder how 
governments could have been so narrow minded, insensitive and 
unfair.
<P>
	There are five statutes that provide the framework for First 
Nations policy during the past 200 years. The first was the royal 
proclamation in 1763 which separated Indian lands from those that 
formed the colonies. It initiated a process by which Indian land 
could be purchased. Second was the Gradual Civilization of the 
Indian Tribes in Canada Act of 1857. Third was the the Gradual 
Enfranchisement Act of 1869. Theses acts endeavoured to remove 
all distinctions between Indians and non-Indians.
<P>
	Fourth was the Indian Act of 1876, the first to bear that title. It 
consolidated previous legislation and introduced new provisions. 
Fifth was the Indian Act of 1951 which followed the 
recommendation of a joint committee of this House and the other 
place. It introduced major reforms, including the reduction of 
powers exercised by the government. Those are the principal 
statutes but in between these key dates many amendments have 
been introduced that have had a profound impact on the day to day 
lives of First Nations peoples.
<P>
	I will look at some recurring themes within those statutes and 
regulations. When we look at the way in which the rules have been 
changed at the whim of successive administrations, this House will 
get a better idea of why we now want to give First Nations the 
option to get government off their backs. One of the most important 
themes is the basic question who is an Indian. By 1876 the 
definition was someone of Indian blood, or in the case of mixed 
marriages the definition was a non-Indian woman married to an 
Indian man.
<P>
	The 1951 act replaced the notion of Indian blood with the notion 
of registration. Registered Indians had the right to band 
membership and could live on reserve. Indian women who married 
non-Indian men were not recognized as Indians. This was not 
changed until the Indian Act was amended in 1985.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	But the issue of who is an Indian also includes whether the 
government has a right to decide, whether the government has a 
right to take away the rights and privileges of an individual Indian. 
This was the objective of the Gradual Civilization Act passed in 
1857. It introduced the notion of enfranchisement. An Indian adult 
male could obtain the franchise but he would lose his Indian status.
<P>
	Over the years the government sought to encourage Indians to 
give up their status by promising them land which they would hold 
as individuals, not as members of a band. In 1857 the government 
promised up to 50 acres. How many Indians fell for this? How 
many were willing to lose their Indian status in return for 
enfranchisement and private ownership on reserve land? Between 
1857 and the passage of the Indian Act 19 years later, only one.
<P>
	This method of encouraging Indians to give up their traditional 
ways was not working, so in 1876 the law was changed. In a 
breathtaking piece of paternalism, enfranchisement was imposed 
automatically on any Indian who earned a university degree or who 
became a doctor, a lawyer or a clergyman. Compulsory 
enfranchisement for all Indians over 21 was taken in and out of 
legislation frequently over the next 43 years. In 1933 it was again 
reintroduced and it stayed in effect until the act was revised in 
1951.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8264"> 8264 </A></B>
<P>
	What we have here is a record of arbitrary decisions on the part 
of former governments to try to destroy the fabric of First Nations 
by removing Indian status from some of the most prominent 
members of the First Nations communities. This is part of the 
legacy of the Indian Act. This arbitrary power extends to other 
spheres.
<P>
	In fact, much of the concern about the enfranchisement issue 
arose out of another broad area of concern: land. The history of 
government relations with First Nations with respect to land shows 
an alarming degree of high-handed imposition of government will. 
Individual land holdings on reserves were instituted in 1876. 
Residents received a location ticket from the superintendent 
general; otherwise reserve residents would not be considered to be 
lawfully holding their individual plots of land. The superintendent 
general could order that a reserve be surveyed and divided into lots 
and then require that band members obtain location tickets.
<P>
	By 1884 a male Indian holding a location ticket could bequeath 
property to family members, including his wife, but the wife had to 
be living with him at the time of his death and she had to be of good 
moral character. Who decided whether she was of good character? 
Government authorities.
<P>
	It was the government, not the band council that would decide 
how moneys from the surrender and sale of reserve lands and other 
resources would be spent. It was the superintendent general, not the 
band council who decided whether non-Indians could reside on or 
use reserve lands.
<P>
	The governor in council could allow leases to be issued for 
surface rights on Indian reserves. There was no need to get 
approval from a band council. According to the changes 
established in 1919 the owners of the land would have to be 
compensated, but by 1938 even this provision was dropped.
<P>
	In 1941 Indians were prohibited from selling agricultural 
produce, furs and wild animals. To this day the Indian Act contains 
a provision prohibiting the sale of agricultural products by western 
Indians without official permission.
<P>
	Changes to the act in 1951 removed many of the most glaring 
inequities surrounding land. Expropriation powers were 
significantly reduced. Administration of Indian estates was brought 
more into line with provincial laws. But many of the old rules 
remain.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Today we shake our heads and wonder how governments of the 
day could be so imperious and paternalistic. But the day will come 
when Canadians will wonder why they continued to keep so many 
restrictions in the Indian Act in the latter half of the 20th century. 
That is why the government has introduced the legislation before 
us as an option to get out from under some of the old rules, to start a 
new era without paternalism.
<P>
	I urge all members to join me in voting to send this legislation to 
committee for further study.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-79, the bill that makes 
what they call optional modifications to the Indian Act. I was very 
pleased to hear the words of the minister in introducing the bill to 
Parliament and as well to hear a number of the Liberal members 
commenting on why they think the act needs to be changed and 
eventually eliminated.
<P>
	I applaud the minister of Indian affairs for his work over the past 
three years in visiting with aboriginal people from coast to coast to 
coast. He has travelled more extensively than probably any other 
minister of Indian affairs that I am aware of.
<P>
	It seems that while he was travelling he learned some of the 
language Indian people want to hear, but the actions he has taken 
are not the ones the majority of Indian people would like him to 
take. The Indian people in Canada would like the language being 
used by the minister and by government members to be more 
adequately reflected in the legislation proposed and in the actions 
the government takes in terms of removing some obstacles that are 
in their way, along with providing them with the resources 
necessary to assist them in getting themselves out of the difficulties 
past legislation and government practices have put them in.
<P>
	In looking at Bill C-79 I recognize there are a number of positive 
aspects to it. However, they are almost insignificant in terms of 
what it is that needs to be done for aboriginal people in Canada 
today. The legislation allows the government to remove itself from 
certain aspects of Indian community life. It allows different First 
Nations to buy into the proposal or to leave things as they are. Let 
us look at some of the specifics.
<P>
	For example, departmental officials will no longer have to 
approve the sale of farm produce. This is admirable but that has not 
been going on for years. This part of the Indian Act has basically 
been ignored by all the officials, the department and the minister 
for years.
<P>
	The act allows for a First Nation not to require the instruction 
from the minister on road repair. I am sure most First Nations are 
glad they no longer have to ask the minister for permission to fix 
their roads, but they have no money to fix their roads. Their roads 
are in horrible disrepair and it is because the resources are not 
available to fix them. They do not have to ask the minister because 
they cannot fix them in any case. If the government were truly 
interested in assisting in this regard, it would ensure that the 
necessary moneys were there, not just for road repairs, but for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8265"> 8265 </A></B>
<P>
establishment of new roads to connect with provincial highway 
systems which ignore a lot of the First Nations communities.
<P>
	The bill also states that the terms of office for chief and council 
could be extended from two to three years. Obviously many of the 
Indian governments would applaud the move from two to three 
years, but most of them have been asking for an extension to four 
years. Because other governments around them have terms of 
office of four years, many of them see that the work they start is 
interrupted at the end of the second or the third year. Most of them 
have been thinking that four-year terms would be appropriate. 
Having the opportunity to set their own terms of office in 
conjunction with people in their own communities is very 
important.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I notice in the briefing papers that the government indicates it 
would ``not fundamentally affect the crown's fiduciary relationship 
and treaty obligations''. The word fundamentally is very important 
to aboriginal people in Canada. Fiduciary responsibility of the 
federal government is paramount. The fiduciary responsibility 
exists and cannot be changed, yet the government acknowledges 
that it will not be fundamentally affected. That means there may be 
an effect on the fiduciary responsibility. We must ensure that does 
not happen at all.
<P>
	All of this follows the release of the report by the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. There has been a great deal of 
comment around the country about the expense and the expanse of 
the royal commission. Fifty-eight million dollars was spent on the 
royal commission, money that the minister even said he would 
rather have spent on housing than on the royal commission.
<P>
	Regardless of what we think about the process and the financing 
of the royal commission, the fact is the documents released by the 
royal commission exist. This is the most extensive study of the 
relationship between aboriginal people and the rest of us that has 
ever taken place in this country.
<P>
	I do not claim to have read the entire royal commission report. I 
am only almost finished the first volume of the several volumes of 
the report, but I am overwhelmed at the value of the information 
contained in the document. In skimming the other documents that I 
intend to read over the next few months, I can tell that the royal 
commission has done a tremendous job of identifying the problems 
that aboriginal people have faced and suggesting some solutions as 
to how to overcome those problems.
<P>
	Certainly getting rid of the Indian Act is a part of that, but it is 
not negotiating the Indian Act away one Indian band at a time or 
one section of the act at a time. What this country needs is a 
thorough parliamentary First Nations provincial government 
review of the Indian Act and the overhaul of it in one fell swoop 
with the idea of ensuring that the resources are available to all 
levels of government to ensure that the replacement is a success.
<P>
	It makes no sense to replace the Indian Act one nation at a time, 
one clause at a time. This does not seem to me to be the most 
efficient way of doing it. Certainly the words, the study, the 
thought, the work that has gone into the report of the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples make it very clear that 
substantial changes are necessary both in attitude and in 
programming in order to fix a number of the problems that exist. 
Some of them cannot be fixed by this type of negotiation; they will 
simply be fixed within the Indian communities on their own.
<P>
	When we ask First Nations communities what is at the top of 
their list for correction, they are not saying they want to get the 
minister off their backs from selling farm products. They talk about 
the need for more housing. They talk about the need to improve 
their health and justice systems. They talk about the need to fix 
their education system to ensure that their young people are well 
educated and skilled both in traditional knowledge and in the ways 
of the neighbouring communities, to ensure that their young people 
will be successful as they get older. They also talk about culture 
and language, economic development and self-government, land 
and resources which ensure their economic development packages 
are successful.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	These are all matters which require a great deal of attention from 
all members of this House, from all members of provincial 
legislatures and from all municipal governments across this 
country. We as communities, as people living together, must 
understand the history of this country, how all of our people have 
worked together to get us in the position we are in today. Tinkering 
with the Indian Act, one clause at a time, one band at a time, 
certainly will not achieve the goals which we wish to achieve.
<P>
	I wish the minister well as we go into the election period. I know 
there are major challenges in front of us. I challenge the minister to 
address those serious, important issues before we face the people.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today to Bill C-79, which amends the Indian Act.
<P>
	This bill allows bands so wishing to amend certain provisions of 
the Indian Act. We are looking at the reform of a bill passed over a 
century ago. That was a long time ago. The amendments concern 
45 of the 120 sections of the Indian Act.
<P>
	The main areas affected by the changes are estates, new powers 
to band councils, electoral procedures,  infractions and the 
application of criminal law on reserves. For example, the chief and 
the band council have a three year mandate; we do not know why. 
The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8266"> 8266 </A></B>
<P>
minister has the power to annul an election; we do not know the 
reason for that either.
<P>
	Because the new powers this bill confers are optional, only the 
nations so requesting will be covered by this new legislation. The 
others will remain under the old one.
<P>
	This is a bad bill. The report of the Erasmus-Dussault royal 
commission of inquiry noted the bill was outdated and backward 
and said that amending it was not the way to establish a new 
relationship between natives and non natives.
<P>
	With Bill C-79, Canada returns to its colonial past with respect 
to its aboriginal peoples. At the time, the only aim of the Indian Act 
was to assimilate the native peoples. This bill does not even have 
the approval of those primarily affected by it-the native peoples. 
In December 1996, of 610 aboriginal communities, 542 came out 
against this bill. In other words, more than 85 per cent of the First 
Nations categorically reject the process set in motion by the federal 
government in this respect.
<P>
	How can the government go ahead when the vast majority of 
those affected oppose its proposal? Many of the commitments the 
Liberal Party of Canada had made to the aboriginal people before 
the election were not fulfilled. Even the aboriginal people involved 
in developing the election platform set out in the red book made 
sure to publicly dissociate themselves from the Liberal Party of 
Canada when they saw this government's attitude and behaviour 
toward the First Nations.
<P>
	There is no mention anywhere in the seven pages of promises 
relating to the aboriginal people in the red book of any amendment 
to the Indian Act. Where does this initiative come from? The red 
book states at page 98: ``A Liberal government will develop a more 
comprehensive process for consultation between federal ministers 
and aboriginal representatives with respect to decision making that 
directly affect First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples''.
<P>
	This is another example of a serious consultation problem on a 
bill that concerns specifically and directly aboriginal peoples. This 
approach is contrary to the red book, which goes on to say: ``It does 
not make sense for the federal government to be unilaterally 
making policy or budgetary decisions that affect the lives of 
aboriginal people, without their consent''.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that it is the core of the commitments 
made to the aboriginal people that this government failed to 
honour. Where is the ``new partnership'', the ``mutual respect'', 
and the ``participation of aboriginal people in the decision  making 
process'' this government had promised before the 1993 election?
<P>
	On November 21, the report of the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples was released. This is a comprehensive, 
important and interesting study prepared by the Erasmus-Dussault 
commission. I agree with the objectives stated in this report 
concerning self-government, the recognition of aboriginal nations 
and territorial claims.
<P>
	Canada's aboriginal nations are distinct. As such, they must have 
increased self-government, so as to be able, among other things, to 
generate revenues and to protect their languages and cultures. 
Aboriginal nations have a right to be sovereign in strategic sectors 
such as health, education, language and economic development. It 
is the only way they can ensure the preservation and development 
of their own identity.
<P>
	However, aboriginal people must first be recognized, so that they 
can negotiate directly with the federal and provincial governments. 
We must repair the harm done over the years to aboriginal people 
by the various Canadian governments. After more than a century of 
Canadian policies designed to assimilate, if not eliminate 
aboriginal people, it is time the federal government recognized its 
mistakes, assumed its responsibilities and made the necessary 
changes.
<P>
	Aboriginal nations must achieve self-government status to stop 
being financially dependent on Ottawa. I am pleased that the 
Government of Quebec negotiated and signed a modern day treaty 
with the Crees. The James Bay Agreement made it possible to 
improve the Crees' economic situation and to let them take charge 
of their development. I should point out that the fair sharing of the 
land was instrumental in the success of this initiative.
<P>
	It is well known that I come from Latin America, where Indians 
make up a large part, sometimes the majority, of the population in 
certain countries. From the beginning of colonization in 1492, the 
aboriginal peoples were exploited and exterminated. Today, more 
than 500 years later, they are still living in inhumane conditions, in 
unacceptable poverty and misery.
<P>
	The Erasmus-Dussault report is critical, and rightly so, of the 
living conditions of native people in Canada, ``the best country in 
the world'' as the Prime Minister so often tells us. In Latin 
America, these conditions are much worse.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to urge the federal government to put the 
issue of Amerindians on the agenda when meeting with various 
countries, whether bilaterally or multilaterally through the OAS, or 
in other international forums.
<P>
	International co-operation must be developed in this regard with 
respect to the Americas. The Erasmus-Dussault report describes 
and deplores the immense problems confronting Canada's native 
peoples  with respect to health, education, unemployment, housing 
and crime. Native peoples are a minority representing 3 percent of 
the population. They are often the victims of racism and discrimi-

<P>
nation. In addition, this study points out that over 10,000 
households on reserves are without indoor plumbing.
<P>
	The Liberals have done nothing to resolve these serious 
problems. Nor will they with Bill C-79. For all these reasons, I will 
therefore be voting against Bill C-79.

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise in the House today to recognize a 
constituent of mine, Mr. Harry Burke. He is a local artist who was 
inspired by the names that he found inscribed in stone at the Exeter 
cenotaph.
<P>
	He was so deeply stirred that he began an intricate endeavour to 
paint portraits of each of the people who had so valiantly served 
their nation in its time of crisis.
<P>
	His project originated with the idea that these individuals were 
more than just names cast in marble. They were people with 
families and friends and they should be remembered as such.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to view Mr. Burke's work. I was 
struck by the realistic manner in which the faces of our fallen 
countrymen were captured in each portrait. So accurate were the 
images that family members and veterans were moved to tears as 
they viewed the impressions of their departed companions.
<P>
	I would like to relay my heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Burke for 
his substantial investment of time, energy and emotion into this 
venture. His valuable contribution pays a fitting tribute to those 
Canadians captured forever on his canvas.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
wollastonite is a little known mineral, a white crystalline substance 
used in the manufacture of plastics, ceramics and paint. Production 
of this mineral has doubled over the past decade. This is good news 
for the first wollastonite mine in Canada, which is located in 
Quebec near Saint-Ludger-de-Milot.
<P>
	At the present time, annual production is forecast at over 50,000 
tonnes, and the mine has the potential for expanding its production 
to 85,000 tonnes. Such forecasts are, of course, forecasts as well of 
economic growth and increased employment for Quebecers.
<P>
	Thanks to such initiatives, the mining industry has become a 
pillar of the Quebec economy, providing close to 17,500 people 
with jobs. In order for this progress to continue, I am asking the 
government to turn its promises into concrete actions and to do 
away with the costly duplication in regulations which is hindering 
investment in Quebec's mining industry.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police deserve a fair deal from this 
government. Under present law, RCMP personnel are unable to 
voice their concerns or grievances through a police association.
<P>
	The Reform Party recognizes that RCMP officers should have 
the right to organize democratically and bargain collectively. This 
means that officers should be able to do so through voluntary 
membership in a police association. To those officers who want to 
bargain collectively, Reform applauds your efforts.
<P>
	Reform also recognizes that the RCMP wants real freedom of 
association. To those officers who feel their concerns are best 
addressed individually, Reform supports your right to opt out of 
compulsory union membership. We support your right to work.
<P>
	I say to the RCMP officers in the gallery, on the Hill here this 
week or out in the communities, your concerns are not falling on 
deaf ears.

officers a fair deal.

<P>
my home province of New Brunswick. They are here in Ottawa 
representing the Canadian Police Association.
<P>
	The men I met with are concerned because of the government's 
long delay in bringing forth legislation providing for DNA data 
banks. Fingerprints are kept in a bank. Why is DNA treated 
differently? Setting up a DNA data bank would allow police forces 
across the country access to a wealth of information which could 
help them conclude unsolved violent crimes. The government 
really has to get its priorities straight. It does not want a criminal's 
genetic fingerprint on file, but it does want all law-abiding gun 
owners on file.

<P>
	In the past few months 4,000 Canadians have indicated to me

<P>
	Over 350 municipal councils from communities like Gambo, 
Newfoundland; Puslinch, Ontario; Beaconsfield, Quebec; Leaf

Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my deep concern over last 
Thursday's display of religious intolerance and blind bigotry 
displayed by police in Karachi, Pakistan against the Christian 
minority.
<P>
	I believe it is essential for people of different religions, including 
minority groups, to respect each other's faith. We are all children of 
God, so rather than work to destroy each other, we must try to 
eliminate the true source of conflict which is religious intolerance.
<P>
	In the words of Patrick Henry: ``Religion must only be directed 
by reason, not by force or violence. All individuals are equally 
entitled to the free exercise of  religion, and it is the mutual duty of 
all to practice tolerance, love and charity toward each other''.

strong call for religious tolerance and understanding in Pakistan.

industries to police themselves.

	The Alberta government is also in the process of reducing the 
budget of its environment department by $164 million and 1,360 
jobs by the year 1999.
<P>
	Not to be outdone, the Ontario government has cut its ministry of 
the environment and energy budget by one-third, eliminating 752 
staff and has also reduced the staff of the ministry of natural 
resources by 2,150 people.

depression, unemployment in my riding of Okanagan-Shuswap 
stands at 10.7 per cent.
<P>
	Those are not just numbers, they are people: from new graduates 
looking for their first jobs, older workers laid off because of 
downsizing, to people in the prime of life who are unable to support 
their families no matter how hard they try.
<P>
	Last October bankruptcies were up 61 per cent from October 
1993 when the Liberal government took office. Families are also 
carrying the highest debt load in history.
<P>
	These figures are a national tragedy. And what response do we 
get from this caring, sharing Liberal government? Last week it 
tabled legislation that will sharply increase payroll taxes, making it 
more costly than ever before for businesses to hire new employees.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to some people, Canada is the finest country in the world, 
yet it is also the country in which a Quebec family on welfare, 
composed of one parent and one child, must struggle desperately to 
survive on $8,337 less than the poverty level.
<P>
	This actual drop in purchasing power is the direct effect of 
federal government cuts to transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	In fact, under the new Canada social transfer, the provinces will 
be receiving approximately $7 billion less for health, 
postsecondary education and welfare. The federal government

the expense of someone other than the most disadvantaged.

Speaker, last month seven post-secondary education groups 
representing universities, community colleges, students, professors 
and student aid administrators urged the federal government to 
adopt a comprehensive package of student aid measures to provide 
affordable futures to students. They note that fast rising student 
debt loads are fueling a deep anxiety on the part of students and 
their parents.
<P>
	The measures they propose include targeted grants for high need 
individuals, repayment assistance where required to help former 
students meet their debt obligations, a work study program to 
provide opportunities for students to earn while they learn and tax 
measures to help Canadians save for their children's education.
<P>
	New Democrats strongly believe in the need for continued 
federal investment in student assistance in order that every student 
who is academically qualified is able to benefit fully from 
Canada's post-secondary education opportunities regardless of his 
or her financial status. We urge the Liberals to implement these 
progressive proposals.

Minister has not delivered on these two verbal promises and 
Canadians will not be fooled by the smoke and mirrors budget 
announcements today.
<P>
	I am sure that the finance minister will unveil a good news 
budget announcing no new tax increases. Why should he not for he 
has already picked the pocketbooks of Canadians with hidden 
taxes.
<P>
	Last week's changes to the CPP was the biggest tax grab in 
Canadian history. The bottom line is that the average Canadian's 
net pay is less than it was three years ago. Let us not be fooled for it 
is the middle income earners that continue to pay for the financial 
mismanagement of governments.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
government still considers Montreal the cornerstone of Quebec 
economic activity. Many businesses in the high tech industry are 
located there, and their expertise makes Canada a leader 
internationally in these areas.
<P>
	The CGI group in Montreal is the biggest Canadian owned 
information technology company. It was a member of Team 
Canada on its latest Asian trip.
<P>
	While in Thailand, the CGI group, which employs over 1,700 
people in Canada and abroad, signed a contract a Chomburi 
company to supply a management system. The contract is 
estimated to be worth $2 million.
<P>
	The high tech sector is a jewel in the Montreal economy and, 
thanks to Team Canada, our know-how has spread to the far corners 
of the world.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
action taken jointly by the federal government and a majority of 
provinces to put the Canada pension plan on a sound footing is an 
example of responsible leadership.
<P>
	It may have been politically expedient to delay, but that would 
not be in the best interests of Canadians young or old. Delaying the 
decision would have resulted in a bigger bill down the road.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, it is precisely because previous governments failed to act 
that we find ourselves in this situation today. It is precisely to make 
the plan affordable and sustainable, for generations, now and in the 
future, that we are acting right now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Those who attempt to score political points by preying on 
people's fears should come clean with Canadians and tell them 
what their own plan is, and that is to dismantle the CPP. It is also 
irresponsible to try to make this an intergenerational battle.
<P>
	Canadians believe in the CPP. They want it preserved as a public 
pension plan and that is what we are doing. That is political 
leadership.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we thought we had seen everything with this government, 
but it seems more is yet to come.
<P>
	Apparently, from now on, Canadian artists and creators will be 
able to obtain financial assistance from the Department of Foreign 
Affairs for tours abroad only if they promote Canadian unity. The 
federal government has decided to impose its political views on the 
creative process. This is absolutely incredible.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
How can the minister, who is responsible for culture on behalf of 
the Canadian government, allow this government to set political 
criteria for the creative of work of Canadian and Quebec artists?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it will be a pleasure to answer the hon. member's question. He said 
in his question that funding would be given only if one particular 
criterion was met. That is entirely inaccurate.
<P>
	There is a series of objectives, as my colleague, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, mentioned yesterday. There is no need to meet all 
objectives, and I expect the hon. member opposite is well aware of 
this. There is only a list of objectives, and one of them is to present 
Canada as a bilingual country consisting of various cultures. Is the 
hon. member against our artists presenting Canadian diversity 
abroad? I hardly think so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is the limit. The minister tells us there is in fact a rule 
that if you do not defend Canadian unity, you may not get your 
grant. Maybe you will, but it is not a sure thing. It is up to the 
government.
<P>
	How can the minister responsible for Francophonie, who is 
attached to Foreign Affairs, and I am not sure in what capacity he is 
answering my question, how can he be so matter of fact about a 
program that is trying to control all Canadian artists and Quebec 
artists as well who are more specifically on the receiving end?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is the exact opposite of what I just told the hon. member. I 
made it quite clear that these were not criteria. As for the objectives 
I mentioned, and there are six, there is no obligation to meet all 
these objectives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8272"> 8272 </A></B>
<P>
	One of them, as the hon. member said, mentions national unity. 
Another one refers to diversity. Is he against diversity? And 
another objective for instance, is to present our culture abroad. 
Another objective is to talk about cultural and other exports 
abroad.
<P>
	So there is a whole range of objectives, and I am sure that 
everyone can find within that range ways to convey the message of 
Canadian diversity abroad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if this were a page from Astérix, the comment would be: 
``Those Romans are crazy''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Do not worry, Mr. Speaker, I will not violate the 
Standing Orders. You know my respect for the Standing Orders of 
this House.
<P>
	The minister was explaining that they include this criterion but it 
does not have to be met. They put it in by accident, this thing about 
Canadian unity, but it does not really matter if we do not promote 
Canadian unity. What he just told us does not make sense.
<P>
	I will ask him another question: Does the minister agree that the 
government has two objectives in mind by including this criterion, 
a new criterion artists will have to meet? First, they want political 
control over the creative arts in Canada, and second, they want to 
reduce substantially assistance to Quebec creators who, according 
to this government, are not interested enough in promoting national 
unity.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Leader of the Official Opposition doth protest too much, but I 
want to thank him for his short course in pop culture in the form of 
a quote from Astérix.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite must know, and I told him so earlier, 
that this is not about criteria that must be applied regardless. In fact 
this is not about criteria at all. There are no prerequisites. We 
respect the freedom of the artists, that is quite clear.
<P>
	What we have here are simply objectives. One of those 
objectives is diversity. The hon. member opposite mentioned 
another one. Is he against cultural diversity and cultural 
excellence?
<P>
	I believe that Mr. Léveillée, that Edith Butler and many others 
are excellent examples of this cultural diversity in Canada. And I 
hope my hon. friend will agree that these people excel in their field.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
strangely enough, this government, which has made major cuts to 
culture, always seems able to find money to fund propaganda 
campaigns. The latest idea the Minister of Canadian Heritage came 
up with is a propaganda kit on Canada for distribution in schools.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. The 
federal government had promised to withdraw from provincial 
jurisdictions. Why is the minister jumping in with both feet and 
squandering public funds to distribute her propaganda kit in 
schools when her colleague, the Minister of Finance, is cutting 
transfer payments for education?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the cultural affairs 
ministers' meeting in Saskatchewan last year, one of the questions 
raised by the provincial ministers concerned the lack of availability 
of Canadian material for use in schools.
<P>
	Last year, I had a kit prepared-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> You are not allowed to show it around.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> -which was such a hit with school principals that, 
within two weeks, we had received 3,000 telephone requests for 
kits from school principals, including 300 from Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> It makes no 
sense, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	After the flag operation, after the Canada information office, 
after the TV quiz, now the heritage minister wants to indoctrinate 
children starting in junior kindergarten.
<P>
	Where will it stop? What is next? ``Flushabye Flags''?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have taken on the 
challenge of the cultural affairs ministers, who asked the 
Government of Canada to provide information to school principals.
<P>
	Later, I sent a letter to school principals to tell them about this 
kit, and the response was incredible. I would like to quote for the 
record the president of the Fédération des directeurs d'école du 
Québec, who stated today: ``It is up to school principals to exercise 
judgment in deciding whether or not to order the multimedia 
educational package''.
<P>
	I always give school principals the choice. All we do is provide 
information. It is such a hit that, after two weeks, we had to have 
5,000 new packages prepared.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a 70 per cent increase in mandatory Canada pension plan 
premiums; up to $10 billion more per year in revenue for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8273"> 8273 </A></B>
<P>
government; $690 more taken off  Canadian paycheques. That 
sounds like a tax, smells like a tax and looks like a tax, but not so 
according to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	In the House yesterday he said: ``This is not a tax grab. It is not a 
tax''. I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether it is really the 
position of the Government of Canada that Canada pension plan 
payments are not a payroll tax.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance mentioned that it is a contribution 
by every citizen and employers to make sure there is a Canada 
pension plan available for generations to come.
<P>
	The leader says that there was neglect in the previous 
government and I agree with him. That is why we are obliged to fix 
it at the request of the provincial governments. This program is a 
joint federal-provincial program.
<P>
	They are pretty close apparently to the Conservative 
Government of Ontario. In the paper over the weekend the minister 
of finance of Ontario was claiming a victory.
<P>
	It was to be proceeded with to make sure that this element of 
public finances of the provincial and the federal governments will 
be in order.
<P>
	The people have to understand that these contributions are used 
by the provincial governments to finance their operations. That is 
why they wanted it fixed. We did that jointly with the provincial 
governments.
<P>
	The premier of Alberta was very happy that this problem was 
resolved. He, like us, like Ontario and like most of the people, 
wanted the finances of the nation to be in good order. This is not the 
time to try not to tell the truth to the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, therefore according to the Minister of Finance and the 
Prime Minister, the CPP premiums are contributions and not a tax.
<P>
	I have on my desk a paper entitled ``Growth in CPP/QPP 
Contributions''. In it the author clearly describes contributions to 
the Canada pension plan and the Quebec plan as compulsory 
payroll taxes. He demonstrates that increases in the payroll taxes 
from 1986 to 1993 reduced employment by 26,000 jobs. The author 
of this paper, Joe Italiano, is with the economic analysis and 
forecasting division of the Department of Finance.
<P>
	Who is right, the finance minister who says that CPP premiums 
are not a payroll tax and that raising them has no impact on jobs, or 
the analysis of his own department that says exactly the opposite?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to start at the beginning and go 
very slowly for the hon. members opposite.
<P>
	These are not revenues of the Government of Canada. He 
misleads Canadians when he says that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I encourage you to stay away from 
words like ``mislead'' in questions and answers. I invite the hon. 
parliamentary secretary to give his response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, their statements to the effect that 
these are taxes rather than describing them as what they are have 
left an unfortunate impression among Canadians. These are 
contributions to a public pension plan available to pay benefits 
under this plan. They are not revenues of the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister once said he would kill the GST. He 
broke that promise. The Prime Minister claims there have been no 
tax increases under his administration. Now we have a 70 per cent 
hike in a particular payroll tax alone.
<P>
	Soon the Prime Minister will be sending candidates across the 
country to seek re-election. As they go from meeting to meeting, 
they will be followed like some hound from hell by the Prime 
Minister's record of broken promises on jobs, broken promises on 
taxes and broken promises on integrity.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister hope to improve his reputation for 
honesty and integrity when he refuses to admit that CPP 
contributions are a payroll tax and a 70 per cent hike in premiums 
is a tax grab?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the parliamentary secretary explained the contributions 
very well.
<P>
	As I explained earlier, this is a joint plan between the federal and 
provincial governments. We cannot change the plan alone. We need 
the collaboration of the provinces. Because the provinces needed 
the money to finance their operations, they were urging us to make 
the contributions equal to the payments for the future.
<P>
	At this time there is a deficit. The hon. leader of the third party is 
always talking about deficits but when we try to do something to 
put the finances of the nation together, he does not support us. He is 
the one who has completely changed his position. Because he is 
now desperate, he is trying to buy the votes of Canadians with their 
own money.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Yesterday, when asked about spying activities targeting a 
Quebec diplomat in Washington and involving military officers at 
the Canadian embassy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said there 
was no policy, no direction whatsoever that anybody in any 
embassy should spy on any Quebec official.
<P>
	Given that the two officers involved may, of their own initiative, 
have engaged in illegal activities under American laws, can the 
defence minister tell us whether these officers were suspended and 
whether he ordered an investigation into the activities of his 
military personnel at the Canadian embassy in Washington?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I believe that, 
yesterday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs explained very clearly 
that no one had engaged in spying activities in that case and that 
nothing wrong was done. We have no reason to believe that any 
illegal action under American laws took place.
<P>
	We know that the allegations resulted from a misunderstanding 
or a difference of opinion between an American government 
employee and his superiors.
<P>
	As for us, as the minister said yesterday, there is no government 
policy to spy on any official of the Quebec government or of any 
other provincial government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
once again asking the Minister of National Defence whether or not 
an investigation was conducted and, if no investigation did or will 
take place, who are we supposed to believe? The Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, who told us yesterday that the allegations were 
unfounded, or the Minister of National Defence himself, who the 
day before said the issue had to be looked into?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member knows that this information was the result of reports 
following representations made by an American government 
employee against his superior.
<P>
	The employee claimed that representations had been made to 
find out whether someone had been present at a breakfast.
<P>
	Let us be serious when we talk about spying activities. As for 
myself, at this point, based on the facts that are known, I have no 
reason to believe that spying activities were conducted against the 
person in question.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary said that the CPP premiums are not a tax 
but a contribution to a public pension plan. Let us just look for a 
moment or two at a private pension plan, the MP pension plan, the 
most obscene in the country.
<P>
	Canadians are now paying twice as much of their salary for a 
paltry $9,000 a year in CPP. Thanks to the government, 
parliamentary porkers like the member for Sherbrooke and the 
Deputy Prime Minister are going to pocket five to six times that 
amount. That is scandalous.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify asking Canadians to pay 70 
per cent more of their meagre pensions when he and his Liberal 
colleagues are just going to lap up the lavish MP pension plan?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> There is more than a slab of bacon talking 
there.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is mixing up two things; one has nothing to do with 
the other.
<P>
	In making the Canada pension plan fund able to meet its future 
obligations, the government with the provinces is making sure that 
the plan is sustainable. In terms of the members of Parliament 
pension plan, we reduced it by 20 per cent and reduced the cost. We 
have introduced 55 as the age when it can be collected. Therefore, 
once again, we have made the plan much more in conformity with 
the requirements.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it may 
be that I am a porker but I opted out of that pension plan and the 
taxpayer does not owe me one single penny for that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> A pension porker I am not. I opt out; Sheila copped 
out.
<P>

away from personal remarks. I would ask you, my colleague, 
without further preamble to please put your question.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the Prime Minister 
this question. To be consistent, to be fair to all Canadians in this 
Chamber and outside, will the Prime Minister today announce an 
immediate 70 per cent increase in the premium for the potlicker 
MP pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr.  Speaker, I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8275"> 8275 </A></B>
<P>
have already mentioned that benefits for MPs in respect of service 
after July 12, 1995 have been reduced by 20 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	During the debate on Bill C-85, which was retirement 
allowances for MPs, there was an MP for the Reform Party, whom I

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr.

asked the Minister of National Defence whether there has been an 
investigation into allegations that military staff of the Canadian 
embassy in Washington engaged in certain illegal activities.
<P>
	I am simply asking the Minister of National Defence a very 
simple question for the third time: Did his department conduct an 
investigation to check out these allegations? It seems like a rather 
simple question to me.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, obviously, 
following statements reported in the newspapers, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and I looked into the matter, because obviously we 
have to know what is going on, and in my mind there is no doubt, 
based on the information we have, that no spying took place, no 
activity that could be described as spying, in the situation to which 
the American government employee is referring.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Well, Mr. 
Speaker, we have just obtained a quicker answer from this minister 
than from the former minister. It took the last one a good two 
months before we could get at the first thing about the Somalia 
affair.
<P>
	So, if there was an investigation, surely there was a written 
report for the minister. The minister must have taken his decision 
on the basis of written reports.
<P>
	Could the minister, in the interests of transparency, make this 
report public, so that the allegations that have been made and that 
appear to be serious, since there are affidavits, so that we can know 
clearly that it is not true that Canada is acting in this manner and 
can put an end to this story? Is the minister prepared to make this 
report public, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I have said 
three times, when we learned, through the newspapers, that an 
employee of the American government, in a dispute with his boss, 
alleged that  discussions had taken place concerning a 
representative of a government of a Canadian province, obviously 
we asked what exactly had taken place.
<P>
	According to the information I have received, which is very 
limited, I am told that it was a question of finding out whether the

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the $1,300 job-killing Liberal Canada pension plan 
payroll tax increase will patch over deficiencies in the plan for the 
time being at a terrible cost in job opportunities for young 
Canadians. The very young Canadians who are already saddled 
with a $600 billion national debt will now be forced to subsidize 
the retirement of the very Canadians who built up the debt in the 
first place. However, because the Canada pension plan is still a pay 
as you go plan, it is not sustainable.
<P>
	Will the government guarantee there will be no further premium 
increases or benefit decreases to the Canada pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we have done in responding to 
the wishes of Canadians is to provide a plan that is sustainable in 
the long term. By moving to the new contribution rates we are 
ensuring that they will not have to rise to the rates they would have 
had to rise if we had not taken action, something no earlier 
government has done. The provinces by and far agree with this. 
Canadians will benefit from sustainability of the plan, a plan they 
know will be there for every working Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is like the federal government saying: ``We are not 
guilty because all we are doing is driving the getaway car''.
<P>
	The most vulnerable Canadians in the workforce, younger 
Canadians, the last hired and the first fired, will pay the price for 
maintaining the Canada pension plan. The minister's own officials 
have admitted that younger contributors to the Canada pension plan 
will not receive a fair pension from the plan.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	Is it right to force young Canadians to pay almost 10 per cent of 
their income into a retirement plan that will return substantially 
less than the same amount invested in an RRSP?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	The minister has decided to resume expulsions of refugee 
claimants to Zaire, while the authoritarian regime and the civil war 
in that country continue. The minister is showing a flagrant lack of 
compassion and humanity toward these persecuted people.
<P>
	Can the minister explain to this House just how the political 
situation in Zaire has improved to such a point that she can now 
resume expulsions of refugees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the advisory committee on 
country conditions for removals has examined the situation in 
Zaire most particularly. A number of people in Canada and 
elsewhere have provided it with input.
<P>
	We looked a bit at what was being done internationally, and 
found that a number of countries continue to return people to Zaire. 
It is very clear that we will not return people to certain regions of 
Zaire, the east in particular. This is not the case for other regions of 
the country, where it is totally possible.
<P>
	I will conclude, if I may, by stating that no one has been returned 
to Zaire without a risk assessment being done to ensure that he or 
she is returning to one of the regions of Zaire in complete safety.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, instead of 
taking refuge behind a phantom committee, the minister ought to 
face up to her own responsibilities.
<P>
	Is the minister aware that she is committing a flagrant injustice 
toward the Zairian refugees, whose country is experiencing serious 
instability, while maintaining the suspension of deportations to 
Rwanda, Burundi and Afghanistan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat: there is no question 
whatsoever of returning a person whose life would be at risk if he 
or she were returned to certain parts of Zaire.
<P>
	However, yes, people can return in complete safety to certain 
regions of Zaire, and this is why we do an individual assessment. 
This is exactly the same policy as in some other countries, and I can 
assure you that we are keeping close tabs on the situation. If ever 
we have to suspend deportations, we shall do so. We will never put 
anyone's life in danger.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Secretary of State for Science, Research and 
Development.
<P>
	It is recognized that research, technology, information and 
knowledge are now the driving forces of economic growth. What is 
the government doing to ensure that Canada is leading this parade 
as Canadians march together toward the 21st century?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development)(Western Economic Diversification), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our government has a vision for the 21st century. We are 
investing in science, technology and building the information 
society.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	We announced last week numerous programs for science for 
young people. We have renewed the Canada space plan. We put 
major funding into Technology Partnerships Canada. We are 
putting Canada on the fast lane to develop the information highway 
with programs like CANARIE, SchoolNet, the community access 
program, and digital collections. We have invested in the health 
services research fund, have started the medical discovery fund and 
numerous other initiatives. The auditor general has said we have 
the best ever strategy for science and technology.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the past 
76 months unemployment has remained above 9 per cent. Youth 
unemployment is a fixture at 17 per cent. Every welfare and job 
creation program introduced by this government has been a failure. 
Yet the Minister of Natural Resources was quoted last week in 
Alberta as saying the pain is over. She wants to get back to more 
Liberal tax and spend policies to create jobs.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that the tax and spend youth jobs 
strategy is merely another welfare program for the unemployed 
rather than a serious attempt to get Albertans and Canadians back 
to work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our government was extremely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8277"> 8277 </A></B>
<P>
pleased last week to be able to give some hope to children and 
young unemployed people who really want to do something with 
their lives. That is what the youth of this country want and that is 
what we are giving them.
<P>
	There is the amount of $2 billion that we are already spending 
for young people in this country. We have announced two major 
new programs to gain work experience and 110,000 young 
Canadians will have access to some work experience in order to get 
them out of the no experience, no job and no job, no experience 
cycle. Our government is doing a lot. We need to do more and that 
is what we will do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no 
question the government needs to do more. It has to give tax relief, 
not more tax and spend programs. These tax and spend programs of 
this government are merely creating dependency on welfare. We 
know and the government knows that the entrepreneurial sector is 
the sector which creates jobs. It is not welfare dependency.
<P>
	That is why I ask the minister to explain the policy of this 
government dependency on welfare. Why is the government 
insisting on that way of resolving the problem rather than creating 
the entrepreneurs we need in this country and giving them the 
breaks? Jobs will be created this way rather than the government's 
way. Does the minister acknowledge that job creation can be better 
done this way?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member will have to look at 
the jobs strategy before commenting on it. This is precisely what 
we are doing. We are doing precisely that in partnership with the 
private sector and non-governmental organizations in creating jobs. 
These work experiences will not be in the government. They will 
be in the private sector and non-governmental organizations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why this strategy for young people who want to find jobs 
and gain work experience is greatly appreciated across Canada. In 
partnership with the private sector and non-governmental 
organizations, we will provide 110,000 young Canadians with work 
experience to get them out of the no experience, no job and no job, 
no experience cycle.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On November 26, 1996, in response to a question from the 
official opposition, the minister recognized having received from 
the Quebec Minister of Justice a letter requesting an amendment to 
the Criminal Code to permit  the opening of casinos on 
international cruises in Canadian waters. The minister even 
promised at the time to keep me abreast of his consultations with 
the cruise industry and the provincial governments.
<P>
	Does the fact that we have not yet heard from the minister about 
the latest developments on casinos on international cruises mean 
that he has simply given up the idea?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. As I told this House a few 
months ago, we have received a proposal from the Province of 
Quebec concerning floating casinos.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, this requires an amendment to the 
Criminal Code. The justice department has initiated consultations 
with the provinces, the territories, the aboriginal peoples, the 
industry and all other interested parties.
<P>
	We are now discussing every aspect of this issue with those 
concerned. In the months to come, I am confident that we will be 
able to state our position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the minister that what is 
at stake are the jobs, jobs, jobs promised in the Liberals' red book 
during the last election campaign.
<P>
	Am I to understand from the minister's answer that he is 
prepared to support the bill I tabled in this House last week?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, it is very important 
that we see this consultation process through. As I told this House, 
the interests involved are many and varied. I would rather wait and 
see what comes out of this consultation before stating a position.

<P>
	Could the minister imagine what it is like to be a tourist

then suddenly being deluged with surveys from half a dozen or 
so government departments? I know the information is important 
to collect but would the minister tell this House what he is doing 
to ensure this paper burden is not interfering with doing business?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard from small business people from across 
Canada that they are concerned about the extent and number of 
surveys they have been receiving.
<P>
	We have asked Statistics Canada and it has agreed to work with 
small business people to choose the best time of year for them to 
complete survey information. Small business owners know how 
important it is, not just to the federal government but to provincial 
and local governments as well, that Statistics Canada has adequate 
information so it can provide a basis upon which policy decisions 
can be made.
<P>

imposes on small business by over 15 per cent.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The present Prime Minister said in this House on April 1, 1993 
that Canada should not side with the multinational drug companies 
by passing Bill C-91 at the expense of poor and sick Canadians who 
need drugs. The Prime Minister was joined by the present ministers 
of health and industry in criticizing and voting against Bill C-91.
<P>
	Last night Canadians were told by the Minister of Industry that 
reducing the length of time for drug patents which could save 
Canadians billions of dollars on prescription drug costs will not 
happen under a Liberal government. Why have the Liberals now 
flip-flopped and sided with the multinationals at the expense of 
Canadians who need affordable prescription drugs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hope the hon. member listens closely because he 
evidently has been misled by somebody.
<P>
	He will know that since the time he has referred to, Canada has 
entered into, among others, the World Trade Organization 
agreement which resulted from the Uruguay round negotiations. 
One commitment of that agreement is article 33 of the TRIPS 
agreement which was signed subsequent to that: ``The term of 
protection available shall not end before the expiration of a period 
of 20 years counted from the filing date''.
<P>
	I understand why Bill C-91 was very controversial. I was here 
during those debates. I also understand how important it is for 
Canada to participate in international trade organizations such as 
the World Trade Organization, particularly when so much of our 
economy benefits from export access to many countries.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	I urge the hon. member to make significant and important 
contributions to the work of the industry committee that is 
reviewing Bill C-91, but to understand the context in which that 
review is being conducted.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my point of privilege arises from a response to a 
question yesterday by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	It is not a question of interpretation of fact which would not 
make it a point of privilege. It is a clear point in which the minister 
said something that was not the case.
<P>
	I would like to read what the minister said in yesterday's 
<I>Hansard</I>. It relates to services relating to Airbus. He said that ``all 
services that were rendered were entirely within those 
contemplated properly by the contract''.
<P>
	I have a copy of the contract and it plainly is not the case that 
those services were rendered within it. I can read it or not, as the 
case may be.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wonder if the hon. member could identify for me 
the specific privilege which is being impinged upon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Yes, Mr. 
Speaker. I believe it is contrary to the privileges of the members for 
anyone in the House to mislead the House and it is particularly 
important for the minister not to do that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With all respect, we seem to be going down the 
road of debate in this particular case. The hon. member mentioned 
that a statement was made. I take it he disagrees with whatever that 
statement was. Usually in the give and take of question period 
where a question is asked, the minister or a parliamentary secretary 
gives a  response and that is all part of question period. It is surely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8279"> 8279 </A></B>
<P>
not for your Speaker to decide that which is or which is not, and I 
quote your word, ``misleading''.
<P>
	Perhaps the answer was not the one that the hon. member wanted 
or was expecting, but I would be hard pressed to judge when a 
statement is or is not misleading.
<P>
	At this point, the hon. member should identify further what was 
his particular privilege. We have a question and answer and we 
have to take for granted that all of you are honourable members, 
therefore, that the answer will be given in good faith. I would let 
the matter rest there.

<P>
	When the Chair examines the blues for a possible breach of

should the Chair find that something did in fact occur, is to ask the 
member to withdraw that particular statement.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>

will come back to the House if it is necessary. I have said that.
<P>
	Do you have a point of order other than that which I have just 
described?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not want to bring that particular 
point up again. The only thing I ask, on a point of procedure, is that 
if a member, whether it be this incident or a different one, speaks 
on an open microphone, and if it is viciously directed at another 
member, no matter on which side of the House, I contend that it is 
not sufficient for the hon. member to withdraw that remark. When 
it is made openly against another member it should be in the form 
of an apology.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There again, my colleague, a withdrawal in this 
House embodies an admission that what was said was 
unparliamentary. In my view that would constitute perhaps the 
apology for which the member is looking.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
address Bill C-79, which seeks to amend to the Indian Act. As you 
know, the Indian Act is over one hundred years old and has often 
been referred to as a measure which is obsolete, does not reflect the 
reality and, more importantly, does not meet the needs of 
aboriginal people themselves.
<P>
	This act is so flawed that it should be changed, not merely 
amended, as the Minister of Indian Affairs wants to do. The 
minister is doing the opposite of what was recently recommended 
by the Erasmus-Dussault commission, which is to recognize that 
there is currently an injustice done to aboriginal people.
<P>
	I sat on two committees of the House. First, I was a member of 
the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, and I 
now sit on the Standing Committee on Health. When I was with the 
human resources committee, we toured all across Canada and 
visited a number of aboriginal communities.
<P>
	Following the testimony heard not only from aboriginal people 
themselves but also from people working with them, it is obvious 
to me that aboriginal people have much greater health problems 
than the rest of Canadians.
<P>
	Unfortunately, aboriginal people are still the victims of a great 
deal of prejudice. As the hon. member for Drummond knows, the 
Standing Committee on Health conducted many studies on the 
health of aboriginal people. It is rather sad and even disappointing 
to see that, in spite of these studies, and in spite of the fact that a 
commission of inquiry released a five-volume report on the 
condition of aboriginal people, we end up with a bill that only seeks 
to amend the Indian Act, this in a rather dreadful, embarrassing and 
nonsensical way.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	This bill runs counter to a lot of other legislation. Legislation 
must apply to everyone. This bill, however, will create two classes 
of natives: those to whom the old act applies and those to whom the 
new one applies. It is optional. It will concern only those bands of 
Indians or aboriginal groups that wish to submit to it, to take the 
goodies being held out as an enticement to them to give up their 
ancestral rights. This is something many Indians cannot and will 
not do.
<P>
	Despite the opposition of the very great majority of native 
people in Canada, the minister is deciding to go ahead with this 
bill. For what purpose? Obviously, to  give Canadians the 
impression, before the election, that he has done something. He 
dared to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8281"> 8281 </A></B>
<P>
change a statute that has existed for 100 years. What an 
extraordinary feat. But it is a bill that would not affect everyone, 
only those who wanted it to.
<P>
	Has anyone ever seen legislation that is optional like this? It is as 
though you were told you could not drive faster than 120 
kilometres an hour in Quebec; only those who drove under this 
limit would be affected by this legislation and the rest could decide 
to have other legislation apply to them.
<P>
	It is not an acceptable way of doing things. Some people might 
say that it is interesting, that all legislation should be like that, that 
people could then take advantage of their freedom of expression, 
their speed of adaptation we could call it. The law does not work 
like this. It is not my understanding that the law works like this.
<P>
	A piece of legislation must apply to everyone. What the minister 
wants to do is to blind Indians to the facts. He wants to show other 
Canadians that he has just done something important, when in 
reality, the proposed legislation, in most cases, would not be 
applied. It will change nothing. It will only give the impression that 
he has done something, a bit like the health minister, who boasted 
about his bill C-71. In the end, he has left himself so many options 
with this bill that it is not certain if it will be enforceable.
<P>
	I do not know whether or not it is parliamentary to say so, but I 
will take the chance. I call this hypocrisy. It is deceptive at the very 
least, it is misleading. Pretending to do something, when you know 
in advance that you will do nothing. This is not good government.
<P>
	It is time the Liberal government held an election, because it 
seems to be catching. All of the ministers want to do a little 
something to show that they can get something done before the 
election, before they change portfolios. If the Liberals do get back 
in, we know there is a risk of their changing portfolios. They can 
boast in their c.v. that they have changed a hundred year-old law. 
But history will say: this law did not change much, because it was 
obeyed only by those who wanted to. That is extraordinary.
<P>
	I have made light enough of this serious subject. It is serious: 
438,000 status Indians in Canada, and the minister wants to divide 
them into two categories: those who follow the new act and those 
who follow the old. There are already two types of Indians: there 
are the non-status Indians, 112,600 in 1991, and then there are the 
Metis, 139,491. There are 37,800 Inuit. That makes a total of 
720,000 individuals.
<P>
	In Quebec, the total is 69,300. Now, that represents 1 per cent of 
the total population of Quebec. A group must not be ignored just 
because it accounts for only 1 per cent of the total population. At 
the present time, the Department of Indian Affairs is maintaining a  
paternalistic system, one which keeps the Indians, the aboriginals 
of Canada, in a system of dependency. What the aboriginal nations 
are calling for is the opposite: more autonomy.
<P>
	You may perhaps reply that they want a bit too much, that this is 
a negotiation. We in the Bloc Quebecois have always said that they 
had to be given more.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The day after the commission of inquiry's report was tabled, the 
Bloc Quebecois even tabled a motion in the House urging the 
Liberal government to join it in saying that the First Nations are 
distinct nations. In other words, they should be given the means to 
promote their distinctiveness, to preserve their culture and 
especially to obtain the financial resources that will liberate them 
from this dependency so that at last they will become more 
autonomous and be able to manage their own health services.
<P>
	The suicide rate figures, which I will not mention here, are 
incredible. Which group in Canada has the highest suicide rate? 
Amerindians. Which group in Canada has the highest rate of 
alcoholism? Amerindians. Drug addiction? Amerindians. This is 
also the group that has the lowest life expectancy. Which group has 
the highest death rate? Amerindians again.
<P>
	The situation is so bad that Lise Bissonnette wrote the following 
in the newspaper <I>Le Devoir</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The story we read in the five volumes of this report-and I am referring to the 
commission of inquiry-is on the whole a story of domestic colonialism that was 
unique in its brutality and still is, at a time when racism and exploitation should be a 
thing of the past. The United Nations may have given Canada first prize for being the 
best place in the world to live, but the fact remains that all social indicators, when 
applied to the First Nations in this country, are in free fall, indicating a third world in 
the midst of abundance. From education to health care and employment, the rule is 
under-development, from coast to coast. According to the commissioners 
``aboriginal people are 90 times as likely as other Canadians to be without running 
water. On the reserves, more than 10,000 homes have no inside plumbing''. How can 
we read this and hundreds of other horror stories, in one of the most comfortable 
places on the planet, and keep on accepting awards?</BLOCKQUOTE>
Or doing what the minister of Indian affairs and the ministers 
opposite are doing when they tell us that we live in the best country 
in the world.
<P>
	It goes on to say that today, one child out of five in Canada lives 
below the poverty line. We treat aboriginal people this way and 
would have them believe we are living in the best country in the 
world, as the situation deteriorates.
<P>
	This afternoon, the Minister of Finance will tell us how he 
managed to speed up deficit reduction, either by cutting assistance 
to the needy, by cutting spending on health care and transfer 
payments to the provinces and by cutting health care to aboriginal 
people. Are we supposed to believe that everything is okay, that we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8282"> 8282 </A></B>
<P>
are  in good shape? No, Mr. Speaker. The aboriginal people, like 
the poor in Quebec and Canada, deserve a better deal.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
speak on Bill C-79, an act to permit certain modifications in the 
application of the Indian Act to bands that desire them.
<P>
	This bill is a superficial reform of the Indian Act, which is more 
than a century old. The amendments affect 45 of the 120 sections of 
the Indian Act, the following areas in particular: inheritance 
mechanisms, new band council powers, election procedures, 
offences, and criminal law on the reserve.
<P>
	In order to get around the First Nations' general opposition to 
any changes to the Indian Act, the Department of Indian Affairs has 
decided to make the act optional, and has made far fewer changes 
to the act than it had initially planned when it undertook the reform.
<P>
	Its optional nature means that only those aboriginal nations so 
requesting will be governed by this new act; the others will remain 
under the unmodified act.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Let me tell you, we are opposed to this, for Canada is going back 
to its colonial past with Bill C-49. The Indian Act was intended to 
assimilate the Indians. In attempting to modify this legislation 
from another century, instead of adopting a new approach, the 
government is not making a clean break with the paternalistic 
policy that prevailed when the Indian Act was passed.
<P>
	A new constructive approach to the First Nations is described in 
the report of the Erasmus-Dussault royal commission on aboriginal 
peoples, which stresses the outmoded and backward nature of the 
Indian Act. In their report, the commissioners ruled out any 
amendment to the Indian Act as a way to establish a new 
relationship between natives and non-natives.
<P>
	In short, in changing the Indian Act, the minister is going the 
wrong way. He is merely proposing cosmetic changes to this 
outdated and paternalistic bill, which native peoples reject.
<P>
	In December 1993, just before Bill C-79 was tabled in the 
House, the Bloc Quebecois received letters from 542 native 
communities out of some 610 opposed to Bill C-79. In other words, 
some 85 per cent of the First Nations categorically reject the 
procedure followed by the minister in drafting this bill.
<P>
	It affects the interests and the rights of the First Nations in 
Quebec and Canada. In fact, these are the only communities 
affected. How can the government proceed when its bill is being 
opposed by the vast majority of those affected? In this time of 
budget cutbacks, should the government not put its limited 
resources into projects supported by the communities concerned? 
Who is the minister working for?
<P>
	The minister of Indian affairs claims to have the support of the 
First Nations. Who does he mean? The minister has not revealed 
the results of his so-called consultations. He did not show clearly 
who supported his initiative. When we ask the minister who is 
involved, which communities support his bill, he says it is none of 
our business. If the minister is working on behalf of particular 
groups, he should be honest enough to tell the public who is 
involved.
<P>
	The communities rejecting Bill C-79 did so publicly. We have in 
our offices letters signed by each of the organizations that object to 
the bill and the consultation process it stems from. This strong 
opposition, from more than 85 per cent of aboriginal communities 
in Quebec and Canada, shows that the minister's so-called support 
can only be marginal. This kind of behaviour makes no sense.
<P>
	Very few of the promises made to the aboriginal peoples by the 
Liberal Party of Canada were kept once the election was won. In 
fact, even the aboriginal people involved in developing the election 
platform outlined in the red book felt the need to publicly 
dissociate themselves from the Liberal Party of Canada after 
witnessing this government's attitude and behaviour toward the 
First Nations once in office.
<P>
	In connection with Bill C-79, there is no mention anywhere in 
the seven pages of promises relating to the aboriginal peoples in the 
red book of any amendment to the Indian Act. Where does this 
initiative come from? While there is no mention of it, the Minister 
of Indian Affairs and the Prime Minister managed to break red 
book promises by preparing, without any real consultation, a bill 
dealing specifically with aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	Let me quote the Liberal Party of Canada's red book, which 
states at page 98: ``A Liberal government will develop a more 
comprehensive process for consultation between federal ministers 
and aboriginal representatives with respect to decision making that 
directly affect First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples''.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Is sending four letters to the Assembly of First Nations over a 
two-year period the Liberal Party of Canada's idea of a wider 
consultation? If this is the case, interest groups in Quebec and in 
Canada should be wary if a Liberal government talks about 
consulting them. There is no doubt in the Bloc Quebecois' mind 
that the Liberal government is acting in an absurd manner with Bill 
C-79.
<P>
	This government unilaterally developed, without any serious 
consultations, a bill which directly concerns aboriginal people. 
Here is another quote found on page 98 of the Liberal Party of 
Canada's red book: ``It does not make sense for the federal 
government to be unilaterally making policy or budgetary deci-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8283"> 8283 </A></B>
<P>
sions that affect the lives of aboriginal people, without their 
involvement''.
<P>
	The fact is that this government ignored the very basis of its 
commitments to aboriginal people. On page 98, the Liberals speak 
of a ``new partnership'' and of ``mutual respect''; on that same 
page 98, they say: ``A Liberal government will-a new partnership 
with aboriginal people that is based on-participation in the 
decision-making process''. All these illusions in the red book left a 
bad taste in the mouths of aboriginal people. The few letters 
received by the First Nations by way of consultation were simply 
meant to associate them with a bill whose basic thrust they could 
not influence.
<P>
	We have no choice but to say that the term ``consultation'' does 
not mean the same thing to the Bloc Quebecois that it does to the 
government. The Bloc Quebecois considers consultation to be 
more than just four letters to native communities and their 
representatives, the results of which the minister of Indian affairs 
refuses to divulge. Consultation involves two parties getting 
together to discuss and consider the consequences of a new law. No 
formal meeting of the government and the Assembly of First 
Nations was ever held on the changes to the Indian Act.
<P>
	It would be more complex than simply drafting the legislation in 
camera, but the solutions that would have come from such a 
process would last longer.
<P>
	Is this government going against the conclusions of the Penner 
parliamentary committee? I regret I have only one minute left, 
because I still have some things to say.
<P>
	In conclusion, by refusing to consult properly, the government 
has come up with a superficial bill that will resolve no basic 
problems and that will therefore fail to satisfy the vast majority of 
the First Nations involved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate today in this debate on Bill 
C-79, an act to amend the Indian Act. I cannot say, however, that I 
am too proud of what this government has accomplished on the 
Indian issue since taking office three and a half years ago.
<P>
	Perhaps three and a half years is nothing in the history of Indians 
in Canada, but it shows this Liberal government's blatant lack of 
vision. A bill is introduced, which purports to deal with rather 
important issues: distribution of estates, new powers for band 
councils, election procedures, contraventions and criminal law on 
reserves.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in view of what I would call generalized 
opposition-more than 500 aboriginal communities told the 
government, and sent us copies of their letters, that they did not 
want this bill-I think we must realize one thing, which is true in 
Quebec as well as in Canada.
<P>
	In the past, we have not always treated aboriginal people, the 
natives, like adults, as equals. And instead of changing this 
attitude, the minister is perpetuating it. Imagine what impact 
making this act optional will have, with some communities coming 
under the it, and others not.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	We can easily imagine that it will be a carrot and stick situation, 
where special advantages will be used as incentives to get some 
communities to agree with the optional modification of the act. 
This will result in a proliferation of unacceptable situations 
condemned previously, by the Auditor General of Canada among 
others, concerning allocation of funds, that is to say how federal 
government funds are allocated to and used by aboriginal people.
<P>
	One really has to wonder what prompted the minister to make 
such a decision. Why not have gone to the bottom of the issue like 
the Erasmus-Dussault royal commission did in a thorough 
analysis? One may not agree with all the recommendations in this 
report, but the commission conducted a major exercise and took a 
look at the overall situation. Why does the minister come up with a 
bill which, to me, is a cosmetic, pre-election measure?
<P>
	The government wants to be able to campaign and say: ``We 
passed an act amending the Indian Act. We had said we would do it 
and we did it''. All these cosmetic changes before an election are 
nice, but we are not elected for that purpose.
<P>
	We are elected, ultimately, to truly fulfil the commitments made 
during the election campaign, so as to be credible as a government. 
In this case as in many others, the current Liberal government is 
launching into what could be called a coverup operation. It is like 
putting a bit of paint on an old car to hide the rust for a while, for 
the duration of the election campaign, before it will resurface 
again.
<P>
	The plight of Canada's Indians is much more serious. Let me 
read the Liberal Party's position, as stated in the red book. It says: 
``A Liberal government will develop a more comprehensive 
process for consultation between federal ministers and aboriginal 
representatives with respect to decision-making that directly 
affects First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples''. There are 542 
communities opposed to Bill C-79, that is 85 per cent of the total 
number. Something is wrong somewhere. It does not make sense. 
The federal government's decision is even insulting for aboriginal 
communities.
<P>
	There is another line in the red book which is even smoother 
when we read it today. It says: ``It does not make sense for the 
federal government to be unilaterally making policy or budgetary 
decisions that affect the lives of aboriginal people, without their 
involvement''. Yet, the government introduced a bill which will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8284"> 8284 </A></B>
<P>
have major policy and budgetary consequences, partly because of 
its  optional nature, without the support of aboriginal communities.
<P>
	If I were a member of an aboriginal community, I would be even 
more stunned by the way the Government of Canada is treating 
them. Let us not forget that the Indian Act was based on the same 
principle, the same structure as the apartheid legislation, in South 
Africa. It stems from the great wisdom of the British Empire, many 
years ago. Since then, we never went to the bottom of the issue to 
really find out how to solve the problems relating to aboriginal 
communities and their rights, and to also find out how to deal with 
them.
<P>
	Today, the Liberal government has placed us in a sad situation. If 
this bill is passed by Parliament, native peoples will be able to say 
once again that the government has decided to offload the problem, 
as the member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead would say, to 
ignore the facts.
<P>
	If I were a native person, I would be rather puzzled. First of all, I 
would wonder why the Government of Canada, which is supposed 
to be my defender, which is so described in the bill, is passing such 
bills, when the only people to truly come to our defence are 
Quebec's sovereignists. What is going on in this Parliament that 
things have come to this?
<P>
	One answer is that, in the past few years, Quebec has begun 
treating native communities with the respect they deserve. We 
began by recognizing their status as a nation, and then went on to 
other areas that have not always been easy, but we are still trying to 
establish a relationship that is evolving slowly through 
negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	It is not just a matter of keeping an election promise by passing a 
bill, so that during the election campaign they can say: ``You see, 
we kept this promise, the eighty-second or eighty-third, increasing 
our score to 82 or 83 per cent''.
<P>
	Quantitative results like these are not what the people of Quebec 
and of Canada, what native peoples expect from their government. 
What they want is to get to the bottom of things, because there are 
social problems, important economic problems resulting from the 
failure of the Canadian government to take action on this issue for 
several decades. This government, which announced interesting 
things in its red book, has been completely unable to deliver the 
goods.
<P>
	Today, on the eve of an election campaign, it confronts us with a 
completely unacceptable bill. I urge the members of the majority to 
go back and consult the 542 communities who wrote to tell us that 
they did not want to see the bill passed, that they wanted it thrown 
out. They gave us the reasons they did not want to see it passed.
<P>
	Each of you in the Liberal majority, in your respective ridings, 
before the election campaign begins, during the period when the 
bill is being studied in committee, should go to see your 
communities and ask them the reasons they find the bill 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I am certain that, when you come back from this consultation, 
you will make sure that your government at least kills this bill, or 
has the courage to propose a bill that completely transforms the 
relationship with natives within Canada, so that this major problem 
can be eliminated. A solution must be found to this problem, which 
is a stain on the quality of democratic life in this country, because 
Bill C-79 is no solution.
<P>
	I will close by saying that it is essential that any bill that speaks 
about relations with native peoples must include as a basic 
principle that they be treated like adults and that their rights be 
respected. It is for this reason that the Bloc Quebecois is coming to 
their defence against this bill, which is unfair.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I now recognize the hon. 
member for Compton-Stanstead-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I always forget the first 
part of the riding's name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you are perhaps assuming the outcome of the 
next election, which is why you designate me with the name 
Compton-Stanstead. In fact, after the next campaign, my riding, 
which has been altered considerably and separated from Mégantic, 
will be called Compton-Stanstead.
<P>
	I see you therefore as a visionary, who already acknowledges not 
only that I will be re-elected in the riding of Compton-Stanstead, 
but that the Bloc Quebecois will be here in full force after the next 
election for its well known purpose of defending the interests of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	My colleague, who wants to hear nothing but the truth, is 
perfectly right, and that is what I am going to try to do in the next 
few minutes. I am going to try to explain what the truth is in 
connection with Bill C-79.
<P>
	First of all, if I may, I will take a few moments of my time to 
congratulate my colleague, whose performance as Indian affairs 
critic is recognized by all those involved in this question, which is 
such a touchy one and so important, not only for the future of the 
aboriginal communities, but for the future of our respective 
communities, I would say, that is the people of Quebec and the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	We cannot treat this question lightly, as the Liberal government 
has already done for decades, ever since Canada began, I would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8285"> 8285 </A></B>
<P>
say, by denying reality. In recent years, we have witnessed a study 
without precedent in  this area, and I would say without precedent 
anywhere in government activity.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I am of course referring to the Erasmus-Dussault report which 
was tabled only a few months ago. This study took years to 
complete. It thoroughly examined aboriginal issues and proposed a 
comprehensive plan in its recommendations. That was and still is 
what made the Erasmus-Dussault report unique, that it proposed a 
comprehensive plan to deal with aboriginal issues.
<P>
	I would also like to say that in addition to the hon. member for 
Saint-Jean who has done and still does an excellent job in this 
respect, the Government of Quebec has also made an effort in the 
past to understand the expectations and demands of the First 
Nations in Quebec. I am referring to the government of former 
Premier René Lévesque.
<P>
	This was the first government in North America to recognize the 
First Nations for what they were, peoples who had and have a 
different culture, who want to develop this culture as part of their 
lives, not only for the benefit of their own communities but also for 
the benefit of the other communities around them. In Quebec we 
were the first, as a people and as a government, to recognize that 
fact. I think that is an important point.
<P>
	We should also remember, setting all political considerations 
aside, that the Quebec government, the Liberal government under 
Robert Bourassa in the 1970s, was also the first government to 
negotiate an agreement with a First Nation, with the Inuit in 
Northern Quebec on the development of James Bay, an agreement 
which although not perfect, set a historical precedent. As a result, a 
First Nation was considered a legitimate party, with the authority to 
decide on behalf of its people, which led to the James Bay 
agreement, an agreement which has been quoted as an example on 
many occasions in the past and still is today.
<P>
	I mentioned these two positions to point out that as a people, we 
may wish to consolidate our future. As a people, we may wish to 
develop our potential while respecting those who live around us. 
This is the example that should be taken from the earlier positions 
of the Government of Quebec in the case of native communities.
<P>
	What we have before us looks more like a botch. In other words, 
following the conclusion of the Erasmus-Dussault commission, 
which cost over $50 million in tax money and produced a report of 
thousands of pages including hundreds of recommendations 
proposing a comprehensive plan, the Liberal government arrives 
with a bungled proposal on the eve of an election. This government 
does not want to go into another election without being able to say 
it has done something for the native population. Thus we have Bill  
C-79, which uses a piecemeal approach to try to resolve a number 
of problems.
<P>
	This is not the way to go about it, and I consider it almost an 
insult to the native peoples. This is not the way to resolve the 
government's problems with the native peoples. It must first 
recognize their existence and the importance of the 
Erasmus-Dussault report and the riches it has to offer and then sit 
down with these communities to define their future.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	This is the only logical and intelligent way to proceed in this 
matter as in all matters. This is what my colleague from Saint-Jean 
is proposing on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	We will not agree to support a bill that does not even start to 
honourably address the claims of the aboriginal nations. The 
government and its minister must get into the habit of sitting down 
and talking to people. They must sit down with the native groups, 
see what they and their representatives want, and how they would 
like the necessary changes in the relations between the federal 
government and the communities to be planned.
<P>
	Is the hon. member of Saint-Jean, who has convinced his 
colleagues, including myself, of the validity of this proposal, now 
alone? Are we the only ones to take this view of resolving the 
problems of aboriginal communities? No.
<P>
	I need not repeat what my colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup mentioned earlier. We all know 
that the Liberal members of this House can be hard of hearing, to 
say the least, and have a hard time understanding sometimes, which 
means that we have to repeat the same things over and over if we 
want to at least be heard by this government and try to get our point 
across.
<P>
	On this issue, it is important to remind the House that 542 of the 
610 aboriginal communities, not only in Quebec but across 
Canada, oppose this bill; 85 per cent of the First Nations 
categorically reject the proposal put forward by the minister in 
terms of process.
<P>
	I will close on this last remark I just made: 85 per cent of 
aboriginal communities, of the First Nations have rejected the 
process put forward by the minister. Be that as it may, the minister, 
and his government, stubbornly want to press on. The minister and 
his government are going to botch this bill purely for electoral 
reasons, in order to be able to claim during the campaign that they 
have started working on the aboriginal issue. We condemn this 
today and will continue to condemn it during the next election 
campaign.

	It is worth noting this bill constitutes the first effort in 50 years 
to redefine the relationship between the Canadian public and the 
Canadian government in the nuclear industry. The fact that this is 
the first effort in 50 years is enough reason for Reformers to at least 
give qualified support to the legislation. We are at least applauding 
the effort that has been put forward. However, I insist on using the 
term qualified because the bill has a lot of shortcomings.
<P>
	The bill's shortcomings were identified both at committee and at 
report stage. Those shortcomings remain in the bill because as 
usual the Liberal government did not give serious consideration to 
the proposals put forward by Bloc and Reform members in 
opposition. The suggestions put forward by my colleague from the 
Bloc were well reasoned and well intended proposals and were very 
similar to those advanced by my colleague, the member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan. Both groups of amendments would have 
enhanced the transparency of the activities within the Canadian 
nuclear industry.
<P>
	I will briefly discuss the proposals and why they were found to 
be unacceptable. The proposals were intended to enhance the 
accountability of the nuclear industry to the Canadian people and to 
make those issues understandable by people across the country and 
members across the way. I do not understand why the Liberals have 
such a problem with the concept of accountability, but it is 
certainly understandable when we look at the other issues that have 
been before the House, for example the GST, Airbus and the Krever 
inquiry. But that does not make it any better than in this instance.
<P>
	The issues of transparency and accountability are very central to 
this bill and to the desires of Canadians, at least from what we 
heard from the witnesses in committee. For years the nuclear 
industry in Canada has functioned with little public scrutiny, little 
transparency and virtual immunity or impunity, depending on your 
point of view. In in either characterization there is a sense among 
the population of Canada that nuclear safety has not rated as a 
priority for this and previous Liberal and Tory governments. The 
situation has not been addressed by Bill C-23, which is regrettable 
because the government had the opportunity to do so in this bill.
<P>
	To illustrate the bill's shortcomings let us look at the present 
issue of nuclear safety through the lens of nuclear waste disposal. 
This is a matter I will continually refer to. In May 1995 and 
November 1996 the auditor general's report touched on the fact 
that the clean-up of low and high level radioactive waste would 
cost billions. Yet the auditor general noted that the federal 
government's share of the clean-up did not constitute parts of its 
budget forecast and expenditures. The auditor general indicated 
that this lack of financial acknowledgement by the federal 
government constitutes a serious unfunded liability which changes 
the accuracy of the government's reported financial position.
<P>
	My friends across the way will argue, as the natural resources 
minister did on November 26, 1996, that the government takes the 
health related concerns of nuclear waste disposal very seriously. 
But the reality and the lack of a co-ordinated action by this 
government speak volumes about the neglect and the problems 
associated with nuclear waste. In any event, the auditor general 
reported that the costs associated with cleaning up contaminated 
federal sites was being ignored by the federal government. This 
should highlight for Canadians the inadequate accounting 
procedure by the federal government and represents a lack of 
responsibility by the Liberals to the taxpaying public.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	When we put that alongside recent efforts by the Liberal 
government to delay and possibly scrap their  promise to dispose of 
low level radioactive waste near the town of Deep River, Canadians 
can appreciate that this government is not serious about addressing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8287"> 8287 </A></B>
<P>
the problems and research solutions needed in the area of nuclear 
waste disposal.
<P>
	In short, the government will not recognize the environmental 
disaster in its own backyard or the potential costs associated with 
its clean-up. It is reneging on its promise to the people of Deep 
River and closing R and D facilities all because it says it does not 
have enough money to pay for services in these areas. However, I 
want to remind the Canadian public and the Liberals that they have 
no problem coughing up $1.5 billion of Canadian taxpayer money 
to lend to the Chinese government. The Liberals can do this so the 
current government of China could build CANDU reactors.
<P>
	Bill C-23 does increase the regulatory burden already present 
within the nuclear industry. The nuclear safety and control act 
replaces the Atomic Energy Control Act with a new regulatory 
framework for the nuclear energy industry.
<P>
	The natural resources ministers has stated that the bill is 
intended to modernize nuclear regulations and eliminate overlap 
with provincial regulatory agencies. This is something that has not 
been done in 50 years.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-23, 
an act to establish the Canadian nuclear safety commission and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I would like to go back by 
way of background some 50 years ago. When the atomic age 
started in Canada we were in the throes of the second world war. 
Scientists who discovered nuclear  fission realized its tremendous 
potential as a weapon if controlled and its potential to destroy the 
world if uncontrolled.
<P>
	Since then nuclear experiments and facilities were given the 
highest possible security classification. The absolute necessity for 
secrecy has haunted and been part of the atomic and nuclear energy 
field ever since. Certainly that same situation does not exist today 
in Canada. Canada has long since rejected the participation in the 
production of nuclear war machinery or issues of war production 
and therefore should have also rejected the veil of secrecy that 
surrounds the production of nuclear energy in Canada.
<P>
	Canada's nuclear role begins with the building of the research 
facility at Chalk River, Ontario and, oddly enough, the recent 
closing of a research facility in Chalk River might also herald the 
end of Canada's nuclear age.
<P>
	All too often the activities at facilities under the administration 
of AECL are shrouded in secrecy. I agree that the public's right to 
know must be tempered with considerations of national security, 
but the concerns of national security certainly are not as paramount 
as they were some 50 years ago.
<P>
	Yet this has meant that government is given a ready made excuse 
which it can use to limit Canadians' access to information where 
matters of atomic energy are concerned. Bill C-23 could have 
begun to diffuse some of the public apprehension and 
misunderstanding which has plagued activity within the Canadian 
nuclear industry for the past 50 years.
<P>
	Again, I suggest to all members that there is a need to keep the 
public informed on issues where nuclear safety and energy are 
concerned.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Given what has been going on at AECL facilities across Canada 
in recent months, public openness by the government is sorely 
needed.
<P>
	For example, Canadians should be told about the closure of the 
Chalk River superconducting cyclotron facility. Canadians should 
know that this research facility was closed down by the Liberal 
government's Minister of Natural Resources on January 31, 1997 at 
11 a.m.
<P>
	The Liberals would not even wait for this House to resume 
sitting so that the closure could be brought forward for discussion. I 
am sickened that even with the member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke sitting in the Liberal caucus 
could not stop the closure.
<P>
	Then again, perhaps the closure of TASCC was his reward for 
voting against the government's gun control bill, Bill C-68. It did 
not matter that hundreds of scientists from around the world, 
including three Nobel laureates, pleaded with the natural resources 
minister back in October to keep this research facility open.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8288"> 8288 </A></B>
<P>
	I point out for the benefit of those listening that Canadian 
taxpayers spent $70 million on building this facility and now it 
has been turned off. Now that it has been closed it is worth 
absolutely nothing. In addition, the research scientists who worked 
at the facility are preparing to move to the United States where 
evidently research and development is taken more seriously.
<P>
	The former employees of TASCC have indicated that equipment 
from Chalk River may find its way into the Brookhaven Institute in 
the United States.
<P>
	Reformers and Canadians can speculate on the myopic vision of 
the government's commitment to research and development 
initiatives in Canada. However, the question still remains why the 
Liberals closed this facility.
<P>
	They will argue that it was a question of priorities and that the 
government could not find the money. Yet because the federal 
government could not come up with $3 million in operating costs, 
it effectively threw away $70 million. This was done even though 
companies such as Spar Aerospace of Canada had been funding 
increasing amounts of research efforts at TASCC with private 
funds. Eventually this would have seen the facility function 
without any tax dollars.
<P>
	However, let us look at the government's priority and 
commitment in spending in general. The TASCC facility needed $3 
million in operating grants which would have allowed it to remain 
open. The government claims it did not have the money. Yet this is 
the same government that spent an estimated $20 million on 
Canadian flag giveaways, $100 million toward the propaganda 
office in Montreal, $87 million in a loan to the financially sound 
and profitable Bombardier of Montreal. Sadly, the Liberals also 
had $3 million and climbing of taxpayer money to apologize to 
former Prime Minister Mulroney and pay his lawyers. The Liberals 
will probably need to waste another billion dollars because of their 
incompetence and bungling on the Pearson airport deal.
<P>
	Perhaps it is not fair to my colleagues across the way to highlight 
wasted tax dollars on those projects. No doubt Liberal members 
will want to point out that those expenses are unrelated to the 
workings of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited or, for that matter, 
the nuclear safety commission which is what Bill C-23 seeks to 
establish.
<P>
	The members across the way want Canadians to believe that the 
Liberal commitment to R and D is well in line with red book 
promises.
<P>
	In any event, the real blow to the Canadian taxpayer is in the area 
of prioritised research and development spending at AECL.
<P>
	Just before Christmas the government announced the sale of 
CANDU technology to the Chinese government. In order to get the 
deal signed, the Government of Canada committed to lend the 
Chinese government $1.5 billion financed on the backs of 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The government was willing to gamble over $1.5 billion but 
could not come up with a minuscule fraction of that, $3 million, in 
order to keep the TASCC project at Chalk River going.
<P>
	Again, the perception of secrecy surrounds these and other 
projects and continues to remain part of the nuclear energy scene. 
This perception, perhaps more than any other, has been responsible 
for the public's lack of knowledge and apprehension about nuclear 
matters. However, the byproduct of any nuclear endeavour is the 
radioactive waste that results.
<P>
	Radioactive contamination is the other big consideration 
affecting the nuclear industry today and tomorrow. This poses a 
problem of considerable magnitude for this government because 
not only do we mine and export uranium, we burn it in our reactors 
as well.
<P>
	Canada is one of the world's leading producers of uranium and 
therefore one of the leading producers of uranium tailings. This is 
the residue associated with uranium mining. The government has 
recognized this and decided that any legislative response must 
ensure that uranium mining and refinement industries are subject to 
government controls and laws such as those in Bill C-23.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Clearly Canada has great technological expertise in the nuclear 
industry generally and specifically in the construction of nuclear 
reactors. This should be exploited but not at the expense of other 
problem areas which must be addressed and controlled.
<P>
	Again I want to stress to the Liberal members across the way that 
Bill C-23 falls short in its response to the issue of radioactive 
waste, particularly high level waste.
<P>
	The high level waste disposal problem is exacerbated by the 
rumoured disposal of plutonium from Russia and American nuclear 
weapons which are to be destroyed. Here again Canada has 
expertise and can help the world situation. Yet it can only do so if 
the Canadian public knows what is going on and understands the 
risks and agrees with the plan of action.
<P>
	This bill does nothing which would permit an agency to educate 
or inform the Canadian public on the consequences or risks 
associated with burning plutonium in a Canadian reactor.
<P>
	No doubt something like Bill C-23 is needed. Reformers feel this 
bill does not adequately address two key areas. The first is the 
question of public education. The Canadian public has a right to 
know what is going on and to help decide what Canada should or 
should not be doing in the nuclear field.
<P>
	Canadians need access to more facts than they have had in the 
past. Regrettably, the amendments put forward by my colleague 
from Nanaimo-Cowichan were  not accepted. They would have 
addressed the issue of public awareness by assigning some respon-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8289"> 8289 </A></B>
<P>
sibility for public education information to the Canadian Nuclear 
Safety Commission.
<P>
	The second area of concern inadequately addressed by Bill C-23 
is the removal of ministerial responsibility for promoting nuclear 
safety. If the Minister of Natural Resources is responsible for the 
promotion of the nuclear industry, and that in itself is a question, 
she must also be responsible for all aspects of nuclear safety.
<P>
	Members of the opposition put forward motions that would have 
addressed the short circuiting of ministerial responsibility, but the 
government has chosen to ignore them.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, my Reform colleagues and I will be 
supporting the bill at third reading. In doing so, we point out for 
members on both sides of the House that Bill C-23 is the first effort 
in 50 years at redefining the relationship between public and the 
nuclear industry within Canada.
<P>
	Therefore Bill C-23 constitutes only the first tentative steps in 
the right direction. However, there is still an unfulfilled expectation 
that the government would put measures in place that would open 
up the nuclear industry to greater public scrutiny.
<P>
	It was also hoped that the Nuclear Safety Commission, tasked 
with providing information to the public, would also be transparent 
in its future dealings. Sadly, this will not be a benefit resulting from 
Bill C-23.
<P>
	In closing, I stress to the Canadian public that Reform MPs 
would correct many of the deficiencies of Bill C-23 if allowed to do 
so. Indeed, we may very well be given that opportunity after the 
next election.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House approve in general the budgetary policy of the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am tabling the budget documents, 
including notices of ways and means motions. The details of the 
measures are contained in the documents. I am asking that an order 
of the day be designated for consideration of these motions.
<P>
	Pursuant to an order of this House, I will introduce today a bill 
seeking borrowing authority for the 1997-98 fiscal year. I am also 
announcing that the government will, at the first opportunity, table 
bills to implement the other measures announced in this budget, as 
soon as the implementation of these measures will require such 
legislation.
<P>
	Before beginning, let me take this opportunity on behalf of the 
Prime Minister and myself to express our appreciation to the 
various committees of caucus and of this House, including the 
Standing Committee on Finance, for all the work they have done 
leading up to this budget, the fourth one of our government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As in budgets past, cabinet ministers in each of their departments 
have had to wrestle with difficult choices. The members of caucus 
have been on the front lines of the debate in each of their ridings. 
We are deeply indebted and very grateful to them.
<P>
	Last but most important, let me say how much we owe to the 
unprecedented numbers of Canadians who have come forward to 
offer their views and their ideas to us. They have responded with 
enthusiasm and energy to the opening up of the process of budget 
making, and the country is much the better for it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our goal from the beginning has been clear: to strengthen the 
Canadian economy so that it creates more jobs; to strengthen 
Canadian society by preserving the programs that sustain the 
well-being of our people; in short, our goal has been to restore the 
confidence of Canadians in their future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8290"> 8290 </A></B>
<P>
	When we took office, Canadians were aware of the many 
challenges we as a people faced and of the need, therefore, for 
broad and deep reform. They did not want tinkering. They sought 
lasting solutions. They wanted their government to implement a 
plan-and to stick to it. This, we have done in our first three 
budgets, and this, we are continuing to do in this budget.
<P>
	As a country, we have had to make some difficult decisions. The 
adjustment has not been easy. But today, we are well down the road 
to success. Our task now is to complete the journey.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our purpose today is twofold. It is to report to the Canadian 
people on progress made and it is to set out the further steps that lie 
before us. This budget will show that our effort to restore health to 
the nation's finances is very clearly on track and that we are staying 
the course of deficit reduction.
<P>
	This is a budget that will impose no new taxes on Canadians. It is 
a budget that in selected areas will reduce them. It is a budget 
without further cuts to government programs. It is a budget that 
will reinforce our plan for economic growth for jobs in the 
immediate and in the long term. It is a budget that will announce 
important investments in key priority areas for Canadians, 
post-secondary education, medicare and children.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Finally, it is a budget that will lay out the direction for the years 
that lie beyond, for our concern cannot only be to address the 
remainder of this government's mandate; we must as well prepare 
Canada for a new century.
<P>
	Since the deep recession of the early 1990s, Canada's economic 
recovery has not been as strong as any one of us would have liked. 
There can be no more visible sign of this than an unemployment 
rate that is still unacceptably high. But today our economy is 
growing and strengthening.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Short-term interest rates are lower than they have been in close 
to 35 years. Inflation remains under firm control. Our merchandise 
trade balance-exports over imports-set a record surplus in 1996. 
Our current account moved into the black for the first time in 12 
years. This means that more of the income generated in Canada, 
stays in Canada, rather than being sent abroad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The renewed confidence in our economy has not happened by 
accident. It has come about because of the efforts of millions of 
Canadians, each in their own way, striving for a better future. It has 
happened because governments finally caught up with what 
Canadians have long realized, that chronic deficits and runaway 
debt had become an obstacle to jobs.
<P>
	It is no exaggeration to state that only four short years ago the 
economic future of our country was at risk. A vicious circle had set 
in. Higher deficits pushed interest rates up. Higher interest rates 
weakened the economy and hurt job creation. The weaker economy 
and high interest rates, in turn, pushed the deficit up even further. 
Canadians knew that this vicious circle had to be broken and we 
have broken it. That we chose to do so was not a question of 
ideology; it was a matter of necessity.
<P>
	In 1993-94 the deficit had risen to $42 billion, approximately 6 
per cent of GDP. During the 1993 election campaign we committed 
that it would be reduced to 3 per cent of GDP or $24.3 billion by 
this current year.
<P>
	I cannot today give a definitive deficit number for 1996-97. We 
still need to receive the results for January, February and March. 
That being said, it is now clear that our target will be bettered.
<P>
	Indeed even after including this budget's new spending, we can 
safely say that the deficit for 1996-97 will be no higher than $19 
billion. This is more than $5 billion lower than our target. It is 
about $9.5 billion below the previous year. It is the largest year 
over year decline ever in Canadian history.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We can safely say that the deficit for 1996-97 will be no higher 
than $19 billion, that is $9.5 billion below the previous year. It is 
the largest year-over-year decline ever.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, we are also clearly on track to meeting our deficit 
targets for the following two years-2 per cent of GDP for 
1997-98, and 1 per cent for 1998-99.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I know that a good number of private sector forecasters are 
saying that we will do much better than this, including some public 
sector forecasters. I hope they are right. They may very well be. We 
have always said that our targets were not the most we would do 
but the least we could do.
<P>
	Let me explain. Most forecasters assume that the future will 
enfold without surprises. Ministers of finance do not have that 
luxury. The world rarely behaves as predicted. The bond market 
changes its mind every single day. Ministers of finance, on the 
other hand, must set out a track on which people can rely. That is 
why, first of all, we have built into our deficit targets a $3 billion 
contingency reserve to handle unforeseen developments. We have 
always said we would not spend this reserve and we have not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8291"> 8291 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, having taken the consensus forecast of the private sector 
as our base, we have built a further prudence factor into our 
assumptions with respect to interest rates and growth.
<P>
	The result of this approach, in addition to the measures taken to 
reduce spending, has been restored credibility in financial markets, 
and a rising level of confidence in Canada's economic future. That 
this has led us to doing better than our targets is hardly reason to 
change our methodology. It is in fact a reason to stick with it, and 
we will.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For 1998-99, the government's deficit target is $9 billion, an 
amount that the government will be able to finance internally, that 
is to say without any net new borrowing from financial markets.
<P>
	International comparisons are important in this highly 
competitive world. The comparison arising out of new borrowing 
requirements is one of which we can be particularly proud. This is 
the way many countries-the United States, Germany and Japan, 
for example-measure their deficits. According to this measure, by 
1998-99, Canada is expected to have a small surplus-and the best 
financial record of any of the seven largest industrialized countries. 
This is a turnaround of unprecedented proportions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me reiterate what we have said in each of our previous 
budgets. We will balance the books. We will do so by maintaining 
our pace: deliberate, measured and responsible. We will maintain 
our approach of two year rolling targets. And we will not alter 
course. Moreover, we will meet our objectives, as in the past, by 
focusing on getting spending right, not by raising taxes.
<P>
	The fact is that by 1998-99, government spending on everything 
but the debt will have been reduced from $120 billion in 1993-94 to 
$103.5 billion. This is $2 billion less than was projected last year.
<P>
	I have spoken thus far about the deficit, about spending, about 
our borrowing requirements. But the most important measure of 
the financial health of a country ultimately is its ability to manage 
its debt. This ability is measured by what is called the debt to GDP 
ratio.
<P>
	Over the past two decades, this ratio has been rising relentlessly. 
In other words, the debt of Canada's government has been rising 
faster than the income of the country. This had to be stopped. And 
we are stopping it. Our economy will soon be growing faster than 
our debt. More and more of each revenue dollar will go to pay for 
services that Canadians need rather than to pay bondholders. Our 
goal is to put the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward 
track. It is a goal that for the first time in over 20 years is now 
within reach.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear that on virtually every financial indicator, Canada is 
doing well. Fine. The question is, what does this have to do with 
jobs? The answer is everything.
<P>
	The recovery in our financial health has caused the interest rate 
picture in Canada to improve dramatically. This is crucial for job 
creation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The turnaround in Canada's short term interest rates has been 
historic. In the past two years, they have come down by almost five 
and a half percentage points. But what is even more significant is 
that for the past 20 years short term rates in Canada have averaged 
two percentage points higher than those in the United States. 
However, as we speak today, they are about two and a quarter 
percentage points lower.
<P>
	This dramatic reversal in our favour is not a matter of luck. The 
new found freedom to make our own decisions can only be 
explained by the discipline in the country's financial management 
and the new confidence and credibility this has created.
<P>
	While we know from history that it takes time for lower interest 
rates to stimulate the creation of jobs, we also know that today this 
process is taking hold. In the last four months 85,000 new jobs have 
been created by the private sector. It is equally significant that 
almost all of these jobs have been full time.
<P>
	Those sectors of the economy that respond the most quickly to 
lower interest rates are growing strongly. Housing resales have 
reached record levels and the sale of consumer goods is up 
substantially. Indeed, there is a consensus, both domestically and 
internationally, that none of the seven major industrial countries 
will do better than Canada in 1997. As a result, most Canadian 
forecasters are projecting that employment will increase by 
between 300,000 and 350,000 jobs during the course of this year.
<P>
	All this being said, while the outlook is brighter, it is by no 
means bright enough. Those who are unemployed certainly know 
that. So too do those who have jobs but worry they might lose 
them. So too do families that are concerned about what the future 
may hold for their children.
<P>
	Economists can talk about globalization. They can talk about 
technical change in the abstract all they want, but governments 
must not. We cannot treat the restructuring that we are all living 
through as if it were some mechanical concept of academic interest 
only. It is a phenomenon with very real human consequences. As 
economies restructure, as governments are forced to do so as well, 
we must never lose sight of the impact this is having on hundreds of 
communities and on many thousands of families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8292"> 8292 </A></B>
<P>
	This is why we believe that the role of government is not simply 
to stand still or to stand aside. Its role must be to stand with those 
Canadians who are having difficulty adjusting to a turbulent world.
<P>
	The simple fact of the matter is that the short term interests of 
the market do not always address the long term needs of the nation. 
A country is not a balance sheet. For this government, taking care 
of our future requires more than simply taking care of the books.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	On coming into office, it was very clear what our jobs and 
growth plan had to be. First, we had to restore responsible 
management to the country's finances. Second, we had to invest in 
those areas of the economy that would provide immediate growth 
and job potential, thereby serving as a bridge until the full impact 
of our effort to get interest rates down and restore confidence took 
hold. Third, we had to look beyond the short term to make 
investments that would strengthen long term economic growth, 
investments that by their very nature would take time to kick in, but 
would create ongoing momentum in an ever-changing job market.
<P>
	This plan has been part of every budget we have brought down 
including this one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have taken initiatives in infrastructure, trade, youth 
employment, labour market training, payroll tax reduction, 
tourism, rural Canada and small business.
<P>
	For example, upon coming into office, we provided $2 billion for 
the $6 billion three-year Canada Infrastructure Works Program. In 
partnership with the municipalities and every province across the 
country, over 12,000 projects were undertaken.
<P>
	Last month, we announced an extension of this Program for 
another year. This means that in 1997, the federal government's 
contribution will be $600 million, $425 million of which is new 
money.
<P>
	In the international trade sector, four Team Canada trade 
missions unprecedented in their results have been led by the Prime 
Minister. Moreover, financing for Canadian exports has been 
improved through new investments in the Export Development 
Corporation. All this is paying off. The fact is that since 1992, the 
volume of our exports has soared by almost 50 per cent. Talk about 
jobs!
<P>
	On youth employment, last week, the government announced an 
initiative that will support 120,000 summer jobs over the next two 
years and, in addition, create new internship programs to provide 
over 19,000 positions to give young Canadians real work 
experience.
<P>
	On payroll taxes, when we came into office, we acted 
immediately to stop EI premium rates from rising to $3.30, and we 
have reduced them as much as we can  each and every year. For 
1998, we have assumed the EI premium rate will be reduced to 
$2.80.
<P>
	Furthermore, last fall, we announced a New Hires Program that 
will virtually eliminate EI premiums for additional employees 
hired this year by almost 900,000 eligible small businesses.
<P>
	Reductions in the EI premium rate, and other EI reforms, 
together with the new Hires Program will save workers and 
employers $1.7 billion this year alone.
<P>
	Looking ahead, we have been clear since taking office that we 
will continue to reduce EI premiums as fast as our fiscal situation 
permits.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Tourism is an important creator of jobs. Indeed, the Canadian 
Tourism Commission estimates that over the next decade 125,000 
new jobs can be created in this sector alone. Therefore, today we 
are providing the commission with an additional $15 million of 
funding for tourism promotion in each of the next three years.
<P>
	As in the past, the private sector will be asked to match our 
contribution dollar for dollar. In addition, we are investing a further 
$50 million in the Business Development Bank to help it finance up 
to $500 million worth of private sector tourism infrastructure.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The pressures of adjustment to a changing world are as acute in 
rural Canada as they are anywhere in the economy. Therefore let 
me state unequivocally that we will ensure, whether it is through 
programs for infrastructure, tourism or high technology, that rural 
Canada has an opportunity to participate fully in everything the 
government has to offer as it builds for the next century.
<P>
	In addition to the other programs in this budget, $50 million in 
capital has been provided to the Farm Credit Corporation to expand 
its capacity to support growth and diversification in rural Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, we are announcing today that $10 million in 
funding in each of the next three years will be devoted to ensuring 
that virtually every community in Canada between 400 people and 
50,000 in population will be connected to the information highway 
over the next four years-5,000 communities in all.
<P>
	Finally, we know how essential small business is to job creation. 
It is therefore no coincidence that virtually all the measures 
described thus far are of direct relevance to the success of Canadian 
entrepreneurship. However, there are two further initiatives that I 
would like to highlight.
<P>
	First, I would like to note the announcement last week that 
Canada will be open to foreign branch banking. This will increase 
the financing options available to small and medium size business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8293"> 8293 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, small business has been very clear about the major 
costs of the paper burden created by governments; for example, 
those imposed by the requirement to file payroll deductions with 
the federal government on a monthly basis. Small business is 
right. Therefore for small businesses with good records of 
compliance we are eliminating this requirement. They will now 
be permitted to file on a quarterly basis. This has the potential 
of benefiting up to 650,000 small businesses.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In each and every one of the areas I have addressed, a new ethic 
of partnership has clearly developed. It is important because 
co-operation and partnership among governments, and with the 
private sector, have become very much our way of conducting the 
nation's business.
<P>
	I have just described some of the investments which have had an 
immediate impact on economic growth, and which will help bridge 
the gap to the stronger job creation that is now expected. Canadians 
can be assured that we will continue to provide this bridge as long 
as it is needed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have discussed the short and the medium term. We must 
discuss the long term as well. We must broaden our notion of 
infrastructure. We must take it beyond its traditional meaning to 
include the components of future economic success, 
post-secondary education, knowledge, innovation. These are the 
building blocks of the new wealth of nations. It is in this 
infrastructure as well that government must invest, for if we fail to 
do so we will fail the country of tomorrow. We will short change 
the next generation.
<P>
	Canadians know that a better education equals better jobs. This 
is true for our young people who are in school. It is also true for 
those already in the workforce whose continued employment is 
increasingly dependent on lifelong learning.
<P>
	Therefore last year, to help with living expenses while attending 
university, a community college or a vocational school, we raised 
the amount used to set the education credit, thus reducing the taxes 
students or their parents must pay. Today we are raising this 
amount further. We will double it in two stages to $200 per month.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	Next, students also face additional fees apart from the cost of 
tuition itself. Up until now these have not been covered by the 
tuition credit. Henceforth they will be.
<P>
	Furthermore, under the current rules, some students or their 
parents cannot take advantage of these credits because they do not 
have sufficient income in a particular year to utilize them. This is 
often the case, for instance, for those students who do not have 
supporting parents or for people who enroll in an education 
program later in life. Therefore we are changing the rules so that 
those  who are not able to use these credits in the year of study will 
now be able to do so by carrying them forward to offset against 
future income.
<P>
	As a result of the measures just announced and those put in place 
by last year's budget, the combined federal and provincial tax 
assistance for a typical student will rise from $900 to over $1,200 a 
year, an increase of one third.
<P>
	Next, we are taking steps to assist students who have difficulties 
in managing the debt burden they incur through the taking out of 
student loans. Despite the assistance currently provided under the 
Canada student loans program, some students are unable to meet 
their loan repayment obligations. Therefore the federal government 
will extend from 18 to 30 months the period of time that students 
facing these difficulties can defer making loan repayments.
<P>
	During this period the federal government will pay the interest 
the student would otherwise have had to pay. Combined with the 
existing grace period this means that students will have up to three 
years of help after graduation in managing their loans.
<P>
	Furthermore, the federal government is ready to pursue with 
interested provinces, lenders and other groups an additional option 
for repaying student loans, one where the repayment schedule will 
be tied directly to a student's income.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Thus far, we have spoken about measures to support those 
already in school, or those who wish to return to upgrade their 
qualifications. But increasingly, parents with young children are 
worried that they will not be able to afford the costs of their 
education. Registered education savings plans exist to provide 
parents with incentives to save for their children's education.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today we are announcing measures to make registered education 
savings plans more attractive and flexible. In order to help parents 
save more in RESPs the annual contribution limit will be doubled 
to $4,000. This will enable those parents who do not start until their 
children are older to still accumulate substantial savings.
<P>
	Finally, we have found that some parents may be reluctant to 
invest in RESPs because they fear losing their investment if their 
children do not pursue higher education. Therefore we are allowing 
individuals to transfer unused RESP income into their RRSPs if 
they have room.
<P>
	In all, the initiatives announced in this budget will at maturity 
increase tax assistance to students and their families by some $275 
million a year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8294"> 8294 </A></B>
<P>
	Just as broader and better access to higher learning is essential 
for students and those already in the workforce, so too they must 
be provided the facilities needed to acquire that education.
<P>
	In many such instances, the research facilities at our universities, 
our colleges and our hospitals are critical. They are the linchpin for 
world class education. Why? They provide the tools needed to 
develop leading edge skills. The fact is that it is only through 
knowledge, information and ideas that new products and new 
services will be created. It is only if there is an opportunity to 
develop these products and these services in Canada, not abroad, 
that our best and our brightest will be able to contribute to the 
prosperity of their own country.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In short, the research facilities in our hospitals, our universities 
and our colleges are part of the root system of our economic 
prospects for the future.
<P>
	But, too often, those facilities are far from what they should be to 
meet today's challenges. The fact is that much of our current 
research infrastructure is literally unable to handle the kind of 
pressures required to keep Canada in the front ranks of the new 
economy.
<P>
	Innovation doesn't just happen. It requires investment. 
Therefore, the government announces today that it is establishing 
the Canada Foundation for Innovation, with an $800 million 
contribution to support research facilities in our universities, 
colleges and hospitals.
<P>
	The focus of the Foundation will be to support research 
infrastructure in the areas of health, the environment, science and 
engineering.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Innovation does not just happen. It requires investment. 
Therefore the government is announcing today that it is 
establishing the Canada Foundation for Innovation, with an initial 
investment of $800 million to support research facilities in our 
universities, our colleges and our hospitals.
<P>
	The focus of the foundation will be to support research 
infrastructure in the areas of health, the environment, science and 
engineering.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canada Foundation for Innovation represents an entirely 
new approach to addressing the innovation challenge we have 
described.
<P>
	The Foundation will be set up outside of government and will 
operate independently of government. Investment decisions will be 
made solely by a board of directors, the majority of whom will be 
drawn from the private sector and the research and academic 
communities.
<P>
	The Foundation will be able to provide about $180 million 
annually over the next five years to support important research 
infrastructure.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canada Foundation for Innovation is about looking forward. 
It is about our children. It is about education. In short, it is about 
investing in the future growth of our economy, making a down 
payment today for a much greater reward tomorrow. Through 
partnerships for individual projects, be they with the research 
institutions themselves, with the private sector or with the 
provinces, the Canada Foundation for Innovation's resources could 
very well lead up to $2 billion in needed investment, laying the 
foundation for tomorrow's jobs as well as today's.
<P>
	Thus far I have spoken about our plan for economic growth and 
jobs, but if our plan for a strong economy is to succeed then we 
must have a strong society as well. The ultimate test of a nation lies 
in its will and its capacity to support those who are the most 
vulnerable, its will and its capacity to sustain the programs upon 
which every one of its citizens depends.
<P>
	This government promised to make the retirement income 
system secure for Canadians. We are well on the way to doing this. 
No other industrial country has done as much as Canada has to 
come to grips with the challenges of an aging society. As we 
announced last week, we and a majority of the provinces have 
agreed to a strong and balanced package of reforms that will ensure 
that the Canada pension plan is there for Canadians. With the 
introduction of the new seniors benefit in the year 2001, we will 
have taken action to make the public pension system in Canada 
secure and sustainable for future generations while fully protecting 
current seniors.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Canada's system of publicly funded universal health care is one 
of this country's greatest achievements. This government's 
commitment to the principles contained in the Canada Health Act 
is unequivocal. These principles will be maintained. They will be 
enforced.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government supports health, education and welfare 
by providing transfers to the provinces. Last year, under the new 
Canada Health and Social Transfer, a predictable and assured level 
of funding was legislated for the five-year period through to the 
year 2002-03.
<P>
	A stable transfer of more than $25 billion annually in cash and 
tax points is in place until the turn of the century, at which time it 
will begin growing. Legislation passed last year also guarantees 
that the cash component of the transfer will never fall below $11 
billion per year. This is a floor, not a ceiling. Indeed, cash transfers 
to the provinces are projected to begin growing around the year 
2000.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8295"> 8295 </A></B>
<P>
	This federal funding ensures that the principles of medicare will 
be protected. But this speaks to only one part of our challenge.
<P>
	The second part is to acknowledge and act upon the need for 
change. Yes, we will protect medicare but, more importantly, we 
must show the will and the wisdom to improve it-to strengthen it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Upon coming into office, the Prime Minister established the 
National Forum on Health to advise Canadians on how to improve 
our health care system. Earlier this month the forum issued its 
report. As the Prime Minister has stated, it provides a 
comprehensive and common sense view of how governments must 
work together to address the long term health care challenge in 
Canada.
<P>
	The forum's report is very clear. It confirms that while as a 
nation we devote sufficient financial resources to the health care 
system, these resources are not being spent as efficiently as they 
might be. The forum further states that the transition to a more 
effective way of running the system in the future requires some 
targeted investment today.
<P>
	Therefore this budget provides $300 million over the next three 
years to respond directly to the recommendations of the national 
forum. Let me emphasize that every single dollar will be devoted 
toward the delivery of better health services for Canadians.
<P>
	First, the forum makes it clear that one of the greatest challenges 
we face is devising more innovative ways to deliver health care. 
Therefore, we are announcing today that we will provide $150 
million over the next three years to help the provinces put in place 
the type of pilot projects, for example, new approaches to home 
care, drug coverage and other innovations, that will enable them to 
test ways in which our health systems can be improved. This 
amount will be allocated to the provinces on an equal per capita 
basis and decisions regarding spending will be made jointly by 
Canada's ministers of health.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	In the same vein, we will also provide $50 million over the next 
three years to allow both levels of government to put in place a 
co-ordinated national system of health data, the Canada health 
information system. This will ensure that health care planners and 
individual Canadians across the country have the right information 
at the right time, including the most up to date knowledge possible 
concerning the best treatments available.
<P>
	Next, the forum spoke out in favour of stronger community 
based programming. We agree. At the present time the federal 
government funds two community based programs directed toward 
improving the health of children.
<P>
	The first is the community action program for children which 
today supports hundreds of community groups, for example in 
providing parenting education, child development centres and 
family resource programs, all directed to addressing the needs of 
children at risk up to the age of six years.
<P>
	The second program is the Canada prenatal nutrition program, 
which promotes the birth of healthy babies among high risk 
pregnant woman.
<P>
	We are announcing today that the resources for these two 
programs are being increased by almost $100 million over the next 
three years.
<P>
	It will not have escaped notice that the last two programs are 
directed to Canada's children. On this the forum was unequivocal. 
One of the best health care investments we can make for tomorrow 
is to improve the well-being of our children today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our children are our most precious resource and ensuring their 
health is our greatest responsibility. We know that an important 
determinant of the health of our children is the income they have to 
live on, as well as the services at their disposal. The question is, 
what are we doing about it? The answer, for too many children and 
their families, has been not nearly enough.
<P>
	Child poverty is an issue on which the country is coming 
together. Canadians believe the challenge must be addressed. The 
Prime Minister has taken a leadership role and he and the premiers, 
at the First Ministers' Meeting last June, agreed to make investing 
in children a national priority. Social services ministers from 
across Canada are making great progress in identifying how we can 
move forward together.
<P>
	We know that the causes of child poverty are many. We know 
that not all of them can be easily addressed.
<P>
	For example, it is very clear that the ultimate solution includes a 
growing economy that creates jobs. That goal underpins the 
economic course we are on.
<P>
	We also know that we must take the steps necessary to ensure 
that the services are in place that Canada's children require. Those 
include, for example, health and dental benefits, remedial help and 
good nutrition.
<P>
	Yet today, for many children, those services are not there. This is 
simply not acceptable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The fact is the way the current system of services and support to 
families works is contrary to common sense. It is also unfair.
<P>
	At present, in most parts of the country when parents move off 
welfare and into the workforce to provide for  themselves and their 
children, they may see their incomes actually drop. Their children 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8296"> 8296 </A></B>
<P>
lose the services provided them under social assistance, services 
they need and deserve.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	To persist with a system where the price that parents pay for 
rejoining the workforce is to see the circumstances of their children 
actually worsen is bad social policy. It is bad economic policy. 
Going to work should make people's lives better, not worse.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Meeting this challenge requires a national effort, a co-operative 
strategy, on the part of both the provinces and the federal 
government. Why? Because it is the provinces that are best 
equipped to deliver the services and support families need. And it 
is the federal government, through the tax system, that has the 
capacity to take the first step that will provide the provinces with 
the flexibility to devote appropriate funds for these services and 
support.
<P>
	How? Through the provision, by the federal government, of an 
equal level of support for all low-income families, a platform on 
which the provinces can build.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Most of the great national programs in this country were built in 
stages. This was true of medicare. It was true of seniors pensions. 
What is important is to take the crucial first step.
<P>
	In this budget the federal government is proposing to allocate 
$850 million to increase existing spending under the child tax 
benefit. This includes $600 million in new funds as of July 1998 in 
addition to the $250 million increase in child benefits announced in 
the 1996 budget. This means that $6 billion will be provided 
annually to Canadian families under a new Canada child tax 
benefit.
<P>
	Let me explain. In last year's budget we explained that funding 
for the working income supplement which helps meet some of the 
expenses incurred by low income families participating in the 
workforce would be doubled in two stages. In this budget to 
facilitate the move toward a national child benefit system, the 
working income supplement will be further enriched and then 
restructured as of July this year.
<P>
	First, $70 million of the increase in the supplement that was to 
be paid next year will be paid a year earlier. This will provide $195 
million in new benefits as of this July 1 to over 700,000 families 
who earned up to $26,000 a year. One-third of these families are 
headed by single parents, usually women.
<P>
	Next, the allocation of this benefit will be changed to reflect the 
number of children a family has, as do the child benefit allowances 
provided by the provinces under social assistance.
<P>
	Finally, as just announced, an additional $600 million per year 
will be provided to the new Canada child tax benefit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, together with the $250 million for the Working 
Income Supplement, which is being rolled into the new benefit, this 
will mean $850 million per year of further federal support for over 
one million children and their families.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The creation of a new child benefit system is a major change 
which by its very nature requires moving forward together with the 
provinces. Discussions as to detail design are now under way. Part 
of the design involves the provinces moving to use the funds freed 
by the federal investment to provide children with the support and 
the services so needed in their formative years.
<P>
	For our part we are planning on full implementation no later than 
July 1998. However, if based on our discussions with the provinces 
it is possible to go sooner, we will do so. There can be no more 
worthy effort than a new partnership on behalf of Canada's 
children.
<P>
	Today we are devoting significant new financial resources to 
meeting this challenge. Yet this can be but the beginning. We will 
provide additional resources as soon as we can afford it. The reason 
is very clear. Opportunity denied in childhood too often means 
chances lost in adulthood. The future of Canada's children is the 
future of our country as well.
<P>
	Despite the many difficulties that Canadians face in day to day 
life, most are able to do so as healthy, able bodied citizens. 
However, Canadians with disabilities do not have the same 
opportunities. They face real barriers in everyday life. What these 
Canadians seek is not special treatment. They seek equal 
citizenship and they need our support to secure it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, we are announcing measures that flow from the 
recommendations of the Federal Task Force on Disability Issues 
and build on the actions we took last year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, disabled workers will now be able to deduct the full cost of 
attendant care from their earned income. Second, audiologists will 
now be allowed to certify eligibility for the disability tax credit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Third, the list of expenses eligible for the medical expense tax 
credit is being broadened substantially.
<P>
	Fourth, we are doubling the limit on part-time attendant care.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8297"> 8297 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Fifth, we are introducing a refundable tax credit for low income 
working Canadians to help cover the high medical expenses that 
people with disabilities often face. This measure will provide 
additional support to about 280,000 working Canadians with high 
medical expenses.
<P>
	Finally, the government is establishing a $30 million dollar 
opportunities fund which will operate in partnership with 
non-governmental organizations to provide assistance for 
Canadians with disabilities. All in all, the measures outlined 
amount to an investment of some $230 million over the next three 
years, a step on the way to a better life for many thousands of our 
fellow Canadians.
<P>
	Across Canada millions of Canadians give freely of their time to 
support the work of non-profit, voluntary and charitable 
organizations. The generosity they show and the good work they do 
is invaluable. Their participation as citizens builds and maintains 
the quality of life in our communities. Governments have a very 
clear obligation to support their involvement and their dedication.
<P>
	Today we are announcing important measures to encourage 
charitable giving. I will highlight two of the more significant 
measures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First, the government proposes to increase the amount of 
donations for which the charitable credit can be claimed in any one 
year. In this budget, the allowable amount is being raised to 75 per 
cent and is being uniformly applied to all charities.
<P>
	This will particularly help smaller charities such as food banks 
and shelters.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Next, as a result of the actions taken in past budgets as well as 
this one, for donations of cash, particularly from individuals with 
middle incomes, Canada has a more generous tax regime than that 
in place in the United States.
<P>
	However, there is one area where the Canadian system is 
significantly less supportive of charities than that of the United 
States and that is in the donation of gifts in a form other than cash.
<P>
	As a result of this differential, Canadian charities have told us 
that they have been far less successful in securing large donations 
than they otherwise might have been.
<P>
	Therefore we are proposing tax changes for donations of 
publicly traded securities which will put our charities on an equal 
footing with those in the United States.
<P>
	This change is designed to assist charities of all types. This 
means the United Way/Centraide, every member of  Community 
Foundations of Canada, universities, hospitals, for example. This 
provision will be reviewed after five years to ensure it is effective 
in both increasing donations and ensuring that the resulting 
distribution falls fairly and broadly across the spectrum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me set out our policy and our commitment on the issue of 
taxation.
<P>
	Our goal is straightforward. It is to reduce taxes.
<P>
	The fact is we came into office in 1993, after a decade of 
constantly rising taxes. Within a month of our election, I stated that 
this was clearly one of the principal reasons why Canadians had 
lost faith in government. I further stated that we were determined to 
put a halt to spiralling taxes. And we have.
<P>
	In not one of our budgets has there been an increase in personal 
income tax rates. Indeed, in last year's budget, and in this year's, 
we have not raised taxes at all. Indeed, we have put in place 
selective tax cuts where their positive impact will be greatest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we have outlined today, this budget proposes selective tax 
cuts for low income families, for charities, for Canadians with 
disabilities, for students and workers pursuing higher education, 
and for parents saving for their children's future education.
<P>
	We have always said that this is the way that we would begin the 
process of tax relief. In addition, we are continuing to reduce and 
simplify tariffs on imports, a major reform that last year alone 
saved Canadian consumers and business $600 million.
<P>
	Finally, as a result of fiscal restraint, Canadian interest rates 
have dropped substantially and this alone has put several billion 
dollars in additional purchasing power into the hands of Canadians.
<P>
	With this as background, I would now like to address the 
suggestion by some that this is the time to introduce a broadly 
based tax cut.
<P>
	Our position is quite straightforward. We would like to reduce 
personal income taxes more significantly and we will do so as soon 
as the country can afford it. But to do so now would be 
irresponsible.
<P>
	Indeed, this debate is possible only because of the progress we 
and all Canadians have made in reducing the deficit and restoring 
responsible financial management over the last three years.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To propose a broadly based tax cut at this time is to pretend that 
the attack on the deficit is over. It isn't. It will be soon-but only if 
we keep to our course and stand firm.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8298"> 8298 </A></B>
<P>
	The issue is not whether we should reduce taxes because we 
are ahead of our deficit target. The real issue is whether we can 
afford to reduce taxes when we still have a sizeable deficit and 
when the debt-to-GDP ratio has not yet declined.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us face it. A broadly based tax reduction today would have to 
be paid for in one of two ways: by adding to the deficit or by cutting 
government programs further. Our view is clear. Neither one of 
these choices is acceptable. We will not break faith with the 
Canadian people after all the sacrifices they have made and after all 
that we together have been able to achieve. To drive the deficit up 
again would be to drive up interest rates. It would be to reduce 
confidence and seriously diminish the prospects for jobs and for 
growth that we now see. And this we will not do.
<P>
	Nor will we cut programs further. Yes, we have to keep up our 
efforts to root out waste and inefficiency. And yes, we have reduced 
spending, but we have done so in a way that preserves the essential 
priorities of the nation. Having spent three years looking at 
government spending, I can say that cutting billions of dollars 
further on top of the cuts that have already been made would have 
no other consequence than to put at risk programs that Canadians 
want us to protect, the programs that go to the heart of the nation's 
very sense of its well-being.
<P>
	There will be a time to consider a broadly based tax reduction. 
But we will not do it until we know we can afford it and until we 
know it can be sustained. Our goal must be permanent fiscal 
recovery. That is the only assured route to permanent tax relief.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In concluding-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I just said I was going to conclude and the House leader said 
``thank heaven''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me now summarize our plan for a strengthening economy 
and a stronger society, a plan acted upon in each of our budgets.
<P>
	On taking office, we had to first re-establish confidence in the 
country's management of its financial affairs. Every one of our 
deficit targets has been met-in fact, bettered.
<P>
	The second element of our plan has been to take action in areas 
that have an immediate impact on growth and jobs.
<P>
	The third element has been to strengthen the foundation of 
long-term economic growth and jobs by investing in the knowledge 
infrastructure Canada must have.
<P>
	And the fourth element has been to invest in a stronger 
society-in health, in the future of our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Fiscal control, immediate initiatives for jobs and for growth, 
longer term investments for a stronger economy, laying the 
foundation for a stronger society; these four elements make up our 
plan. They are what our previous budgets have been about. They 
are what this budget is about.
<P>
	As I draw to a close, let me just say one thing. We must be very 
clear. There can be no going back. The days of over-reaching, 
over-spending governments are over. Nor can there be a return to 
the time when government would not or could not set priorities 
and, as a result, spent too much money on what did not matter and 
not enough on what did. What government does with its scarce 
resources shows what its values are.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	This government has set its priorities and with this budget we are 
investing in them. While continuing to bring the deficit down, we 
are providing substantial new resources to invest in jobs, in health 
care, in education, in our children. This is a reflection of our 
values.
<P>
	We have made it very clear that we will not deviate from the 
deficit track. However, to those who would use deficit reduction as 
a cover, an excuse to make government disappear, let me say that is 
not what we believe.
<P>
	We believe that a government relieved of the deficit burden is 
not a government relieved of its responsibilities. It is a government 
able to fulfil them.
<P>
	Our role must be to reach out to those in need. We must be able 
to speak for those whose voices are drowned out by the winds of 
change and the forces of privilege. The role of government must be 
to help the country reach forward to the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is no doubt this has not been an easy decade for 
Canadians.
<P>
	We have faced a painful process of adjustment to free trade and 
technological change.
<P>
	But now, having done what we had to do, we can see that the 
worst is behind us, that brighter days lie ahead.
<P>
	Obviously, we have not yet reached our destination, but we have 
made considerable progress, the era of cuts is ending, the finances 
of the nation are finally being brought under control, and we are at 
the point where we are now able to forge a new destiny for 
ourselves.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In terms of the nation's finances, very clearly our journey is not 
over. But equally clear is how far we have come. Far enough most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8299"> 8299 </A></B>
<P>
certainly for us now to come to a shared vision of the kind of 
country we want for our children and then to go on to build it.
<P>
	This vision can never be anchored in the extremes of ideology, of 
left wing or right. It must be based on the great balance that has 
always been at the heart of our national mission, the balance 
between individual freedom and collective responsibility. It must 
be based on the knowledge that in a civilized society our public 
institutions and the sense of community and common purpose they 
represent are as critical to our economic health as are the 
operations of the free market.
<P>
	If we have been forced to spend much of our energy addressing 
financial problems inherited from the past, now, with those 
problems on the way to resolution, we can focus on the promise of 
a future, on the great national challenges that lie ahead.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Let us never come to believe that there is such a thing as a 
tolerable level of child poverty or that a growing gap between the 
rich and the poor is ever acceptable. Let us never forget the debt we 
owe to our seniors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us leave no stone unturned in our quest for jobs. Let us 
recognize that Canada's greatest natural resources do not lie buried 
deep in the ground, but in the skills and the talents of those who 
walk upon it.
<P>
	Let us do what is necessary to ensure that Canada not only meets 
the standards of innovation that the world has set for today, but that 
we set the standards that others must meet tomorrow.
<P>
	Let us speak loudly and clearly to those who believe we cannot 
afford medicare any more. Let us say that if there was ever a time 
in our history when we cannot afford not to have medicare, it is 
now. Let us go on to strengthen it for all time.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	There is literally nothing standing in our way. We have it within 
ourselves to do all of this and even more. For three years now, our 
course has been to provide Canada with a new beginning. The time 
has come to turn this beginning into great achievement.
<P>
	It is time to shed doubt. It is time to turn away from the timid, 
from the pessimists, from those who believe we can settle for 
second best. It is time to speak to the reality of the national interest. 
It is time to say that this will not be a good country for any of us 
until it is a good country for all of us.
<P>
	This is the course we are on. On this course we will stay and on 
this course we will stand.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-83, an act to provide borrowing authority for the 
fiscal year beginning April 1, 1997.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I get underway, I would like to acknowledge in the 
gallery Mr. Yves Duhaime, the next member for Saint-Maurice.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> To get back on track, the budget tabled today by 
the Minister of Finance is not worth the paper it is printed on. It is 
despicably election oriented.
<P>
	It is an election budget, because the Minister of Finance missed a 
golden opportunity to do extraordinary things, given the 
exceptional circumstances. He could have done extraordinary 
things in job creation, in really fighting poverty, in providing a real 
impetus to long term employment while continuing to aim for zero 
deficit in the year 2000.
<P>
	Instead, the Minister of Finance presented measures that are 
blatantly election oriented and a sad reflection on this government.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Let us take taxation, for example. Last November, we suggested 
to the Minister of Finance, in a detailed analysis with respect to a 
review of corporate taxation, ways to tighten up fiscal spending, 
unfair advantages for large corporations. This would have allowed 
him to recover no less than $3 billion to plow back into SMBs in 
support of their job creation effort. What do we see in this budget? 
Nothing, in this regard. As for individual taxation, it is exactly the 
same thing.
<P>
	He has been at the head of the federal finance department for 
three and a half years and he is unable to produce a single line of 
tax reform to make the system more equitable for low and middle 
income taxpayers. What they have done is to hang on to the unfair 
advantages for the very rich friends of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance had extraordinary leeway. I will 
explain. If we compare the projected deficit when he brought down 
his last budget and the projections in the present budget together 
with the projections from the large Canadian firms that specialize 
in this sort of figures, the Minister of Finance had at least $8 billion 
to play with in 1997-98.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8300"> 8300 </A></B>
<P>
	In other words, while continuing to focus on lowering the 
deficit, and eliminating it by the year 2000, as the Government 
of Quebec has undertaken to do, the Minister of Finance could 
have done extraordinary things. Eight billion dollars worth of 
leeway, of flexibility. And the Minister of Finance is not taking 
advantage of this.
<P>
	As far as job creation is concerned, 1.5 million people in Canada 
who were officially unemployed, three million if we include those 
who stopped looking for work because they were discouraged or 
because measures like employment insurance have marginalized 
them, three million unemployed could have expected something 
tangible in the way of job creation. They were waiting for the 
Minister of Finance. They were waiting for the budget.
<P>
	Instead, the only measure involving new money in this budget 
amounts to $25 million. Twenty five million dollars, when the 
Minister of Finance, with his $8 billion, could easily have used part 
of the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund to make a 
substantial reduction in premiums. Not 10 cents, which is peanuts, 
but a substantial reduction in premiums to give job creation a 
boost. He could have done that. This is something we have been 
asking him to do for almost a year and a half.
<P>
	He could also have announced that this decision to put in place 
the employment insurance system, a name that is rather odious, 
which came into effect last January, he could have taken part of the 
surplus generated by the unemployment insurance fund to once 
again provide adequate protection for the unemployed.
<P>
	Instead, the Minister of Finance acted like a manager who is hard 
as nails. Not just a zero deficit objective for the year 2000 but a sky 
high surplus. The unemployed would just have to wait. As the 
Prime Minister said not long ago to the unemployed: ``Good luck''. 
That is the Minister of Finance for you.
<P>
	As for child poverty, a few weeks ago, the Minister of Finance 
and the Prime Minister were all of sudden filled with compassion 
for the children they made even poorer during the past three and a 
half years with their cuts in social programs totalling $4.5 billion. 
All of sudden, they feel compassion for poor children.
<P>
	So what do they give to poor children? This year, $50 million. 
This year, $50 million more in new money for poor children. Next 
year, a program worth $600 million in new benefits. Sure, $600 
million, but compare that with this government's past record. And 
this $600 million is new money that is supposed to come to us after 
the election. Suppose they change their minds, the way they did 
with the GST?
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	They have changed their mind as well, an unkept promise of 
$600 million for daycare; they could change  their mind about the 
child benefit. A total of $600 million, while they have cut $4.5 
billion from social programs. A total of $600 million, while they 
are going to take very close to $1.5 billion away from the 
unemployed, just by creating employment insurance. 
Impoverishing the parents of children living in poverty-is that 
what battling poverty is all about?
<P>
	It is odious to present things to us under that light. They are the 
ones responsible for the rise in child poverty, and they are the ones 
who were calling for a campaign against poverty in the red book, 
where they decried the fact that there were a million poor children 
in Canada. Thanks to them, those numbers have risen to 1.5 
million; the bulk of the blame lies with them.
<P>
	This budget sets up a foundation, with all the hoopla, all the 
theatrics and window dressing the Minister of Finance is capable 
of. A foundation to fund research in areas that include health and 
higher education. Here again, an $800 million foundation. The first 
question that came to mind was where in the Minister of Finance's 
balance sheet did the $800 million fit. Once again, it boils down to 
one thing: the Minister of Finance has cut transfer payments to the 
provinces for funding post-secondary education and health.
<P>
	As a result, as a Canadian coalition told us in the Finance 
Committee, the cuts the minister has made will mean, for instance, 
that in the years to come biomedical research will be cut 30 per 
cent. This is the disaster the Minister of Finance has wrought. Then 
they come along to tell us that a research foundation is being 
created. Yes, created in order to try to pick up the pieces, for they 
have realized that they made a mistake, but cannot face up to their 
mistakes.
<P>
	And where, once again, are the $800 million going to come 
from? Looking at the forecasts for transfer payments to the 
provinces made public last year by the Minister of Finance, and 
comparing them with the revised transfers presented by the 
Minister of Finance this year, we see that there is a ``slight'' drop of 
$800 million in transfers to the provinces. And the research 
foundation costs precisely $800 million, so once again it is clear 
that the initial funding for this foundation will be created at the 
expense of the provinces. That is what the finance minister is up to, 
and that is what we should thank him for? This budget is why we 
should be telling him he did a fine job? It is a monumental 
disgrace.
<P>
	I will point out, Mr. Speaker, that all these new measures 
announced with fanfare, every one of them, are in areas exclusively 
under provincial jurisdiction. They all deal with health, education, 
income security, which are areas identified in the Constitution as 
areas exclusively under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is quite strange that the Minister of Finance was able to find 
money on the side to announce, and make a big production of it, 
federal programs identified by a big flag and the words 
Government of Canada underneath, but  he cannot find a red cent to 
maintain the transfer payments that were normally made to the 
provinces for social programs. It is really quite strange. Could it be 
that he is taking over provincial jurisdictions by squeezing the 
provinces out and using the Canadian flag and the words Govern-
<P>

<B><A NAME="8301"> 8301 </A></B>
<P>
ment of Canada, prominently displayed, to score political points? 
The answer is yes.
<P>
	The measures put forward by the Minister of Finance in this 
budget are an extension of the Deputy Prime Minister's flag policy, 
nothing more.
<P>
	I would have had much to say about this budget; in fact, we will 
have the opportunity to do so in the days to come. Let me tell you 
about another important issue which is not mentioned in this 
budget: the compensation to which Quebec is entitled for 
harmonizing the GST.
<P>
	Our province harmonized its sales tax with the GST as early as 
1991. Today, it is presenting the federal government with a $1.9 
billion bill. The federal government signed an harmonization deal 
with the maritime provinces, and a cheque was immediately issued. 
The maritime provinces got close to $1 billion in compensation for 
harmonizing the GST, while Quebec, which did the same in 1991, 
did not get anything. For reasons of fairness and justice to Quebec, 
we expected the budget to make mention of a first payment to the 
Government of Quebec for harmonizing the GST, but there is no 
such mention.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to quote the Minister of Finance, who 
said in his budget in brief, and I quote: ``What government does 
with scarce resources shows what its values are''. This budget 
shows the government's cynicism, blatantly election oriented 
strategies and mockery of taxpayers in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	I would like to move the motion to adjourn the budget debate. I 
move, seconded by my colleague for Rimouski-Témiscouata:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the debate be now adjourned.</BLOCKQUOTE>
