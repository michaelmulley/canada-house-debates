</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in today's London <I>Free Press</I> and <I>Sun 
Media</I> there is an accurate description of the contents of a 
joint project between the RCMP and CSIS called sidewinder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contents of the report should raise very deep concerns with 
all Canadians.  I have been contacted by a Toronto police officer 
who worked in the Asian crime unit for three years who said “The 
Canadian public have absolutely no idea what is taking place in 
our society insofar as the criminal activities of organized 
groups is concerned”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having read the report, it shows a seamless connection between 
the issue of organized crime and national security, with bridges 
built to significant Canadian companies and political parties. 
The Liberal government's inaction on these issues is deplorable. 
It must immediately undertake a rationalization of information 
sharing and jurisdiction between the armed forces, foreign 
affairs, immigration, CSIS and the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The threat to Canadians' personal and national security, as 
illustrated by the contents of sidewinder, are far too profound 
to Canada to continue to be ignored by the government.

take this opportunity to pay tribute to John Connor, a

Canadian expertise to businesses, communities and organizations

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
past September 14, Canada announced the creation of an 
international commission mandated to promote intervention by the 
international community in the event of humanitarian 
catastrophes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is creating this commission in order to be able to play a 
positive and constructive role in the resolution of conflicts 
affecting human dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not alone in this crusade.  It has the support of the 
Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, as well as 
the leaders of a number of European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Primarily, the new commission is to organize symposia and 
debates throughout the world on humanitarian catastrophes and to 
produce a report on its activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is evidence of Canada's continuing lead role in 
international policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in the House today to announce 
that the FAG Bearings Limited of Stratford has recently opened a 
$23 million, 12,000 square metre plant in Stratford, Ontario. 
Production lines begin moving on August 18, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FAG Bearings currently employs 215 people in the manufacturing 
of high quality aerospace bearings with another 10 to 15 
employees to be added by the end of the year.  Stratford now has 
the most modern aerospace bearing plant in the world. This will 
allow the strategically important Canadian division of FAG 
Bearings to continue to increase its annual sales, which have 
grown from $10 million in 1995 to $50 million in 1999, and on and 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new plant facility is a perfect example of the growing 
strength of Canada's economy, which has outpaced even the United 
States over the past year.  This is welcome news for the 
expanding local economy of Stratford and the riding of 
Perth—Middlesex, which maintains one of the lowest unemployment 
rates in Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 
untimely passing of Anthony Theodorus Roosenmaallen. He died on 
12th Street in New Westminster, British Columbia in August of 
this year when he bravely tried to intervene and come to the 
rescue of victims who were being assaulted.  He tried to keep the 
peace in the community and, unfortunately, died as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born November 13, 1960 in Scarborough, Ontario, Tony is survived 
by his son Morgan, age 13, his parents Anthony and Jose, and his 
brothers and sister in Kingston.  He was buried at Glen Abbey 
Memorial Gardens in Kingston. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Westminster there was a street candlelight vigil in 
Tony's memory, as this construction worker had many friends. Four 
males aged 16 to 21 were charged from this tragedy.  My community 
was deeply offended.  May the Minister of Justice change her ways 
and take notice of what is needed to defend our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tony refused to ignore an injustice taking place.  Why are the 
Liberals ignoring taking responsibility for violent crimes?

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once 
again I have concerns that the <I>National Post</I>'s sensational 
headlines have caused a huge distortion of serious facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of today's article in the <I>National Post</I> 
suggested that mammograms are pointless.  This could not be 
farther from the truth.  A new study on breast screening 
procedures says that proper physical examinations can be a viable 
alternative for women who do not have access to mammograms or who 
fear radiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Cornelia Baines, deputy director of the study, explained 
that if women can arrange to have a good clinical breast exam, 
they will be looking after their breast health as well as if they 
were getting a mammogram, but that mammography screening of women 
who take no other steps to detect breast cancer does reduce the 
number of deaths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Cancer Society numbers say that 19,200 women will be 
diagnosed with breast cancer in Canada this year alone; all the 
more reason why Canadian women over 50 must still be encouraged 
to have either a mammogram or an appointment for a proper 
clinical examination by a trained professional every two years.

trying to get a handle on this government policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it now, when the government is in a position to 
give money back to people, it says it cannot because it has to 
consult.  However, when it wants to take money away from people, 
as it did when it reduced health care to the provinces by 33%, 
and as it did when it raised the gas taxes in 1995, there is no 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister please abandon this self-interested 
policy and state clearly that his government will in fact allow 
consumers to have a reduction in their taxes at the pump? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have replied to this question.  To have a meaningful 
policy on that, the Minister of Finance is right to consult with 
the provinces otherwise it will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many options that we are looking into, but we have to go 
back to the fact that the increase in the price of oil in Canada 
has been caused by the tripling of the price of oil around the 
world, including those who produce oil in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I would like to tell the House of Commons that there 
was no tax on gasoline in Alberta when the Leader of the 
Opposition became a member of the assembly.  He was the minister 
of finance for three years and there was a 9 cents a litre tax in 
Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

I was minister of finance we had the lowest tax on gasoline in 
the country and lower taxes right across the board.  We lowered 
the debt at a time when oil prices were low and global commodity 
prices were high.  When the Prime Minister was the minister of 
finance, taxes went up and debt when up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Minister of Finance this.  While he is parlaying 
at that palace in Prague next week and the people from P.E.I. to 
Penticton and Princeton continue to have their pockets picked at 
the pump, will he please, before he leaves, make the 
recommendation to lower that price? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, after imposing the tax, then at a time of rising fuel 
taxes in Alberta, and public discussion on whether or not the 
excise tax should be cut when it was at 9%, the minister said he 
would consider it.  In his budget, he specifically rejected it. 
The question is, why is he recommending in opposition a course of 
action that he refused to accept when he was in office? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

continue to lower taxes at a rate unseen across the country, even 
when prices were low. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister is sincere when he says he thinks the 
increase in the price of gasoline may increase the risk of a 
recession, why will he not support the Alliance proposal to 
reduce the price of gasoline by almost 5%, which would reduce 
the risk of a recession?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this was a risk I mentioned while discussing this problem  in 
New York last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a danger in the western world that countries which are 
very dependent on oil may find themselves in a much more 
difficult situation than we have in Canada, because we have oil 
in this country.  Moreover, the level of taxation on gasoline in 
Canada is three times lower than what it is in England, Germany 
or France.

waiting for OPEC.  He is waiting for the G-7.  Maybe now he is 
waiting for Christmas to cut taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His 1995 excuse was that he was waiting to end the deficit when

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

any tax cut must be one that is significant and felt.  That view 
is also shared by provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have said that if we were to act in that area we 
would only do so in conjunction with the provinces.  We are 
prepared to show the leadership.  No single level of government 
can provide a large enough cut to make an impact.  We do not want 
to see this money lost at the pumps.  We want to see it go into

lead him.  I am not sure but I think that is followership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the finance minister not explain to Canadians why a 3.5 
cent cut per litre at the pumps would not be real tax relief for 
those who are hard pressed?  Why does he continue to impose a tax 
on tax, a double tax which his own caucus says is unfair and 
should be removed?   Why does he not listen to his own

be totally incredible is that this report, with all of the

Speaker, let me simply explain the balanced approach to the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may well remember that in the budget we put $900 million more 
into the Canadian Foundation for Innovation. At the year end we 
put more money into western and eastern agriculture. In that same 
budget we put $2.5 billion into transfers to the provinces for 
health care.  It is that surplus which will allow us to finance 
the very large funding of $21 billion to $23 billion in transfers 
to the provinces in the agreement signed by the Prime Minister 
and the premiers two weeks ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question then goes to the right hon. Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the Minister of Finance said he was advised by his 
friends on Bay Street as to what to do with the surplus.  Of 
course, the surplus going to the debt would help his friends on 
Bay Street and that is exactly what the minister did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Prime Minister, is this not a conflict of interest? Is 
it not a conflict of interest for the finance minister to give 
the money to an institution that would help his friends? Should 
the minister not resign because of that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not like the insinuation.  I think that the 
Minister of Finance has shown how honourable he is and how 
objective he has been over the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to tell hon. members that he recited a long list of 
agreements and payments that we are giving in the social field. 
There is the health agreement. 
We have invested a lot of money in the children's agenda since we 
have been here.  We have invested in research and development, 
high technology for connecting all Canadians, the millennium 
scholarship program and I could go on and on.  I will always be 
happy when we can pay the debt in Canada because we are paying 
the mortgage that the previous generation put on the children of 
today.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order relating to today's

publicized statement outside the House concerning the state of 
Canada's financial circumstances, in particular focusing on the 
level of the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that you, as a great defender of the 
significance and the importance of the House, will know that we 
raised this issue on a number of occasions.  We regret that 
unfortunately the House has not seen fit or the Chair has not 
seen fit to take a vigorous attitude toward the practices that 
diminish the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we heard high praise from the government about the 
importance of public business of Canadians being conducted in the 
House of Commons, yet it has chosen to flout the House again.  My 
colleagues in this party condemn the continued marginalization by 
the Liberal government in the House.  We know that the House is 
being diminished by the practice of announcements being made in 
the press gallery as opposed to the floor of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of your sister speaker in the British house of 
commons in Westminster, I suggest that this would lend support to 
this point of order.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make a start by remembering that the function of 
Parliament is to hold the Executive to account.  That is the role 
for which history has cast the Commons.  It is the core task of 
members—not merely to act as representatives of their 
constituents, important though that certainly is. It is in 
Parliament in the first instance that Ministers must explain and 
justify their policies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to say, 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken action to ensure that those who advise Ministers 
should never overlook the primacy of Parliament.  This is the 
chief forum of the nation—today, tomorrow and, I hope for ever. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that there is wisdom to be found in those words 
and that sentiment expressed by the British speaker.  I urge the 
Chair to follow that lead of the parliamentary model in Great 
Britain and remind the government of the supremacy of Parliament 
and the importance of speaking to Canadians through its House, 
this House and parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it was interesting that the Speaker had commented about 
the continual practice of the government making big announcements 
outside of this place, ironically again in the Charles Lynch 
Theatre today.  There seems to be quite a bit of action down 
there lately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in parliament the Speaker brought forward his concern 
that this not become a habit of the government to make 
announcements outside of this place.  He said words to the effect 
early in this parliament that “I want to express my concern that 
the government is continuously or habitually making important 
legislative announcements outside of this place”.  The 
announcements of the magnitude that we saw again this morning, 
which was basically an admission that the forecasting ability of 
the finance minister was zilch, were made outside the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree with the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough that it is time that the

comments to the points that have already been raised by my hon. 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all cognizant of the fact that Canadians are concerned 
about the nature of business conducted in the House.  It is in 
the interest of all parliamentarians and the interest of Canada 
and the parliamentary system to conduct, as much as possible, the 
serious business of Canada in the House.  Today when we watched 
television and saw the Minister of Finance talk about the surplus 
and the whole issue and policies surrounding the surplus, the 
question that came to all of us was why was he not making this 
now under ministers statements when there would be an opportunity 
for others to respond and to start this discussion in terms of 
how to deal with this surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to not only you, Mr. Speaker, but to the government 
members, and particularly to the Cabinet ministers, to use this 
House and give it the due that it deserves.  If we do not use it 
seriously ourselves how can we expect Canadians to take it 
seriously?

arguments advanced by the hon. members on this point.  I have to 
say that when this particular chair occupant was in opposition I 
raised the same point.  I am familiar with the argument but I am 
also familiar, unfortunately, with Speakers' rulings on this 
point, so I have some bad news for the members who raised this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite the decision of Mr. Speaker Fraser on October 4, 1989 who 
had raised before him a question of privilege by Mr. Ian Angus, 
the then hon. member for Thunder Bay—Atikokan.  He complained 
about an important announcement made by the transportation 
minister outside the House.  He felt that the matter should have 
been raised here in the House under statements by ministers 
instead of at a press conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote Mr. Speaker Fraser: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker, of course, is not supposed to have any personal 
memory of events in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree of course. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I do, and it has been customary from time to time over many 
years for complaints to be laid before the Speaker with respect 
to whether or not it was appropriate for the Government to make a 
statement in the House, which of course, if that is done under 
the rules enables both opposition critics to have equal time to 
respond.

if the House wishes to change the rules then the Chair will 
certainly abide by them.  There are no rules to that effect as, I 
say, and the honourable Member for Thunder Bay—Atikokan, in 
raising this point, raises a complaint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government has made a response which may or may not satisfy 
honourable Members but it is not a point of privilege and it is 
not a contempt of the House.  I would suggest that honourable

practice of making statements in the House can be followed as

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also refer the hon. member for

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-38, an 
act to establish the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada and to 
amend certain acts in relation to financial institutions, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>

to financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the bill has been a long time coming.  The PC Party of 
Canada, like most people associated with the banking industry, 
have been waiting for years for the government to enact such 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say it has been a long wait.  We have had task forces 
explore ways in which Canada could assist our banking industry. 
There has been much consultation and various reports presented to 
the government which have finally led to the drafting of this 
important piece of legislation. 
Bill C-38 is the culmination of a tremendous amount of effort by 
many people.  These individuals should be congratulated.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides an overhaul of federal laws governing banks 
and other financial institutions.  Changes being proposed in the 
legislation are expected to promote more efficiency and growth 
within the banking industry.  The bill will allow increased share 
ownership for larger banks and provide financial institutions 
with an opportunity to do more through holding companies while 
also giving them a broader range of allowed investments.  These 
changes will help our financial institutions compete in an ever 
changing global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present no single shareholder can own more than 10% of a 
large bank.  The bill will raise that limit to 20% yet still 
prevent the control of a large bank by any single shareholder. 
The legislation will allow financial institutions an opportunity 
to create regulated, non-operating holding companies.  These 
changes could allow smaller institutions to come together and 
compete with other larger institutions.  Such competition could 
only be beneficial to the Canadian consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial institutions could expand their investments in the 
fast growing e-commerce sector.  Technology is quickly changing 
the way consumers conduct their financial affairs.  Therefore it 
is imperative that our financial institutions be at the forefront 
of this new evolution. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to recognize that about 220,000 Canadians 
work in the banking industry in Canada. Even more impressive is 
the fact that more than 500,000 people work in the Canadian 
financial industry, a crucial industry in the Canadian economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our financial services sector allows exports of nearly $50 
billion worth of services each year.  That represents 5% of 
Canada's GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past number of years our financial institutions have 
been under increasing pressure coming from our southern 
neighbours.  Changes to our federal laws governing banks and 
other financial institutions are required if they are to compete 
in the global economy.  I know that our banking institutions in 
West Nova can benefit from the changes being proposed in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I might digress, with the ever rising, ever higher profits 
that the banks are receiving, it is only appropriate that I 
mention small banks being closed in rural Canada, more 
specifically in my riding of West Nova.  We have a small bank in 
Freeport on the islands off Digby Network.  That bank has been 
there for years and years and is very important to the businesses 
that operate in that area.  Yet we are advised that it is being 
closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another bank in Caledonia in the riding of my colleague from 
South Shore is being closed as well.  That bank affects 
individuals who do business in my nearby riding.  In these times 
it is very important that even though we have to look at changes 
to how banks operate we still have to take into account how 
important these small banks are to our regional economies and to 
the areas they serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past number of years our financial institutions have 
been under increasing pressure from our southern neighbours.  As 
I said earlier, we have to enact changes that will permit our 
Canadian banks to work in the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another industry that will be affected, and I am sure the banks 
in West Nova will appreciate this point, is the trucking industry 
which is faced with high and ever increasing diesel costs.  If 
the price of diesel fuel is not soon reduced we will see our 
banks experiencing defaults on loan payments and becoming used 
truck industries.  Their parking lots will be full of used trucks 
that truckers will not be able to afford to put fuel in and to 
make the payments on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the cost of fuel will have a negative impact 
on our local economy by increasing the cost of goods which will 
in turn be another hard impact on consumers.  I digress, but it 
is important that we touch on these issues because they play a 
very important role in our economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to exploring the substance of the legislation. 
The bill will allow banks to set up a holding structure that 
could separately regulate subsidiaries such as retail banks, 
credit card companies and insurance firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from the insurance industry prior to my political career, 
I know how difficult and how bothered insurance companies are by 
the potential for banks to market insurance.  I am glad, and I am 
hopeful that the committee will study that.  The PC Party in no 
way supports the sale of insurance by banks.  For that matter, we 
also do not support the leasing of cars.  That is one of the 
recommendations we will be continuing to push forward at 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the bill is to allow banks to evolve to meet 
competition and, at the same time, protect consumers.  I would 
argue, however, that due to the government's slow reaction to the 
changes in the financial services sector, Canada has already 
fallen behind our global competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is clear.  After years of uncertainty from the current 
government, it has finally added some clarification and stability 
to the banking industry.  The PC Party will be supporting this 
bill and we feel that this is the first step in the right 
direction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in the debate on this important bill. We have been 
talking about this bill for more than seven years, and we are at 
least two years late in dealing with legislation on financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague, the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, on his hard work in the 
finance committee, his exceptional contribution, and the 
amendments he has moved on the legislation of banks and 
financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World competition is increasingly fierce. The six major banks in 
Canada are small, compared to their international competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we compare our big banks to the American or the Asian 
banks, especially those in Japan, we find that what is needed is 
a legislative environment conducive to increasing the ability of 
our financial institutions to hold their own against 
international competition as well as the competition that will 
inevitably begin to appear within the markets of Quebec and of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the spirit of the proposed 
legislation and several of its provisions. However, if the 
amendments that we will put forward are rejected by the House, 
we will vote against Bill C-38 for three reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-38 grants many powers to the Minister of Finance 
to determine all by himself what the future of the banks in 
Quebec will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-38 provides no guarantee that the minister will 
take into consideration the specificity of Quebec's financial 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is no concrete measure in Bill C-38 to ensure 
better access to financial services for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-38, which was introduced on June 13, 2000, the 
Minister of Finance will have the power to decide on his own the 
future of banks in Quebec. It is unacceptable for this 
discretionary power to be as strong as the act itself, if not 
stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is concerned about the fact that a single 
shareholder could, with the approval of the Minister of Finance, 
hold a 65% interest in the National Bank, the largest 
Quebec-based bank.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need for the Minister of Finance to allow this kind 
of excessive control to give the National Bank the flexibility 
it needs to continue to prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a shareholder holding 65% of the shares of a bank give 
more flexibility than 65 shareholders each holding 1% of the 
shares? We need legislative guarantees against any negative 
impact these new ownership rules might have on employment of 
professionals, consumer services, small businesses, decision 
centres and the role of Montreal as an international financial 
centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stakes are just too high to rely on only one man, the 
federal minister, especially since there are no legislative 
guarantees in the bill. Bill C-38 does nothing more than list 
some elements to consider that are under the sole control of the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, Bill C-38 is full of phrases like “The Minister may 
deem necessary” or “such and such a section of the Act will 
cease to apply if the minister so decides”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, this bill can be made to say whatever Ottawa and 
the Minister of Finance want, in terms of deciding on their own the 
future of Quebec's banks.  It is not obvious that the finance minister's 
bill will bring about more healthy competition on the national 
market. But competition is more important for our future 
economic development than the creation of big banks to compete 
on the world market. 
Nonetheless the Minister of Finance has decided to make a law 
for big banks, even if that means sacrificing Quebec banks like 
the National Bank, which is the institution for small businesses 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as consumer protection is concerned, the Minister of 
Finance remains vague and the bill is more wishful thinking than 
real political action.  The bill establishes the financial 
consumer agency, which is intended to protect the consumer, 
according to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is a staunch defender of consumer rights. 
This is evidenced by the debate that we led regarding the 
privacy legislation, Bill C-54, which became Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remind the government that Quebec already has legislation dealing with 
this issue, including the Consumer Protection Act, the Privacy 
Act and acts relating to insurance, trusts, credit unions and 
securities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of a new agency is likely to create new 
regulatory overlap with the measures already taken by Quebec in 
an area which, after all, is a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes a provision called “low-fee retail deposit 
account” which, according to the minister, seeks to ensure 
access to financial services for low income people. 
No one except the minister really knows what this “low-fee 
retail deposit account” is. No one except the minister knows 
who will be able to open such an account, and no one except the 
minister knows whether this account will be accessible 
everywhere. Why? Because all these issues will be dealt with 
through regulations. For the time being we must be satisfied 
with the minister's fine rhetoric, but this is not enough of a 
guarantee to state that consumers will be better protected by 
the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A notice by the bank is the only thing provided in Bill C-38 in 
the case of the closure of a bank branch or a reduction of 
services available to consumers. With such an unrestrictive 
provision, how can the Minister of Finance claim that there will 
be increased access to financial services? The minister is the 
only one convinced of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of problems with this bill and we intend to 
propose amendments at report stage. It is not an easy task, 
given the countless pages of the bill itself and of its 
schedules, all 900 pages of it. We realize that the 
discretionary power given to the Minister of Finance is much too 
great for a single individual.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like this Liberal government and its leader, the Prime 
Minister, who appoints all the ministers, senators, the Governor 
General of Canada, the lieutenant governors in all the 
provinces, the justices on the supreme court, and government 
officials, including those abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently, one man, the Prime Minister, had at his disposal 
the personal files of 34 million individuals, dead or alive, in 
Canada in the longitudinal file of Human Resources Development 
Canada.  He also has a file on most journalists, concocted by 
the Canada Information Office, the official propaganda organ. 
And now we have the Minister of Finance going a step further and 
wanting to decide on his own, at his discretion, the future of 
Quebec's major banks.  This sort of thing would make certain 
dictators drool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the bill, whenever there are provisions concerning 
banks, insurance companies, trusts, anything to do with the 
financial sector, the minister always reserves the right to 
determine, based on criteria known to him alone, whether or not 
an operation is acceptable. He alone defines certain concepts 
such as low-fee retail deposit accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, we would have liked more clarity regarding 
the decision making process and also more specifics regarding 
certain concepts, such as the low-fee retail deposit accounts for 
the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not oppose increased consumer protection.   However, we 
do oppose provisions that duplicate and overlap those that are 
already included in the Quebec consumer protection act. 
Consumer protection is an exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
The Liberal government has a tendency to want to centralize 
everything.  It is systematic, disgusting and often insidious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the bill is important.  It was also important that it 
be introduced in the House, but we oppose certain provisions and 
if our amendments are not approved at report stage, we will vote 
against this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this 
business of the banks, one thing catches my attention.  It is 
not necessarily something that surprises me.  There are many 
things that unfortunately have stopped surprising me in the 
House since 1993.  But this caught my attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some big banks in Canada.  There are a few, not 
dozens, that are big.  The National Bank, not to name names, is 
one of these big banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when it comes to a bill like the one before us, the minister 
establishes two categories: the big banks which are bigger and 
the big bank which is the smallest.  It happens that the latter 
is the National Bank. 
It is not surprising that it is the smallest, because it 
operates primarily in Quebec and Quebec represents only one 
quarter of the Canadian population.  It is therefore not 
surprising that it is the smallest of the big banks, but it is 
still a big bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might wonder why the Minister of Finance establishes two 
categories of big banks.  This has repercussions because the big 
banks in the privileged category will not be able to be easily 
“sold” to foreign interests, while the other big bank, the 
smaller one, will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebec were a country, it would not have considered passing 
legislation that would have allowed its big bank to fall into 
foreign hands.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that Canada's Minister of Finance wants to 
introduce legislation so that these big banks cannot fall into 
foreign hands.  But I wonder why he is prepared to sacrifice the 
smallest of the big banks, which happens to be a Quebec bank, 
and allow it to fall into foreign hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation in its present form worries me.  I am not the 
only one it worries; many others are concerned.  I repeat that 
with this legislation, the young offenders legislation and other 
legislation, I am tired of not yet having my own country.  That 
day cannot come soon enough for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Drummond could perhaps give us her view of this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
information he just gave us to add to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally agree with him. One can wonder why this bill raises 
from 10% to 20% the percentage of shares of large banks that can 
be purchased by an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The smallest bank, namely the National Bank, is based in Quebec. 
It is still a big bank, but, as my colleague explained, it 
operates in a smaller area since it is based in Quebec. An 
individual could hold 65% of the shares, which means that there 
is a greater risk of unfair competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A business person who holds a 65% interest in a bank like the 
National Bank could deny a loan to another business person, 
because this competitor could probably hurt his or her business. 
That is why we are saying that it could lead to unfair 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have one set of rules for the other big banks and 
another one for Quebec-based banks. What was the minister 
thinking when he decided to include this provision in the bill? 
Was it just another way of putting Quebec in its place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy is booming. Things are going well, but Quebec should 
not benefit from all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> The federal government, this Liberal 
government, has set itself the additional duty of centralizing 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew: </B>Things are fine in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> I would point out to the Minister for 
International Trade things are not as fine as all that.  He need 
only look at his former department, Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew: </B>Things are fine in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> If things are going well in Quebec, it is 
because there are some Quebecers who have taken charge.  His 
government is, however, still trying through every means possible 
to create problems for us and to centralize everything, because 
it wants to have all the power.  There is no way we will allow 
that to happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Rivière des Mille-Îles is one of the most beautiful 
rivers in Quebec and it is located in the Montreal region.  I 
must invite you to go down it by canoe in August.  The downriver 
excursion is a very popular event; this year more than 4,500 
people took part.  My riding is along the shores of this lovely 
river. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk of something other than lovely rivers, even it is a 
whole lot more interesting to talk of Rivière des Mille-Îles than 
Bill C-38. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs boast 
about how well things are going in Quebec, I realize he is not 
being realistic.  I tell myself he is not coming to see the 
day-to-day situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His riding is located in the heart of Montreal, so where is the 
Minister for International Trade? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, things are going well in Quebec. But if I were a federal 
government member or minister, I would not brag, because 
Quebecers are the ones who are doing all the work. Considering 
all the money that has been taken from the social transfers to 
the provinces since 1993, the minister should know that if we 
have a balanced budget in Quebec, it is not thanks to Ottawa's 
help. Heavens no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now deal with Bill C-38. It is true that I read it 
quickly, but I spent enough time on it to come to a conclusion. 
Upon reviewing this bill, I came to the conclusion that, in his 
proposed bank reform, the Minister of Finance is assuming, 
through Bill C-38, the right to be the only one to decide the 
future of banks in Quebec. If this is indeed the case, then it 
is truly worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my interpretation of this bill is right, if the minister is 
assuming this right, then it is really scary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for Drummond, delivered a 
brilliant speech, which shows that she came well prepared. Does 
she share my impression that the Minister of Finance is assuming 
the right to be the only one to decide the future of banks in 
Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague is absolutely 
right. This bill is very lengthy one that runs to 900 pages. It 
is also very complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of its provisions state that the minister, one person, has 
the final say on certain operations. When we read the bill, we 
notice that there are many provisions where the minister can 
decide arbitrarily, on a whim, when it suits him. He decides to 
accept or not. Nobody knows what his criteria are. We know 
nothing. He does not say nothing. He is assuming the right to be 
the only one to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the government did with Bill C-20. It has ignored 
Quebecers and our institutions and wants to be the only one to 
decide the future of Quebecers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased as well to speak to Bill C-38 which involves 
financial sector reform, a bill, as has been mentioned, that is 
900 pages long and certainly deserves thorough scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to listen to the Minister of Finance today 
during question period talking about generational debt.  This is 
a man, along with our Prime Minister, who was in the House in the 
eighties and nineties when that huge debt was created and a large 
part of it is due to compound interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was talking about this generation and himself as someone who 
was going to be a saviour.  It was in fact our parents and the 
men and the women who were in the war and lived through the 
depression.  They made sure their children went to school and got 
an education.  They made sure there would be pensions, 
unemployment insurance benefits and housing programs.  They made 
sure that people would have homes and that they could afford the 
gas and the heating fuel to keep their houses warm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a government that has slashed and burned those 
programs.  It was not the social programs that caused the debt. 
It was, as I said, compound interest that was paid to financial 
institutions in the eighties and nineties that caused the debt to 
spiral.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that we have a debt and that it needs to be paid, but we 
also have a debt to the homeless and to the people who are on 
emergency lists at hospitals.  People are dying because they are 
being turned away from emergency wards.  Those debts are far more 
important than the debt to private institutions such as banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a finance minister who has been visibly taking public 
money and transferring it into private hands and we have no say. 
The big announcement of an extra $12 billion goes right to the 
banks.  Nobody in the House has any say over how that money will 
be treated, who it will go to or who it should go it. It is 
completely out of our hands.  That is reprehensible and 
shocking when we have other debts besides financial debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These financial institutions are the most privileged, profitable 
and wealthy institutions in Canada but they pay very little tax 
compared to the profits they make.  They put nothing back into 
their communities.  The bill will not require them to reinvest in 
their communities.  They will be able to pull out of communities 
and end banking services at will without any recourse for the 
communities involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party, just on principle, does not support 
the bill.  There are things in it that are worth supporting but 
not in comparison to what is not worth supporting.  We do support 
the expanded power to credit unions.  We think it is important to 
modernize financial institutions and make sure there is better 
competition for insurance companies.  The bill will provide more 
power to the House of Commons in bank mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that this huge financial bill went through a screening 
in a backroom committee where no elected official or average 
Canadian could have a say.  I do not know about most members of 
parliament but I do not know any wealthy people.  Most of the 
people I know barely make it from month to month, paycheque to 
paycheque and being able to buy shoes for their kids for the 
start of school.  Most of us do not have any access to the world 
of privilege or wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP do not support the bill because it abandons the 
wide ownership rules and it will lead to a concentration of power 
into a few hands.  We do not need more public money going into 
private hands or more public power going into private hands.  In 
a democracy we want to keep power where it belongs, in the hands 
of the people as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also gives far too much power to the finance minister. 
Why would we want to do that when he already has enormous power? 
Why would we want him to have that much power over the way we 
exchange goods or the way we make decisions?  In fact, very few 
of us can get away from a world that depends on money.  The 
minister will have a final say on mergers, acquisitions, 
regulations and ownership levels, and that is just not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no accountability between a bank and its 
community.  As do some states in the United States, the bill will 
not require banks to reinvest in the communities where they have 
made their money.  Banks make their money off our money. There 
will be no guarantees of rural access to banking.  We cannot stop 
bank closures or provide no cost accounts.  It reduces capital 
requirements for small banks and there is no control on high risk 
derivative products or off balance sheet liabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 our Canadian banks made $9.1 billion in profits.  That 
kind of money seems unimaginable to the average Canadian when 
they pay $2 billion in federal tax.  The banks also got a 7% 
reduction in corporate tax in the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, banks are privileged but they do need to be dealt 
with fairly.  The financial sector does have to be reformed but 
it should not be reformed at the expense of the individual 
Canadian who has a very hard time going to the bank.  Small 
businesses struggle when approaching banks for loans.  They could 
at least invest in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say that we in the NDP oppose on 
principle second reading of Bill C-38.

Mr. Speaker, I beg your indulgence.  As you know, following

referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor 
General. 
I indicated that my understanding of the practice and procedures 
of the House was that because he did not refer specifically to

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had an opportunity in the intervening period—and this is 
the first opportunity I have had, which is why I beg the 
indulgence of the House under this point of order—to review the 
blues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General said “I am 
pleased to report to the House today that review is now 
complete”, referring to the SIRC review, “and has been 
submitted to the solicitor general”. This is important.  He says 
“There are three points in that submission that I would like to 
refer to all members of the House”.  He is referring to points 
contained in the report.  He continues, saying “The first is 
that there was no political interference as alleged in the media. 
The second is the draft report in fact indicated it was deeply 
flawed.  The third is that there is no evidence of any substantial 
nature that was part of that draft report”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his response to my supplementary question, at the conclusion 
of his response I refer you to the sentence where he stated “The 
facts today are evident and they are presented here in the 
House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, 
page 518, chapter 13.  I would like to read a portion of a 
paragraph pertaining to tabling of documents and speeches. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Speaker Glen noted in a 1941 ruling, “an honourable member is 
not entitled to read from communications unless prepared to place 
them on the Table of the House.  The principle upon which this is 
based is that where information is given to the House, the House 
itself is entitled to the same information as the honourable 
member who may quote the document.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, my argument is simply this.  I recognize that I 
have not had an opportunity to call the parliamentary secretary's 
office but I did want to be on the record as early as I possibly 
could, at the earliest possible moment, and move from making a 
request of the government but rather to state that the government 
really must follow parliamentary practice where clearly the 
solicitor general's parliamentary secretary kept referring to 
these documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of being too repetitious, I am going to read this 
again.  He said “There are three points in that submission that 
I would like to refer to all members of the House”. Then he 
elucidates on those three points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that there is a House official for the government in the 
House today.  I therefore request that he undertake to see that 
this SIRC review which was submitted to the solicitor general, 
which I have subsequently found out was submitted about a week 
ago, is tabled forthwith.

seeks to regulate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact most Canadians feel very strongly about Canadian banks. 
Most Canadians think that Canadian banks are greedy and bloated 
institutions that are not really serving the best interests of 
Canadians. 
That is why they anxiously awaited this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They waited patiently while the MacKay task force studied this 
country's financial institutions in great detail for over two 
years. That report was finally presented to the Minister of 
Finance.  He chose to implement many of the recommendations which 
have now found themselves into Bill C-38. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things that the MacKay task force dealt with covered many of the 
concerns that Canadians have.  Many Canadians came forward and 
made representations to the task force.  Even through their 
members of parliament they have come forward to complain bitterly 
about the inadequacies in the Canadian banking sector.  They have 
complained bitterly about the closing of local banks, whether 
they are in the inner city of Winnipeg, which I represent, where 
services are being arbitrarily shut down, or in rural Canada. We 
heard the Tory member speak passionately about how frustrating it 
is for the people in rural Nova Scotia who see their local 
branches being shut down, things they came to expect from our 
chartered banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that the chartered banks enjoy a privileged 
status. This is not any old business.  This is not a Home 
Hardware that can decide to build a new store in one place and 
shut down another one somewhere else.  That is completely its 
business; it is a completely private institution.  The chartered 
banks are privileged in the sense that we guarantee them a 
certain amount of business and a certain amount of profit.  In 
return they owe us a certain amount of service.  That was the 
deal.  That was the tacit agreement between the Government of 
Canada and the chartered banks.  That is why they are chartered. 
But they have broken their promise time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an era of unprecedented record windfall profits, what do they 
do?  They shut down the local branches so that seniors and inner 
city people in my riding at least do not have access. In the 
inner city of Winnipeg over 20 branches from all of the five 
chartered banks were shut down. Branches were shut down 
arbitrarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks increased service fees.  With record profits one might 
think they might be able to lighten up on the service fees 
perhaps.  They have eliminated jobs.  Every time a branch closes, 
jobs are usually eliminated. They have installed ATMs rather than 
personalized service, which many seniors are frustrated by, and 
then they have the audacity to charge customers every time they 
use the ATMs. The banks are saving a fortune in salaries by 
putting in those machines and then they have the unmitigated gall 
to charge a fee every time they are used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are real frustrations that Canadians have brought to the 
attention of members of parliament.  They had hoped they would 
have been addressed in a document like this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of shareholders are getting very active. Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know if you have ever been to a shareholders meeting of a 
major chartered bank, but I have. I crashed two of them last 
year.  I say I crashed them.  I borrowed some proxy votes and I 
visited them in the company of a wonderful man from Quebec, Mr. 
Yves Michaud, who is a champion of shareholder rights and of 
Canadians' rights in this regard.  I think he is a Canadian hero 
and should get the Order of Canada for what he does.  He goes to 
every one of those shareholder meetings of the chartered banks 
and he moves motions and amendments to try to democratize the 
corporate structure there and to force the banks to be more 
accountable to the needs of Canadians.  It is kind of fun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 1,200 people in the room all looking at their shoes. 
One would think it would be a democratic process where anybody 
could stand and move a motion or an amendment.  Only nine motions 
were moved.  All nine were moved by Mr. Michaud and seconded by 
me.  That was it for the whole program of the day, believe it or 
not.  In a room of 1,200 people one would think there would be 
more interest in how the banks are run but they were all as quiet 
as mice pretending nothing was wrong with their financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the motions we moved was to limit the executive salary of 
the CEO to 20 times that of an ordinary teller. Frankly, that is 
still a whack of dough.  The average CEO in Japan makes 13 times 
that of an average worker. The average CEO of a Canadian 
chartered bank makes 220 times that of an average worker.  It is 
unbelievable.  That motion failed.  It did not succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another motion almost succeeded.  We wanted gender parity on the 
board of directors.  The result of that vote was 49.6 to 50.4, 
numbers we might recognize as they are exactly the same numbers 
as in the last Quebec referendum by some happy coincidence.  That 
one failed just by a little.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another motion we moved was to limit the number of boards that a 
director can sit on.  George Cohon, the CEO of McDonald's, sits 
on 54 boards of directors, including the chartered banks. They 
meet 10 times a year.  How can someone possibly attend some 550 
board meetings and make intelligent rulings about how the 
organizations should be run?  I do not think it can be done. That 
is why there is a paucity of ideas and accountability at the top 
level of the banks.  Those guys just sit on the boards and they 
vote each other raises.  I am sure of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We moved a motion to limit the number of boards of directors a 
person is allowed to sit on to no more than 10. That one did not 
succeed either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an exciting exercise in trying to democratize the 
corporations.  As governments lose power and lose their ability 
to manage the economy and the corporations take over more and 
more, the only way we are going to have any democratic say is if 
we democratize corporations. Frankly these corporations run above 
and beyond the dictates of truly elected parliaments like this 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians think that Canadian banks are not good corporate 
citizens.  They are disappointed in the performance of Canadian 
banks.  They do not give a hoot about mbanx.  They want them to 
pay mtaxes.  That would be better than having mbanx.  How about 
some mtaxes from the Bank of Montreal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I will say is that John Cleghorn was a much better 
sport than Matthew Barrett.  Matthew Barrett was really nasty 
about these amendments, especially the one about limiting his 
salary.  Cleghorn at least got a chuckle out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians think that chartered banks do nothing but take and 
take and take and never give anything back in return.  That is 
the image.  It is the old Snidely Whiplash image with the top hat 
and handlebar moustache taking the mortgaged family farm at the 
first sign of danger.  That is the image. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks have a big job on their hands in terms of public 
relations.  They are spending hundreds of millions of dollars 
trying to convince Canadians that they are of warm, fuzzy, caring 
institutions that are fun to do business with.  They are anything 
but.  It is almost as absurd to watch the Liberals trying to 
paint themselves as the party of the centre left and the 
champions of health care.  It is almost that absurd and that big 
of a stretch that Canadian banks flounder around trying to 
pretend that they care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask any small business in Canada how much the banks care in 
terms of providing venture capital.  They will not lend someone 
money unless it can be proven it is not needed. Even when they 
do, at the slightest hint of any trouble in the business, they 
just demand the loan.  They call the loan, pull it right out from 
under it and another small business collapses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were hoping that Bill C-38 would have something like chapter 
11 in the United States.  I hate to look to the United States for 
ideas; it bothers me.  However the United States at least has 
this sanctuary that a business can hide out in when the banks are 
trying to blow down its house. Chapter 11 is an interim stage 
before bankruptcy.  The business calls its chapter 11 status and 
the banks cannot touch it, at least temporarily.  We would have 
welcomed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example of how unbelievably and unabashedly greedy the 
banks have become is student loans.  One of the obligations that 
was passed on to the banks in exchange for the exclusive 
privilege to do all the credit card transactions and the billions 
of dollars they get from that was to handle the student loans 
program.  They handled it for a couple of years and they were not 
making enough money so they tried to dump it and get out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party believes there should not be student loans because 
there should be free tuition.  Nobody should be paying tuition to 
go to university, but that is another issue.  If I were in charge 
of a $12 billion surplus, the first thing I would declare would 
be absolutely free tuition for every Canadian student. We can 
afford it.  It would cost $3 billion a year. It would be a great 
idea.  We would not be putting our students at the mercy of 
ruthless, greedy and bloated bankers who take advantage of them. 
I do not think that is in anybody's best interests.

like to congratulate the member for Winnipeg Centre on his speech

thinking only of his family and of himself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he prefers, since he does it so well, to take the side 
of the small shareholders, the small investors, and vigorously 
defend the often difficult cause of these people with those who 
we might call “those financial monsters”, the banks and the 
Canadian financial system, with increasing success.  To my way of 
thinking, it is very encouraging to see how the challenge Mr. 
Michaud set for himself is evolving and to see his success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit like the successes, in educational terms, the 
sovereignists have enjoyed in Quebec since the 1960s by 
explaining to the public the merits of the sovereignist proposal. 
This is what Mr. Michaud is doing with respect to the banks by 
racking up successes and a better understanding over the weeks, 
months and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this, from the member for Winnipeg Centre, is very 
flattering for Mr. Michaud, who certainly deserves it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague from Manitoba how he would 
react if one of the major Canadian banks were located primarily 
in Manitoba and doing a growing business, as is the case of the 
National Bank in Quebec, and he learned, as we Quebecers did, 
that the Minister of Finance has a particular plan in mind for 
Quebec's National Bank, the bank for small and medium business, 
by giving it distinct society status in the present instance, by 
opening the door and pulling out all the stops to enable any 
foreign company to acquire 65% of the shares of Quebec's National 
Bank, instead of limiting foreign ownership of it to 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would my dear colleague react if this were a Manitoba bank? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I believe that we would 
react very negatively to any intrusion of that nature.  The 
possibility of losing our economic sovereignty is only one step 
away from losing our sovereignty, period.  I know the people of 
Manitoba and Canadians generally do not want to see the takeover 
of their institutions by foreign enterprise and foreign agencies. 
The 10% rule was put there specifically to stop the Chase 
Manhattan Bank from taking over the Toronto Dominion Bank in the 
1960s.  It was put there for the very specific reason of trying 
to shield one of our Canadian institutions from an unfriendly 
corporate raid by American interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can honestly say to the member for Trois-Rivières that 
we would react very negatively if we were faced with similar 
circumstances as he outlined in the province of Quebec and the 
Banque Nationale. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague from Winnipeg 
Centre on his speech.  I could not have done better myself and I 
really mean that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to share with him some information which came my way 
this summer.  It was really heart-rending to get calls from 
farmers who were in danger of losing their land and of having 
their mortgages pulled.  It was very heart-rending and difficult 
to deal with but not nearly as difficult as what they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the hon. member mentioned the banks walking away from 
the administration of student loans.  I can tell him that just 
recently the chartered bank which had been doing that work in 
Saskatchewan gave notice that it will no longer do it because it 
is not profitable enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague mentioned that the banks have been given many 
benefits.  In some ways they are almost treated like an extension 
of the crown.  However, they have a corporate and social 
responsibility on the other hand from which they often walk 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my colleague about the Community Reinvestment Act. 
The New Democratic Party had that in its 1997 platform because it 
was very clear to us that many people who really needed loans, as 
my colleague said, could not get them because the banks were not 
prepared to lend to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he elucidate and give us a bit more detail on what I 
believe to be the wisdom of that kind of legislation? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Community Reinvestment 
Act is an American idea that works very well in large American 
cities.  Banks are obligated to reinvest a certain amount of 
their profits into community enterprises or small businesses or 
start-up businesses that otherwise might not have qualified for a 
loan under a more traditional setting and certainly would not 
have qualified for a loan in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes they are funding non-profits or giving bank loans to 
groups that otherwise would not qualify.  In some small way at 
least the banks are repaying for the privilege they enjoy as a 
chartered bank in this country.  We are disappointed there is no 
reference to it in Bill C-38. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to participate in this debate on an important piece 
of legislation to reform the Canadian financial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with the Canadian financial system, we should be 
aware that we are dealing with day to day operations, the savings 
of Canadians, the economic activity that should exist in all 
communities where there are institutions where we can make 
transactions and deposit our savings. This kind of bill is a 
matter of bread and butter and it concerns the economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense we could perhaps take the government to task for 
not doing enough publicity and raising public awareness of the 
importance of this bill, which is the end result of a long 
process. It is not easy to amend the Bank Act. Extensive 
consultations are necessary. It seems to me more thought should 
have been given to raising public awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something struck me when I read the bill. I would like to bring 
a number of points to the attention of the House, starting with the 
regulatory authority the bill is giving to the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about regulatory power, just as when we talk about 
the privatization of public agencies, we are talking about loss 
of control, the loss of the right to have a say in these matters 
for parliament, parliamentarians, the elected representatives 
that we are, and therefore a loss of control for the people, the 
Quebec people and the Canadian people, because things will be 
done mostly through regulations. That is the bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is a threat to democracy about which we make 
great claims. We are very good at telling people how to 
administer themselves. Canada takes great pride in doing so. In 
certain respects it may be right, but it seems to me it should 
be more concerned than it is about ensuring that the elected 
members of parliament do not lose their powers so systematically 
and regularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know as well as I do—and the matter is being debated in 
university circles—that constitutional experts are increasingly 
worried about the loss of power experienced in democracies by the 
people and their representatives. It is indicative of a certain 
form of disregard for the democratic system to which we owe our 
presence here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point that strikes me: this reform is taking 
place in a context fraught with contradictions—my colleague from 
the NDP alluded to this earlier—and we are asked to stand by 
somewhat passively. As consumers we are even more powerless and 
victimized. I am referring to the decrease in banking services in 
general, the decrease in the number of business hours and the 
increase in service charges, which is a contradiction in view of 
the decrease in services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also referring to job loss. This is another contradiction 
since banks are raking in huge profits, record profits that are 
piling up year after year to the tune of several billions of 
dollars; and the very same month, they have the nerve to announce 
they are going to lay off dozens, hundreds, thousands of bank 
employees as a result of a streamlining effort that might be 
justified. This is a tragedy across the world. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this brings us to another characteristic of banks, which is 
their symbolic value.  People talk about neo-liberalism, with its 
internal logic, the infernal logic of modern capitalism whereby 
profits are never high enough and must always be boosted.  It has 
now reached the point where if the expected profits do not 
materialize, it is the stock which takes the hit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there is a logic which is increasingly uncontrolled and which 
seems uncontrollable whereby life, for those who work, must be 
infernal, when one is subject to such pressure, always in the 
name of the great diktat of money, profit and profit for profit's 
sake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One gets the feeling, in the development strategy of all the 
banks, of the entire Canadian banking system, of an attempt at 
rationalization which is far from being to the benefit of 
consumers, which is far from being to the benefit of users, which 
is far from being to the benefit of employees, and which is aimed 
solely at profit, for example, perhaps going beyond what 
shareholders are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some interesting studies could be done of this because social 
peace, quality of life, harmony and distribution of wealth are 
concepts that so-called civilized societies such as ours hold 
dear.  Some surveys are perhaps in order.  They would show that 
the big anonymous managers of this world, with their red 
suspenders, would perhaps do better to develop greater 
sensitivity to people's real expectations, to get a better read 
on the aspirations of the public in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one specific area that is somewhat related to this, and 
to which my colleague has referred, something dear to the heart 
of my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve: the community 
aspect.  There is one striking aspect, in particular in the 
eastern part of Montreal: branch closures.  It 
seems that it could be demonstrated that the poorer the 
population, the more bank branches are being closed, and thus the 
fewer tangible, physical services are being provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The physical accessibility of services to the public is being 
decreased, services to people who are already disadvantaged, who 
may have difficulty getting around and may not be able to afford 
to.  Perhaps they have to take a bus or the metro to a bank that 
is further away because their local one has been closed, 
thumbing its nose at customers and their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is evidence of a management philosophy that must be 
deplored, a philosophy that is totally egocentric.  In a sector 
that is totally pretentious, judging by its advertising boasting 
about its services to customers, while closing hundreds and 
hundreds of branches as is systematically happening with all the 
banks, I believe there are grounds for criticism and for 
wondering where things are headed, since once again this is all 
happening within a context of huge profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other very troubling aspect to this bill: the 
discretionary power given to the minister to apply the 
legislation.  When one reads something along the lines of “the 
minister may, if he deems necessary” and “if the minister so 
decides”, these are discretionary powers that are always cause 
for concern and always troubling.  It should be made clearer. 
The minister's powers should be better defined, so as to be in a 
better position to criticize them, to assess the decisions made 
and the quality of the management, by the Department of Finance 
and its minister, of any issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious criticism, because discretionary power implies 
arbitrary decisions. And that is much more serious. It is even 
harder to protect oneself against arbitrary decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect—and this refers to the question that I asked the 
hon. member for Winnipeg Centre—concerns of course Quebec's 
largest bank, which is granted special status. That bank is 
ranked sixth or seventh in Canada, but it does business almost 
exclusively in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's National Bank is a bank that does not operate on as 
large a territory as the other major banks, but it is 
nevertheless a big bank. Under the bill, a single shareholder 
could buy its shares and hold a 65% interest in it, while the 
limit is 20% for the other banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will realize that, for us sovereignists, the 
message is very clear. Some wonder what Quebec sovereignty is all 
about; they wonder why we should have the status of a province 
when we are subjected and dominated as a people, when, in spite 
of his great competence, the Quebec minister of finance can only 
make recommendations or suggestions to his federal counterpart, 
who may or may not take them into account. This is what being 
dominated is about. This is what not being a sovereign nation is 
all about. By contrast, if Quebec were a sovereign state, it goes 
without saying that Quebec's National Bank would not be at the 
mercy of foreign investors as it is about to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will realize that there is a constitutional area 
and that the example I just provided is an illustration of 
non-sovereignty. This is what it would mean, among other things, 
for Quebecers who are listening to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect to this issue in that the federal 
government is interfering in the area of consumer protection, 
something the Quebec government is already doing very effectively 
with its own legislation. Once again, the federal government is 
sticking its nose where it does not belong, which has become a 
habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this attitude fits in with the social union 
concept, with the new aggressive and determining role the federal 
government will play in the lives of Canadians in the next 
century. The federal government will be the real government, and 
the provincial governments will be nothing more than large RCMs, 
large regional county municipalities. That may be necessary for 
the good management of Canada. It is the problem of Canadians. 
But for Quebecers, it is a disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we stay in the federation, the Quebec government will lose 
some of its powers, it will become a large regional government 
and will have all of its legislation overruled, as it is already 
systematically being done and as is being done today with this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is duplicating legislation that is 
working well, as it did yesterday with regard to endangered 
species, an area where Quebec has had its own legislation for 
years. That legislation has been very effective. The federal 
government has decided, without consultation, to legislate in the 
same area, totally ignoring everything Quebec may have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we must realize that this raises serious 
constitutional issues. 
The subject of the Banque Nationale is a good opportunity to talk 
about the Quebec model in the area of finance and venture 
capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers, as you might know and as I have come to notice when I 
was industry critic from 1993 to 1995, are the envy of many 
Canadians because of the tools we have in the area of finance. 
There is the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec, the 
Caisse de dépôt et placement, the Société générale de financement 
and the wonderful Mouvement Desjardins, despite all the critics 
we can hear about it. Thank God it is there. If the Mouvement 
Desjardins did not exist, Quebec sovereignty could well be 
unthinkable. The Mouvement Desjardins is still a free 
organization, depending on Quebec resources only and we must be 
thankful about that. Then there is the CSN's Fonds de 
développement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being interconnected, all these organizations offer us a galaxy 
of stakeholders who can reduce the risks and who invest more and 
more in some high risk and high technology areas. Thanks to them, 
Quebec is amongst the best in the world in certain areas. I am 
thinking for instance of biotechnology and aeronautics. It is 
important to recognize it, what with Bombardier being the largest 
manufacturing corporation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, when the federal government interferes in this sector, it 
touches a very sensitive subject where Quebec, as in many other 
areas, has nothing to learn from our Canadian friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I too want to pay tribute to Mr. Yves Michaud, just 
like my hon. colleague for Winnipeg Centre did earlier. Mr. 
Michaud is a great Quebecer. A former member of the national 
assembly, he was a career journalist. He represented Quebec in 
Paris with great dignity. A cultured mind and a very eloquent 
speaker, Mr. Michaud made us proud wherever he went. Today, he is 
fighting a very important and extremely worthy battle to protect 
small savers and consumers against a huge monster, the Canadian 
financial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has been scoring points. He has also been lecturing the 
financial establishment, which is really not a bad thing to do. 
Earlier, my colleague from the New Democratic Party compared the 
compensation package of the bank directors to the wages of the 
bank tellers. This is a very normal thing to do. When we compare 
ourselves to other countries, we see how far things have gone 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must give the credit to Mr. Michaud, despite some rather mean 
news reports recently aired by the CBC. Sometimes, in Quebec, we 
go for attack journalism. We had a good example then of the kind 
of petty journalism that members are probably aware of. 
Fortunately, Mr. Michaud used all of his fine qualities and 
eloquence to set things straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all I had to say. Obviously for all these reasons, 
unless it undergoes major changes, the Bloc Quebecois will be 
voting against the bill as it is and will be bringing forward 
amendments in due course.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Trois-Rivières for an excellent speech.  I 
can certainly be proud to associate myself with most of his 
comments, but there is one thing I would like to hear him speak 
further on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results from most surveys of small and medium size 
businesses show that 45% of them say that if it were not for the 
lack of venture capital they could expand their businesses and 
create more jobs.  In other words, the banks are not providing 
the venture capital that Canadian businesses need to expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke to us about the Desjardins and Caisses 
populaires as being one institution that may fill those needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour leaders with vision, like the great Louis Laberge in the 
province of Quebec, founded the solidarity fund in that province. 
In our province we have what we call the Crocus Fund which is a 
labour sponsored investment fund using union money to reinvest in 
the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell the House a bit more about men with 
vision like Louis Laberge who had the foresight to put in place 
labour sponsored investment funds that I believe fill the need so 
well for venture capital?  Could the member explain that process 
in his province a little bit more? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I am not mistaken, but when I was the critic for 
industry, it seems to me there was a clear difference between the 
situation in Canada and in Quebec as far as venture capital is 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the mechanisms we have set up in Quebec, we do not have any 
problem with venture capital. We have enough risk capital to 
finance most projects, something that would not happen in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the solidarity fund, for example, may have 
widened the gap even more. Since the same kind of initiative has 
not been taken in English-speaking Canada, differences have 
become even more striking, because we already have Desjardins, 
which is a powerful co-operative movement, whereas the credit 
unions in Canada are far from being as important.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The solidarity fund alone is as big as everything similar that 
could be found in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The venture capital problem is not the same. I do not think it 
is a real problem in Quebec, but, as the hon. member said, it is 
apparently a problem in the rest of Canada for 45% of business 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank the member for Trois-Rivières for his 
incisive remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There really are some similarities between places like 
Saskatchewan, where I am from, and many of the areas in Quebec. 
One similarity would be that there are many small towns in rural 
areas where if a bank closed down there would be a serious 
problem.  Another similarity is that we share a strong credit 
union movement and it is very good that we have credit unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about bank closures in small communities, of 
which, as I have indicated, there are many in Quebec.  Does he 
see anything effective in this legislation that would stop bank 
closures?  We do not see it.  I wonder if, from his reading of 
the bill, there is anything in the bill that would prevent the 
banks in any way or strongly hinder them from closing small 
branches at will. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> No, Mr. Speaker.  The reason this is one 
of the focuses of our criticism is that the bill provides only 
that the banks must give notice of a branch closure.  In Quebec, 
if you lay off more then 10 employees, you must give notice.  So 
there is nothing new under the sun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the need, the quasi essential role of the banks—we 
need banking services in our civilized society—under a sort of 
laissez-faire approach the banks manage this at their discretion. 
The situation is all the more unpleasant because this takes 
place in a context of huge profits, with staff being laid off all 
at once and services cut.  So, if we put that all together, we 
come up with a rather unpleasant business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a golden opportunity here to limit that, to make it more 
civilized. The law is made to civilize things a bit, but the 
government is missing the boat completely, because it says that 
the bank will simply have to give notice to those concerned, no 
doubt the Minister of Labour, in Quebec at least, when a branch 
with more than 10 employees not transferred elsewhere by the 
employer is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is totally weak and rather hypocritical, because there is 
a problem.  There are hundreds and hundreds of persons who have 
lost their jobs in the banking sector in Quebec, and the 
government is doing nothing to establish constraints to make the 
situation a little fairer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak 
to Bill C-38, which deals with the reform of the financial 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of our listeners, that means the reform of the 
whole banking network and the whole system of financial 
institutions in Canada. A review of the act takes place every 10 
years or so. I have been a member of parliament for seven years, 
and the act is now being reviewed. This is probably the only time 
it will be while I am a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is very important as it governs every financial 
transaction, not only our small deposits at the bank, but also 
any transfer of funds across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover this is happening at a time when globalization is 
changing all the mechanisms that govern how trade is conducted 
between various countries around the world, which will have an 
impact on the way financial services are structured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we must take a serious look at the whole thing and 
see if indeed the reorganization under way is interesting, 
satisfactory and good for the future of the financial system in 
Canada and more specifically in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When reading Bill C-38 one notices that it gives the Minister of 
Finance total control over the future of Quebec banks. Moreover, 
it does not give any guarantee the minister will take into 
consideration the specific nature of Quebec's financial system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point, to which we will get back later on, is the way 
the bill deals with the possible acquisition of the National Bank 
of Canada, the type of ownership that might apply to this bank 
compared to other major banks in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the kind of double standard we in the Bloc Quebecois find 
totally unacceptable. It is also unacceptable to the Quebec 
government. The minister of finance of Quebec said so in a letter 
to the Minister of Finance of Canada, dated June 7, 2000, clearly 
stating that there are four main criteria to determine what 
constitutes public interest, and these are not included in the 
legislation. As far as I am concerned they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first criterion is the effect of change on present 
activities in these banks, including the services available.  It 
must therefore be ensured that this bill has a proper 
administrative framework and is not merely dependent on the good will 
of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second effect is the effect the change will have on 
employment, both at head office and in the branches, including 
professional positions and those requiring specialized expertise. 
In other words, we do not want to see a change that would make 
banks into empty shells, which would for instance make the 
National Bank a kind of foreign entity in Quebec.  At the end of 
the day, this would mean we would not longer have any control 
over the bank itself. There would just be an empty shell, and all 
the specialized jobs, all the jobs with particular, strategic 
importance, might disappear, particularly from head office, and 
end up elsewhere. Thus we would lose the control developed over 
the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of finance of Quebec also wishes to see taken into 
account the effect of the change on the economy of Quebec and its 
technological development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire banking sector is one that is heavily impacted by 
technological change, but it is also one with a domino effect on 
business. When, for example, there is a decision to lend money to 
businesses to enable them to conform to new technological 
requirements, in order to be in a competitive position, the 
lenders must be in place and prepared to take actions that 
reflect the particular context of Quebec.  To that end, we feel 
it is important to follow up on the recommendation by the Quebec 
minister of finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last characteristic, the last condition set by the Quebec 
minister of finance is the effect of change in the financial 
sector of Quebec and the role of Montreal as a financial centre, 
particularly as far as keeping final decision making centres in 
Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these are four important criteria which the federal 
government must take into account and which are absent from this 
bill at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the start, this is an important bill. 
Changes will not be made overnight. Once passed, it will set the 
framework for financial institutions in Canada for many years to 
come. It seems important to me that Quebec's distinctiveness be 
taken into account and treated along the lines of the interests 
of Quebec as opposed to those of the Minister of Finance of 
Canada, which are very different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to emphasize another point made by the 
minister of finance of Quebec, who wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that the legislation should include mechanisms to 
ensure that measures are enforced to safeguard against the 
adverse effects of allowing an individual to hold more than 20% 
of the voting shares of a bank in aforementioned areas. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, through its finance minister, the Quebec government clearly 
cautioned that major changes must be made to the legislation. The 
Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill and will eventually vote 
against it, if these amendments are not incorporated into the 
bill per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, bills have been put forward, including one by the 
hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, dealing with community 
reinvestment, inspired by a practice existing in the United 
States, whereby banks are required to have some sort of social 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Trois-Rivières was saying earlier, and 
this is true as well in all the regions of Quebec and probably 
all the regions of Canada, concentration in the banking system 
today has the following consequence: if there were no credit 
unions in several regions of Quebec, a local banking system would 
simply no longer exist. This is because, in the past, banking 
operations were based solely on economic and financial criteria, 
without any concern for the social implications of these 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we had an ideal opportunity to include in this bill some 
major elements of the bill on community reinvestment introduced 
by the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we could have taken a page from the American experience 
and applied it to the Canadian system. In a few years, we would 
have realized that, instead of seeing our regions abandoned by 
the banks, as we have seen in the last couple years, perhaps they 
would have come back to this market in accordance with the 
requirements of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is the result of major technical work. With this bill, 
some cleaning up is being done, but there are still major points 
that need to be corrected, and not enough is being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the Bloc Quebecois considers that no concrete measures 
have been taken to give the poor greater access to financial 
services, as I was saying when I spoke about community 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has chosen to unilaterally decide the 
future of Quebec banks. Figures have come out lately and we have 
seen what is being done with the surpluses in Canada. Last year, 
the Minister of Finance announced a $3 billion surplus, which 
will actually reach $12 billion. This was well known from the 
beginning. But to avoid a debate on the way this surplus should 
be used, the budget forecasts were fudged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this new law, the Minister of Finance will have even 
greater powers, and I find this dangerous. For instance, the bill 
is full of expressions like “the Minister may, if he deems it 
necessary” or certain clauses could be applied “if the Minister 
so decides”. In other words, this bill can be made to say 
whatever the federal government and the Minister of Finance want, 
in terms of deciding on their own the future of Quebec's banks, 
among other things. This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point is that, under the bill, in a bank like the 
National Bank, a single shareholder could, with the approval of 
the Minister of Finance, hold a 65% interest in the National 
Bank, the largest Quebec-based bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance does not need to allow this kind of 
excessive control to give the National Bank the flexibility it 
requires to continue to prosper. 
Why would a situation where a shareholder owns 65% allow more 
flexibility than one where a shareholder owns 1%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, this could prove to be very dangerous. The 
Minister of Finance has not thought this through. Some 
legislative guarantees are needed to prevent any negative impact 
these new ownership rules might have on employment of 
professionals, consumer services, small businesses, decision 
making centres, and the role played by Montreal as an 
international financial centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not obvious that this bill will bring about healthier 
competition on the national market. But competition is more 
important for our future economic development than the creation 
of big banks to compete on the world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has decided to draft legislation 
benefiting the major banks. However, if that means sacrificing 
Quebec banks like the National Bank, which is the institution for 
small businesses in Quebec, he is surely aware that if he does 
not amend his law he will not have adequately met the needs of 
Quebecers or their desire to have a financial system that works 
for them, instead of the financial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back in time. Before 1960, Quebec had few experts who 
could see and understand the importance of all that. Since 1960, 
since people like Jacques Parizeau helped create the Caisse de 
dépôt et placement du Québec, since Quebec acquired such 
instruments as the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs, and the 
Fonds d'actions de la CSN, many management tools have been 
developed. We are now aware of the power of money. 
We now know that we can get tools that would help us make the 
best possible decisions in the interests of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is something we are quite familiar with. 
There are in the House sovereignists who want Quebec to have at 
its disposal the best possible tools to build its future. The day 
Quebec becomes sovereign, we will inherit a lot of federal 
statutes during the transition period and this will be one of the 
most significant. We might as well pass good legislation that 
is in the interests of Quebec and would allow Quebecers to get 
down to business the day after the referendum is won, without 
having to correct too many mistakes made under the federal 
system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we carry out our duties in the House. We will 
criticize this bill and come up with some amendments so that we 
end up with a bill that is much more acceptable for Quebec and 
for the rest of Canada, one that would give us the tools we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this opportunity, at second reading, to talk 
about consumer protection. The Minister of Finance remains quite 
vague on this issue. In my mind, what he says sounds more like 
wishful thinking than a strong political will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be in everyone's interests for us to consider this bill 
in detail and bring forward appropriate amendments. 
This bill establishes the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, 
the objective of which, according to the minister, is to protect 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has long been recognized as a champion of 
people's rights. We have had important debates on these issues, 
including on the Privacy Act, where was shown that the federal 
government had passed legislation that would not meet its 
objectives and that would have to be reviewed before long to 
ensure proper management of personal information. We have seen 
the results of such a piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internal management of information networks within the 
government is totally inadequate. I received at home some 
information from the Department of Human Resources Development. 
In its big brother database I am registered as working in the 
processing industry in Ontario. A lot of the information sent to 
me was false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I had to send it back to the government saying that the 
information was false and had to be corrected. But that 
information had been going around for years. It was used in 
studies, and we did not even know what kind of information the 
federal government had about us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same government that is unable to manage its information 
properly brought in Bill C-56, which became Bill C-6 regarding 
the protection of personal information, and it did not go nearly 
as far as Quebec went in its own legislation in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have our doubts about the finance minister's 
desire to really protect consumers. 
The financial consumer agency will create numerous regulatory 
overlaps with measures already taken by Quebec in this area.  In 
any event, it is a sector which comes under the jurisdiction of 
the provinces, of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same bill makes provision for a low-fee retail deposit 
account, which the Minister of Finance says will ensure those 
with low incomes accessibility to financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one knows exactly what this low-fee retail deposit account 
is, except for the minister.  We have not been able to get a good 
definition of it.  No one knows who would be entitled to such an 
account, except for the minister, and no one knows whether this 
account will be available everywhere, except for the minister. It 
would be nice if we knew a bit more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill gives the minister considerable discretionary power. 
What is more, in a definition that is important for those with 
low incomes, we do not know exactly how it will be managed. Since 
the legislation is revised only once every ten years, it would 
have been good to have this spelled out off the bat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this not known?  Because everything will be defined by 
regulation.  For the moment, we must be satisfied with what the 
minister has told us since we are unable to get at the meat of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if the proposed legislation is to be acceptable 
to Quebec, it will need to contain important legislative 
guarantees not now present.  The most flagrant example is what 
will become of the National Bank if the present wording of the 
bill is not changed.  The minister is given far too much 
discretion, considering the guarantees he has given us in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec must not find itself at the mercy of Canada's finance 
minister. I think that major amendments should be moved and 
accepted by the Liberal majority, so that in the end we will have 
legislation on reform of the financial system that meets a number 
of conditions, both for Quebec and for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that members read what the president of the National 
Bank had to say. He thought it could be a bit higher than 
20%—say even more than 40% or something like 49%—but this all 
has to be discussed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the 65% is concerned, I think that control of anything 
more than 50% of the National Bank, as provided for by this bill, 
is a bad thing. The bill will have to be amended within two, 
three or four years or it will put undue pressure on the finance 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current finance minister will certainly not be around until 
the end of this century. Two, three, five or ten years from now, 
we may have another finance minister. Other Canadian governments 
will make other choices, and we might not necessarily be able to 
trust the finance minister fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the current minister has already shown us that, as far 
as surplus management is concerned, we should not trust him. Nor 
can we assume that his successors will be any better. It is 
essential that Quebec's Banque Nationale be provided with 
legislative protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill, legislation that will not be reviewed 
for several years. This bill proposes many significant changes. 
There are constructive ideas on the table. The government of 
Quebec gave us advice and warnings regarding the conditions 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the federal government will act responsibly, that it 
will take the time to study these amendments, that it will agree 
with our arguments and that it will make some changes so that 
Canada's financial system will be well accepted by all sectors. 
It is important to be able to trust our financial system and, 
consequently, that this system reflect a consensus. We have not 
reached that consensus yet. Such a consensus would enable us to 
have the financial tools that would help us face globalization 
and the challenges that lie ahead of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we give these tools to every family and 
every person working in our regions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-38, a bill on the reform of financial 
institutions and banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill that has been talked about for a long time.  Much 
has been written, much uproar has ensued.  It has triggered much 
action and reaction, and one could say we are late in doing 
something, because globalization and the inevitable competition 
between major partners are among the challenges in the world 
context which is about to become ours, if it is not already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions, the Bloc Quebecois has intervened in 
this regard.  But here we are now faced with the bill as a fait 
accompli, and the government seems to be a rush to get it 
passed, so we are taking part in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not come with the bill in hand, since it is 900 pages 
long.  It is not something everyone will read, but it is a bill 
that creates rights we find insufficient.  We therefore wish to 
put on the record that, if the corrections we will be proposing 
at the report stage do not get through, we will be forced to 
vote against the bill.  I do, however, wish to state right off 
that this bill contains a number of improvements with which we 
agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note, for example, that the Minister of Finance has 
incorporated the recommendation made by Henri-Paul Rousseau that 
the financial institutions, insurance companies and various 
institutions be allowed to join together against foreign 
competition.  He has added this to his bill, and we acknowledge 
that it was not in the original.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now look at what is wrong, totally wrong, with this bill. 
First, I must say that, generally speaking, the powers given to 
the minister in the bill are way too broad and pervasive. 
Because of this discretionary power, there are still many 
provisions whose meaning remain unclear, since the minister may, 
on his own initiative, change what they appear to mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking—and once again, the Bloc will propose 
amendments—we would like more clarity regarding the processes and 
also more specifics regarding certain concepts, such as the 
low-fee retail deposit accounts for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue of discretionary power is very important to us, 
especially since it will touch upon what is at the heart of our 
opposition, that is the transformation of the ownership rules 
for the National Bank, in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect shocked us. The hon. members will understand 
that, having been my party's critic on Bill C-54 concerning the 
protection of personal information—which is, in fact, a 
provincial jurisdiction—I am extremely sensitive to the fact that 
this bill is again creating overlapping by directing how 
consumers should be protected. It is not that we do not want 
consumers to be protected when they deal with financial 
institutions, but we know that they are better protected by 
Quebec laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And there are many in this area. There are the Privacy Act, the 
Act respecting Insurance, the Act respecting Trust Companies, 
the Quebec Savings Banks Act and the Credit and Securities Act, 
to name a few. There is also the privacy bill, which is 
undergoing radical change in order to take into account the 
impact of electronic commerce. This is a very interesting bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why oppose a bill supposedly intended to protect consumers? For 
an extraordinarily simple reason: because consumer protection 
legislation has to be simple and easy to understand and to 
enforce. It must be easy and simple for consumers to understand 
what their rights are and how they can ensure they will be 
upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's privacy law is cited all over the world for its 
clarity, for the ease with which the citizens can win their 
case, and for its ongoing implementation in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a citizen has a problem and wonders “Under which act am I 
protected? What are my rights? Are these rights provided under 
the Credit and Securities Act or under the Privacy Act?”, there 
is a problem. This grey area, which could even make it possible 
to make a complaint under both acts, but also to miss deadlines 
at one point or another, is not a good way to protect consumers. 
The Bloc Quebecois will certainly follow this situation very 
closely.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not talk about the whole issue of 
community investment. As my colleagues said before me, the hon. 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve has conducted a remarkable 
campaign on the necessity for the banks to assume greater 
responsibilities in depressed communities and in isolated areas 
experiencing economic difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, banks should systematically invest in communities, 
because they do benefit from regulatory protection. They should 
therefore agree to assume responsibility for the impacts of 
their activities on consumers, constituencies, regions, the 
environment and this, of course, in each of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague argued that banks have an unfortunate tendency to 
avoid depressed communities and to prefer economically healthy 
areas. When they choose to stay in a depressed community because 
there are profits to be made, there is generally no correlation 
between the amounts of the deposits they take in and the amounts 
they give out in loans and cash advances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague's system is based on American legislation passed 
in 1970, which completely changed the relationship between the 
banks and the citizens namely by forcing representatives of the 
citizens and of the banks to sit together and look at how they could 
help improve the situation of the most disadvantaged in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the first thing to do to help those persons is to 
allow them to open a bank account. That is the very first step. 
The bill provides for a low-fee deposit account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since the application of this provision and its real 
content are not known, we say that until we know we are 
concerned, because I think everyone was made aware by the 
campaign, and at that time, not just by our colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, by the need to ensure that everyone can 
at least open a bank account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members know that this is far from being a sure thing and 
that the reasons given or not given have to do with income, 
length of employment, credit cards, which we can or cannot show, 
to prove our solvency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue we consider very important, and we think that 
the bill would be vastly improved if it contained a provision 
that would permit something similar to what is done in the 
States—when the States has good things to offer, we should use 
them—that would permit dialogue as is the case with other 
businesses and other representatives of the public to ensure that 
these financial players help the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ombudsman is a step in the right direction, but it is far 
from enough.  I note that up to now, the ombudsman has been 
appointed by the banks.  When I sat on the Standing Committee on 
Industry, I heard the banks regularly defending their record on 
loans to SMBs.  I myself bore witness to the fact that the 
ombudsman had good intentions, but lacked authority because he 
was appointed by the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points causing the greatest difficulty are extremely 
important for the Bloc Quebecois.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the majority of Quebec members are from the Bloc 
Quebecois, we can argue that we are talking on behalf of Quebec. 
We can question the change this bill makes to the ownership rule 
for the big banks. But where the ownership of the only big bank 
in Quebec, the National Bank, is concerned, we cannot support the 
change the Minister of Finance is proposing in this bill. We said 
so loud and clear and we will come back to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of our fellow citizens watching the debate I 
would like to mention that up until now, the Bank Act provided 
for the splitting of the shares by prohibiting any single 
individual from owning more than 10% of the shares and having 
control over the banking industry, which could have been risky 
for businesses as well as for the economy and consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of pressures exerted upon him and changes in the world 
economy, the minister has decided that a single shareholder can 
now own 20% as opposed to only 10% previously. You can rest 
assured that we will discuss and question this decision. That 
change affects the big Canadian banks only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But why allow a single shareholder to own up to 65% of the 
shares of the only big bank in Quebec, the National Bank? When we 
think about all the risks this reform would involve, we do not 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at history, we can see that Quebec has experienced 
serious problems over the years in exercising relative control 
over its economy. One of the main reasons for that, at the 
beginning of the century and before that, was the lack of 
capital. The popular phrase then was “French Canadian” or 
“controlled by French Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to historians, the collapse of Quebec-owned businesses 
after World War I was due to the fact that, because of the change 
and because of insufficient funding, all those businesses were 
bought by British or American capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many economists—and I am thinking of the École des hautes 
études commerciales where so many economists and businessmen have 
received their training—began to understand that Quebec needed 
its own capital. Jacques Parizeau, distinguished professor at the 
École des hautes études commerciales, is among those who were 
taught by François-Albert Auger and others. So it is a good thing 
that we now have the National Bank and the Caisse de dépôt et 
placement, as well as the Fonds de solidarité and the Fonds 
d'actions, which came later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that venture capital is now available in Quebec. The 
National Bank is one important element of this trilogy and we 
will not let it become vulnerable to foreign control, which could 
even lead to its dismantling. It could be taken over just to 
create competition. I will add that one extremely important 
characteristic of the National Bank is the fact that it caters to 
the needs of small and medium size businesses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course other banks do get involved, but it is the small and 
medium size businesses' bank. We know to what extent they are 
part of the Quebec economy and its distinct nature. For this 
reason, we must protect the National Bank against being owned by 
one individual, which could result in a change in its original, 
main vocation, and worse yet in its being taken over by foreign 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will fight tooth and nail to avoid this, and I believe Quebec 
and Quebecers will be behind us to oppose others who might favour 
interests other than those of the small and medium size 
businesses and their ability to access capital and use it through 
a bank such as the National Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could mention other elements of the legislation, but my 
colleagues and I wanted to stress the essential. The members of 
our party who sit on the Standing Committee on Finance will work 
very hard, as usual, but I wanted to say that they will have the 
strong support of all the members of the Bloc Quebecois and also, 
we are convinced, of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that the Quebec government, through Mr. Landry, was 
very clear and suggested adding to the minister's discretionary 
criteria four other criteria that would be more definite and that 
would stress the link between the economic situation, employment 
and services. It is surprising that these criteria are not 
included in the basic criteria the finance minister is looking at 
in his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your attention. It is always a help 
for us members of parliament, when we need to be convincing, to 
be able to address not the Chair, but the Speaker himself, who 
might even enjoy from time to time the fact that we are really 
addressing our remarks to him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I notice that every time I rise in the House, you 
make an effort to remember the full name of my riding. I hope 
everyone will remember. You do so in French and your French is 
constantly improving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this bit of humour, I want to remind Quebecers who are 
listening to us—it is suppertime and some people like to play 
with the remote control—to make sure, before they eat their 
dessert, that they know what we are debating here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us will allow the federal Minister of Finance to 
decide the future of federally chartered banks in Quebec. What 
does this mean? My colleague, the hon. member for Mercier, 
explained it very well. The National Bank which, for most 
Quebecers, is the bank for small and medium size businesses, 
could come under foreign control. 
This means that its head office could be moved. These things 
could happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are listening to us, in particular people in the Gaspe 
Peninsula, always want their member of parliament to come back 
home as often as possible, so as to keep informed of their 
problems. If, some day, I were to retire from the House and 
always stay away, how could I be aware of the needs of the 
constituents whom I represent? I realize that it is not quite 
the same thing for banks, but it is important to be close to 
one's customers. I am sure my colleague can comment further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could I, as a legislator, as the representative of the 
constituents of Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, give a 
blank check—the expression is appropriate since we are talking 
about an act amending the Bank Act—to the Minister of Finance, 
when his bill is full of expressions such as “the Minister may, 
if he deems it necessary”? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He can do as he pleases, for Quebec and for the Gaspe.  He can 
decide to do the right thing, but in six months we might 
suddenly have a different minister.  Everyone is talking about 
elections. What would happen if there were someone else in the 
portfolio? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to ascribe bad intentions to the present minister, 
although sorely tempted, but if we change ministers, then what? 
If people want to make amendments, according to how they see 
things, and knowing their way of operating and how the electoral 
system works today, I would dearly love to see what 
contributions will end up being made to the campaign expenses of 
future ministers of finance.  I will keep a list of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banking system has influence.  If we as legislators make the 
decision immediately, and leave as little as possible to the 
discretion of a Minister of Finance, which is I believe what the 
banks and small and medium business want, then we will be have 
some very clear rules to go by.  I do not think that this bill 
as it stands is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave my colleague from Mercier to comment on this 
statement, but in my opinion it is not, at this time, worth the 
paper it is printed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, as usual, the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok has a way of putting 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we are going to hear this description again.  No, 
we cannot give a blank cheque to the Minister of Finance when it 
comes to the future of the National Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, the National Bank is the only Quebec-based bank.  It is 
a mid-sized bank.  It is smaller than the major Canadian banks. 
But it is Quebecers' major bank and it is the bank that finances 
small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been on the Standing Committee on Industry long enough to 
know that these businesses have tremendous difficulty getting 
financing from the other banks.  The other banks prefer to make 
loans to the rich.  The Bible warned us about this.  We see it 
regularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we must ensure that this bank remains in Quebec's hands, that 
it is not controlled by one person. Such a person could be from 
another country and could break it up and take it in a 
completely different direction, but he could also be a big 
industrialist who would want to change the rules of competition 
so that he would not have to make loans to small and medium size 
businesses that were not to his liking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way can we agree to what this bill is proposing, for the 
economic health of Quebec, for the ability to retain control 
over the important part of the economy that these businesses 
represent, and we know that they are much more important in the 
economy in Quebec than anywhere else in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister not say that what is good for the National 
Bank would be good for Canadian banks?  Why have departmental 
officials said that they are worried about control? 
If they are worried about control of the major Canadian banks if 
they increase the percentage of shares that may be held by one 
individual from 10% to 20%, it only makes sense to be even more 
worried about control if one person is allowed to hold 65% of 
the shares in the National Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly unacceptable.  We cannot even consider this 
proposal.  It is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say, like my colleague, that the Minister of Finance's 
intentions may be good.  I saw a press release that said he 
wanted to help us.  That kind of help we do not need.  What we 
want is a rule that will guarantee us that control will remain 
in Quebec.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK193">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ) </B>moved that Bill C-211, an act to amend the Income Tax Act 
(travel expenses for a motor vehicle used by a forestry worker) 
be read the second time and sent to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, the name of the bill is a bit 
unprepossessing, but I would like to summarize its intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, it serves to allow forestry workers like those who 
work in my region—in the Basques, Saint-Jean-de-Dieu, Saint-Médard 
regions and throughout the Gaspé—who, in earning their living, 
have to go and work in Abitibi or on the North Shore and have to 
provide their own equipment, such as a pick-up, skidders, 
gasoline or a chain saw, to enjoy certain deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill came out of a meeting with a forestry worker from 
Saint-Jean-de-Dieu and a meeting with several forestry workers, who 
work in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation at the moment is that, with the partial deduction 
the law currently provides, they cannot make enough profit to 
make it worth their while working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, tax legislation discourages people from going to work 
elsewhere, and yet this is the only sort of job available.  They 
would like a more appropriate tax deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can I say that the current legislation does not fully 
satisfy them?  First, I wrote to the Minister of National 
Revenue on May 18, 1999 to ask for an interpretation of the law 
that allegedly permitted an appropriate tax rebate, a large 
enough tax credit to enable these people to get a tax deduction 
for travel costs.  The law as it stands contains no such 
provision.  The Minister of National Revenue confirmed this in 
his response to my letter of May 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a reply three months later and I wrote to the 
Minister of Finance on August 13, 1999, to tell him, since he is 
responsible for this issue, that a change to the act was 
absolutely necessary to allow these workers to have a decent 
income, to continue to work. Indeed, our tax laws must be an 
incentive to work, not a disincentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance replied to me on September 30, 1999. Let 
me read two paragraphs from his letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In your letter, you ask if it is possible to consider these 
expenses as employment expenses, since there are some benefits 
related to working on a specific site or in a remote area that 
may be excluded from a worker's income, as long as they are 
reasonable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter then explains that this somewhat changes taxation 
practices, but adds: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the costs associated with transportation between a 
person's residence and place of work are not generally 
deductible, I submitted your concerns to the attention of my 
staff. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I am very pleased that my bill can be debated in the 
House. This allows me to provide the Department of Finance with 
valid arguments to enable it to reach a conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 22, 2000, a few days before the budget, I asked the 
minister whether his staff had finally done the studies and 
reached a conclusion. Again, I got a reply from the Minister of 
Finance, but only in June 2000. That reply is still positive. 
The Minister of Finance says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What constitutes a reasonable level of expenses for motor 
vehicles is a complex issue that requires a thorough study. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That thorough study sure is taking a long time. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The review of this issue and of other components of the tax 
system concerning motor vehicles is still going on. We will 
inform you of the results as soon as it is completed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been looking at this proposal for a year and a half. 
I find it quite interesting that the Minister of finance has 
told me twice that this proposal has some merit and that it is 
worth exploring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, on the basic principle that would give a tax deduction 
to workers who have to travel long distances to go to work and 
are forced to use their car, I think it is justifiable. This 
would help reduce unemployment in regions like ours and would 
promote economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a forestry worker comes back to his family after two weeks 
on the job, he has a pay cheque, he can support his family, he 
can spend a little money to make sure that he has all the tools 
that he needs to go back to work. There is some economic 
activity there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the finance minister asks for detailed figures, he will find 
out that it is much better to help these people who have to 
drive far to go to work by giving them an appropriate tax 
deduction than to close the door on them, to entice them to stay 
at home, to push them into not going to work and becoming a 
burden on society, thus adding to the unemployment rate in a 
region that is already badly affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these good reasons, and because I think it would be 
worthwhile for these workers to persevere in pushing for this 
bill, I urge the government, the Liberal majority in this House, 
to consider passing this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we voted on a bill aimed at lightening the tax burden 
of mechanics, a bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, which was put to a 
vote in this House as a private member's bill and has gone on to 
the next stage.  It has somewhat the same objective: to provide 
a proper tax deduction for the tools all mechanics must supply 
for their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This one deals with forestry workers, and in this case it is not 
a box of tools but a truck and all the equipment required for 
work in the bush.  The two bills have the same underlying 
principle.  I would like to get the same open-minded attitude 
from the Liberal majority and from all members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also taking advantage of the fact that we are in the 
prebudget consultation phase. 
A letter has come from the member heading the standing finance 
committee indicating that there is a prebudget consultation 
exercise to be carried out this year again, in order to ensure 
that the people of Canada may receive the best possible services 
from their government and the encouragement to accomplish things 
and take their place within society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a concrete example on which a quick decision could be 
reached on behalf of people who are very hard-working, who do not 
have easy lives, who do not get to go home every night, who 
often have to do what we call down our way “two week runs”. 
They work away from home and have to sleep in camps where 
conditions are not always ideal, they have to put up with 
difficult conditions.  Sometimes they pretty well have to sleep 
in their trucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe they deserve respect and deserve to be protected from 
personal bankruptcy.  When people buy a pickup truck that can 
easily cost $25,000 if they want something decent, they do not 
buy them for their cool looks but because they are needed for 
getting to work.  This is what they need to do their job

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think our forestry workers deserve the recognition of the 
House. There are all kinds of tax deductions. In the case of 
businesses being allowed a deduction for season tickets for 
hockey or other professional sports, the deduction can be 
justified because it helps maintain jobs. A similar deduction 
costing a lot less would allow forestry workers to earn a 
living, to feel the dignity of being workers, to travel to their 
place of work, not to make fabulous profits but to earn enough 
income to keep on working. I think the government should 
consider doing this for these workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a very complicated bill. Basically, it requires only a 
little sense of fairness on the part of those who would pass it. 
If it needs a little polishing in committee, we will be 
listening to see if some changes can be made, but it is obvious 
that the current legislation does not allow these needs to be 
met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made all the necessary representations to the appropriate 
officials and we came up against the fact that, under the 
current legislation, they cannot grant an adequate and 
satisfactory tax deduction that really takes into account the 
need for pick-up trucks and related material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislators must take their responsibilities. Our forestry 
workers deserve our attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years, we saw that we wanted workers to have 
jobs. 
They would like to turn seasonal workers into machines and ship 
them all over Canada to work. These workers are often willing to 
drive 200, 300, 400 or 500 kilometres a week just to get to 
their workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe they deserve our attention and this tax benefit. It 
would only be fair and respectful of the work they do. This 
would also be an opportunity for rural communities to get enough 
extra income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well to say that rural communities must look to 
new technologies, but the fact remains that primary natural 
resources are one of the important components of the economy 
both in Quebec and Canada. We must ensure proper management of 
these components. Forest use must be maximized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forestry workers have developed an expertise in a given area. If 
they are not allowed to go to work far from their home and to 
make a decent living, their expertise will be lost altogether, 
they will exit the labour market and will not find work in other 
sectors, thus becoming a burden for society. This is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I call on the members of this House to consider my 
proposals. At the end of today's debate, I will have the 
opportunity to rise again. I hope I will be able to say that I 
have the agreement of everybody in the House in order to move 
toward tangible results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will be able to say to the finance minister “You have 
studied the matter, you say that you have not yet completed your 
review, but the stakeholders and the members of this House want 
a practical solution, that is giving forestry workers in Canada 
a proper tax rebate”. I believe forestry workers deserve nothing 
less.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the number of private members' 
bills that are coming forward are very creative, imaginative and 
are keeping the Department of Finance, the Minister of Finance 
and his parliamentary secretary very busy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I am not the bad cop today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some sympathy for the member's bill.  Before I was 
elected in 1996, I worked for 20 years in the forestry sector. 
The workers in this sector are very professional.  They are 
people with whom I have done a lot of work. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the intention of this private member's bill 
is to amend the Income Tax Act to permit, in certain 
circumstances, forestry workers to deduct for tax purposes motor 
vehicle expenses related to travel between their residences and 
places of work. 
Deductible costs would include not only the day to day out of 
pocket expenses required to operate the vehicle, such as 
gasoline, repairs and maintenance costs, insurance and licence 
fees, but also capital cost allowances.  That is the depreciation 
on the original cost of the vehicle and interest costs associated 
with any loan taken out to acquire the vehicle.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill raises a number of issues that need to be examined 
carefully.  In examining these issues, a number of policy 
principles must be considered. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important tax policy considerations is that of 
fairness.  That is that the tax change be fair, not only to the 
taxpayers directly affected by the change, but also to all other 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second important tax policy consideration is that of 
simplicity.  Can taxpayers understand and comply with the tax 
change and can the proposed tax change be readily administered 
and enforced by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency?  Another 
consideration is how the proposed tax change impacts on the 
fiscal resources of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes to permit forestry workers to deduct 
employment income motor vehicle expenses related to travel 
between their residence and their place of work.  Permitting such 
a deduction would represent a major departure from a 
well-established tax policy which has been in place for many 
years. The cost of driving to and from one's place of employment 
is considered to be personal driving.  As such, costs associated 
with personal driving are considered to be personal and therefore 
not deductible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I was first elected in 1996, I spent a number of years in 
the forestry sector.  Even with that predisposition I cannot 
think of any rationale that would justify providing this benefit 
to forestry workers but not to workers in other sectors.  I agree 
that forestry workers often have to work far from their home in 
relatively remote locations whether it is doing silviculture 
work, tree planting, thinning or spacing or whatever the case may 
be.  However, forestry workers are not unique in this regard. 
Most employees have to commute to work and incur costs in doing 
so.  Some employees may have to travel relatively long distances, 
like forestry workers, to remote work locations.  However, it 
would be difficult to justify providing a tax deduction solely 
for forestry workers, as this private member's bill proposes, at 
the exclusion of other individuals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the issue that this bill raises relates to the much 
broader issue of the deductibility of employment related 
expenditures more generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most workers incur costs connected, in one way or another, to 
their employment.  In addition to the cost of commuting to and 
from their work location, in the past, taxpayers and their 
representatives have sought tax relief for work related 
expenditures such as personal computers; professional journals; 
skills upgrading; business and construction safety clothing; and 
home office expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Providing tax relief to employees in all of these situations 
would be a major shift in policy and would result in a 
significant fiscal cost. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, a second issue that must be carefully considered 
in examining this bill is that of simplicity.  Can taxpayers 
understand and comply with the tax change and can the proposed 
tax change be readily administered and enforced by the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have extensive provisions that permit the deduction 
of automobile expenses from business and employment income in 
certain circumstances and within certain limits.  These rather 
extensive provisions are intended to ensure that all taxpayers 
are treated in a fair and consistent manner.  However, taxpayers 
often express concern about the complexity of these provisions. 
This bill would only increase the number and length of the 
provisions devoted to automobiles by providing a unique tax 
benefit to forestry workers that other employees are not entitled 
to. By confining this benefit to forestry workers, the bill requires 
the crafting of a definition of forestry workers eligible for 
this tax benefit.  However, developing an appropriate definition 
broad enough to include a variety of work situations yet narrow 
enough to focus the benefit to those taxpayers for which it is 
intended would be extremely difficult and could lead to increased 
uncertainty for taxpayers and increased administrative and 
enforcement concerns for the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that there is a need to reduce the tax burden of 
Canadians.  However, providing focused tax relief to employees in 
specific sectors is not the way to go.  Rather, as outlined by 
the government in its last three budgets, it is better to provide 
broad-based tax relief to all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 2000 budget alone, the government proposed that federal 
personal income taxes be reduced by an average of at least 15% 
over the next five years.  The proposed budget measures will 
ultimately benefit each and every Canadian taxpayer by 
retroactively restoring full indexation of the personal income 
tax system effective January 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the budget proposes to: first, reduce the middle 
income tax rate to 23% from 26%; second, increase the amount of 
income that Canadians can earn tax free to $8,000; three, raise 
the income amounts where middle and upper tax rates begin to 
apply to at least $35,000 and $70,000 respectively; and finally, 
eliminate the 5% deficit reduction surtax for people with incomes 
up to $85,000 effective July 2000 and completely phase it out 
over the following five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget also provided further support to Canadian families by 
the expansion of the Canada child tax benefit by $2.5 billion a 
year to more than $9 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The personal income tax cuts proposed are even larger when 
combined with actions taken in the budgets of 1997, 1998 and 
1999.  The combined effect is that federal personal income taxes 
will be cut by an average of 22% over all, 26% for low and middle 
income Canadians and 30% for families with children by the year 
2004-05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the personal tax cuts outlined in 
the 2000 budget reflect the least, not the most, that the 
government will do and we will accelerate those tax measures, I 
am quite confident, in budget 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more that the forestry sector plays an 
important role in the Canadian economy.  I have met and worked 
with many of these professionals.  This sector contributes 
significantly to our gross domestic product and the large volume 
of exports contribute significantly to our balance of trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This industry provides work to many hard working Canadians. 
However, for the reasons I mentioned, I hope the members here 
would support the position I outlined.  To create this 
provision for forestry workers alone, to restrict it and not 
allow it for other workers in other sectors and to create a 
precedent with respect to the deductibility of travel expenses 
from home to the workplace would create an unnecessary and costly 
precedent.  I urge members to vote against the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the Bloc member's private 
member's bill, Bill C-211, on tax reductions for forestry 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to say that I fully support the issue that all 
workers in the country are crying out for tax deductions.  There 
is absolutely no question with respect to that.  I want to talk a 
bit about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-211 is specifically targeted at forestry workers who want 
another tax deduction.  I want to focus on the larger picture 
which is the taxation levels in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we watched the Prime Minister.  Ironically, he announced a 
$12.3 billion surplus.  To his credit, he did put it on the debt. 
However, I have some concerns.  Only months ago that he was 
forecasting a $3 billion surplus.  I question who is doing the 
accounting for the government.  We have a 400% increase in the 
amount of the surplus and one has to question exactly how this 
happened.  Is it happening because there will be election weeks 
or months away?  We know we are within a six month election cycle 
and all of a sudden we have a $12 billion surplus.  We saw this 
type of what I call bean counting in British Columbia where 
months before an election there was great surpluses and months 
after the election there were great deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  That was the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  That is exactly right, as the member 
yelled across to me.  That was the NDP but again, we are seeing 
exactly the same scenario here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see how they arrive at these numbers.  In the first 
quarter of this year alone the surplus reported by the Department 
of Finance was $11.4 billion.  There is only one way that the 
government gets money and we all know that is from our back 
pockets.  The government collects money from taxes.  That is one 
source of revenue.  Clearly we have to look at what has been 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes it is time for real tax cuts for 
working Canadians.  They need these tax cuts.  There is all kinds 
of evidence to substantiate this.  We can look at the standard of 
living of Canadians.  It has been dropping dramatically over the 
last 10 years.  Today the worker's purchasing power is much less 
than it was 10 years ago.  There are all kinds of reports and 
statistics to back that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get taxes down.  Since 1993, the Liberal government 
has raised taxes over 60 times.  It claims it has deducted taxes. 
I challenge Liberals to to go to the working people in their 
ridings and ask them to pull out their paycheques from today and 
compare it to two years or four years ago.  Working people have 
less money to take home.  There is only one reason for that.  The 
current government has raised and raised taxes.  What are they 
left with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance reported a $12 billion surplus. The 
government has put that on the debt but I am a little curious to 
see what kind of numbers we will get after the election.  Maybe 
we can go back and look in <I>Hansard</I> when the government 
comes back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, to back this up, our standard of living has gone down. 
Let me give a couple of quotes.  This comes from the OECD: “One 
of the most important determinants of the standard of living is 
productivity which is a measure that attempts to capture the 
efficiency and productive inputs and technical progress”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  This has to do with forestry workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is yelling this 
has to do with forestry workers.  The issue here is taxation 
levels.  The private member's bill is specifically trying to 
reduce the taxes of forestry workers.  He has brought back a 
private member's bill to bring in more tax deductions for the 
workers in his riding.  I fully support the need for tax 
reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member across that it would not be fair to give 
tax deductions to just the forestry sector.  We cannot just 
provide tax reductions to forestry workers, or as the government 
would probably like it to members of parliament.  In fact, we 
need to bring in tax deductions for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me continue on.  These are statistics from Canada.  The OECD 
went on to state: “While productivity growth appears to be 
better in Canada than anticipated, there continues to be a wide 
gap in the productivity level compared with the United States, 
Canada's most important economic partner.  This gap is reflected 
in a substantially lower standard of living in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go out and talk to the people in our ridings, they will 
tell us that they are struggling, that there is no money for 
extras and that there is less every month to pay the bills. 
That is strictly because we have seen one increase after another 
by the government.  It is reaching into people's back pockets and 
we have to change that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that the Canadian Alliance is committed to 
reducing people's personal taxes with meaningful tax relief, not 
punishing people who are successful.  These are the people who 
power the economic engine.  We are saying that we want to provide 
tax relief to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have people in my riding who are earning less than $20,000 and 
should not be paying any taxes.  We would take them right off the 
tax rolls, yet the government continues to tax them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I struggled with whether I wanted to run for parliament back in 
1997.  One of the passions to which I was committed was that the 
aspirations and dreams of my generation were being shattered 
strictly through taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear of and talk about the brain drain. It is one of my 
greatest frustrations.  It is not the significant number of 
people who are leaving Canada, but it is the very best, the very 
brightest, the economic engine of the country in 15 or 20 years. 
It is the entrepreneurs, the people who will create jobs in 
Canada for other people.  They are flocking to the states.  Why? 
It is because of the tax levels in this country.  It is time for 
meaningful tax relief which they will feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $12 billion is not the Minister of Finance's, the Prime 
Minister's or the government's money.  It is taxpayer money.  We 
need a plan where we can give taxpayers real, meaningful tax 
relief.  We are committed to doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a laudable goal by the member from the Bloc who brought 
this issue forward.  I too have worked in the forest industry.  I 
spent five years working at Crestbrook Forest Industries.  I have 
a lot of friends in the forest industry.  It would be very easy 
for me to stand here and say that we should provide tax relief 
just to one sector, the forest sector which is huge in British 
Columbia, but we have to look at reality.  We cannot start 
providing tax relief targeted specifically to one occupation or 
one sector of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need tax relief for all Canadians.  We in the Canadian 
Alliance are 100% committed to doing that.  Jurisdictions all 
over the globe such as Hong Kong and Ireland have brought in 
meaningful tax relief, and what has happened?  We have seen those 
economies flourish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that it attracts the best and the brightest. 
Economies flourish and the wealth created by the private sector, 
not by the government, allows us to have the social programs that 
are dear to our hearts.  We can put the money into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-211 is asking for a tax deduction for one sector.  It is 
obviously not doable.  It needs to extend to all Canadians.  I am 
very proud that the Canadian Alliance is committed to providing 
meaningful tax relief to every Canadian.  Their standard of 
living would increase.  It would allow our best and our brightest 
young people to stay in the country.  It would turn around the 
tax increases we have seen year after year after year by this 
government.  I can count over 60 sneaky, hidden tax increases. We 
can turn those around and start putting money back in the hands 
of the taxpayer, not in the hands of the government.

pleased to speak to Bill C-211, an act to amend the Income Tax 
Act, relating to travel expenses for a motor vehicle used by a 
forestry worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques is an 
initiative that I also feel strongly about. The bill would allow 
forestry workers, who have to travel long distances in a motor 
vehicle between their place of residence and their workplace, to 
benefit from a reasonable tax deduction, which, in this case, I 
find adequate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, Bill C-211 would allow a forestry worker, under 
certain conditions, to deduct from his income the interest paid 
on money borrowed to acquire the motor vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, a forestry worker would be able to deduct from his income 
expenses related to the wear and tear of the motor vehicle. This 
bill means a lot to forestry workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, Revenue Canada considers the use of such a motor 
vehicle as a use for personal reasons by forestry workers who 
have to travel long distances to get to their workplace. 
Consequently, these workers cannot claim travel expenses from 
their residence to the logging area. 
What this means is that Revenue Canada does not consider that 
these workers need to travel to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at forestry workers, and this is where I disagree 
with my colleague from the Alliance, there is a major difference, 
and that is what my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois is trying 
to point out with his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forestry workers do not work all year round, they are seasonal 
workers. When spring comes around, they have to contract loans. I 
think it is one of the only Canadian industries where people have 
to buy their own tools, such as chain saws, that cost $850 plus 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year, the forestry worker, the logger who goes off to the 
logging area has to buy a new saw. That costs money. Unlike other 
workers, he does not work all year round. The seasonal worker, 
the logger has to survive on employment insurance for part of the 
year, at least six months. 
He has to make do with 50% of his income because of the cuts 
Liberals made in 1996. EI benefits have been slashed by half. 
These workers are punished left, right and center. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I feel I have to support the bill introduced by my 
colleague from the Bloc, because these workers deserve a break. 
Each spring, these workers have to fork out a lot of money after 
spending the winter on employment insurance, because they cannot 
log all winter long. They end up with debts after spending the 
winter on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am going to support this bill. 
It is all well and good for the Canadian Alliance to say 
that all Canadians must be treated equally, but in the meantime, 
we must take into account the plight of our forestry workers. 
According to Alliance members, Canadians should not have to pay 
any taxes or everyone will want to move to the United States. I 
will say one thing. I would rather live here, in Canada, the best 
country in the world, than in the United States, where they have 
a two tier health care system. They may pay less taxes, but going 
to the hospital can easily cost $10,000. In my opinion, that is a 
form of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Acadie—Bathurst, the forest industry is 
important. Nearly half the people are seasonal workers, either in 
fisheries or forestry. These jobs are important for our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, and I will repeat it because apparently before people 
get it into their heads, it must repeated 28 times: in my riding, 
the forestry worker who is lucky to work 15 or 20 weeks ends up 
unemployed the rest of the year, because there are no jobs. He is 
not a seasonal worker, but he works in a seasonal sector. He ends 
up with half an income for the rest of the season and in the 
spring, he must buy a chain saw even if he would appreciate 
getting a little tax break then. With the little tax break that 
he gets, which is a tax refund, he has to buy a chain saw in 
order to go to work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the hon. member opposite remembers the visit we 
made to loggers in the Prince George area. This is not an easy 
job, because we cannot bring the forest into the city. Loggers 
have to go into the forest, miles away from home; they have to 
travel and leave their family behind for weeks. When they come 
back on Friday night for the weekend, they are exhausted. They 
are home Saturday, and on Sunday, they go back to the logging 
camp. That is what loggers do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the government could recognize their work by giving 
them some tax relief, such as the one proposed by my hon. 
colleague in his private bill. I think this is the best thing to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance members come from a region where there are many 
loggers, but they are not prepared to give a break to a specific 
group like this one. 
However, they want to have a tax, what they call the flat tax, 
to give a break to all the millionaires in this country and all 
the people who make over $100,000 a year, giving them a tax cut, 
so that they do not have to pay as much tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But they are not prepared to do anything in support of the 
forestry workers, not prepared to treat them as special workers. 
Yet these workers are special, because they are the ones who go 
out in the woods to cut down our natural resources, which 
provide the whole country with wood, with 2x4s, with paper and 
what have you.  The piece of paper I am holding starts in the 
forest.  The forestry workers are the ones who cut down the raw 
material that it is made from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing they are asking for is recognition. 
Very often people say “Oh, he's just a forestry worker, that's 
all”.  As if these workers were not part of society.  That is 
how they feel sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough that many of their jobs in the bush have been 
lost to mechanization, now gas costs are making it extremely 
expensive to get to their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion it would be just the honourable thing to do if 
parliament were to say “Now we are finally paying attention to 
our forestry workers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the members of this House have such workers within their 
ridings, or their fathers or brothers were forestry workers.  I 
think giving them a little hand up is nothing more than the fair 
and honourable thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing, I will just quickly repeat a few points.  We 
must keep in mind that the forestry workers cannot control wood 
quotas.  They are therefore forced to be seasonal workers.  For 
a large chunk of the year, six months I would say, they are 
forced onto employment insurance, at 50% of what they were 
earning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly recommend that the government members vote in favour 
of Bill C-211 in order to give our forestry workers the 
opportunity to purchase chainsaws and get to work providing our 
country with a resource.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
pleased to speak to Bill C-211.  My colleague from the Bloc has 
put forward a pretty interesting proposal.  However, when we look 
at the forest worker separated from a lot of others in the same 
categories, I have some concerns. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT52"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT52"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1815

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the proposal that a low paid seasonal worker is asking 
to reclaim some of his expenses through the income tax source. 
The other interesting part is that he would be able to claim his 
vehicle or the costs of his travel back and forth, including the 
cost of the interest on his loan to purchase his vehicle.  I 
wonder if we are just talking about cars and trucks here.  As the 
hon. member knows, some people travel by Sea-Doo.  Maybe they 
should be able to claim them also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately a dual economy is developing. There are areas that 
are flourishing.  Employment rates are extremely high mainly 
around our urban centres and people are doing very well.  In many 
of the rural regions people are trying to eke out a living. 
Forestry workers, fishery workers and construction workers are 
some of those groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the way the present government has operated and 
because of the CHST cutbacks over the last number of years, most 
of the provinces have put the meagre income they have into health 
care more than anything else.  In most provinces, except for the 
two or three more affluent ones, there is a lack of construction 
work.  Many construction workers who worked on our highways, 
municipal projects and water and sewer projects now have to 
travel all over the place to get enough hours of work just to 
qualify for EI benefits during the long hard winters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who presented the bill has an issue.  He is on 
to something but he needs to broaden the base considerably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of discussion tonight on the methods of 
taxing people.  Alliance members talked about their proposals, 
the flat tax.  Let me tell them that many seasonal workers 
certainly would not benefit from the flat tax.  They would just 
be flattened a little bit more by the flat tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might say that the government's proposals are going to be 
generous.  Let me say to them that again, the rich will become 
richer and the poor will become poorer.  We are seeing this more 
and more.  When I use the word poorer, I am not talking about 
poor in the sense of resources, but poor simply because they have 
been downtrodden by the Liberal government over the last 10 years 
to the point where they cannot gain from the development of the 
great resources they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no greater example than my own province of Newfoundland 
and Labrador.  We are an extremely rich province with a 
tremendous amount to offer, but because of the policies of the 
government, we are not gaining at all from the development of our 
resources.  We see some employment in the urban centres, but the 
employment levels in the rural centres are going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see among our fishery workers what the hon. member sees among 
his forestry workers.  In order to gain meagre employment, they 
have to travel miles and miles. Before, many of our communities 
had large fish plants where the local fishermen came into their 
own wharf.  People in the area worked in the processing plant and 
did very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the depletion of our resources and in particular the 
mismanagement by the government, there is absolutely no 
scientific research involved in order to dictate how we should 
handle our resource. 
We see the decimation of the fishery.  Fewer people are fishing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fisher persons themselves have to travel further and further to 
get to the wharf that they use and to the place where they now 
must store their boat. Many of them have to go from the smaller 
boats to the bigger boats to travel further afield to catch the 
meagre resource. Fish plant workers who work practically next 
door travel in excess of 100 miles a day in order to get enough 
work to qualify for EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of sympathy for what the hon. member is saying. 
Construction workers day in and day out travel over 100 miles to 
get to a place where they have a few weeks of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at changing the tax structure, instead of looking 
at across the board cuts that the members opposite say will 
benefit everybody, perhaps we should look at adjustments within 
the system that will benefit those who really need the tax 
breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government cuts taxes by 5%, 10% or whatever, 
it brags about it.  Everybody gets a break. But for the people in 
Newfoundland who pay 69% of the federal rate in their personal 
income taxes, it does not mean a thing.  It means that the 
provincial government is taking in fewer dollars. It means 
absolutely nothing in the sense of attracting investment because 
the playing field is not level.  Again, the rich benefit more. 
They can offer more incentives to people to invest. The poorer 
provinces such as the Atlantic provinces in particular cannot 
compete with the more lucrative ones because they cannot offer 
the same tax incentives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the board cuts and made in Ottawa solutions might be 
looked upon as being equal, but they are certainly not fair for 
many regions.  Not only are rich, poor and some in between 
regions developing, the same thing is happening in sectors within 
our provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the rural areas of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia 
and Newfoundland in particular are finding it more and more 
difficult to find employment.  The expense of going to their job 
and the expense of being involved in the workforce are getting so 
great that people need some kind of a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support in principle what the hon. member is proposing.  I 
hope we will use this as a catalyst to help other sectors, not 
just the forestry workers. Their case might be unique in certain 
areas of Quebec, but the fishery workers in Newfoundland are just 
as unique.  The construction workers in Atlantic Canada and 
Quebec are just as unique.  Perhaps it is time that we looked at 
developing tax policies that benefit those who need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite brag about the $12 billion, $14 billion or $15 
billion surplus.  They should be on their knees thanking the 
Tories for their initiatives.  Back in the early nineties when 
they brought in free trade, the members opposite said no, that it 
would destroy the country.  What happened after the election? The 
Liberals went along with free trade and today they see the 
benefits. Every night they should give thanks that Prime Minister 
Mulroney had the fortitude to do what the Liberals did not have 
the fortitude to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other great income generator is the GST.  Once again those 
hon. members said that we could not have this terrible tax.  What 
happened?  They had the terrible tax.  We can go back to the 
government of the hon. leader of our party which was defeated 
when it increased the gas tax.  When the members opposite came 
into power, they doubled it right off the bat.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals can brag about the surplus for two other reasons. 
It is not only because of good Tory policies but they have also 
shafted the people on health care and have held back billions of 
dollars that should be going to the sick and the poor. People are 
suffering because of seasonal employment.  The government has cut 
their legs out from under them with the EI benefits.  This has 
helped fill the government coffers and it is nothing to brag 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it is time for the government to change its mind and 
support the hon. member's bill and help the people who really 
need the help.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the members who took part in this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even those who did not support the idea, I felt, considered a 
debate on tax incentives needed to get people to work relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forestry workers we are talking about here have to go 
elsewhere to work, are forced to sleep elsewhere and need their 
vehicles for their work.  So they are not using them on a whim. 
They need them to get to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government already partially acknowledges this, because 
there is a partial deduction for it.  The problem is that the 
present deduction is inadequate, because it does not take into 
account the relevance of using this type of vehicle for these 
purposes.  In a little square box, in a department somewhere, 
they defined this vehicle as being used for tourism or personal 
uses, and this is not the case.  This point needs to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all members who said something special could not be 
created for a given sector to debate my bill so that we may look 
at similar situations and examine this issue in committee.  I 
invite them as well to not close their eyes to the facts.  Under 
the existing tax system, all sorts of specific deductions are 
permitted for all sorts of people.  We are among these people 
who have a significant sum that is tax exempt so we can do our 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people get tax deductions to pay for season tickets to the 
hockey games in big cities like Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver, 
and people in my region cannot benefit in any way from such 
deductions. It is absolutely impossible to obtain a season 
ticket and to benefit from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to weigh things carefully. The system is not balanced in 
that regard.  In this case, I think we have what is needed to 
reach a practical solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to make this bill a 
votable item and for us to vote on it after the vote on Motion 
M-160, which is the next item and for which division will be 
deferred. 
I ask for the unanimous consent of the House for my bill to be 
declared a votable item so that members can take a stand and so 
that we can examine it in committee and amend it, if necessary, 
to do justice to forestry workers, not only those in my region 
and in Quebec, but forestry workers all over Canada who need 
their vehicle for their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent of the House to 
make the bill a votable item? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To many, this issue of sealing the 1911 census information 
forever does not seem like a very important issue and think that 
maybe the House should spend its time in other areas, but it does 
raise a concern for a number of people and several of my 
constituents who have contacted me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of individuals in our society take great delight in 
seeking information about their family history and look forward 
to the time when this information will be available to them so 
they can have a better understanding of their roots in Canada. It 
was because of an individual who was very concerned in 1906 and 
again in 1918 that this information could be used for purposes 
that were not necessarily considered to be good purposes, that 
they felt for privacy they needed to seal the records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time it probably made sense but that was 85 years ago. 
Many of the laws on our books have now become redundant.  The 
concern for privacy and respecting the privacy of an individual 
is a good one and should be considered, but when this information 
becomes of an age and is no longer current that need for privacy 
disappears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the people who would have this information in the 1911 
census would be 75 years or older.  Many of them are probably not 
even alive.  The question of securing or protecting their privacy 
becomes less of an issue, if an issue at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the motion is to make an allowance and to perhaps 
put a timeframe on when this information would be made available, 
but certainly not to have all the census information from the 
1911 census lost forever.  That certainly was the concern of some 
of my constituents who contacted me on this issue. Their concern 
was that that information, even if they had to wait another 20 
years, should be available to the families for historical 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When other countries had to deal with this issue they set a year 
beyond which the person probably would not be living, although 
with today's technology it may be hard to put that to the number 
of years.  In Australia and France the census data is released 
after 100 years.  Denmark is saying that 65 years is adequate. 
The United Kingdom is making efforts to release its data after 
100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precedents are being set internationally that maybe 100 
years would be an adequate period of time that any information on 
an individual, if they lived beyond 100 years, which is very 
unlikely, at least for most of us, could not be used and harm 
that person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect to an individual's privacy, there is a good 
cause for Motion No. 160 and for the concern that historians and 
people who are researching their family histories have, that we 
set a timeframe, perhaps 100 years.  This law is actually 88 
years old.  Maybe that is time enough and we should say that as 
of the year 2000 this information will be made available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the indication is, from other countries that have 
dealt with this issue, that 100 years is adequate.  In one case 
65 years was considered adequate.  I think Canada would be 
justified in putting the timeframe at 90 or 100 years, or 
whatever, into this legislation and then to redraft it.

overhauled.  I think this certainly is one that has to be looked 
at and changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my hon. colleague is looking to all members of the House 
to support this motion, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
all necessary steps to release the 1911 census records once they 
have been deposited in the National Archives in 2003. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly, on his behalf, request that members of the House 
support his motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address the motion raised by the member for Calgary 
Southeast with respect to the release of the 1911 census records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer of census records to the National Archives for 
public access is a fairly complex issue.  The competing interests 
at issue here are both legitimate and important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure my colleagues that the minister 
responsible for Statistics Canada is well aware of both sides of 
this debate.  Although he recognizes the importance of historical 
and genealogical research, the minister must also take into 
account the privacy concerns of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, my own private member's bill, Bill C-312, an act to 
amend the National Archives of Canada Act and the Statistics Act, 
is an attempt to resolve this issue with a fair and balanced 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason that the minister took immediate steps and 
appointed an expert panel to examine the legal, privacy and 
archival implications of providing access to historical census 
records. The panel was asked to recommend an approach which 
balances the need to protect personal privacy with the demand of 
genealogists and historians for access to historical census 
records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel submitted its report to the minister on June 30, 2000. 
The minister is now reviewing the recommendations made by the 
panel and will be making the panel's report public in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore encouraged by the minister's genuine interest and 
commitment to find a balanced resolution.  While he must 
carefully consider all sides of this issue, any decision taken 
must respond to the concerns and desires of Canadians to research 
their personal and community roots.  The minister is working 
toward a resolution of the issue of public access to historical 
census records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's census records up to and including the 1901 census are 
available to the public through the National Archives. 
Statistics Canada continues to hold all individual returns of 
census questionnaires collected between 1906 and 1996.  Up to 
1991 these records are on microfilm and are available only to 
individual respondents who need to confirm birth dates for 
pension purposes, passports or any other related issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the members of the House understand the need for 
access to census records while at the same time they are 
sensitive to the privacy concerns of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of co-operation, I would like to propose an 
amendment that would support the work of all those involved 
reaching a workable solution to this issue.  I therefore propose 
to amend the motion and emphasize that the government should 
consider taking the necessary steps to release the census 
records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member for Calgary Southeast will agree that this 
small change to his motion will allow an opportunity to look at 
both sides of this issue.  It also provides parliament with an 
opportunity to vote in support of the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak today to Motion No. 60 put forward by the 
member for Calgary Southeast.  The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
all necessary steps to release the 1911 census records once they 
have been deposited in the National Archives in 2003. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am actually a bit surprised at the brevity of the debate on 
the motion before us tonight, and I am more than a bit surprised 
that the person who actually proposed the motion has chosen not 
to speak to it at this time.  I understand that he may be here 
for the five minute wrap up, but when one puts a private member's 
bill forward, hopefully one would be a little more serious about 
it than the five minute wrap up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion addresses an issue that is very important to many 
Canadians.  Many of us understand it because we have been 
contacted by constituents, historians and genealogists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I understand surveys have shown that this issue is not one 
of which the general public is aware, there is certainly a vocal 
outcry from many segments of Canadian society who understand the 
implications of this motion and the problem it attempts to 
resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me outline what exactly it is that needs to be addressed and 
what this motion we are debating here today contemplates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada conducts a census every five years, polling 
Canadians about such things as their name, address, marital 
status, income, education and activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 2001 census, additional questions will be asked on 
languages spoken at home and at work, birthplace of parents and 
religion.  This information is considered confidential and is not 
made available to other government departments, including the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that until 1906 census information collected by 
Statistics Canada was kept confidential for 92 years, after which 
time the information was provided to the National Archives of Canada 
and available for public searches.  This enabled family 
descendants, historians, genealogists and any other interested 
persons to access records from censuses that were collected at 
least 92 years previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1906, however, changes were made to the Privacy Act which 
stated that where other acts provide specific protection to 
personal records, those acts must prevail. Since the Statistics 
Act makes reference to the confidentiality of census information 
supplied by the individual completing the census, legal opinion 
indicates that any census following 1901 cannot be released to 
anyone other than the specified individual in the census. 
Moreover, no time limitation was ever stipulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can see the bind in which the government finds 
itself.  What I find more surprising, though, is the real lack of 
activity by the government to do anything about that bind because 
there are certainly a couple of avenues that the government can 
take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to the 1911 census, which would have been made public 
in 2003 under the regulations in place prior to 1906, it is now 
considered private and confidential in perpetuity.  Only with a 
change to legislation can this regulation be changed and access 
provided to historians, genealogists and descendants of people 
who filled out those original censuses.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are addressing today proposes such a change.  It 
asks the government to take the necessary steps to amend the 
regulations and allow the former practice of transferring census 
information to the national archives following a period of 92 
years.  The federal government is aware of this problem as there 
has been a concerted effort by genealogists to have this matter 
brought to the attention of the public to facilitate the changes 
that would allow continued access to these records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genealogists across the country like Muriel Davidson and 
historical societies have been in contact with my office. There 
is a huge file on this issue.  The need for it is obvious. If the 
government has a bill in waiting it should have put it out first. 
This is something that we should no longer continue to ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government responded to efforts made by individuals, 
historians and genealogists by establishing in November 1999 the 
expert panel on access to historical census records chaired by 
the president of Carleton University, Dr. Richard Van Loon.  This 
panel was mandated to examine the problem from the perspective of 
both historians and the general populace, to review options and 
to report its findings by May 2000.  May has come and gone.  The 
panel subsequently requested an extension, expecting to report by 
the early part of this summer.  The early part of this summer has 
come and gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada is now saying that the minister has the final 
report to review and it will be released at his discretion. Those 
of us who are interested in the findings of the expert panel will 
have to wait until the minister chooses to release its 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly all of us would benefit from knowing the results of 
the panel's interpretation of release of historical census 
information, particularly given the important discussion tonight 
on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the review of this topic the panel was asked to 
examine a couple of options regarding possible remedies to allow 
access to census records.  One option would see the 2001 census 
and any future census transferred to the national archives after 
an established period of 92 years.  The second option would see a 
similar change made retroactively to allow access to the 1911 
census after 92 years.  This second option entails breaking the 
promise of confidentiality made by the government of the day to 
the people who completed the censuses since 1906. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand a number of concerns with respect to this matter, 
both from the perspective of privacy and confidentiality and the 
need for historical access to information.  As the past president 
of the local New Ross Historical Society in Nova Scotia, I am 
fully aware of the usefulness of census records when exploring 
and tracing family ties and compiling historical snapshots of any 
particular moment of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting, and I think important, to look at the history 
of census taking in Canada.  According to a publication by 
Statistics Canada, Intendant Jean Talon ordered the first census 
in 1666 in New France.  The basis of the door to door enumeration 
was to better prepare for the development of the colony.  The 
3,215 colonists in the areas of Montreal, Trois-Rivières, 
Cap-de-la-Madeleine and Quebec participated.  Until 1739 there 
were 36 censuses conducted under French rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With British occupation censuses became more intermittent until 
the British North America Act of 1867.  That act established the 
need for more regular, dependable data collection, which was 
particularly important for regional population counts as the 
British North America Act set out democratic representation based 
on population, a system still in place today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Nova Scotian I also found it interesting to note that it 
was the 1767 census of Nova Scotia that introduced questions on 
religion and origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party recognizes and supports the release of census 
information to the general public.  Not only does this 
information assist historians and genealogists but also everyday 
Canadians can find out information about Canada's past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, there are other options available for historical searches 
but to cut off this important avenue would be to ignore the past, 
and we all know that when we ignore the past we are unprepared 
for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A survey was conducted as part of the expert panel's review of 
access to historical censuses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The survey found that Canadians agree with having access to past 
census records particularly to enable families to trace their 
backgrounds.  When the questions emphasized the fact that 
government would have to break its promise to keep the censuses 
confidential from 1906 onward there was less support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we think about why census records are useful and 
informative, it would be difficult to accept that although census 
taking began in Canada in 1666 there would be a complete void for 
a period of 92 years from 1911 to 2003.  There would be no census 
information available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes sense to allow access to the historical censuses on the 
contingency basis that only after 92 years have passed will 
records be publicly available through the national archives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, I have been 
contacted by a number of people concerned with the availability 
of census records.  I have talked to constituents about this 
matter and publicly stated my support for initiatives to allow 
access to historical census records.  I continue to advocate the 
position.  The Progressive Conservative Party supports the motion 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I understand that the hon. member for South Shore who 
just spoke referred to the absence of a certain member from the 
House.  I believe that was out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  No, I was listening very carefully. 
The member for South Shore indicated that a certain hon. member 
had not participated in the debate today, but he made no 
reference to the presence or absence of the member.  I was quite 
attentive to the fact that this was the tone of the discussion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this motion. More 
than a year ago, the president of the historical and 
genealogical society of my area, Mrs. Ouellet, made some 
representations to ensure that this information would be made 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked myself some questions about the protection of 
personal information. 
I am particularly sensitive to this whole issue since the 
Department of Human Resources Development accidentally sent me 
some incorrect information about myself. I think there is a 
distinction to be made between historical information collected 
through the 1911 census and protected ever since then and the 
privacy issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the motion put forward will help us reach a greater 
consensus in the House to let the government know how important 
it is to make a decision as soon as possible and to take into 
account all the various points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I gather from the arguments I have heard in support of 
this motion, it seems that the report submitted to the minister 
was quite favourable. I hope this means that the government is 
considering providing access to this information in an 
appropriate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry, who is responsible for this issue, 
will have to complete his work quickly, because he has had this 
report in hand for some time now. He can make it public at the 
same time that he announces the government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the House, it would be interesting to say to all those 
history buffs, to all our historians, to all those who would 
find it useful, such as genealogists, that, yes, they can use 
the information collected via this census. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some said that in other countries, the data remain unavailable 
for 90 or 100 years. In the present case, it is close to 90 
years. I believe we have all the arguments in favour of public 
access to this information, so that it can be used for 
historical purposes and so that this anomaly be corrected. 
In the subsequent censuses, there were no provisions concerning 
the period after which the information would be made available.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very happy if we could allow people in our historical

respond to requests made to them in that regard and if we could 
settle this issue once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been was in favour of the motion from the start. This is 
my personal position, and I will probably support the amendment 
as well because I think it will create a larger consensus in the 
House to send a clear message to the government. The time has 
come for the government to act responsibly, make up its mind and 
state its position. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to debate the amendment to what 
is actually my motion.  This motion seeks to have the government 
release the results of the 1911 census and by implication every 
census thereafter.  I have spoken to the principle of the motion 
in the first hour of debate and will not reiterate.  Rather I 
will address briefly the amendment brought before us by the hon. 
member for Ottawa Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note with some dismay the remarks of my itinerate colleague 
from South Shore who for some reason apparently supports the 
motion but saw some reason to criticize its mover for not having 
participated in the debate.  I am here tonight to participate in 
the debate.  I was here during the first hour and I was here at 
every stage in this debate.  I think in private members' hour 
that kind of apparently petty partisanship is uncalled for.  I am 
as partisan as anyone when it is called for, but certainly not 
when we are discussing matters of this nature.  I found that 
regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Ottawa Centre seeks to amend this motion by 
changing the words “the government should take” to “the 
government should consider taking”.  I object strenuously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of Canadians have an interest in this matter although 
they may not yet realize it.  Certainly tens of thousands have a 
very acute interest in the passage of the motion.  Genealogists, 
archivists, librarians, researchers and historians through many 
personal and organized representations to their representatives 
and to this place have asked for the government to release the 
1911 archives for the census of that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was principally as a result of those representations that I 
brought forward the motion.  I thought these archivists, 
genealogists and so on had made a very reasonable case that the 
release of these documents would be well within what would be 
very conventional and would not violate privacy rights or 
undertakings on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought a motion which would suggest that the government 
should take this action.  Let us be honest and frank about it. 
This is how it works.  Government members have been deluged with 
mail on the issue like all other members from people concerned 
about the issue asking for the release of these documents.  It 
has become a political concern for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that many of these members have received dozens of 
letters and communications asking for their support of this 
motion or action of this nature to be taken.  It has become a 
small but not insignificant political concern for them. 
Undoubtedly many of these members intended to vote in favour of 
my motion that the government should take this action and release 
these census documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure this is what happened.  The Minister of Industry is 
responsible for the oversight of Statistics Canada and the 
archives.  Undoubtedly his office realized that the motion could 
be somewhat embarrassing for the government because he clearly 
had no intention of taking decisive action on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, the Minister of Industry appointed a committee to delay, 
a panel of experts, which is a typical government procedure, to 
study the issue into the ground probably at least until after the 
election so that my hon. colleagues opposite could tell all the 
genealogists and local historians in their ridings not to worry 
in that the government was considering the matter and in the 
fullness of time and at the earliest opportunity would release 
the archived documents.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt they were planning to do that with the committee to 
delay.  This motion comes along and suddenly forces them, heaven 
forbid, to actually confront the issue, especially because it has 
been deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says that the government has to come up with 
some way to water this thing down so that it is not obliged to 
take any sort of action at all, but instead can continue to delay 
the release of these census documents and denude this as a 
political issue for the backbench government members.  That is 
exactly what has happened.  Let us be grown-ups about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strenuously object to the motion which would require that the 
government consider taking action.  The government can consider 
taking action on anything, anytime.  This amendment renders this 
motion meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clearly put on the record that this will not serve as 
an adequate loincloth, if you will, for government members who 
hope to go back to their ridings and tell their constituents 
interested in access to this important historical information 
that they voted in favour of this motion, that they voted in 
favour of the release of these census documents.  That is not 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an disingenuous motion designed to cloud the issue for 
those with an interest in obtaining these records.  It is a 
somewhat underhanded effort on the part of the government to 
prevent the House from actually reflecting the interests and 
concerns of their constituents.  It is a very simple matter, but 
the government and the minister want to maintain a stranglehold 
on this information.  He does not want the House, its members or, 
heaven forbid, his own members representing their constituents 
deciding that this archival information should be released from 
the 1911 census.  He wants his department and his bureaucrats to 
be able to make this decision.  That is why this amendment has 
come forward from a government member tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just say to my colleagues opposite and everyone else that this 
completely dilutes the meaningfulness of the motion.  I would ask 
members to please vote against the amendment and support the 
original motion which has stronger language and which creates at 
least a strong sense of the House.  Even if my motion passes 
unamended, it will not force the government to take action.  It 
will merely give a strong sense of the will of the House.  That 
is what private members' motions are intended for.  Let us use 
that procedure properly.  We get very few votable private 
members' motions.  Let us use this one to actually represent our 
constituents in a non-partisan fashion. Instead of protecting the 
minister's hide and his committee to delay, let us vote against 
the amendment and support the original motion, as no doubt most 
members would be inclined to do.

subject matter after the mover of the original motion.  It does 
not give me great pleasure that we now have an amendment which 
basically guts the motion.  However, it allows me to speak to 
this subject again.  I previously spoke to it on April 10 and it 
would have nullified my ability to speak tonight if that 
amendment had not occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As explained by the hon. member for Calgary Southeast, the mover 
of the original motion, essentially what we have here is a 
circumstance where it is obvious that the Minister of Industry, 
who is responsible for the census data and the Statistics Canada 
operations, does not want to release this information for his own 
purposes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much fuzziness around the issue and it has been 
exploited to the government's advantage because of that. We are 
one of the jurisdictions in the western world without clear 
statutory rules for when census information shall be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most critical period of time in terms of mass emigration 
particularly from Europe to Canada is the period 1910 to 1930. 
That is very important historical information for us.  It is also 
very important information for the country to the south of us, 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our set-up is diametrically different from the standpoint that 
the U.S. is getting ready to release its 1930 census data next 
year.  It has a 70 year rule. The motion does not propose a 70 
year rule.  It proposes that the 1911 census data be released in 
2003, which is 92 years.  We can argue all day about what is an 
appropriate length of time but we need clear statutory rules as 
to when Canada will do that.  The current situation is open to 
political manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister asked Statistics Canada to produce a report on what 
it thought about the whole situation.  The Statistics Canada 
report essentially stated that there was an everlasting promise 
to keep the material secret.  It has been able to make that 
statement without any documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A review of all the statutes, proclamations, the Canada 
<I>Gazette</I> and newspaper clippings of the day would indicate 
quite the contrary.  The more one thinks about why Statistics 
Canada would take such a position, the more one is led to the 
conclusion that Statistics Canada is actually in a conflict of 
interest situation on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very pervasive, invasive questions have been asked recently by 
Statistics Canada. There are members of the public, including 
myself, who do not believe that the level of inquiry is 
appropriate for census material.  By using coercion, the threat 
of penalty and other measures, we are told that we have to 
respond to the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That accumulated data becomes a saleable commodity by Statistics 
Canada.  It is in business with this data.  It does not want to 
threaten its ability to coerce the public into responding to 
those questions.  Therefore it has to hold out this guarantee, or 
at least favour that end of the spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe we should be giving any plausible credibility 
to its report.  The motion is clear in stating that nationally we 
have a vested interest in actually releasing our census data.  We 
will lose too much of our history if we do not do so.  We will be 
out of step with other parts of the western world.  We will leave 
an unsatisfactory circumstance to be cleaned up later.
