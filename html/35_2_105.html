<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	In the Order Paper and Notice Paper for yesterday, Thursday, 
November 21, on page X in Roman numerals, Motion No. 22 
appears to have been proposed by me, according to the English 
version, while in the French it appears to have been proposed by 
my colleague, the hon. member for Stormont-Dundas. I am 
therefore rising to make the correction, if it has not already been 
done. I believe that I moved the motion, but my colleague for 
Stormont-Dundas could confirm this with the Chair.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank my colleague, the hon. member 
for Bellechasse. There was indeed an error in yesterday's Order 
Paper and Notice Paper, which has been corrected in today's Order 
Paper.
<P>
	If all of my colleagues could follow today's Order Paper, we 
would avoid problems such as the one the hon. member for 
Bellechasse has just raised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
waiting for a copy of today's Order Paper; it will take just a few 
seconds. I trust you will not take this time off my speaking time. In 
fact, the pages were so fast it would not even be worth the bother.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	First of all, the debate must go far beyond taking the 
amendments one at a time. I will be able to do that when I speak on 
third reading. The official opposition's extreme reticence about the 
bill before us today at report stage is, of course, partly because the 
finished product is imperfect and needs reworking. As some poet 
said-was it Boileau, my hon. colleague from 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve?-``Hone your work carefully; spare no 
effort and remember that that which can be said in fewer words is 
often better''.
<P>
	This bill was not honed carefully. It bears all the marks of having 
been thrown together any which way. In the parliamentary 
committee, we saw the divergence between the points of view of 
the government which tabled the bill and those of Elections 
Canada. In fact, it is a hybrid, like the offspring of a porcupine and 
a snake we used to joke about as school kids, saying that the result 
would be about three feet of barbed wire. That is what the bill is 
like.
<P>
	Regardless of what has been said, the opposition was not 
involved in drafting this bill. The very nature of the bill, modifying 
the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act, ought to have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6597"> 6597 </A></B>
<P>
automatically meant that the opposition parties, all of the 
opposition parties represented in this House, would be closely 
involved in drafting the bill along with Elections Canada, so that 
the resulting bill would be non-partisan.
<P>
	It is quite possible that in the end we may not reach a unanimous 
decision since we are here to discuss ideas, and to discuss them on 
the basis of very clear premises. However, that has not been the 
case.
<P>
	The first false premise was that this bill would supposedly 
establish a permanent voters' list for the next election. That is 
absolutely untrue. That is merely the impression that was given, 
and that some people repeated.
<P>
	As far as the next election is concerned, the bill will only allow 
for an enumeration outside the electoral period, which means the 
election campaign will be abbreviated, but there will be no 
permanent list of electors. There will be an enumeration and a 
revision of the list of electors, but for all practical purposes, the 
current Canada Elections Act will apply to the rest of the election. I 
will explain the difference in greater detail at third reading. So 
basically, the process is flawed.
<P>
	I trust that in a case like this, if both opposition parties vote 
against the bill at all stages, the government will not take a bill on 
electoral matters that was adopted only by the government majority 
in this House and submit it to the Senate for approval and Royal 
Assent. This would create a dangerous precedent that is intolerable 
in a free and democratic society, where a debate on such matters 
should be as open as possible. I will get back to this.
<P>
	We are told that passing Bill C-63 will save money. We will not 
save any money by passing Bill C-63, since the amount of money 
required to conduct an enumeration before the electoral period, a 
special enumeration held over a period of three weeks, will 
considerably exceed any savings resulting from the fact that the 
election campaign will be shorter by exactly 11 days.
<P>
	Basically, our position is this: let us have one more election 
according to the old rules we all know. Reform members, Liberals 
and Bloc members are all familiar with this act. We went through 
one election with this legislation, the Reform Party as well, and the 
Liberals have had several. We are on familiar ground here.
<P>
	Electoral legislation is like the Criminal Code and the Civil Code 
in Quebec. These are the pillars that carry the whole system, and 
we cannot change them on a whim, just because someone has a 
bright idea and feels it should be implemented right away. This bill 
was introduced in early October, and a month later, the same bill, 
after being fast-tracked through committee, is back in the House at 
the report stage.
<P>
	In these matters, speed is not the best policy. It is much better to 
take your time. We did not have enough time, but we are 
nevertheless proposing amendments that could help improve the 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	It is like an automobile muffler: for a certain time, you can 
always weld it so that it will not be too noisy, but sooner or later, it 
will fall off. What is proposed here is like welding a rusted muffler, 
which is what this bill is. Is it or is it not going to hold? At least if 
those amendments are passed, we will get rid of the noise for 
another two weeks and be able to travel from Ottawa to Cornwall 
once or twice, at most. Incidently, I lost my own muffler on my 
way to that same town two weeks ago, and I had another problem 
with that.
<P>
	We will nevertheless try to make one last repair to this bill but 
basically I would like it to be put aside and I wish that those who 
will have the opportunity to examine it a second time will also take 
into account the haste with which it was considered the first time 
round.
<P>
	There is also the undeniable fact that this government is in the 
last year of its normal mandate. Now traditionally, during the last 
year of a mandate, basic rules are not changed, in particular as 
regards the Elections Act.
<P>
	It is somewhat like the hockey finals. I will give an example 
using two American teams to avoid controversy in this Chamber. 
The New York Rangers and the Boston Bruins have made it to the 
finals. The Bruins are leading three games to nothing. The Rangers 
have money as we know. They are in New York. They have 
Madison Square Gardens, which they fill each time. The Fox 
network televises their games. They have a lot of money. They 
survey the members of the board of governors and manage to get 
the board of governors of the National Hockey League to say: ``It is 
no longer four out of seven; it is now five out of nine. We have 
another chance to catch up''. The rules are changed at the end of the 
game.
<P>
	The game is already underway. The government is already on the 
campaign trail. The Prime Minister rated his accomplishments at 
78 per cent. He is clearly heading into an election trying to sell his 
78 per cent rating. We will slip a decimal between the two figures 
during the election campaign, in fact, well before.
<P>
	The game is underway; the finals have begun. Let us play the 
game with the old rules and not change anything. As the official 
opposition-and the Reform Party will speak for itself, it does not 
seem to have been consulted any more than we were-had no hand 
in writing Bill C-63 and did not give its approval, it is hard to 
agree, to hand over a blank cheque.
<P>
	The smallest provision will blow up in our face at some point. 
They will say: ``You voted for that; you have to live with the law as 
it was passed. You supported it''. I by far prefer the process 
followed-and I will come back to it later-in the formulation of 
Bill C-69 on electoral boundaries in the first session of the 35th 
Parliament, where the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs took a year to prepare the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6598"> 6598 </A></B>
<P>
	The official opposition and Reformers did not support the bill, 
but at least we knew it word by word, comma by comma. The 
punctuation was checked over and over to make sure it changed 
nothing. Representatives of Elections Canada attended the 
meetings. The discussions were very broad.
<P>
	This is not the case here. The government and Elections Canada 
are obviously very much at odds. We clearly have before us a 
partisan bill on electoral matters, where even Elections Canada 
officials disagree with several of the provisions of the Elections 
Act.
<P>
	Because I have taken a few minutes to situate the debate my 
colleague for Laval Centre and chief whip of the Bloc Quebecois 
will speak shortly on motions of Group No. 2, which aims to 
include age as one of the essential factors in an electoral list.
<P>
	To the extent that we want a permanent register of electors, not 
for the upcoming election but for the one after that, the date of birth 
must be included. Bill C-63 proposes that it be optional. However, 
the more complete the information, the more valid the register is. 
The information the state has on its own citizens comes from 
registers going back to their birth, as the provinces require that 
births be registered.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	In French law, this obligation has existed for over 400 years. 
These rights were recognized very early. The government must 
know who makes up the nation and which citizens enjoy certain 
rights. It cannot be optional. Some members spoke about this 
earlier. My colleague from Laval Centre will, of course, address 
this issue in more detail.
<P>
	If Motions Nos. 1, 3, 9, 15 and 18 are adopted, I would agree to 
support the motion proposed by my colleague from Calgary West 
to omit gender. If the date of birth is included, the information 
regarding gender is no longer necessary.
<P>
	The age and the date of birth would allow us to distinguish 
between people with neutral first names such as Claude, Carol or 
Maxime. Those are the comments I wanted to make.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising today to speak to the report stage amendments on Bill C-63. 
In doing so I would first like to summarize our position as a party 
on this bill because we are not having a full second reading debate, 
having sent the bill to committee before second reading.
<P>
	Under this new process we only have a brief debate and then we 
come back here with a debate which combines second reading and 
report stage. At third reading I will have a chance to fully elaborate 
upon our position. I would like to comment on this process. I share 
many of the concerns of the hon. member for Bellechasse. I also 
am concerned about this process.
<P>
	This process does not really allow us to fully debate legislation. 
We have used this new process of sending bills to committee before 
second reading several times. I am not sure that the opposition 
parties generally have found it to be satisfactory. Many of my 
colleagues have mentioned this to me. As a result of this new 
process, we never really have a full debate in principle on 
legislation.
<P>
	In this case the bill had only a cursory debate and then was sent 
to committee. The purpose of sending a bill to committee before 
second reading is to examine a broad range of issues which are not 
necessarily related to the principle or contents of the bill. After all, 
prior to second reading the bill has not received approval in 
principle. That is supposed to be the concept. Of course it depends 
on the chairman's style, but my observation has been that we very 
much conduct those committees the same as we would if they were 
held after second reading. In other words we tend to restrict debate 
to the items raised in the bill.
<P>
	I know for example with respect to this particular piece of 
legislation, some of my colleagues raised issues which were not 
included in the legislation. The hon. member for Bellechasse raised 
the issues of third party advertising and of some regulations of 
Quebec's electoral law. Our party raised the concept of fixed 
election dates. We also raised the whole concept of how this 
elections bill would apply to byelections.
<P>
	In all cases, while we had a brief discussion, the committee 
basically said that these things were outside the scope and the 
principle of the legislation. Of course they were. The legislation 
had not received approval in principle. Nevertheless, we worked on 
the assumption that it had. That was constantly the attitude of the 
government.
<P>
	Certainly there were things which went well beyond the subject 
matter, but most of the things raised were clearly within the subject 
matter. In the case of byelections, while not directly related to the 
amendments in the bill, they are actually affected by the subject 
matter of the legislation. These things should have been debated 
more thoroughly than is allowed under this process.
<P>
	Another example is that we wanted to debate at some length the 
rationale for a 36 day campaign as opposed to 37 or 39 days. We 
had only the briefest of discussions on that issue and once again the 
attitude was that this was not the principle of the bill and we were 
proceeding as if the bill had been approved in principle.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6599"> 6599 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	I think that the process of sending bills to committees early in 
many cases simply allows the government to accelerate the 
timetable of debate rather than giving the bill a more thorough 
examination. That was the opposite of the intention.
<P>
	I would make just a brief comment on our overall position on 
Bill C-63. We are going to oppose the legislation. I must be frank in 
saying that we are disappointed that we feel we have to do so. 
There are three major initiatives in the bill: the reduction of the 
electoral period, the creation of a permanent register and the 
initiative to stagger voting hours. All of these have some degree of 
merit, particularly the permanent register, which not only has merit 
but is critical.
<P>
	We were unable to come to any kind of inter-party agreement on 
these. I think we could have if we had not been operating on an 
accelerated timetable. Many of the things that were discussed 
would have resulted in improved legislation.
<P>
	I cannot speak for other parties, but on behalf of the Reform 
Party I can say that with a few changes we could have supported 
this legislation. The changes are not minor but they do not affect 
the principle of the legislation either. That troubles me a great deal. 
Maybe we will have some time to speak a little later in the debate 
about the process. I see my time is winding down. I would like to 
address the report stage amendments in the second group.
<P>
	Group No. 2 includes 15 amendments, 5 moved by the Bloc 
Quebecois and 10 moved by the Reform Party. The five from the 
Bloc Quebecois concern making the date of birth a mandatory 
piece of information for inclusion on the register and the motions 
by the Reform Party remove gender as required information for the 
register.
<P>
	I must say in all honesty that there is a bit of a technical problem 
with both of these being grouped together in that one does preclude 
the other the way they are drafted. I do not think that was the 
intention of either party because both the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Reform Party share the same position on these issues, which is that 
there is no necessity to include gender but there are reasons for 
including date of birth.
<P>
	I will have time to address this very general issue later in the 
debate. What should guide us in constructing data registers is 
whether information is necessary for the purpose at hand or at least 
relevant. The primary consideration in constructing these databases 
should be whether it is necessary and relevant from the perspective 
of the citizen rather than some other group that may have an 
interest in the information.
<P>
	It is quite obvious that the information on electoral lists should 
be relevant to a person's ability to be eligible to cast a vote. For a 
very long time in Canada gender has not been relevant in terms of 
whether or not somebody can vote in this country. On the other 
hand, clearly date of birth is relevant because a voter has to be at 
least 18 years of age. Why then are we including the one and not 
including the other?
<P>
	If we examine the transcripts of committee meetings and 
comments from various members and if members had heard some 
of the comments that were made in camera, it becomes apparent 
that the guiding factor was not the needs of the electoral list or the 
needs of the voter. They were the perceived needs of political 
parties and of politicians. It was expressed over and over again that 
MPs found it convenient. Parties found it useful to know the gender 
of a voter. In some cultures, in French, and even some names in 
English, there are times when there is confusion, based on the first 
name, about whether a person is male or female. Certainly in some 
of the newer ethnic communities in the country names may not be 
obviously male or female. Because of our unfamiliarity with the 
names, as anglophones or francophones we do not readily know 
whether these persons are male or female. It makes identification 
harder. It can occasionally lead to an awkward situation. However, 
it is both a trivial and unnecessary reason for including gender.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	We have had concerns raised by females living alone that 
electoral lists expose the fact that they are females living alone and 
that these lists do circulate. We all know that electoral lists can only 
circulate under very restricted conditions for very restricted use. 
The fact is that they circulate widely during elections and probably 
most extra circulation of lists is rarely heard about or prosecuted. 
This does become a piece of information conveying the gender on 
the voter's list. It is unnecessary and it should not be there. In the 
province of Alberta, for example, it is not done and this is the case 
in other provinces.
<P>
	That is something we think should be changed. I am surprised 
government members were not more sensitive about the needs of 
women when designing this legislation. I hope they will support 
these amendments.
<P>
	I think they have more serious and perhaps even more dubious 
motives for refusing to include date of birth but I will let them 
speak for their own position on these matters.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since Group No. 2 mentions the date of birth, I feel quite 
comfortable saying that I went to school a very long time ago. 
When I was in school, I learned one thing, that is to make a 
preamble which was different from, although linked to the content. 
I am sure I will be allowed to make a brief preamble.
<P>
	I was able to follow closely the proceedings of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, to hear the Chief 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6600"> 6600 </A></B>
<P>
Electoral Officer of Canada, Mr. Kingsley, and the Human Rights 
Commissioner, Mr. Wilson. I listened very carefully, as I always 
do.
<P>
	I almost swallowed my birth certificate when I saw how fast the 
clause by clause study of the bill went. I really had a feeling of 
being in a classroom where a very bright mathematics professor 
was lining up digits across the blackboard, leaving no time for 
students to think or breathe.
<P>
	I could barely believe that man was our chairman. It went so fast 
that there was time left on the clock. This is extraordinary. I think 
the House will understand that we are determined to make up for 
lost time in the House because, in the end, it may be the best forum 
to hold the debate.
<P>
	Basically the second group of motions deals with two elements, 
namely age-is it useful, necessary, indispensable or just 
nice-and sex. I am going to talk mainly about the date of birth, 
and then briefly about sex.
<P>
	It seems to me that we all come into this world one day and that 
we all eventually die. It is recorded somewhere. If we apply for a 
driver's licence when we are not yet 18, our parents must sign on 
our behalf. Once we turn 18, our date of birth appears on 
everything. My date of birth appears on my passport, if I am not 
mistaken, so does the colour of my eyes, and I do not feel offended 
by it.
<P>
	But when it comes to the electoral process, why do we in the 
Bloc Quebecois, and everyone in Quebec, believe it is important? 
For several reasons. First, on election day, it is a means to make a 
proper identification. My name is not very common. I will not 
mention it since I am not allowed to, but everyone here knows what 
it is. Suppose, however, that there are two other persons with the 
same name as mine, one born in 1953, the other, like me, in 1938. If 
the date of birth does not appear, I might be able to pass myself off 
as someone much younger.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	This is one reason. I believe that this is one more way to clearly 
identify the voter at the polling station, because the one thing we 
fear more than anything else on election day is an imposter. This is 
the first reason.
<P>
	There is another one which I find very important. The 
democratic process is said to be the most important thing in our 
society. During an election campaign several things are at stake. Of 
course, what is at stake is not of equal concern to the various 
groups in our society. In the case of measures specifically targeting 
the younger age groups, for example, the parties will have to know 
where they are to be found in order to give them some up to date 
information about what concerns them. This is the second reason 
why I think the date of birth should be mandatory and recorded.
<P>
	For example, as far as old age pensions are concerned, I can 
assure you I would like the different parties to keep me informed of 
whatever changes are being proposed in the Liberal Party platform, 
for example. I would be very annoyed if my date of birth were not 
recorded.
<P>
	I heard interesting arguments against that measure. The first one 
was that in Canada voting is optional and we are not forced to vote. 
It is true we are free to vote or not, just as we are not required to 
have a driving licence. However, if I do want to vote, my name 
must necessarily be on the electoral list. Otherwise, if it were not 
necessary, how could we justify the millions that are spent on 
compiling a list?
<P>
	So, if I accept to be recorded on an electoral list, I am sending 
the message that as an elector in my country I intend to act as a 
good citizen and vote. In that context, I think it has nothing to do 
with freedom. Not indicating the date of birth would facilitate what 
we could call electoral fraud. You know, there are elections where 
the results are a close call. Imagine for example that in Laval 
Centre the candidates are neck and neck. It is possible, I am not 
saying it is probable, but it is possible. There are about 200 polling 
divisions and the difference in such a situation could be 2,000, 200, 
or even just 10 votes. Very clearly, with 200 polling divisions, one 
illegal vote per polling division makes the difference between 
victory and defeat.
<P>
	So, I believe that, in all good conscience, the House should find 
another way to ensure that the voter who is in front of the deputy 
returning officer is really the person he or she claims to be.
<P>
	I will now talk to you about sex. I am a little old to talk about 
sex, but I will tell you a little about it anyways.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>There is no age for that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>No names, please.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral: </B>No, I will not name names. You can 
rest easy about that.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will tell you one thing; no one in this House 
doubts that I am a woman: my name is Madeleine. So, I think that, 
if we do not indicate the sex, we should also remove first names 
and only keep the ones that are both masculine and feminine. In my 
opinion, an offender who would feel like doing some harassment 
would have plenty of ways to do so. And, to my knowledge, a 
voting list on which the sex would be indicated could not be used 
mainly to get involved in activities that would certainly not be 
right, but, as we say in the Lac-Saint-Jean region: as long as there 
are men, there are men's attitudes and, as long as there are women, 
there are women's attitudes. There may be offenders on both sides.
<P>
	All this to tell you that I encourage the members of the House to 
pass the motions moved by the Bloc relating to age. They would 
show a greatness I know they are capable of.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
	They say the purpose of committees is to improve bills. This 
legislation has many flaws, including the fact that so little time was 
provided for its consideration. But, if the majority members wanted 
to earn brownie points, they could perhaps recognize that Canada 
should include the date of birth on electoral lists, as Quebec already 
does. I hope the Human Rights Commission will not fault me for 
saying that, in this context, it is not really a question of 
discrimination on the grounds of age.
<P>
	I am counting on my colleagues across the way to support me so 
that, for once in this Parliament, all members unanimously agree 
on something important.
<P>
	I only have one minute left and I will use it to make a wish. I 
think there are many bills considered important by the government. 
So I will go as far as imploring members opposite, why not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> No, haggle.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> No, I will not. I am not like that.
<P>
	So I implore the government to take the time needed to 
determine the reasonable period that should be allowed all 
parliamentarians, including government members, to really 
examine in depth bills which have an impact on the lives of all 
Canadians, of all Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are two members rising. Normally 
we wait until all the people moving the motions have given their 
reasons and then someone from the government side gives their 
reasons why they can or cannot accept the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-63, whose title, an act to 
amend the Canada Elections Act, tells us parliamentarians about its 
importance.
<P>
	You will understand that I cannot discuss the amendments 
proposed by my party without first congratulating and thanking the 
hon. member for Bellechasse, for his excellent work regarding this 
measure.
<P>
	I am convinced that you share my conviction, as does I am sure 
the President of the Treasury Board, that this Parliament would be a 
better institution if it had more members like my colleague for 
Bellechasse, who believes in the value of words and is well aware 
that, in a democracy, the best way to oppose an idea is to come up 
with a better one.
<P>
	This is why the hon. member for Bellechasse reminded us of 
certain things. I was told that the President of the Treasury Board 
received a classical education. We will get back to this, since it has 
a direct connection with the bill and the motions. You will agree 
with me that, when we discuss issues relating to electoral 
democracy, haste is often the enemy of common sense.
<P>
	It is truly sad that, on an issue such as this one, which deals with 
the quality of representation, of democracy and of our debates, the 
government did not ask opposition parties to get much more 
involved.
<P>
	We are all mature enough, regardless of the party to which we 
belong, to know that, when it comes to such issues, it is preferable 
to seek a consensus. The hon. member for Bellechasse and the 
President of the Treasury Board are both cultivated individuals. 
The hon. member for Bellechasse quoted Boileau and reminded us 
that we had to keep working to improve the bill.
<P>
	To illustrate the importance of the motions, I too wish to quote 
Boileau and dedicate the following proverb to the President of the 
Treasury Board: ``There are those whose dull minds forever 
languish under a cloud, blind to the light of reason. What is well 
understood can be clearly expressed; the words just flow 
naturally''.
<P>
	The reason I am quoting Boileau, an author oft quoted in the 
classical colleges attended by the President of the Treasury Board, 
who is now in his fifties, is because it is important-

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am sorry to 
interrupt my colleague in the debate.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in recognizing my colleague you referred to a 
standing order. Perhaps you could suggest to us what standing 
order it is that you feel would make it inappropriate for us to speak. 
I believe that my colleague the chief opposition whip spoke and 
then my colleague from Calgary also spoke. I thought it would be 
appropriate in terms of the normal rules to allow the government to 
speak at least at that point.
<P>
	I am respectful of the Chair and I would appreciate it if you 
would point out to us the standing order to which you were 
referring.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the clarification you will bring 
into that matter, could you, by the same token, explain to the hon. 
member for Fundy-Royal why a substantial motion cannot be 
moved on a point of order?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will explain it as I attempted to do 
before.
<P>
	It seems logical, to me at least as the Chair, to have all the people 
proposing motions to rise and say why they favour their motions. 
At the end of that process, whether there is one, two, three or four, 
it really does not matter, then a government member would rise to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6602"> 6602 </A></B>
<P>
say why they either agree with or, more likely, oppose an 
amendment. That makes some sense, rather than going back and 
forth across the aisle as we normally do in debate.
<P>
	I think I discussed this earlier with members on the government 
side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. I 
believe that I was involved in some of those discussions.
<P>
	Keeping in mind what the Chair has put forward, in terms of 
members who have brought motions forward, in this case in Group 
No. 2 they would stand in the name of the hon. member for 
Bellechasse and in the name of the hon. member for Calgary West.
<P>
	I would add that the member for Laval Centre, who at this time 
and in this particular group has no motions standing in her name, 
participated in the debate. I believe, with every entitlement, that the 
hon. member for Fundy-Royal should be given the opportunity to 
speak. I think that any government member should be given the 
opportunity by that criteria.
<P>
	I understand that the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, 
who is speaking now of course, does not have a motion in this 
group. I submit that possibly a large number of members on that 
side may want to speak and the government will not be silent on 
this important piece of legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has no desire to prevent anyone 
from taking the floor. I think it is more logical to hear people in 
favour of the motion for 10 minutes. At the end of that period, 
members on the government side will be able to reply and even if 
100 of them wish to speak, they will be allowed to do so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that you would find, with the 
greatest of respect for yourself and the Chair, that sometimes things 
might be deemed to be practical and logical and that above all, the 
rules of the House must prevail which entitle members on either 
side to participate in the debate whenever they so choose and get 
the attention of the Chair, the eye of the Speaker.
<P>
	While certainly I would understand fully that the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve would complete his remarks, I 
would hope that during the remainder of the debate we would be 
given the opportunity to participate fully.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respect whatever decision you 
will take. But some members on this side of the House have taken 
positions. I see the hon. members for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, 
Parry Sound-Muskoka and Scarborough-Rouge River and I do 
not know what they think.
<P>
	Preventing alternation would be presuming that all the members 
on the government side will oppose our motions; it would also 
hamper the exchange of views that makes the debate progress and 
that builds the debate as we go on, because the points made by the 
hon. member for Fundy-Royal might convince my hon. colleague 
for Verchères, or myself or the hon. member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia that he was wrong when he 
supported his party's position.
<P>
	We have here in this House a dynamic where you ask all 
members in favour to rise first and then those opposing, but this is 
the last stage, the vote. That is the time when we will be called, one 
by one, row by row, to do it.
<P>
	I respectfully submit that during debate, the principle of 
alternation, without being applied as strictly as on second or third 
readings, should nevertheless apply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what your decision will 
be, but, should that be of any help to the Chair, we would agree 
with the suggestion of our colleague, the government whip, to 
allow the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to complete 
his remarks. After that, we could alternate to allow for an exchange 
of views, as mentioned by my colleague from Bellechasse.
<P>
	That would make for a better discussion, and prevent one side or 
the other from monopolizing the time of the House. As you 
suggested earlier, once we have expressed our views, the 
government side could have 25, 50 or even 100 speakers in a row, 
but I do not think this would be good for debate. May we suggest 
that the Chief Government Whip's proposal to alternate speakers 
be accepted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think I have heard enough. I have 
already heard from the member on this point. I do not think I need 
to hear from him again.
<P>
	The point is a difficult and important one. The principle of 
alternates is a very important principle in the House. Possibly the 
best cure is to allow the mover and the seconder to speak and then 
to respect the question of alternates.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In this case, the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
supported one of the motions. The hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve may complete his remarks. After that, 
we will have to alternate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thought we would never straighten 
this out, but I will continue. You are right to remind the House that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6603"> 6603 </A></B>
<P>
I support the motion. It may not look like it, but it does mean 
something when someone  supports a motion in this House. When I 
rose earlier in the House it was as seconder of the motion.
<P>
	What I mean is that we would like and we would have liked, as 
the hon. member for Bellechasse put it, to have plenty of time to 
consider the issue. It would have been terribly courteous, good 
practice and extremely respectful to invite opposition parties, both 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, to take part in the 
drafting of this bill.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Bellechasse reminded the House, that 
was done when the issue of redistribution of seats was addressed. 
Let us not forget that some people fought hard and lost their lives 
for the right to be heard in Parliament.
<P>
	It is important to come to an agreement on the issues of 
democracy and representation. In our system we have a tool called 
the list of electors. Why do we have such a tool? Because we brag 
about having the cleanest, most transparent election practices of 
the whole world, which promote a strong democracy through 
representation. The voters' list is an extremely important tool.
<P>
	We are convinced that the more complete it is, the more 
information it contains, the easier it will be to track down abusers. 
This is why we want to see on this voters' list the same thing we 
have in Quebec, which is identity information, like the age and sex 
of voters. This would be useful come election time, enabling 
support staff, the clerk, and representatives to ensure that

	The mining industry in Canada plays a vital role in the continued

many rural and remote communities that depend on it for their very

Organization and in its efforts globally to protect all Canadians 
who are dependent on a prosperous industry for their livelihood.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate National Patriots Day. By dedicating the Sunday 
closest to November 23 to the memory of those who fought for the 
fundamental values of freedom and democracy-as my colleague 
from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve mentioned a few moments 
ago-Quebecers want to pay tribute to the patriots who did 
everything they could to leave us a country we can call our own, a 
country that meets our aspirations.
<P>
	Their contribution to the history of Quebec and Canada is 
unquestionable. In fact, on October 7, the Maison nationale des 
Patriotes, located in Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu, received a 
prestigious award from Parks Canada. This house, which once 
belonged to merchant and patriot Jean-Baptiste Mâsse, has been 
converted into an interpretation centre. Visitors are reminded of the 
events that led to the patriots rebellion in 1837 and 1838, when 
those who were then called ``Canadians'' fought against the British 
colonial regime.
<P>
	Since each brick and each stone of a building is essential to its 
construction, each action taken by these patriots must make us 
proud of these men and women-

Transpo and its management.

	Many Canadians, including me, are concerned about the 
employment situation in Canada. Jobs are a source of income and 
dignity for Canadians. Jobs are also crucial to the economic 
well-being of this country and remain one of my top priorities.
<P>
	To create more jobs we must get Canada's public finances under 
control. The reduction of the deficit is of course essential to job 
creation and growth. The present government is well on its way to 
meet its targets and the country's economy is already reaping the 
benefits through the lowest interest rates since 1964.

	Current unemployment levels on reserves are pegged at 47 per

greater dependency on the state. Unemployment on reserves would

people's identity. In Quebec, it is a major factor of our history, our

<P>
	A study by the Conseil de la langue française published

	We know that the linguistic balance will always be fragile in a

promote the survival of the French language but also of those that

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Dussault-Erasmus report says that native bands must 
be recognized as aboriginal nations. The government is still 
dragging its heels as far as giving them this recognition is 
concerned. Since 1983, however, the Government of Quebec has 
recognized its native peoples as distinct nations entitled to their 
own culture, language and customs.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us whether the federal government intends 
to recognize aboriginals as distinct nations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member looked at 
the history, he would realize we have always recognized aboriginal 
people as being distinct in this country.
<P>
	Unfortunately being recognized as distinct has not enhanced 
their well-being. Right now they are looking to be up at a level 
table with their fellow Canadians. However, they have been here 
for 10,000 years. There is legislation and more constitutional and 
legal responsibility to deal with aboriginal peoples as distinct.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it would be useful, as the commission report points out, to 
do so officially, because this is not the case. Otherwise, the report 
would not have raised this issue.
<P>
	It is difficult, I think, for the federal government to recognize the 
existence of distinct nations. We know this is so for Quebec, and 
we can see it in the case of native peoples as well.
<P>
	I ask the minister whether he will agree, as a first step in 
negotiations with native peoples, to table a motion in the House 
recognizing aboriginals as distinct nations, just as Quebec did over 
ten years ago? I can tell him in advance that he can count on the 
support of the official opposition if he tables such a motion.

trying to avoid the Reform Party's ``games'', to use the minister's 
word, I can tell you we will not get very far as a society.
<P>
	A number of provinces have still not recognized native peoples 
as distinct nations. Will the minister undertake to promote 
Quebec's initiative with those provinces that have still not given 
this recognition, so that they will join forces with the federal 
government in this essential recognition of native peoples as 
nations in order to set the stage for any serious negotiations? That 
is the first step, to recognize that they exist as nations, and then to 
begin negotiations. This is what natives are calling for, it is what 
the report recommends, Quebec has done it, and I urge the minister 
to do the same on a federal level and take this message to the 
provinces in order to encourage them as well to follow Quebec's 
example.

<P>
	The resolution of the assembly from René Lévesque may have 
said this, but in fact the separatists of Quebec feel-as said by 
various ministers in Quebec-that they have the right to take the 10 
aboriginal communities and the Inuit with them if they decide to 
unilaterally secede from Canada. This is not the law. We do not 
accept it. It is in the Supreme Court of Canada and hopefully the

Court of Canada on UDI that they want us to pay to the Churchill

The federal government is slow in admitting its mistakes relating to 
the abuse of aboriginal children in residential schools.

not going to give the history of the  last three years. I will just give 
the history of the last three weeks.
<P>
	In the last three weeks we have admitted our mistakes 
collectively in Labrador. We are reaching agreement with the Inuit 
of Davis Inlet on relocation. We have admitted our mistakes north 
of the 60th parallel by not allowing First Nations to come to the 
negotiating table when we are talking about minerals. We have a 
package, BHP in the territories and Treaty No. 8 and Treaty No. 11 
of which the federal government is proud.
<P>
	Two weeks ago in Saskatchewan we admitted our mistakes. In 
the provinces of Saskatchewan and B.C. we say there is an inherent 
right of First Nations. I would be the first to admit that we have 
made mistakes in the past and I would be the first as a 
representative of this government to go out there and try to do our 
best to remedy those mistakes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, this may 
well be question period, but it is certainly not an answer period. At 
least four questions have been asked of the minister, and he has 
sidestepped them all.
<P>
	To get back to residential schools. Residential schools weakened 
aboriginal culture, weakened aboriginal languages, weakened 
aboriginal traditions. I have a serious question to ask of the 
minister. I am asking him to give me an answer.
<P>
	How can the minister deny the government's responsibility-we 
are asking him to acknowledge it, not deny it-when, thirty years 
ago, in the days of the residential schools, the government had 
recognized in court that residential school staff were employees of 
the crown. Let it then acknowledge its responsibility.

policies related to aboriginal peoples.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	The minister mocked our suggestion that individual aboriginal 
people be given a choice about where they want their money sent. 
Do they want their money sent to the chief and council or do they 
want to receive the money directly from the federal government?
<P>
	Why is the minister afraid to make treaty entitlements payable 
directly to grassroots Indian people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will play it a little slower for 
the hon. member.
<P>
	In our relationship with governments, whether it is Alberta or 
B.C., on the transfers that the Minister of Finance makes with our 
programs, we deal with governments. They decide whether they are 
going to build hospitals or schools.
<P>
	Is the Reform suggesting that we send all of the people in B.C. a 
cheque directly from the Minister of Finance, leaving us broke and 
leaving the provincial government broke? That does not work.
<P>
	What Reform is suggesting is that we send $10,000 to each 
native, which means that there is nothing in my budget, nothing in 
the Minister of Health's budget and nothing in the Minister of 
Justice's budget. That is what the Reform is suggesting.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> What a shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> You are smarter than that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> I am smarter than that. It is too bad that the Reform 
member is not smarter than that. That is what he said on TV 
yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the comments of the minister make it abundantly clear 
that the minister is afraid to cut funds to the Indian industry.
<P>
	On page 39 of volume 5 of the royal commission's report it 
states that in 1992-93 government expenditures relating to the 
aboriginal people were $15,714 for every man, woman and child. 
That is before adding in increases in federal funding since that time 
which total $1.5 billion.
<P>
	Can the minister tell Canadians how much of this cash actually 
finds its way into the hands of grassroots Indian people living on 
the reserves?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is mistruths or 
misinformation that the Reform is putting out. I will go slowly or 
maybe we can put it into cartoons so the Reform will understand it.
<P>
	When a school is built worth $10 million to $12 million, the 
Reform has taken that money for that school vis-à-vis Indians and 
said that every Indian gets $15,000. That is not a fact. In fact 
schools are built with it. Sewers are built with it. Water systems are 
built with it. All these things are done to help all the public on the 
reserves. That does not mean that an individual Indian gets $15,000 
any more than it means that because Parliament Buildings are here 
the cost of these Parliament Buildings is $10,000 or $15,000 in the 
pocket of each Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, back in 1969, when the present Prime Minister was the 
minister of Indian affairs, the Liberals had a policy based on the 
fundamental principle of equality. I quote: ``Non-discriminatory 
participation of Indian people in Canadian society.'' If they had 
stayed on 
<P>

<P>
the equality track maybe there would have been no Oka, no 
Gustafsen Lake and no Ipperwash.
<P>
	When will the minister repeal the Indian Act which divides us on 
the basis of race and replace it with new legislation based on the 
principles of equality, democracy and accountability; principles 
that would give individual Indian people real choices about what 
they want done with their land and their treaty entitlements?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are looking at the Indian Act 
now. We will be looking at 18 sections in which the minister has 
power that will be transferred to aboriginal people.
<P>
	We will be looking at sections pertaining to western Canada 
which say that they cannot sell their grain unless I approve it. In 
western Canada they cannot sell their pork unless I approve it.
<P>

December. From what this member said today, I expect him to be 
on his feet supporting those amendments.

<P>
	The situation is straightforward. This is the restructuring of a

suppliers to take part. It requires American Airlines' parent 
company, AMR, to take part and it requires substantial change to 
change it from a company in the red, a company which is losing 
money, to a profitable company which is in the black.

aboriginal women are concerned about their right of individual

back to the charter of rights. It was always the position of the

should be entrenched, that there should not be a notwithstanding 
clause. It is there only because it was forced on us by the premiers 
and by the Conservative governments of the time.
<P>

out of the Constitution so that the charter of rights is free standing

	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the industry minister.
<P>
	On Monday, in response to a suggestion by the Bloc Quebecois 
to merge Canadian International and Air Canada, the industry 
minister stated that it would be an insult for western Canada. 
However, the fact of Canada having a single international air 
carrier is not insulting, either for the West or for Quebec. It is clear 
that the minister's statement was only intended to exacerbate 
tensions between Quebec and western Canada.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that the only fair and lasting solution to 
the problems facing the airline industry in Canada is the one put 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois, namely to create one single 
international airline as is the case for instance in France, England 
and Germany?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, government policy with respect to air travel is to try to 
encourage competition so that the Canadian consumer can receive 
the benefit of lower fares and more frequent flights.
<P>
	We do not have before us a serious proposal from anyone, 
including the Bloc, to merge the two airlines. What we have instead 
is a situation where one of the two major airlines in Canada is 
facing restructuring so that it can occupy a more profitable niche of 
the air travel market and where it can be turned from a company 
that has been losing substantial amounts of money into a company 
that is profitable.
<P>
	I should remind the hon. member that Air Canada too over the 
last 10 years has lost substantial amounts of money, approximately 
$600 million.

come forth with its package, which it will do.

for the transport minister.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has just received copy of a 1992 report 
produced for Transport Canada showing that there are so many 
flaws in the ferry running from Magdalen Islands to the mainland, 
the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I>, that it would cost close to $12 million 
to refit that ship which could otherwise be the cause of some major 
incident, and even the loss of lives. This morning local 
stakeholders informed us that, since 1992, only $4 million have 
been invested in the refitting of the ferry.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to publish the coast guard report on the 
safety of the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I> and does he intend to go 
ahead with the plans for replacing that ferry, in accordance with 
what was asked by the round table on transportation for the 
Magdalen Islands in a letter sent to the Prime Minister and of

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
government ran on a platform of jobs, yet thousands of jobs are 
being lost in sawmills right across the country. Mills are shutting 
down because lumber quotas, which this government controls, are 
being allocated in secret. The provinces and the companies agreed 
on the allocation formula, however they did not and do not agree 
with all the secrecy. Mill owners cannot understand why there is so 
much secrecy regarding a resource that is owned by the public. Mill 
owners feel that the minister is playing politics with their jobs.
<P>
	My question is for the minister of trade. As the minister refuses 
to table individual mill quotas thus keeping them secret, will he at 
least table a full list of companies that received lumber quotas in 
the last round?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister for International Trade has responded to 
these questions several times in the House pointing out there are 
basic commercial rights that have to be honoured and respected.
<P>
	It is important to point out that the allocation formula for the 
softwood lumber quota was arrived at, at full, open, transparent 
consultations with all the industry. There was nothing secret and 
nothing hidden. It was done in full co-operation with the industry.
<P>
	The hon. member's suggestion now that there is some kind of 
conspiracy and plot by the government simply indicates that he is 
in fact accusing the industry itself of that kind of practice because 
the quota system was totally and completely done in full 
co-operation with the private sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
exactly the reverse. It is now the companies that are accusing this 
government of conspiracy.
<P>
	The minister has stated in this House that he has no problems if 
individual companies publicly divulge their lumber allocation 
quotas. The problem is that only the minister knows which 
companies were allotted quotas.
<P>
	In order to save jobs, individual mill owners must be able to 
negotiate allocations between themselves. However, they do not 
know the players because the minister refuses to release the names 
to the public.
<P>
	In order to save sawmill jobs, will the minister table a full list of 
companies receiving lumber quotas?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very important to go to what is the basic cause of the 
hon. member's protestations in the House. The fact is that once the 
quotas were allocated, many companies used up their allocation in 
a very anxious way to take advantage of the market. That was a 
business decision that they made. Now that they have found that 
the allocation of the quota is no longer sufficient, they are 
attempting to find ways of increasing it.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade said there is a reserve 
system that can be given to companies that they in effect can bank 
their quota against next year's allocation. That would allow them to 
keep their plants running and keep the jobs going. It is an orderly 
system that was set up under the agreement.
<P>
	To now start trying to bargain in the Chamber of the House of 
Commons about getting more individual allocations for individual 
companies is simply not the way to do good business.

that nature are also being committed elsewhere in the world.

under section 54(1) of the Judges Act to Madam Justice Louise 
Arbour. While that section may give him the authority to grant 
leaves of absence, he certainly does not have the authority to allow 
her to assume other duties, because section 55 of the Judges Act 
states: ``No judge shall, either directly or indirectly, engage in any 
other occupational business other than judicial duties''.
<P>
	On what basis did the Minister of Justice approve the leave of 
absence for Madam Justice Arbour to work as a prosecutor for the 
UN while she is still a judge? We have just heard the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs tell us that she is going to be an active and 
aggressive prosecutor. She is a member of the impartial bench in 
Canada. How can she be an impartial judge and a prosecutor at the 
same time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is discouraging to have to 
respond to that question and it is distressing that the question was 
put.
<P>
	A few feet away from the member's place an exchange just 
occurred involving the Minister of Foreign Affairs who described 
to the House the honour that was done this country when one of our 
best, a judge of the Ontario  Court of Appeal, was asked to assume 
responsibility as the chief prosecutor for war crimes. By 
unanimous resolution of the United Nations Security Council she 
was singled out for that task. She left her judicial duties. She took a 
leave of absence. She has travelled halfway around the world to 
work in difficult circumstances engaged in that crucial 
responsibility.
<P>
	During the months that we have tried to amend the statute to 
overcome the technical prohibition against her being paid by others 
for doing that work, we have encountered nothing but 
meanspirited, narrow-focused and inappropriate objections from 
sources who somehow fail to grasp both the importance of that 
work and the honour that she brings to this country.
<P>
	I invite the hon. member to rise above the niggling legalisms 
upon which he now relies for partisan purposes and to join with this 
government in making sure that Madam Justice Louise Arbour is 
permitted to do that work on behalf of Canada and on behalf of all 
humanity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
disturbed by the response from the Minister of Justice who is 
asking me to rise above niggling little legal details which prevent 
Madam Justice Louise Arbour from taking this position. The 
Minister of Justice is the highest position in this land to uphold the 
law of this land. To have those kinds of words coming from him in 
this House belittles the position which he holds.
<P>
	Let me quote the minister's own words. Before the Senate 
committee on October 7 he said: ``There is no provision in the 
Judges Act for a federally appointed judge such as Madam Justice 
Louise Arbour to be granted a leave of absence without pay to work 
for an international organization such as the United Nations''.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	I have a great deal of respect for Madam Justice Louise Arbour. I 
have a great deal of respect for the work that she has been asked to 
do in the United Nations, but I do not think that we should trample 
the laws of Canada to allow her to go over there to uphold the laws 
for the United Nations.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice could have picked anyone else in Canada 
rather than someone from the bench. I am sure there are many 
people who are perfectly capable of doing the job. Therefore, I ask 
him again: Why is he allowing the laws of this land to be trampled 
in order for someone to uphold the laws somewhere else?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member combines an 
ignorance of the law with a meanness of spirit when he puts that 
question.

Arbour, it was the United Nations Security Council. Second,

<P>
Madam Justice Arbour is not  in breach of any Canadian law in 
taking a leave of absence for other purposes.

	The prohibition in the Judges Act is against her taking money 
from any other source. It is that which is addressed by Bill C-42, 
which was passed by this House, sent back with an amendment by 
the Senate for reasons best known to the Senate, and which is now 
before this House for adoption with the Senate's change.

to its IFOR peacekeepers to assist in bringing these indicted war 
criminals to justice?

Speaker, I am certainly glad that we are now engaging in an 
exchange on one of the more crucial and vital contributions that 
Canada can make through the work of Justice Arbour in the 
international realm.
<P>
	What we know now is that there are still many unindicted war 
criminals in Bosnia. Until they are apprehended, the opportunity 
for a peaceful solution in that country will be severely hindered. 
We will begin to discuss over the next three or four weeks in the

apprehend these criminals and to support the work of the tribunal. I

government by using the birth certificate of a person deceased four 
years earlier, without any check being made by the department.
<P>
	Last year, the department's investigators uncovered, to their 
dismay, fraud in excess of $4 million. Can the minister tell us about 
the scope of this year's fraudulent activities and why it is so easy to 
cheat?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada and 
the Department of Human Resources Development have a duty to 
serve Canadians well. When people apply for benefits late, that is 
some time after they have become entitled to such benefits, we 
quickly issue a cheque to them and a verification is conducted 
during the weeks and the months following the issuance of that first 
cheque. This is a perfectly normal procedure.
<P>
	However, it is illegal to deliberately submit an ineligible 
application to the department and to take advantage of our goodwill 
and our good faith. We want to reassure this House and all 
Canadians that we have audit systems in place to detect fraudulent 
activities, and that these systems are constantly updated and have 
been greatly improved in recent years, thanks to the new 
technology.
<P>
	Canadians should know that losing $4 million out of a total 
budget of $57 billion is pretty good compared to what happens in 
many other countries, and that we are working very hard to 
improve the system even more, because Canadians deserve the 
best.
<P>
	The bottom line is that those who are entitled to a cheque must 
receive it as quickly as possible. Providing good service must 
remain our priority.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in answer to a question, the Minister of Transport pointed 
out that, because of his lack of experience, my young colleague 
from Lac-Saint-Jean did not seem to understand that any minister 
can answer any question from the opposition, according to the 
principle of cabinet responsibility.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport, who has been a member of this House 
for a longer period of time, who has a lot of experience, should be 
aware that the Speaker has previously informed the official 
opposition that any question dealing with the administrative duties 
of an individual minister or with a statement made by an individual 
minister should be put to the minister in question.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I just wanted to remind my colleague, the Minister of Transport, 
that seniority and experience are not always synonymous with 
wisdom and good judgment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member seems to be mixing up the questions put 
and the responses given.
<P>
	The fact is that any member of the opposition can address any 
question to any member of the government. However, the Prime 
Minister may answer any question himself or some other minister 
might answer any question, depending on the decision of the 
government.
<P>
	The actual response to a question from the other side of the 
House is from the government. The government speaks as one 
voice and, therefore, the principle of the solidarity of cabinet is 
preserved.
<P>
	I will be happy to discuss this more fully with the hon. House 
leader of the opposition because really there is no issue of privilege 
whatsoever or a point of order.
<P>
	If the member wishes to have lunch with me sometime and chat 
about this a bit more, we might even invite the Speaker to come 
along.

<P>
	However, I want to point out to the Minister of Transport that, 
pursuant to a previous ruling by the Speaker, my young colleague 
could not put his question to anyone else but the Minister of 
Industry, who preferred to dodge the question and evade the issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I want to thank my colleagues for their

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the jointly administered Pacific Marine Heritage Legacy Park

determined to be: (<I>a</I>) the amount of money for use in the purchase of lands north of 
Active Pass for fiscal 1996-97 and (<I>b</I>) the priority list of those locations north of 
Active Pass which are to be purchased?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Within their total allocation of $60 million to the Pacific Marine 
Heritage Legacy, PMHL, over five years, the governments of 
Canada and British Columbia have not specified precise 
expenditures for each fiscal year. Instead, priorities for land 
acquisition are being determined on an ongoing basis as lands that 
meet PMHL selection criteria become available on a willing 
seller-willing buyer basis. Similarly, the proportion of those lands 
that lie north or south of Active Pass and their relative priority for 
acquisition can fluctuate depending on factors that include the 
potential contribution of available lands to the protected area 
objectives of the PMHL, their ability to meet or exceed land 
selection criteria, and cost. Some of these private lands are north of 
Active Pass, including some that because of their priority interest 
are under active but confidential consideration with land owners. 
Land acquisition expenditures in 1995-96 totalled $10.75 million.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAELECTIONSACT">CANADA ELECTIONS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-63, an act to amend 
the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act, as reported 
(with amendments) from the committee; and Group No. 2 of 
motions.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has five minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, think of all we can do in five minutes. It is fantastic.
<P>
	So, I was reminding you of how pleased I am to speak on Bill 
C-63 because the type of representative we will establish as 
parliamentarians depends on it.
<P>
	I was reminding you of how sad I am to see that the government 
did not include the opposition parties in this House, that is, the 
official opposition and the third party, in the consultation and 
drafting process of this bill.
<P>
	And I was reminding you of how proud we are, as an opposition 
party, to have been able to depend on the hon. member for 
Bellechasse, who combines the qualities of a highly skilled lawyer 
and those of a seasoned parliamentarian with such flair.
<P>
	I was also reminding you of all the motions we have to put 
forward because this bill leaves so much to be desired. We hope 
that the government will agree to those amendments, because we 
believe that they will be better for democracy.
<P>
	I was reminding you of how easy it can be, in this democratic 
system of ours, to make ourselves heard, even when one comes 
from a humble background-and I am certainly a case in 
point-since I, the son of a labourer, was able to run for office and 
get elected in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve after a campaign that cost 
only $35,000. When we come to think of it, it is really not much, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6618"> 6618 </A></B>
<P>
compared to the Americans who almost have to be an official 
member of a lobby to be elected.
<P>
	We know that the quality of our electoral practices depends on a 
number of things. We brought to the attention of the government 
the fact that there is a means to keep the process under control, 
which is called a list of electors.
<P>
	You know how important this voters' list is, since it supposedly 
contains the names of all the people who can vote and who, as we 
know, meet a number of requirements in terms mainly of 
citizenship, age and place of residence.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	We have questions regarding the government's refusal to allow 
the age of voters to be shown on the list of electors. It is a 
questionable position. The more the list will include detailed 
information, the easier it will be for all parties concerned to 
identify cheaters. There is nothing partisan about that.
<P>
	You will certainly understand that if, on election day, workers at 
a polling station greet at their table a man named Réal Ménard who, 
according to the list of electors, is 34 years old and the person 
standing in front of them seems to be 70 years old, they will know 
that something is wrong. The vigilance of the staff on election day 
will help identify cheaters and stop the voting process when 
unauthorized people show up at the poll. I think the government's 
position to refuse such an argument is questionable.
<P>
	The same thing applies to gender identification. It is not a matter 
of quality or quantity, but simply a matter of knowing if we are 
dealing with a male or a female voter. I take these things very 
seriously and it seems to me that it would be in our best interests to 
have as much information as possible in order to identify cheaters.
<P>
	We cannot accept the rather obsessive argument of the Reform 
Party that the availability of this information will lead to sexual 
harassment. It is true that the list of electors is a public document 
and that the chief electoral officer has to make it available to any 
individual or group upon request. But I still do not think the 
Reformers' argument is valid.
<P>
	The existence of such a list is not the kind of factor that would 
encourage people who have a predisposition towards sexual 
harassment to act on their impulses. We do not want to minimize 
the importance of this extremely complex problem, but there is 
certainly no correlation between the amendment we are proposing 
and the kind of legislation the Reform Party wants to see passed in 
this House.
<P>
	We are much too aware of the importance of representation. We 
know only too well what it means to have an elections act that is 
truly reflective of the wishes of all parties. I believe the member, 
whose riding escapes me for the moment, but of which he, no 
doubt, is the worthy representative, knows the importance of 
consensus in this matter. It is not true that in matters of  legitimacy, 
in matters which concerns us as parliamentarians and members of 
Parliament, we can afford to do without a real debate.
<P>
	It is not true that we should be delighted by the haste shown by 
the government. This government did not show a lack of courtesy 
when the time came to consult us on the issue of riding 
redistribution and revision of the electoral map.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bellechasse is in a very good position to 
confirm that we were very closely involved in the process. He 
reminded us that, with the help of all parties represented in the 
House, we took more than a year to do the required revision work.
<P>
	Why the sudden haste, the lack of courtesy on the part of the 
government and its representatives, who decided not to call upon 
the opposition parties, since we know that the House would have 
come out of this a better House? Think about the impact we would 
have had if we had been able to say that the bill before us, Bill C-63 
to amend the Elections Act, is truly what all parties in the House 
wanted. I believe the government treated this matter off-handedly.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I think that the government did not live up to its responsibilities, 
and certainly lacked courtesy, by not allowing the opposition to 
fully participate in the review and enhancement of such an 
important bill.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know that you are as committed to democracy as I 
am, and that makes you a very endearing Speaker, but do you not 
think that it would have been advisable to take advantage of the 
debate to discuss the funding of political parties?
<P>
	I know that in a few minutes we will have the opportunity to 
discuss this matter, but I believe that it would have been wiser for 
the government to go back to the basic meaning of the word. It 
would have been a lot better for the government to draw inspiration 
from the practices currently in effect in Quebec.
<P>
	As you know, and I will conclude on this, there has been for 
more than a decade in Quebec a political party financing act which 
is extremely democratic. And I will get back to this later.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to thank both the hon. member for Bellechasse and the 
member for Calgary West for their participation in the committee. I 
very much appreciated, as I did that of all members of my own 
party, their participation in the discussions involved with 
amendments to this particularly important piece of legislation.
<P>
	Before I specifically deal with the motions that are before us I 
want to make one comment, in particular as it  relates to something 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6619"> 6619 </A></B>
<P>
that my colleague from Calgary West said and my colleague from 
Bellechasse. This bill came to the committee after first reading and 
the role of the committee after first reading.
<P>
	It is important also to acknowledge that there was a royal 
commission, the Lortie commission, in 1991 that dealt specifically 
with some fundamental changes that ought to occur in electoral 
reform in Canada.
<P>
	My hon. colleague will know that there were literally dozens and 
dozens, hundreds in fact, hours of representations and work that 
was done for the Lortie commission and the good work that has 
been done by our own House committee on procedure and House 
affairs.
<P>
	The government's reaction and response with the bill that has 
come before us today is not something that was written on the back 
of an envelope. There has been a significant genesis that has 
evolved that has brought us to this period today. It is important for 
listeners and for colleagues of this House to remember that it is 
extremely important to have a consensus, in particular when it is 
dealing with this most important matter of electoral change.
<P>
	As the chairman, I was particularly pleased to see that in 
principle there was a general consensus or an acceptance on the 
issue of a voter registry and that there was a general consensus on 
the principle of a shorter electoral campaign in view of the costs, 
the significant cost issues involved.
<P>
	I know I will have an opportunity to speak to a number of other 
issues as they are presented later in this debate but I also want to 
specifically talk about the motion of my hon. friend. The list of 
electors derived from the federal registry will be distributed to the 
candidates and political parties.
<P>
	The date of birth information in particular in our view is not 
considered essential to proper identification of voters on the list of 
electors. That is not just our view as the government and it is not 
just the view of many Canadians. It is important that the privacy 
commissioner's view is also considered, as I know my hon. 
colleague would want to have it considered.
<P>
	I share the view that the date of birth information reveals 
personal information about voters. I do not believe that Canadians 
are prepared to see that level of personal information shared so 
widely.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I accept and respect the views that are being presented in this 
House by my hon. colleagues but I have to respectfully submit in 
response to this particular motion that I think it is an intrusion. In 
fact, the privacy commissioner and the chief electoral officer have 
informed the committee not only on the issues of date of birth but 
also as it relates to gender, that on the second  point, gender 
information, raised by my colleague, the opposition whip, it was 
felt it was useful for administrative identifiers for electors who 
have names common to both sexes.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Calgary, was talking about 
the gender issue. I think it is important that the privacy 
commissioner stated that he did not see the voluntary collection of 
privacy information as a significant issue. In other words, gender 
was not a significant issue and he did not recommend the removal 
of gender. It was for those reasons that while we heard the views of 
hon. members, we felt it was the preferred approach to take the 
view we took in the legislation presented.
<P>
	In responding specifically to the two motions contained in this 
group, those are the comments that I wish to offer to my hon. 
colleagues. I want to thank them for their participation. I regret that 
they did not gain or feel they had the same opportunity to 
participate in the debate at the committee stage.
<P>
	They may recall that in March of this year the chief electoral 
officer came to our committee and presented the concept of a 
registry. I defer to the seniority on the committee of my hon. 
colleague, the member for Bellechasse, who was on this committee 
for quite a period of time prior to my assuming its chair.
<P>
	He will recall that the concept of a registry is something that was 
universally endorsed as a good concept. I know that he does not 
necessarily take issue with that concept but it is perhaps the process 
that he did not find as friendly as he would have preferred.
<P>
	While I regret that he has not endorsed it, perhaps over the 
course of this debate as we discuss this he may see his way clear to 
finding support for the proposal as it is being put forward. I thank 
my colleagues for their participation. This concludes my remarks 
related to this grouping of motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to contribute to this debate as it relates to two specific articles.
<P>
	It was interesting that the member from the Bloc said there is 
information that has to be given at a time when a person has a 
driver's licence. Of course that is true but the last time I looked we 
do not distribute the information from the driver's licence to 
candidates and political parties or post the information in such a 
way that it becomes public.
<P>
	Clearly the idea of the inclusion of the date of birth may be of 
value with respect to the registry itself, but surely to do with the list 
of electors I cannot say I agree with my colleague. I cannot see any 
value to having that information. With respect to the comments just 
made that the privacy commissioner did not see the inclusion of 
designation of sex as a significant issue or as necessary, I would 
like to read a letter which is very indicative of  correspondence that 
many of the members of our party have received and I suggest with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6620"> 6620 </A></B>
<P>
respect that there may be Liberals who have received this kind of 
correspondence.
<P>
	It is dated November 29, 1995: ``Thousands of Canadian women 
attempt to maintain the security of their domiciles with gender 
neutral references whenever possible. These efforts are nullified at 
election time by lists of electors which clearly note gender, 
complete with a current address. This information is widely 
circulated, being readily available in post offices throughout 
Canada, and used, copied and distributed in campaign offices 
extensively. When one of the research assistants to one of our 
members questioned Elections Canada about this system, the 
research assistant was informed that it was necessary to protect the 
integrity of the list''.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The writer in this case was from the province of Alberta. She 
wrote: ``The province of Alberta manages to elect their government 
without putting females at risk''.
<P>
	I ask the Liberals if they would not rethink this particular item. 
Unfortunately we have reached a point in our society-and it is a 
low point in our society-where women are put at risk because of 
certain dangerous elements in our society. We have to be much 
more sensitive in this place to what we are doing. With all due 
respect to the privacy commissioner, for whom I generally have a 
great deal of respect, I cannot respect his position that this is not a 
significant issue.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the Liberals that the protestation 
made a couple of minutes ago that perhaps there should have been 
more discussion and more consultation at the committee stage is a 
little hollow. It is my understanding that there was a real rush to get 
this through committee and that, in fact, the Liberals did not allow 
sufficient time. As a matter of fact, it is probable that the Liberals, 
because they have left this matter for so long, are probably going to 
have to invoke closure to even get this through in time to meet their 
agenda.
<P>
	Once again the House of Commons is being treated like a rubber 
stamp. The Liberals, when they suddenly wake up and discover that 
they have a problem with a timetable or legislation, out of the clear 
blue sky, very quickly, come to the House and say: ``Let us punch it 
right on through''. It is an unfortunate practice, an unfortunate 
happenstance, that the Liberals have chosen, systematically, to 
treat the House as a rubber stamp.
<P>
	That being a very partisan comment, let me go back to the issue 
at hand. Unlike one of the Bloc members who said she would not 
plead or she would not negotiate, I am asking very sincerely, on 
behalf of the women of Canada, that the government take a very 
serious look at this issue of including gender on voters' lists. I say 
that because there are single women within my family and  
acquaintances who, for example, will put an initial in a phone book 
as opposed to designating themselves as being female.
<P>
	This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue of public safety for 
women. I ask the Liberals to rethink their position on this issue and 
vote in favour of the exclusion of gender on electors' lists.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral): </B>I now recognize 
the hon. member for-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Matapédia-Matane.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral):</B> 
Matapédia-Matane. But I know it by heart.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate you, except you should remember that I 
represent Matapédia-Matane.
<P>
	I would like to open up the debate just a bit, rather than limiting 
my remarks solely to the amendment by my colleague, the member 
for Bellechasse, who deserves special congratulations for his 
amendments, because he introduced several.
<P>
	I think that we are moving a bit too quickly, and that we should 
look a bit more closely at what has been done. I am not on the 
committee, but it is important not to act in haste. In my view, there 
is a great deal at stake.
<P>
	A year, or a year and a half ago as I recall, the riding of 
Matapédia-Matane was even going to be wiped off the map.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The people I spoke with said: ``That's crazy. Who thought that 
up?'' I said: ``It is a mandate of the government, which thinks that 
Matapédia-Matane does not have the necessary population, and 
they want to go by population''. That got quite a reaction out of 
people.
<P>
	The second agreement was that, instead of eliminating the riding 
of Matapédia-Matane, they are going to redraw the boundaries of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. This does not make any sense 
either, because if I draw you a map, or if you travel at all, you will 
see that the riding of Matapédia-Matane takes in Matane, 
obviously, and Amqui; on the north shore, Sainte-Anne-des-Monts 
and Cap-Chat as far as Madeleine; on the other shore, it takes in 
Carleton and Maria, no small distance.
<P>
	The old riding consisted of the triangle formed by Mont-Joli, 
Matane and Amqui, which worked fine. There is no longer any 
sense of belonging. People really are right to say that they should 
go back to the drawing board and set up another commission, one 
that will listen to people in the regions. Village by village, these 
people have built a sort of family. When one village is lumped in 
with another, they feel hard done by, excluded. They are virtually 
excluded. I am therefore asking them to go back  to the drawing 
board, or if they do not have the courage to do so, that at the least 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6621"> 6621 </A></B>
<P>
the Bloc amendments as proposed by my colleague from 
Bellechasse be accepted.
<P>
	Looking at the amendment proposing that the date of birth be 
included, this strikes me as logic itself. I would not like to pick up 
on the arguments of other members who have been quoting 
Boileau. One could quote other philosophers and say this: Listen up 
here. When something is obvious, it is obvious, so let us give up 
demonstrating it over and over. There is something obvious 
involved here, and we are trying to demonstrate an evident truth. 
Let us give up on that and just accept what is pure common sense.
<P>
	What are the advantages other than those already mentioned? 
When someone turns 15, we will know it. When we say, in 
connection with the total population, that there are so and so many 
people in Canada, in Quebec, aged 16, 17, 18, we will know and 
can then take the necessary steps to provide them with some 
political education. The first time somebody votes is really 
something special for him or her. The schools are giving young 
people more and more information now, but those who have never 
shown any interest could be given more preparation when they 
reach 16, 17 or 18. With the figures in front of us, we will be able to 
help them and provide them with more information.
<P>
	For these reasons, because there are many arguments on both 
sides, from the Reform Party and from the Bloc, I am asking the 
House to support the amendment of my colleague from 
Bellechasse, and I shall be speaking later on the other amendments.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to say a few words in this debate. I did 
not intend to, but I was listening to my colleagues, and I thought I 
would like to comment on the amendments presented by the hon. 
member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	By the same token, I would like to thank him for and 
congratulate him on the excellent work he did on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois and the official opposition, but of course, first and 
foremost, on behalf of voters in the riding of Bellechasse, in 
Quebec and even in Canada. The amendments he proposed will 
make the process more democratic. That being the case, every 
citizen of Quebec and Canada stands to gain.
<P>
	It would be too easy to go along with the demands of those who 
want the voters' list to be absolutely minimal, the excuse being 
respect for privacy and personal information, and so forth. The 
hon. member for Laval Centre made a very apt comment when she 
said that every citizen is entitled to a passport. The passport 
contains a certain amount of information, and no one challenges 
the need to include all this information. It only makes sense.
<P>
	We all know there was quite a to-do about passports, so there 
must be some consensus in this House on the issue. When we go 
abroad, it is important for the customs officer to know who we are. 
It is even more important when we vote to elect the people who 
represent and govern us. In that case there must be no 
misunderstanding about the identity of the people who exercise 
their franchise.
<P>
	I think it is important to indicate the gender of the voter on the 
list. I know this is a very emotional issue, but as the hon. member 
for Laval Centre pointed out earlier, the first name often gives a 
good indication of the gender of the voter, but in some cases, it may 
not work.
<P>
	Take my own first name, for instance. Mr. Speaker, if you will 
allow me to indicate my first name, which is Stephane. Unlike the 
hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, my first name is spelled with an 
``e'' at the end. While for many francophones the name 
``Stéphane'' is clearly a man's name, for many of our anglophone 
colleagues it is not obvious that the name ``Stéphane'' with an ``e'' 
at the end is a man's name.
<P>
	I can tell you that in the three years I have sat in the House of 
Commons, I have received a lot of mail addressed ``Dear Mme 
Stéphane Bergeron'' or ``Mrs. Stéphane Bergeron'' or when people 
wanted to make my name masculine, they would take off the ``e'', 
because, in English, such names, like Joanne or Suzanne, are 
usually women's names. I think, under the circumstances, to avoid 
any confusion, the gender of the voter must appear on the electoral 
list.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Camille.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Camille is a fine example as well. I am not 
talking about the people at the clerk's table. In order to make sure 
there is no confusion, the voters' list must indicate the voter's 
gender. Similarly, and once again to avoid confusion, dates of birth 
must be indicated. That is obvious.
<P>
	Up to now, my colleagues have been indicating the importance 
of including voters' date of birth on the electoral list. Some might 
point out that some first names might give an idea of the age of the 
voter.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I keep coming back to my name, Stéphane, a relatively new 
choice in first names for French Canadians and Quebecers. 
Adalbert would be an older sounding name, I might say, or a more 
venerable one. That said, you have to understand that, for there not 
to be any doubt, the date of birth should be given.
<P>
	I still have four minutes left? I had already started my 
conclusion, so I will have to reorganize my thoughts so I can 
continue.
<P>
	As I was saying before, while Stephen might have a more 
modern ring to it and Adalbert or Canute a more ancient one, it is 
obvious that just with the first  name-although earlier on I heard 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6622"> 6622 </A></B>
<P>
my Reform colleague suggesting that we get rid of the first name 
altogether. What kind of information are we going to be left with on 
the voters' list if we reduce it to such a minimum?
<P>
	God knows that not one member in this House would dare say or 
do such a thing, but there is no doubt that eventually, if the voters' 
list was watered down to this extent, certain evil doers could take 
this opportunity to corrupt democracy.
<P>
	If that was the case, Canadians and Quebecers as a whole would 
come out the losers. Therefore I strongly urge all my colleagues in 
this House, who support democracy and the need for transparency 
in a democracy, to vote for the amendments moved by my 
colleague from Bellechasse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
address this House on a nice Friday afternoon, after the hon. 
member for Verchères. I was going to mention his name, but this is 
not allowed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> You can only mention my first name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Your first name? Ah, yes.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues have mentioned, but I will say it 
again for the benefit of those who may have just joined us, the bill 
before us, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the 
Referendum Act, is now at report stage.
<P>
	People at home may wonder why a bunch of MPs are talking 
about gender and date of birth today. It is because we are discussing 
a bill to amend the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	My colleagues are making comments that may lead to various 
interpretations. I will try to remain calm and to tell you what I set 
out to say.
<P>
	The reason why the date of birth should be included, as was 
explained by the hon. member for Bellechasse who tabled the 
motion, is that this information is already on Quebec's electoral 
lists. Why? It is to provide those in charge of an election with a tool 
to correctly identify people. As a number of my colleagues 
mentioned this morning, there may be several people with the same 
name, but they are rarely born on the same day.
<P>
	It is a tool we feel is of great importance. Some people will say: 
``You are going to use this information so that you can categorize 
voters''. Political parties have other tools they can use for this 
purpose, and the first thing that comes to mind is that when you 
want to know people, you must first live in their region and see 
them every day, which I do each week when I go back to my riding. 
That is the first tool a member has to work with.
<P>
	I am therefore not in the slightest worried that they want to 
mention date of birth in the new bill. Quebec already has this tool, 
and I think it could also be important for the rest of Canada to 
include it in the  Canada Elections Act. Everyone would then be on 
an equal footing.
<P>
	As for the other addition, I think that gender is already 
mentioned in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I do not have a copy of the Quebec statute in front of me, but I 
believe that it is included. With respect to the objection by the 
member of the Reform Party, although we could debate it a bit 
longer, I see no problem with mentioning gender as well, for the 
very same reason as that given by the member for Verchères, which 
is that an ``e'' can be misleading. Although one look at him and 
there is no doubt at all that you are dealing with a Man, with a 
capital ``M''.
<P>
	I do, however, insist that gender be indicated. I would remind all 
of the hon. members and all of the electorate that 52 per cent of 
voters are female. When women are, for once, in the majority and 
can signal their presence, I think the voters' list is how they should 
do it.
<P>
	There has long been criticism that women are not represented 
adequately in this House. This would be a good reason to retain in 
the Elections Act the requirement that gender must be indicated, 
precisely to force us as legislators to realize that more than 50 per 
cent of the electorate are women. These, then, are two tools which 
we see as indispensable.
<P>
	I would also add, in connection with this group of motions, as 
my colleague from Matapédia-Matane has also said, that we have 
experienced considerable changes with respect to the redrawing of 
electoral boundaries. I wish to mention this, so that people clearly 
understand that this is not what we are talking about here this 
morning, for it could be misinterpreted. We are talking about the 
act to amend the Canada Elections Act, which is not the same thing 
as what was done by the Electoral Boundaries Commission.
<P>
	My colleague from Matapédia-Matane has described the 
upheaval in his riding. I, who represent the riding of Gaspé, will 
have to face the hon. member for the present riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine in the next election.
<P>
	In passing, I and my colleague from Bellechasse would like to 
thank the people who are here in the House today, particularly the 
Government Whip, for their support. Last week we adopted a bill at 
all stages to change the names of electoral districts. This is another 
achievement and I wanted to congratulate these two people. I 
would like to thank them and also point out to all members present 
in this House that the reeves of the RCMs in the Gaspé are very 
pleased that hon. members agreed to include all RCMs in the new 
designation of the new Gaspé riding which will be called 
Bonaventure-Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine-Paboc.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6623"> 6623 </A></B>
<P>
	All four RCMs are very pleased, they thank you and they want 
to say that this will give them a sense of belonging, because all 
four will be identified with the new riding. They will be working 
together. As a geographical entity, it is still rather scattered, but 
they are prepared to do what they can, and we will see what will 
happen in the future.
<P>
	I may add, and I say this personally, as long as the riding of 
Bonaventure-Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine-Paboc will remain 
part of Canadian history, since I hope that some day, we will have 
another referendum on the sovereignty issue, that we will have an 
opportunity to deal with the situation at that time.
<P>
	That being said, I will get back to the group of motions now 
before the House. We said that the Bloc Quebecois wanted to 
ensure that age would be mentioned. We also wanted the gender of 
the voter to be indicated, as it is now. This will be useful as a 
reference for members and make it easier for the returning officer 
in a given region to identify people.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Where I live, there are people with the same first name and the 
same last name as mine. My father had the same experience. By the 
way, you will recall that formerly in Quebec, although that is no 
longer the case, after they were married, women were known by the 
name of their husband. To my mother's astonishment, when she 
went to the doctor for a minor problem, she heard the receptionist 
say she was pregnant. However, this was another Mrs. Laurent 
Bernier. So you see the kind of confusion that can arise, even if this 
situation was funnier than most.
<P>
	We must have the assurance that no one can use someone else's 
name and especially that the individual who wants to vote will be 
able to do so. The Bloc wants to make sure that the government 
understands these situations. There is no warfare intended here. We 
hope we can reach an agreement soon.
<P>
	However, as many of my colleagues have indicated, the fact that 
we are at report stage indicates that we went a little too fast earlier 
on. Had debate been allowed, and the content of the bill shared with 
the opposition parties, these details could have been resolved 
earlier.
<P>
	My colleague from Bellechasse mentioned this as well at the 
start of his speech; we are at the dawn of an election campaign. So 
the emotional reaction of the government is understandable, since 
it is in a hurry to change the Canada Elections Act. We would have 
expected that changes to the Canada Elections Act would be made 
at the start of the 35th Parliament, that is, when all the members of 
Parliament arrived. At that point, we would have had five years to 
debate this matter. We should have assumed that the government 
wants to do it faster for election or partisan reasons.
<P>
	We have a fait accompli before us. The bill is now at third 
reading. To be sure there is no partisanship and no question of 
pushing things along too fast and to ensure everyone understands, 
we expect the government to let us have our full say.
<P>
	Several members speak to a group of motions to be sure that the 
government gets our message, takes note and incorporates the 
points we make so that everyone's opinion is reflected in the bill. It 
will then be used in the election of all members. All voters, 
whatever their allegiance, must feel comfortable. That is what 
democracy is about. You have to believe in the tools we acquire in 
order to be able to move things along.
<P>
	I conclude on this point. I will return later, when we discuss 
other groups of motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, fist 
of all let me say how much I appreciated the opportunity to renew 
my experience with committee work, particularly with the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. It brought 
back some pleasant memories, even if at the time I sat on the other 
side of the House. Frankly, I must say that the experience is more 
enjoyable from this side.
<P>
	Having said that, I want to join with those who congratulated our 
colleagues from both sides of the House for their enthusiasm and 
hard work on this bill.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	They include my colleague, the hon. member for Fundy-Royal, 
who chaired the committee, the hon. member for Bellechasse, who 
really gave it all he had and worked extremely hard, the hon. 
member for Laval Centre, the chief opposition whip-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-the member for Calgary West and the member for Lethbridge, 
from the Reform Party, and of course the whip of the Reform Party, 
the member for Fraser Valley East, and a good number of my 
colleagues, including the deputy government whip, the member for 
Ottawa West and many others, who, long before I arrived, had 
already put in a long number of hours hearing testimony from very 
impressive witnesses, including the commissioner of privacy-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-Mr. Kingsley, the Chief Electoral Officer, to name a few.
<P>
	I also want to say briefly that I am left with the strong feeling 
that discussions and consultations have been all encompassing. If 
we recall the Lortie commission and all its elements, we know that 
there is already broad support in Canada for the general principles 
contained in the bill, including reducing the length of the election 
campaign from 47 to 36 days. This proposal has been very well 
received by voters throughout Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6624"> 6624 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe there is also a consensus among the parties and, more 
important, among the electorate that a permanent register is long 
overdue and will be a welcome addition to the electoral process in 
Canada.
<P>
	In a later motion we will deal with another matter of great 
significance to the regions, particularly to western Canada, which 
is the matter of staggered hours.
<P>
	I would like to take a few comments to the two principal issues 
within this group of motions, the first being the matter of gender. 
Both the issues of gender and date of birth, which I will deal with 
later, could be useful. There is no denying that administratively that 
information could be useful. However, I am satisfied from the 
testimony of Mr. Kingsley of Elections Canada and others, as well 
as the privacy commissioner, Mr. Phillips, that it is not necessary. It 
is not essential.
<P>
	Our electoral system is based on honesty and the freedom to 
vote. We encourage all Canadians to exercise their responsibility to 
vote. Too many Canadians do not participate in the electoral 
process.
<P>
	Having said that, because of the strong testimony of the privacy 
commissioner, I do not believe that it is necessary. He further stated 
that he did not see the voluntary collection of privacy information 
as a significant privacy issue and, therefore, he did not recommend 
the removal of gender from the list of electors.
<P>
	In summary, while a clarification of gender is desirable 
information to differentiate voters with the same names, it is not 
necessary, and for that reason it is not included in Bill C-63.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With regard to the date of birth, I realize that the hon. member 
for Laval Centre, the chief opposition whip, is a very young and 
dedicated lady who is not hiding her age, but we must do what is in 
the best interest of Canadians. Even if it could be useful 
administratively, it is not essential.
<P>
	Again, according to the testimony given by the privacy 
commissioner, I submit that the reason why it is not in the bill is 
simply because it is not essential and that our electoral process is a 
voluntary one. True to these broad principles and to the privacy 
commissioner's advice, we thought appropriate to include neither 
the gender nor the date of birth.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, since I do not wish to be recognized 
for the purpose of the debate, I am raising a point of order of a very 
general nature by saying that the Bloc's motion in this third group 
is motion No. 22, dealing exclusively with opening hours of polls, 
and more specifically with the period of time employers must give 
their employees to vote.
<P>
	If this is agreeable to you, Mr. Speaker, I will discuss this issue at 
the end, once the chief government whip will have tabled his 
amendments, and also after the member for Calgary West will have 
explained the nature of his amendments on a much more general 
issue, that is the possibility of having variable hours for polls 
across Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the House agree?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise to discuss the motions in Group No. 3. Group 3 
contains a number of motions and I will try to address all of them in 
my comments. There are three Reform motions, two Liberal 
motions and one presented by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	All these motions deal with the attempt to incorporate provisions 
in this legislation that would stagger voting hours. We discussed 
this issue not when we addressed Bill C-63 in the House previously 
but when we addressed Bill C-307, a private member's bill.
<P>
	That private member's bill was passed by the House in principle, 
although it is more than fair to say, based on the record, that 
Reform Party members indicated our grave reservations about the 
approach advocated in the bill. We only approved it in principle for 
the purpose of further discussing the proposal in committee and 
arriving at a consensus.
<P>
	We did not arrive at a consensus on these issues. The government 
chose to go ahead with a proposal that is substantially different 
from what was passed in Bill C-307. It is substantially different in 
at least two ways. It altered the hours for voting that were proposed 
in Bill C-307, moving them up so that not only are we cutting into 
prime voting hours in British Columbia but in Alberta as well.
<P>
	The other change made was to reverse hours in the case of the far 
eastern part of the country. In Atlantic Canada the polls would 
actually close at earlier local times than they would in central 
Canada. This was not a proposal the committee heard during 
deliberations.
<P>
	These government proposals were not even an option for 
consideration when the Library of Parliament researcher prepared 
his report for our discussion. These proposals literally came out of 
nowhere.
<P>
	Nothing was proposed in these options that would indicate a 
premature closing time in Alberta. Never was it proposed in this 
document that the hours be earlier than 7.30 p.m. in British 
Columbia; nor was it ever proposed that we would actually reverse 
the hours in the case of the far east of the country.
<P>
	We said this set of proposals needed to be studied and on which 
we needed to come to a consensus, but we did not. On top of that, 
we discussed items in our preliminary discussion which sparked 
considerable interest in all the parties represented on the committee 
and in the chief electoral officer. However, they were then entirely 
rejected by the government when it tabled its proposal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6626"> 6626 </A></B>
<P>
	The items include not just the hours but the concept of delaying 
the vote count in some parts of the country as a way of dealing 
with this problem. There was also a proposal to eliminate the 
blackout.
<P>
	We were looking for a proposal that would involve three 
elements as a way of dealing with the time zone differences across 
the country: staggering the voting hours, staggering the vote count 
and a blackout. But when the government presented its proposal the 
last two elements completely disappeared which was a surprise to 
us.
<P>
	More surprising were the comments by some of the government 
members that it was necessary to arrive at a consensus and this was 
how they did it. I think I speak for the Bloc and my party when I say 
that we were left wondering where the consensus was since only 
one of the parties seemed to agree with this proposal. How could 
this decision possibly be classified as a consensus?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> That's Liberal consensus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> My colleague says it is a Liberal 
consensus.
<P>
	The three Reform motions in Group No. 3 deal with the 
proposals we put forward which I will not say were unanimously 
accepted in discussion. That is not the case. They were not rejected 
and seemed to be of interest to all parties in the committee during 
our discussion on this particular issue.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Our proposals were to stagger the hours beginning by moving 
the hours of voting back a half hour in each time zone east of 
British Columbia, delaying the count a further half hour for each 
time zone and eliminating the blackout entirely in the case of 
Atlantic Canada as a way of making up anything over and above 
the three hour difference between British Columbia and Quebec. 
Those are the proposals we have here. They are divided into three 
motions.
<P>
	Motion No. 21 relates to the actual closing hours we propose 
which would be 8 p.m. in British Columbia; 8.30 p.m. in Alberta; 9 
p.m. in Manitoba and Saskatchewan; 9.30 p.m. in Ontario and 
Quebec; and 9.30 p.m. as well in Atlantic Canada. Motion No. 23 
would delay the vote count. That would be an additional half hour 
for each time zone, a delay of a half hour in Alberta, an hour in 
Manitoba, and an hour and a half in central Canada. Motion No. 25 
proposes to limit the blackout.
<P>
	Our preference would have been with staggered voting hours to 
completely eliminate the blackout for Atlantic Canada because 
frankly we could not see that this really would be an issue to 
anybody in the west or even in central Canada. The fact that there 
might be some preliminary results available from Newfoundland 
and the maritimes did not seem to be an issue. Therefore we were 
going to propose eliminating it entirely.
<P>
	The only reason our amendment does not do that is that we were 
concerned with the limits we had in our technical drafting, that we 
were not able to capture some of the effects on advanced polls and 
special ballots. We were concerned that some of those results might 
circulate even before the counting had begun in some parts of the 
country. That is why we only limited the blackout as opposed to 
eliminating it but the concept is still the same.
<P>
	I will be speaking at much greater length on this when we reach 
full debate, but I urge the government to reconsider this. The whole 
rationale that many in the government have given for this is that 
somehow it would deal with grievances in western Canada, to deal 
with the fact that westerners presumably know the results or that 
governments are elected before the polls have even closed in the 
west. That was stated to be one of the concerns here.
<P>
	The effect of what the government is proposing is to do that by 
limiting the ability of western Canadians to vote. Closing the polls 
in British Columbia at 7 p.m. has a major impact upon prime voting 
hours in that province. This is terribly problematic and it is not 
necessary. I am very suspicious about the proposal to close the 
polls early in Alberta. This is not necessary in any form to deal with 
this problem. I am very surprised that the government threw that in. 
It was another anomaly in its solution.
<P>
	The final anomaly I will mention is that this provision is actually 
allowing the count to begin in Ontario a half hour earlier than when 
the polls close in B.C. While technically feasible, this was in fact 
rejected by the member from Vancouver East who proposed the bill 
in the first place.
<P>
	There are all kinds of anomalies in this solution, things that did 
not reflect the committee discussions.
<P>
	The Liberals are trying to make amends by their Motions Nos. 5 
and 20, both of which we will oppose. Motions Nos. 5 and 20 
essentially propose to extend voting hours across the country from 
11 hours to 12 hours. I would presume that is one way of giving 
people more time and more ability to vote.
<P>
	Allowing British Columbians to vote at 7 a.m. before they have 
had breakfast or presumably on their way to work is not 
compensation for not being able to vote at a convenient time of the 
day. In fact it is more costly to keep the polls open longer. Elections 
Canada testified to that effect. I do not think adding the extra hour 
buys us anything or deals with the fundamental problems created 
by the government's proposal on this. We will be voting against 
those two motions because we do not feel they fix the problem and 
it is costly.
<P>
	I have just a very brief comment on Motion No. 22 proposed by 
the Bloc Quebecois. I must admit that we have had some discussion 
and some uncertainty as to how we should deal with this. The Bloc 
has proposed to reverse a proposal in the bill that requires 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6627"> 6627 </A></B>
<P>
employers to  give only three hours to vote instead of four hours. 
The motion would put it back to four hours.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	We will be opposing this motion. We are torn because we think it 
should be three hours. Four hours is too long and too much of an 
imposition on employers. I would point out that with the hours as 
they are in British Columbia, having only three hours is going to 
cause a fairly serious problem in terms of logistics for people 
trying to vote and also getting time off work from their employer, 
particularly if they travel some distance from work to home, which 
is often the case in Vancouver and some parts of rural B.C.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Calgary West for his intervention. I am 
sure there will be a great deal more intervention from both sides of 
the House when we get to third reading.
<P>
	As I said in my brief remarks in committee while in camera, this 
is a partial solution. Considering the number of time zones we have 
across this great land of ours from east to west, I believe it is the 
best accommodation that can be made to reflect the sensitivities 
members had particularly to those Canadians living in Alberta and 
British Columbia.
<P>
	Obviously we all realize that when it is 7 p.m. in British 
Columbia it is 10 p.m. in Quebec and Ontario. It would be quite a 
test to draft something that would be perfect for all the regions of 
Canada. At the same time I believe that is the art of the impossible.
<P>
	I submit that this proposal is equitable and fair to the electorate 
throughout the country. Yes, the amendment would provide for 12 
consecutive voting hours in all time zones across the country by 
adding one hour of voting time in the morning. Bill C-63 provides 
for staggered voting hours across the country to respond largely to 
concerns of voters in the west, particularly in British Columbia and 
Alberta, that their votes do not carry the same weight as those of 
other Canadians. Each and every vote of each and every Canadian 
counts equally.
<P>
	The bill as reported by the committee proposed that the polls be 
open for 11 consecutive hours as is currently the case in each time 
zone but that the hours for voting be staggered as follows: The polls 
in Newfoundland and Atlantic zones would be open from 9 a.m. to 
8.30 p.m. The polls in the eastern time region would be open from 
10 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. The polls in the central zone would be open 
from 9.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. Polls in the mountain zone would be 
open from 8.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. Finally, the polls in the Pacific 
zone would be open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
<P>
	The bill proposes a reduction by one hour, from four to three 
hours, in the number of consecutive hours that every employer 
must provide to employees in order to vote. This was proposed to 
address the concerns of  employers in western Canada. A 7 p.m. 
closing time in the Pacific zone would mean that employers would 
need to let their employees leave work at 3 p.m. under the current 
four hour rule. The bill's proposed reduction to three consecutive 
hours means that employers would allow their employees to leave 
work at 4 p.m. which is the current situation. Recall that currently 
the polls close in B.C. at 8 p.m.; with the four hour consecutive rule 
employees may currently leave work at 4 p.m.
<P>
	Under these staggered voting hours, results from the eastern, 
central and mountain time zones would be available at the same 
time. Results from the Pacific zone would be available one-half 
hour later.
<P>
	The proposed amendment now before us would modify the 
staggered voting hour proposal of Bill C-63 by adding one 
additional hour of voting in the morning in all time zones across the 
country. This means that the polls in the Newfoundland Atlantic 
zone would be open from 8.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. The polls in the 
eastern time zone would be open from 9.30 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. The 
polls in the central time zone would be open from 8.30 a.m. to8.30 p.m. The polls in the mountain time zone would be open from 
7.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. The polls in the Pacific zone would be open 
from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Allowing the polls to remain open for 12 consecutive hours 
would help to compensate voters in the Pacific time zone who are 
losing one hour in voting time in the evening. With this proposed 
new amendment, the polls in this time zone would open at 7 a.m. 
allowing most workers one extra hour to vote in the morning before 
starting work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
most interesting things, which I am sure the government or 
anybody else would find in trying to create legislation that is going 
to work to solve a problem is to first discuss whether there is a 
problem of perception or a problem of a reality.
<P>
	I happen to be a bit of a hybrid in that I come from British 
Columbia but I happen to be in the Alberta time zone so I speak 
with some authority to this issue. In fact, if we look at the reality, 
the reality is that with Internet, telephone communications and 
satellite services, those in western Canada who choose to avail 
themselves of information relative to voting patterns in Ontario, 
Atlantic Canada or Quebec can do so.
<P>
	I may be admitting to some kind of a crime here, but in 1993, one 
hour after the polls closed in Ontario I made a telephone call from 
British Columbia to Ontario to find out what was going on. That 
does happen and it is a reality. However, the question has to be: 
How many people in western Canada actually do that?
<P>
	There are only a selected number of us who choose to become 
candidates and a few more who choose to actually support the 
political parties. For the most part,  there is no problem. As a 
matter of fact, according to the reports that I read in the news media 
on the most recent U.S. presidential election, the amount of 
information that was accessed on the Internet by people in the 
western U.S. about what was going on in the eastern U.S. was 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6628"> 6628 </A></B>
<P>
minuscule. In other words, in actual fact this has no real basis of 
reality.
<P>
	There is a problem of perception. The problem is that people will 
turn on their televisions in the Pacific time zone and the votes will 
have been in the process of having been counted for four and a half 
hours in Newfoundland and three hours in central Canada. The 
perception is that the election is over.
<P>
	However, I agree with the Liberal whip that every Canadian's 
vote counts and is equal. I suggest to this House that in actual fact it 
does not make a bit of difference. There may be a perception in 
British Columbia on the part of some people, and a little 
disappointment, particularly as it happened in the 1993 election. 
We were expecting that Reform was going to break through in 
Ontario, as we will in this coming election, but we were expecting 
that in the 1993 election. Naturally there was a lot of 
disappointment for the people in western Canada that the people of 
Ontario had not quite woken up to the fact of what Reform was 
about. The fact is that it did not make a bit of difference.
<P>
	What I do not understand is legislation that deals with perception 
only and in dealing with perception completely upsets the apple 
cart. Everyone in this House will be fully aware of the fact that 
between five o'clock and eight o'clock on election day, if they have 
anything approximating a team working for them, their people will 
have the information of whether their supporters have been out and 
have supported them. That not being the case is when the 
telephoning happens. It is part of the election process.
<P>
	What we have done in British Columbia is to take one full hour 
out of the normal election process. Does this mean that the people 
of British Columbia will not get out and vote? I would suggest it 
could. It certainly will change the difference between the way in 
which the election is conducted by the respective parties and their 
organizations and the supporters of the candidates in Ontario, 
Quebec and the Atlantic provinces to the way in which it is 
conducted in Alberta and British Columbia. They will be missing 
the hour between seven o'clock and eight o'clock when they could 
be getting their voters out.
<P>
	I submit to the House that this legislation deals only with 
perception and is problematic. It creates problems. Instead of 
dealing with the real problem, it creates a real problem.

that an agreement could not be reached under the provisions of 
Standing Orders 78(1) or 78(2) with respect to the report stage and

allot a specific number of days or hours for the consideration and 
disposal of proceedings at the said stages.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ANACTTOREVOKETHECONVICTIONOFLOUISDAVIDRIEL">AN ACT TO REVOKE THE CONVICTION OF LOUIS 
DAVID RIEL</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 21 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-297, an act to revoke the conviction of Louis 
David Riel, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak today on Bill C-297, an act to revoke the 
conviction of Louis David Riel.
<P>
	Louis Riel worked tirelessly for Metis people, as well as other 
residents of the territory, so that they could take their rightful place 
in Canadian society and exercise their rights and freedoms within 
the Dominion of Canada.
<P>
	An historical perspective is always useful to have when 
examining a matter such as we have before us today in the House.
<P>
	The Metis people of Rupert's Land and the North-West Territory 
took steps, through democratic structures and procedures, to 
maintain order and to protect the interests of all the members of the 
community at the Red River.
<P>
	In 1870, under the leadership of Louis Riel, the Metis of the Red 
River adopted a list of rights. Based on the list of rights, Louis Riel 
negotiated the terms for admission  of Rupert's Land and the 
North-West Territory into the Dominion of Canada. A delegation of 
three was sent by the provisional government to Ottawa to present 
the terms to the Canadian government. This action put an abrupt 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6629"> 6629 </A></B>
<P>
end to some publicly expressed desires, south of our border, to have 
American settlers expand northward into Rupert's Land.
<P>
	These terms of admission, or union, form part of the Manitoba 
Act. This act provided for certain guarantees for Metis people, who 
were then in the majority, including schooling and religious rights, 
as well as recognition of the French and English languages.
<P>
	The rights of other citizens were also clearly set out. This was 
Riel's vision of a united country, with each citizen participating on 
an equal basis.
<P>
	After negotiating the entry of Manitoba into Confederation, 
Louis Riel was elected three times by acclamation to the House of 
Commons. All hon. members know that acclamation is a rare event 
in the political process, an action accorded only to those who 
command the greatest respect from all quarters. Such was the 
stature of Louis Riel in Manitoba at that time.
<P>
	From the late 1870s to the mid-1880s the territory west of 
Manitoba was undergoing significant change. Indians were not the 
only occupants of this region. Both English speaking and French 
speaking Metis and settlers of many nationalities had moved west 
of Manitoba. These people banded together to advance their 
requests to government for the maintenance of their rights.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The Metis asked Louis Riel to assist in negotiating with the 
government. This took place at a time when Metis people and 
others felt the government had not responded to the plight of the 
people in the North-West Territory. This had led to extreme 
tensions.
<P>
	The Metis people of the territory led by Louis Riel, decided to 
take action to secure their interests. Several military expeditions 
were dispatched to the west. Sadly, this led to a conflict in which 
lives were lost. Louis Riel paid with his life for his leadership in a 
movement which sought protection for the aspirations and interests 
of Metis people. This loss was devastating to Riel's family and has 
been a heavy burden for all Metis people.
<P>
	The Metis people have since honoured Louis Riel's memory and 
have continued his purposes. The Constitution Act of 1992 
recognizes and affirms existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the 
Metis. Governments have honoured Louis Riel in numerous ways. 
Commemorative stamps have been issued to honour Louis Riel.
<P>
	The government, through the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council of Canada, funded the publication of the 
collective writings of Louis Riel. This was published by the 
University of Alberta Press in 1985  to commemorate the 
anniversary of the North-West rebellion. Copies of this scholarly 
work have been deposited in all major Canadian libraries.
<P>
	On March 10, 1992, the House of Commons passed a special 
resolution honouring Louis Riel as a founder of Manitoba and 
recognizing his contribution to the development of western 
Canada.
<P>
	The government takes very seriously its obligation to honour one 
of its sons for his many contributions. On May 16, 1996 a new 
statue of Louis Riel was unveiled in Winnipeg. The Metis people 
see this depiction of Riel as a statesman as a proper and fitting 
tribute. Funded by the government, the statue is situated on the 
grounds of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.
<P>
	Riel's statue overlooks the Assiniboia River just west of its 
confluence with the Red River, two of the major transportation 
routes of the settlement in that era of our country's history.
<P>
	At the unveiling the Minister of Foreign Affairs and member for 
Winnipeg South Centre told the gathering that Riel was a father of 
Confederation for all Canadians. Lieutenant-Governor Yvon 
Dumont, a Metis, said the unveiling of the statue establishes Riel's 
status as Manitoba's founder. Mr. Dumont said: ``He is a hero to all 
Canadians. Today we hold our heads higher''.
<P>
	The government will continue to work closely with Metis 
leaders and the family of Louis Riel to find meaningful and 
appropriate ways to celebrate Riel's contributions to 
Confederation. The government will continue the dialogue begun 
with the Metis leadership in order to arrive at a satisfactory 
solution concerning his conviction. We will also continue our 
discussions with the leadership on this and other matters through 
the existing bilateral process with the Metis National Council.
<P>
	I cannot accept the premise on which this bill was put forward. 
When Bill C-297 was tabled, the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata asserted that Riel was hanged ``because 
he was Metis, because he was francophone and because he stood up 
for a distinct society''. Statements such as these do no justice to 
Louis Riel. They are incompatible with his purposes.
<P>
	Riel was an eloquent, articulate defender of Metis rights as well 
as those of all members of the community, whether aboriginal or 
non-aboriginal, anglophone or francophone. Louis Riel believed in 
Metis having equal rights and participation within Confederation. 
Metis formed a substantial part of the population then and he 
championed the rights of minority groups.
<P>
	Louis Riel would likely be saddened today by the divisive 
approach being taken by the Bloc in this debate.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of the resolution adopted in 
1992 by the House, which recognized the unique and historic role 
of Louis Riel as the founder of Manitoba and his contribution to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6630"> 6630 </A></B>
<P>
development of  Confederation. It further agreed to support the true 
attainment both in principle and practice of the constitutional rights 
of the Metis people.
<P>
	Whatever we do to find a way to address this important matter, 
we should do so in a manner which is acceptable to the family of 
Louis Riel and to Metis.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker. You will no doubt appreciate that I readily 
support the bill introduced by my hon. colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata. For the benefit of those just joining us, I 
would like to make it quite clear that, as the official opposition in 
this House, we sincerely believe that we are putting before 
Parliament a bill to redress an injustice.
<P>
	We must not overlook the fact that there was a time in 
Parliament's history when, within these walls, shame, intolerance 
and injustice prevailed. Our purpose in recalling such injustice is 
certainly not to revive old fratricidal conflicts. We will recall that 
Louis Riel was democratically elected three times by the people of 
Provencher and given the mandate to do what we as Canadian 
parliamentarians are doing today, namely representing our 
communities.
<P>
	There is a paradox in accusing of high treason a man who, on 
many occasions in this House, was recognized as an upstanding 
founder of Manitoba. Louis Riel was recognized as a leader in his 
own right in the defence of human rights. He advocated principles 
that still reverberate in Parliament.
<P>
	There is a paradox in, on the one hand, recognizing that Riel was 
one of the founders of Manitoba, that he fought for his peers, for 
the recognition of the right to self-government and 
self-determination of his community, the Métis community, and on 
the other hand, regarding him as a traitor. This paradox could 
become a source of unbearable shame if ever we, as 
parliamentarians, were so ill-advised as to not support the bill put 
forward by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	What is this bill all about? It calls for the revocation of Louis 
Riel's conviction. We are not trying to rewrite history here. Later in 
the debate, as we have all along, we will review the very specific 
milestones of Louis Riel's public life.
<P>
	I think it would be unfair and irresponsible not to recognize that 
the decision to sentence Louis Riel to death for high treason was 
historically unfounded. Without rewriting history, but having 
lucidly considered the facts, we certainly have a duty and 
responsibility to redress the injustice that unfairly cost Louis Riel 
his life.
<P>
	What are the tools at our disposal to effect redress? This is what 
the hon. member for  Rimouski-Témiscouata, who has a sense of 
history, is proposing. She is asking this Parliament-let me quote 
the bill directly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas Louis David Riel, member of the House of Commons for the electoral 
district of Provencher from 1873 to 1874, was convicted on August 1, 1885 of high 
treason and sentenced to death, and was hanged on November 16, 1885 at Regina, 
North West Territories;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas, notwithstanding his conviction, Louis David Riel has become a symbol 
and a hero to successive generations of Canadians who have, through their 
governments, honoured and commemorated him in specific projects and actions;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is being asked-and this is the thrust of the bill, this is where 
we will see if, in the House, we are able to act upon words-out of 
respect for history, since:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and whereas it is consistent with this recognition that the conviction of Louis 
David Riel be now revoked-</BLOCKQUOTE>
that this conviction now be revoked.
<P>
	You will tell me that history cannot be rewritten, and this is a 
very great truth.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	I repeat that, if history cannot be rewritten, we still have the 
responsibility, as parliamentarians, to set the record straight, 
considering that it was in this very place that Louis David Riel, 
whose election was sanctioned by a democratic process, as is the 
case for all of us here, was not allowed to fulfill his mandate.
<P>
	But worse than that, what happened? There was a practice Louis 
Riel, first in 1869-70, as the head of his community located close to 
the Red River, witnessed, without being consulted, powerless but 
not impassive, whereby British settlers, people who were not part 
of his community, occupied the land. Louis Riel was forced to 
stand by, fully aware and committed, while an act of dispoilment 
was being committed. I am deliberately using the word 
``despoilment'', because as you probably remember, the central 
government of the day, with the support of the British authorities, 
sent surveyors to readjust the maps so as to redistribute the lands to 
people other than the Metis.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, prompted by their strong desire for 
democracy, Louis Riel and his peers formed a temporary 
government which had to quell a rebellion, a government which, 
having to deal with the rebellion stirred up by British settlers in 
Fort Garry, decided to execute Thomas Scott.
<P>
	Because a community was being despoiled, a man had to die, as 
was the custom at the time. The Metis were despoiled.
<P>
	What happened then? Instead of opening up the discussions, of 
trying to understand the claims which the Metis had often ex-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6631"> 6631 </A></B>
<P>
plained to Parliament, violence was  used, because the government 
felt it could quell the rebellion with the help of its armed forces.
<P>
	The fundamental problem was that of a community which was 
being despoiled on an individual basis, because the very existence 
of the Metis community was being ignored.
<P>
	Time has gone by and Louis Riel has remained the very 
significant figure he has always been for the Metis. Ontario and its 
most aggressive Anglo Protestants demanded Louis Riel's head 
and they got it.
<P>
	In a second uprising, this time in the far west, at the end of the 
railway line, there was a second attempt at removing a community 
and despoiling the Metis again in what was to become 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Again in 1865, Louis Riel was part of the struggle and stood up 
for his people. At that time, we-I say ``we'', but there is nothing 
personal to it-the Parliament of Canada was party to a verdict of 
execution against Louis Riel. What is becoming increasingly clear 
from the writings of historians of the day, and very few of us could 
deny these facts, is that Louis Riel was the victim of injustice and 
that the ideal conditions, the conditions of elementary justice, were 
not all there for his trial.
<P>
	I could remind you that Louis Riel was tried in Regina although 
he should have been in Winnipeg. He was judged in Regina by six 
English- speaking jurors, but if his trial had been held in Winnipeg, 
as his peers were requesting at the time, the jury would have been 
made up of an equal number of English- and French-speaking 
jurors.
<P>
	Also, Louis Riel was tried by a judge liable to dismissal.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	He was not tried by a Superior Court judge, who could have 
acted independently from the federal government because he was 
not liable to dismissal.
<P>
	Moreover, Louis Riel and his family were not allowed the 
benefit of the expertise of his attending physician. The government 
preferred the testimony of a Hamilton doctor, who examined Riel 
for half an hour, before coming up with the subservient and false 
medical opinion we are all aware of.
<P>
	Still on the sad saga of Riel, the jury that condemned him 
recommended clemency, but the judge nevertheless sentenced him 
to death. Louis Riel's story is a story of injustice. It is the story of a 
subservient Parliament and, thus, of a community covered in 
shame.
<P>
	You know all the publicity Riel's case had in Quebec. It is 
certainly not by accident that, after the hanging of Louis Riel, in 
November 1885, the Premier of Quebec, Honoré Mercier, the fist 
premier, as you will remember, who asked for an interprovincial 
conference, the first nationalist premier, said spontaneously in 
front of a huge crowd of 50,000 people: ``Louis Riel, our brother, 
died unjustly''.
<P>
	And in the opinion of several historians, Louis Riel's death was 
the first step in what was to become a major national unity crisis.
<P>
	Allow me, in concluding, to quote a distant cousin of Louis Riel 
and former member of the other House, who said this: ``We have to 
admit that this sentence alienated the Province of Quebec. This was 
a major crisis, maybe as serious as the one we living through today. 
It is hardly surprising that, each year between 1885 and 1900, some 
100,000 French Canadians left Quebec to emigrate to the United 
States. They did not go to western Canada. There is no need to look 
for the causes underlying this phenomenon. People in Quebec felt 
they were not welcome in that part of the country, as was evidenced 
by events of the day, such as the death of Riel and the fact that the 
use of French was abolished in Manitoba in 1890''. These are 
historical facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise in this House today to speak to Bill C-297, an act to revoke the 
conviction of Louis David Riel, the main purpose of which is to 
revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel for high treason. More 
specifically, it is a revocation of the guilty verdict and not simply a 
posthumous pardon.
<P>
	Everybody in this House knows that Canadian history, especially 
the development of the western part of the country and the relations 
in the first years of existence of our country, cannot be understood 
without a good understanding of the events surrounding the work 
of Louis Riel and the Métis people in Manitoba and in western 
Canada in general.
<P>
	This subject is studied in all history courses in our country, even 
in high school. Louis Riel's place in Canadian history is truly 
essential.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Louis Riel played a key role in Canadian history in the 19th 
century. Indeed, he was an important contributor to Confederation. 
Riel was educated in theology and the law. He was fluent in 
English, French, Greek and Latin. He was an eloquent and polished 
statesman who directed the negotiations with the Government of 
Canada on the entry of Manitoba and the Northwest Territories into 
the Dominion of Canada.
<P>
	Louis Riel was a man who worked tirelessly for the Métis people 
and indeed others who settled in the areas of what have now 
become the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Under the leadership of Louis Riel the Métis of the Red River 
adopted a list of rights in 1870.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6632"> 6632 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That list of rights served as a base for negotiations between 
Louis Riel and the Canadian government for the entry of Rupert's 
Land and the Northwest Territories in the Dominion of Canada.
<P>
	That list essentially constituted the terms of the union and was 
included in the Manitoba Act, 1870.
<P>
	After that province joined Confederation, voters in the riding of 
Provencher, Manitoba, elected Louis Riel as their member of the 
House of Commons three times by acclamation. However, the 
circumstances did not allow Riel to occupy his seat.
<P>
	Not only did Riel help Manitoba become the fifth province to 
join the Dominion of Canada, he also helped people in western 
Manitoba to present their claims to the government.
<P>
	When the Métis people asked Riel to help them defend their civil 
rights in the Northwest Territories, in an area that is now part of the 
province of Saskatchewan, he answered their call.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We now recognize that the government of the day was slow in 
responding to the requests of the residents of the region, even if 
these requests were reasonable requests. What were these requests? 
Let me review the principal requests for the record.
<P>
	The residents wanted appropriate surveys of their settlements 
made. They asked for improved transportation so they could move 
products and materials to and from the markets. They wanted other 
usual services, those services normally provided by governments to 
its citizens and nothing more.
<P>
	The Métis, both the English speaking and French speaking 
Métis, along with settlers of many nationalities sent numerous 
petitions and delegations to Ottawa to ask the government to carry 
out its responsibilities. After what these residents viewed as many 
years of neglect and without recourse against the encroachment of 
others, they asked Riel to help them. The combination of frustrated 
citizens and the appearance of a military expedition led to an 
unfortunate turn of events and the loss of life.
<P>
	These unfortunate events must not make us forget that Louis Riel 
devoted his life to the interests of the Métis people. He understood 
their concerns. He had a vision of the proper place of Métis people 
and other westerners within Confederation.
<P>
	The government intends to seek to recognize his positive 
achievements. Over the years governments have recognized Louis 
Riel's contribution to this country in a number of ways.
<P>
	Hon. members may remember that the government has issued 
postage stamps commemorating Riel. To  honour Riel's memory 
cultural performances have been funded over the years, including 
the very successful Batoche days, an event that has taken place for 
the past 25 years. On March 10, 1992 the House of Commons 
recognized by special resolution the unique and historic role of 
Louis Riel as founder of Manitoba and as a significant contributor 
to the building of Confederation.
<P>
	On May 16, 1996 this government made possible through the 
provision of significant funding the unveiling of a new statue to 
Louis Riel on the grounds of the Legislative Assembly of 
Manitoba. This statue depicts Riel as the statesman he was.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	Many things have already been done and many more positive 
things can be done. We must encourage the government to keep the 
lines of communication open with Metis leaders and the family of 
Louis Riel to ensure they agree with any proposed measures.
<P>
	There is already a process for discussions with the Metis 
leadership. This includes a bilateral process with the Metis 
National Council and the tripartite self-government negotiations 
with the Metis organizations at the provincial level. Discussions 
with the Metis leadership should continue through the existing 
processes.
<P>
	There is a recognition among all Canadians of the proper place 
of Louis Riel in Canadian history. There is a recognition among 
Canadians that if Louis Riel were alive today and the 
circumstances he was involved in were debated in light of today's 
Canadian values, most likely events would have taken a much 
different turn. Let us hope we have learned through the course of 
history how to deal with the circumstances which brought forth 
Louis Riel's expression of concern on behalf of his people.
<P>
	It is always very difficult for us as legislators to attempt to judge 
the past based on today's determination of justice and values. We 
hope that as history progresses we will improve and enlarge the 
scope of understanding through which we pursue matters of justice 
such as those which led to Mr. Riel's execution in 19th century 
Canada.
<P>
	Other examples have been debated in this House where members 
of Parliament with the very best intentions have wanted to rewrite 
history to right the wrongs which legislators today accept were 
wrong. For many reasons these wrongs have not been brought 
forward in those ways. And we hope to learn from the mistakes of 
the past so as not to repeat them.
<P>
	It is interesting that this debate is taking place on the day after 
the release of the report of the royal commission on aboriginal 
peoples. One of the commission's strong messages is that the 
treatment of aboriginal peoples has been fundamentally flawed 
throughout the long history, from the beginning when Europeans 
came and settled in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6633"> 6633 </A></B>
<P>
	The authors of that report are asking Canadians to lay a new 
foundation for the relationship. But we cannot reverse what has 
taken place in 300 years of history. We have to learn from that 
history and if necessary start again. That is my message in this 
debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleagues from the Bloc, I would like to speak to Bill C-297, an 
act to revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel.
<P>
	A few days ago, it was the 111th anniversary of the hanging of 
Louis Riel. That crucial and much debated event of Canadian 
history still haunts this Chamber. It is said that history is ``the 
science that studies things that do not repeat themselves'', but it is 
also said that knowing history is essential to understanding the 
present. Furthermore, the lessons of history help to better 
anticipate the future. Louis Riel's actions have an exceptional 
historical significance in the development of western Canada, not 
only in his struggles on behalf of minority rights and of the 
establishment of real provinces in the West, but also in his 
campaigns for the strengthening of our border with United States.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	History cannot be rewritten. However, we can redress the wrongs 
done to that great man, condemned to death in a mockery of justice. 
We have the duty to defend and rehabilitate Louis Riel's memory. 
His cause was our cause. He wanted all communities to be treated 
fairly and be allowed to develop freely.
<P>
	Who was Louis Riel? Let us go back to history to make a portrait 
of the man. Louis Riel was born in St. Boniface in 1844; his parents 
were Metis. After his studies, he began his career in Sir 
George-Étienne Cartier's law firm in Montreal.
<P>
	Shortly thereafter, he returned to Red River to take up the 
important role of leader of the Métis in their fight against the 
expansionist powers of the government in Ottawa. Louis Riel 
devoted himself not just to the cause of defending the rights of the 
Métis, but also to protecting the rights of all the inhabitants of Red 
River at a time when the traditional equilibrium of the colony was 
threatened by outside factors.
<P>
	Indeed, in 1867, the British North America Act had created the 
new Dominion of Canada, whose leaders were looking to extend 
their rule from one coast to the other.
<P>
	Manitoba and part of the Northwest Territories, which then 
belonged to the Hudson's Bay Company, were run by governors 
appointed by that company. At that time, the government in Ottawa 
was concerned about the expansionist leanings of certain 
Americans and decided to negotiate directly with the Hudson's Bay 
Company to buy Rupert's Land-and this is where the problem  
lies-completely ignoring the concerns of the local population, 
who, at the time, felt like so much cattle for sale.
<P>
	There were then almost 12,000 people in the Red River area; the 
Métis, mostly French speaking and Catholic, and long time settlers, 
mostly English speaking, of English or Scottish descent. Buffalo 
hunters and farmers, these groups that were different in every 
respect, language, religion, and livelihood, had still learned how to 
co-exist. The territorial ambitions of Ottawa, and the attitude of 
certain new colonists from the East would destroy this fragile 
balance.
<P>
	It rapidly became apparent that the strategy of the hardliners 
within the Canadian government was to provoke civil war in the 
western colony and to lay the blame for it on the Metis, so as to 
reduce their influence and destroy their political power. Emerging 
victorious from the battle of 1869, the emissaries of Louis Riel 
negotiated with John Alexander Macdonald and George-Étienne 
Cartier the terms of a settlement, which became the Manitoba Act 
in 1870. This conferred the status of province on the new territory, 
and hence Riel was considered the father of Manitoba.
<P>
	The Metis approved this settlement in June 1870, but Louis Riel 
was under accusation of acts of rebellion and unable to obtain 
amnesty. He was forced to leave the province he had helped to 
establish. Louis Riel did, however, succeed in getting elected to the 
federal Parliament clandestinely in October 1873. Out of fear of 
being arrested and charged, subsequent to the Scott affair, he did 
not report to the House of Commons.
<P>
	Re-elected in the 1874 general election, he was expelled from 
the House that same year on a motion from an Anglo-Protestant 
member. Re-elected for a third time in the byelection required by 
his own expulsion, he was again expelled from the House. Prime 
Minister Mackenzie then obtained the approval of the House to 
grant Riel amnesty, conditional upon a five-year exile.
<P>
	Seven years later, in 1882, the Metis of the North-West, fearing 
loss of their lands to the Canadian Pacific, again rebelled and called 
upon Louis Riel.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	As we know, the rebellion ended in the defeat of Metis troops at 
Batoche in 1885. Riel was taken prisoner and transferred shortly 
afterwards to prison in Regina.
<P>
	But the worst was yet to come. There are many indications that 
the trial of Louis Riel took place in circumstances that were 
unfavourable from every point of view. His trial was to be held in 
Winnipeg, in a bilingual court before an independent judge of the 
Superior Court, and probably half of the jury members would be 
francophones.
<P>
	Prime Minister Macdonald's cabinet ordered the trial to be held 
in Regina, where the court would function in  English only, where 
the territorial magistrate could be removed at the discretion of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6634"> 6634 </A></B>
<P>
federal government and where it was unlikely any of the jury 
members would be French-speaking.
<P>
	A number of historians agree that Macdonald was intent on 
making Riel take the blame for everything and having him 
convicted and executed as soon as possible.
<P>
	The trial of Riel was held during the summer of 1885. He was 
accused of high treason under an English law dating back to 1352, 
according to which the penalty for treason was death. However, we 
know that Louis Riel could have been tried under a Canadian law 
passed in 1868, which provided that the penalty for attacking the 
security of the state was life imprisonment. On August 1, the jury 
declared Riel guilty and recommended clemency. The judge 
sentenced him to death.
<P>
	Another important aspect of this question is that the federal 
cabinet could recommend that the Governor General use his royal 
prerogative to pardon Riel. However, Ontario wanted Riel's head, 
while French Canadians in Quebec and Manitoba demanded that he 
be pardoned.
<P>
	The government, faced with these two waves of protests, 
calculated the number of seats it would lose on either side in the 
next election. The pardon was denied, and Louis Riel was hanged 
on November 16, 1885 in Regina.
<P>
	This is not about rewriting history, as I said earlier. Louis Riel 
was convicted and sentenced to death for treason in 1885. 
However, more and more people, including historians and 
politicians, believe today that the cause Riel defended at the time, 
the rights of the Metis, Native people and the francophones of 
Western Canada, was a just cause.
<P>
	In 1992, this House acknowledged the unique and historic role 
Louis Riel played in founding Manitoba. And yet, in legal terms, 
Riel is still a traitor. This is the paradox that the bill of my 
colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata aims to eliminate.
<P>
	In the past 15 years or so, no fewer than seven bills have been 
tabled by various parties in the House of Commons in order to 
restore Louis Riel to his rightful place.
<P>
	In 1985, on the 100th anniversary of his hanging, the member for 
Hamilton, today the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Deputy 
Prime Minister, sought a posthumous pardon for Riel. Our 
colleague concluded her impassioned statement by saying, and I 
quote: ``Louis Riel, who died unnecessarily, deserves to be 
exonerated by the government and recognized as a victim of 
wrongdoing''.
<P>
	Bill C-297, which calls for the conviction of Louis Riel to be 
overturned, is in the end an act of restoration. It is this House's 
recognition of an injustice to a citizen who  paid with his life, at the 
age of 41, the cost of his devotion to defending human rights.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	He was also a pioneer at that point. Unfair and unjust treatment 
warrants exemplary reparation. This is what the bill before us calls 
for today, and it speaks to all members of this House.
<P>
	Neither statues nor statements in the House will suffice; what is 
required is legislation overturning the conviction. I ask my 
colleagues on both sides of the House to support the member's bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on November 16, 1885, Louis David Riel was hanged.
<P>
	One hundred and eleven years ago today, on November 22, 1885, 
in reaction to this hanging, 40,000 to 50,000 people gathered at the 
Champ de Mars, in Montreal, and heard Premier Honoré Mercier's 
famous cry: ``Riel, our brother, is dead, the victim of his dedication 
to the cause of the Metis''.
<P>
	Quebecers have not forgotten Louis Riel. This is why I rise today 
to support Bill C-297, an act to revoke the conviction of Louis 
David Riel, which was introduced by my colleague, the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	In order to understand why it is important for the Metis people 
and for all the francophones in the country to get Louis Riel's name 
cleared, one must know the history of the development of western 
Canada, which is closely intertwined with the life of Louis Riel.
<P>
	Louis Riel was born in St. Boniface, on October 22, 1844. He 
was the son of Louis Riel, whose mother-Riel's 
grandmother-was a Metis, and of Julie de Lagimonière, the 
daughter of the first white woman born in the North-West.
<P>
	Eldest of 11 children, he was gifted, and thus he was sent to the 
Petit Séminaire de Montréal, where he studied from 1858 to 1865. 
In 1866, he went back to the Red River area and settled in St. 
Boniface in July 1868.
<P>
	Back home, he noticed a strong antipathy between newly arrived 
English Protestant settlers, who wanted to control the colony with 
the help of the central government, and the long time residents, that 
is the Metis and francophones, but also Scots and anglophones born 
in the West.
<P>
	The discontent was aggravated when the government sent some 
survey crews to divide the land, and the surveyors kept the better 
lots for themselves or their friends, declaring arrogantly that the 
legitimate owners would soon have to give up their farms to the 
English settlers coming from the East.
<P>
	Riel embraced the cause of his compatriots, protested against the 
actions of the surveyors and sent demands to the federal 
Parliament. When the Hudson's Bay  Company stopped governing 
the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6635"> 6635 </A></B>
<P>
country, in December 1869, Louis Riel formed a provisional 
government, with English-speaking and French-speaking 
members, which was later approved by the cabinet in Ottawa.
<P>
	That provisional government took prisoner a group of English 
Canadians who were challenging its authority but soon released 
them. Some of them, including the young Ontario Anglo-Protestant 
Thomas Scott, took up arms again and were arrested once again. 
The Metis convened a court-martial and Scott was sentenced to 
death and executed. Ontario never forgave Louis Riel for that 
action.
<P>
	The conflict with the central government was solved thanks to 
the mediation of Bishop Alexandre Taché, and the government 
promised to declare full amnesty and to meet all the demands of the 
Metis.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Strong action on the part of Riel and the Metis, their control over 
the territory and their list of rights forced the federal government of 
the day to grant provincial status to part of this territory, namely the 
district of Assiniboine. It would later become the Province of 
Manitoba, thus foiling federal plans to turn western provinces into 
mere territories under the control of governors appointed by 
Ottawa. Western Canada owes a great deal to Louis Riel; it should 
acknowledge and be grateful for his contribution.
<P>
	Promises of amnesty were broken. Louis Riel was elected three 
times to the House of Commons, in 1873, 1874 and 1875, but was 
never able to sit as a member because a price had been put on his 
head. In February 1875 he went into exile for five years in 
exchange for amnesty.
<P>
	Pursued by enemies who despise him and fearing for his life, 
Riel stayed twice in Quebec hospitals, before returning to western 
Canada and the United States.
<P>
	In 1880, the Metis started sending numerous petitions to the 
federal government, which was slow in delivering their property 
titles. The Metis feared losing their lands to Canadian Pacific.
<P>
	In July 1884, Metis, anglophones and Indians from 
Saskatchewan asked Riel to help them protect their rights, as he 
had done so well for the people of Manitoba in 1869. Faced with 
the Conservative government's apathetic attitude, the Metis 
decided to defend their economic, social and political rights. They 
created a small republic and launched a peaceful protest to that end.
<P>
	On December 16, 1884, representatives of the Saskatchewan 
population sent the federal government a 25-clause petition 
outlining their claims and grievances.
<P>
	They sought permission to send delegates to Ottawa to submit a 
list of rights and possibly reach an agreement on the eventual 
inclusion of their territory in the Canadian Confederation, as a new 
province.
<P>
	At the time, Saskatchewan had a population of 60,000. By 
comparison, Manitoba only had a population of 12,000 when it 
joined Confederation. The central government's reaction to the 
reasonable demands made by the Saskatchewan people was to send 
in the army to subdue them and give their lands to the railway 
company and to settlers from the east.
<P>
	Since the federal government was showing no interest in their 
cause, the Metis and the Indians rebelled, winning a few battles in 
the process. However, the troops sent by Ottawa defeated Riel at 
Batoche and regained control over the territory. Riel gave himself 
up.
<P>
	On November 16, 1885, after a trial tainted with irregularities, 
and despite the jury's call for clemency and the representations of 
Quebecers, Louis David Riel, the Métis hero, was hanged. He was 
the only leader sentenced to death, which shows that his execution 
was mainly a political issue.
<P>
	Louis Riel has become a symbol, the symbol of a linguistic and 
cultural minority struggling to survive and to get equal civil and 
political rights. These rights have long been ignored, and to this 
day, Métis and francophones have to fight to have their 
constitutional rights recognized in their daily life.
<P>
	Whether our Reform colleagues like it or not, Louis Riel was 
also a worthy figure in the fight of pioneers who cherished 
freedom, close contact with nature, and the vastness of this country 
to prevent the federal government from interfering with their way 
of life in the name of civilization.
<P>
	Let me quote from the <I>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</I>, 
published by the University of Toronto Press. I ask my colleagues 
in the Reform Party to listen carefully to this quotation about Louis 
Riel:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Today he is seen as a founder of those movements which have 
protested central Canadian political and economic powers''.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Riel could therefore be considered one of the first to condemn 
western alienation. Are the members from the western provinces 
willing to pay tribute to Louis Riel by voting in favour of this bill?
<P>
	It must be clearly understood that we are not trying to rewrite 
history with this bill. Louis Riel was the leader of a rebellion, he 
was captured, summarily convicted and executed, those are the 
facts. For many anglophones living at that time, Riel was a traitor, 
an enemy; for francophones and the Metis, he was a hero.
<P>
	The question today is how we, members of the House, consider 
him now. Many of the rights for which he fought have been 
recognized in the Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms. The 
House of Commons has unanimously recognized his unique 
historical role as founder of Manitoba and his contribution to 
Confedera-
<P>

<B><A NAME="6636"> 6636 </A></B>
<P>
tion. A Canadian stamp has been issued in his honour, and statues 
have been erected to him.
<P>
	The Liberals, when they sat on the opposition benches, asked for 
Louis Riel's rehabilitation. For example, in 1985, the Deputy Prime 
Minister asked the Conservative government to exonerate Riel and 
went even further by saying: ``Louis Riel, who died unnecessarily, 
deserves to be exonerated by the government and recognized as a 
victim of wrongdoing''.
<P>
	In May 1996, the then foreign affairs minister stated: ``As long 
as I am in office, I will do my utmost to ensure that the Metis have 
the right to take part fully in this country''. It is now time for the 
Liberals, who have been in office for three years, to make good on 
their promise and to take action in favour of Louis Riel.
<P>
	Clearing the name of Louis Riel would harm no one, since all 
those involved at the time have long been dead. But this would be a 
symbolic gesture of opening up to the Metis and French 
communities to show them that they are welcome in this country 
and that they are respected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean), BQ:</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will take the few minutes remaining. ``Je me souviens''. Yes, I 
remember my language, my culture, and all those who died for me. 
After all, these are the words that appear on all licence plates in 
Quebec. Remembering is important.
<P>
	Lately, someone asked me why we bothered to have a debate in 
the House on this subject. That person wondered if revoking the 
conviction of Louis David Riel would change anything in the 
world. I say that we must acknowledge that something terrible 
happened: a political execution or an attempt to alter history.
<P>
	Mr. Riel was, I would say, victim of wrongdoing. I think it is 
important to know where we have come from to know where we are 
going. We did not just spring up one day. It is important to 
understand the origins of our nations, what happened in the past.
<P>
	What I find particularly fascinating is to see so many of my 
colleagues opposite who stated, while in opposition, that they were 
ready to do anything to ensure the revocation of Louis Riel's 
condemnation. I cannot wait for the results of this vote. What will 
happen?
<P>
	It may not be a great moment in the history of our country, but it 
will be a small moment in our history. For me, it is heart-warming 
to be able to speak today on such an important issue. I am 
particularly proud, because two years ago, I had the opportunity to 
follow an English immersion program in Saskatoon, 
Saskatchewan, just a few kilometres from Batoche where these 
events occurred.
<P>
	We are standing up for a hero who fought for democracy as a 
whole, who gave his life for what he considered a fair and good 
cause.
<P>
	Such was the cause and the involvement of a man who put his 
mark on Canada's very foundation, that is, the Canadian 
Constitution. This was the cause of a man who was persecuted 
because he was proud to be a Metis, a Catholic and a 
French-speaking Canadian, three things that were then very badly 
perceived in Ottawa.
<P>
	When we see how the government is treating its minorities 
today, we tend to believe that things have not really changed. We 
sometimes wonder. We often blame the young for not being 
interested in the history of their country and for not knowing 
anything about this episode of their history, which makes so many 
Quebecers and Canadians proud.
<P>
	In order to really understand how important this bill is, we 
should go back in time to get to know who Louis David Riel was. In 
so doing we will refresh the memories of those who may have 
chosen to forget what happened.
<P>
	Riel was born in 1844 in Saint-Boniface, Manitoba. He was a 
Métis, which means his parents were of different races.
<P>
	After his studies at the Petit Séminaire in Montreal, he returned 
to Manitoba in 1866 and saw the hostility between English 
Protestant settlers who had recently settled there and wanted to 
control the area, and the francophone Métis who were Catholics.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know my time has expired.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We will resume debate next time with the 
hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has expired.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 11 a.m. on 
Monday.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
