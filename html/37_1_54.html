to a tax deduction of up to $1,000.  This would be similar to the 
tax deduction claimed by individuals who give cash contributions.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>COMPETITION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-23.  On the Order:  Government Orders 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>April 4, 2001—the Minister of Industry—Second reading and 
reference to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and 
Technology of Bill C-23, an act to amend the Competition Act and 
the Competition Tribunal Act. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (for the Minister of Industry)</B> 
moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-23, an act to amend the Competition Act and the 
Competition Tribunal Act, be referred forthwith to the Standing 
Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the purpose of the motion is 
to provide members of the House with a greater role in preparing 
legislation through House of Commons committees.  It is only the 
third of three bills referred to committee before second reading 
in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Minister of Industry I am very pleased that 
Bill C-23, an act to amend the Competition Act and its related 
statute, the Competition Tribunal Act, will be referred forthwith 
to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. 
This will give members of parliament a greater role in the 
development and passage of legislation.  It should also be noted 
that this government bill was developed on the principles 
underlying four private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiatives proposed in the bill would ensure that key 
marketplace framework laws remain effective and efficient in 
promoting and protecting competition to the benefit of consumers 
and the business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act maintains and encourages competition in 
order to enhance economic welfare, to ensure that small and 
medium size enterprises have an equitable opportunity to 
participate in the Canadian economy, and to provide consumers 
with competitive prices and product choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the competition bureau, with the assistance of the 
public policy forum, undertook extensive consultations on the 
principles underlying four private members' bills that proposed 
amendments to the Competition Act.  Stakeholders representing 
consumers, businesses, and the legal and academic communities 
were encouraged to provide their views.  The bill is the product 
of that consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes improvements to the Competition Act and the 
Competition Tribunal Act in four key areas:  first, prohibiting 
deceptive contests; second, broadening the scope under which the 
tribunal may make temporary orders; third, streamlining the 
competition tribunal processes; and, fourth, facilitating 
co-operation with foreign competition authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a bit about deceptive contests.  Accurate information 
in the marketplace is critical to all Canadians.  In 1999 
provisions were introduced to the Competition Act to address 
telemarketing scams.  However the competition bureau's crackdown 
on deceptive telemarketers has caused some con artists to migrate 
to other technologies such as mail and the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deceptive contests involve the mass mailing of announcements 
which tell recipients that they have won a valuable prize. 
Sometimes the prospective victim is told that he or she must 
first pay a fee or taxes before delivery.  In other cases the 
recipient is duped into telephoning a toll number to obtain 
further details or to claim the prize.  In most cases the prize 
turns out to be worthless or of minimal value.  That pales in 
comparison to the charges the recipient incurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill creates a new criminal offence to combat deceptive 
contests sent by mail or the Internet.  This new provision will 
prohibit any person from sending by mail or otherwise material 
which gives the general impression that the recipient has won a 
prize and that in order to receive such a prize he or she must 
make a prior payment of money or incur a charge such as a 
telephone toll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a bit about temporary orders.  Complex competition 
cases can often require extensive investigation by the 
competition bureau before any proceedings are commenced with the 
competition tribunal.  In cases of serious anti-competitive 
conduct a victim might very well have gone out of business before 
the issue is resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective enforcement of our competition laws calls for powers 
to put an immediate temporary halt to anti-competitive conduct 
where circumstances warrant.  This type of injunctive power is 
presently available with respect to alleged offences under the 
criminal provisions of the Competition Act and with respect to 
the civil reviewable provisions once proceedings have been 
commenced before the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except in the case of a merger there is presently no interim 
remedy available to prevent anti-competitive conduct while the 
Competition bureau is investigating a matter but has not yet 
filed a case with a tribunal.  The bill would fill that gap by 
enabling the tribunal to issue temporary orders on application of 
the commissioner of competition.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to streamlining competition tribunal processes, it is 
important that the competition tribunal not be impaired in its 
ability to make timely and relevant decisions.  The proposals in 
the bill would amend the Competition Act and the Competition 
Tribunal Act to streamline the tribunal processes in three key 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the tribunal would be empowered to make an award of costs 
in order to discourage frivolous or vexatious litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the tribunal would be able to summarily dispose of an 
application without having gone through a full hearing in cases 
where there is no genuine issue or genuine defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a means would be created by which references would be 
brought to the tribunal on a specific issue.  In some cases the 
outcome of a tribunal case might depend on a single pivotal issue 
such as the appropriate definition of the market.  An early 
ruling might obviate the need for a full hearing on all the 
remaining issues.  These streamlining measures are consistent 
with similar procedures followed by most courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Facilitating international co-operation is very important. 
Continuing technological changes and falling trade barriers today 
have resulted in a rapidly changing global economy.  It also 
raises the risk that the effects of anti-competitive conduct will 
spill across borders and that the evidence necessary to combat 
this activity will be located outside Canada.  For these reasons 
we need to be able to exchange information with competition 
authorities for the purpose of evidence gathering if we are to 
ensure that our competition laws remain effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key objectives of the bill is to provide for enhanced 
international co-operation on competition matters.  There is no 
better example that I can provide of the benefits that flow from 
international co-operation than the recent series of cases 
involving international price fixing cartels.  Let me point out 
that in the last few years there have been over 40 convictions of 
multinational corporations for price fixing offences under the 
Competition Act, resulting in fines in excess of $160 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These remarkable achievements in anti-cartel enforcement were 
due to the regime of international co-operation for criminal 
matters under the mutual legal assistance treaty.  A similar tool 
is now required for the civil provisions of the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are being well served by our competition laws.  The 
amendment initiatives before us today represent the latest step 
in a continuing legislative evolution which will ensure that 
Canadians and Canadian competition laws remain up to date and 
operate effectively and efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this juncture I commend the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, the member for Kitchener Centre and 
the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine who worked diligently 
and hard through their private members' initiatives in shaping 
these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note in closing that the public policy forum concluded from 
consultations that a consensus on private access might be 
possible.  While there have been significant concerns expressed 
by some stakeholders on the subject, it has evoked some strong 
support from other quarters.  This motion will give the committee 
the opportunity to explore the benefits and necessity of such a 
proposal.  I personally look forward to seeing whether the 
committee can find consensus in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that the bill be referred to the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Industry, Science and Technology before second 
reading.  I look forward to hearing the committee's views on the 
government's proposed amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is indeed a beautiful morning and we have a beautiful 
piece of legislation to start the day off.  I commend the 
parliamentary secretary opposite.  This piece of legislation, 
although far from perfect, is a piece of legislation that we have 
to look at with some favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary declared, the competition bureau 
has served Canadians well.  Although many Canadians who have made 
appeals and requests of the competition bureau have not always 
received the redress they desired, or they were not dealt with as 
speedily as they should have been, it has served Canadians 
relatively well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some deficiencies in the act which are being 
addressed this morning.  I commend the government for bringing 
the bill forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of our viewers this morning I should like to 
review some of the things the bill will actually do.  First, it 
would facilitate the co-operation between Canadian and foreign 
competition authorities regarding evidence gathering or civil 
competition matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is pretty significant.  We are getting into a global 
economy.  Industries are operating in other countries.  Certain 
countries are becoming highly specialized in some areas and other 
countries in others.  There is need for international trade. 
There is need to recognize our respective strengths and 
weaknesses and to co-operate in developing how we might do it 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a greed element that comes into society every once in a 
while.  Some people want to sort of dominate, take a dominant 
position in industry, and make everybody kowtow to their 
particular desires.  We need to recognize that we need protection 
domestically.  We also need protection internationally so that 
there is a fair and reciprocal exchange of information and that 
the rules of gathering information are comparable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would prohibit deceptive notices of a prize aimed at the 
general public and sent through the mail or Internet.  I am sure 
all members of the House are aware that there are certain 
unscrupulous promoters out there who provide prizes.  They make 
people think they are getting something.  They receive phone 
calls congratulating them and telling them that we have won a $50 
prize, only to discover that to collect the prize they have to 
send in $5, $10 or some other amount.  Then they are thanked for 
the $10 and they discover that the prize is not really worth $50. 
It is a scam.  It is amazing how many people have been fooled by 
so-called prizes.  They are not prizes at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember one case mentioned before the industry committee 
involving the winning of a prize that was worth roughly $50,000. 
In order to collect the prize the person had to invest $10,000 
and the prize was not forthcoming.  This is a very significant 
amendment to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it would streamline the competition tribunal processes by 
providing the tribunal with a power to award costs, to make 
summary dispositions and to determine references. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at three points in this area.  Sometimes people 
feel that some other group is unfairly competing with them when 
the competition is quite fair.  They submit frivolous requests to 
the tribunal which wastes a lot of time and is not productive. 
These frivolous requests are added to a long list of other 
legitimate requests.  The provision to avoid frivolous 
applications to the competition bureau is a reasonable one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also look at the scope under which the competition 
bureau may issue temporary orders.  That scope has now been 
broadened.  I cannot emphasize that enough, because there are 
times when the competition bureau could deal with something that 
it is currently not empowered to deal with, simply because it is 
so restricted as to what it may deal with.  Let me read a couple 
of things that can now happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time an interim order can be issued by the 
competition tribunal only after litigation has begun.  This 
lengthy period of time may elapse before the protective action is 
taken, with the consequence that the target of anti-competitive 
behaviour may already have taken place and have driven some 
people out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is difficult.  I cannot help but refer to a particular case 
that happened in my constituency.  I was able to assist a small 
company that had annual sales of roughly $3 million to $6 
million.  The source of material which it distributed was being 
stopped.  It could not be supplied with material any longer 
because the suppliers wanted it themselves.  They did not 
indicate the last part. 
They simply said they would not provide the material anymore, 
which meant they could not do business any longer.  There was 
literally a domination in the marketplace.  I think it was three 
companies that had 85% or 90% of the market.  They said they 
could have the rest of the market, putting them into a monopoly 
situation.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On principle I object to any kind of monopoly.  This particular 
case went to the competition bureau.  The bureau had some 
difficulty dealing with this case but over time gradually saw the 
merits of the case and dealt with it.  The case went to court and 
an injunction was issued.  The companies that had taken advantage 
of their dominant position had to supply the material.  These 
individuals are now in business and going forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the tribunal not been able to act in this case, the company 
would have been broke today.  Had there not been a recognition by 
the tribunal that some serious injustices were taking place, 
these poor people would be bankrupt, having sunk a lot of money 
into their business.  They still have not finished.  They now 
have to recognize and claim for damages experienced as a result 
of the anti-competitive behaviour by these people.  It looks like 
that is going forward.  I cannot speak about it any further 
because it is before the courts.  I hope it is resolved in favour 
of this small company and that it recovers its costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some major changes were made to the Competition Act in 1999.  I 
distinctly remember the debate which took place with regard to 
fraudulent telemarketing and the business of tied selling.  This 
is when a company puts a condition on a price for a particular 
article.  In other words, to get that price one must buy 
something else.  For example, banks, and sometimes other 
institutions, say that if one buys a particular insurance policy, 
it will give it to the individual for a special rate, but to get 
that rate the individual also has to take a mortgage with the 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, there is the bundling of services to get a better price. 
For example, to get a lower price from the bank, a customer would 
have to take the whole package, such as a savings account, a 
current account, a chequing account and perhaps insurance.  There 
is nothing wrong with that except when it becomes a condition. It 
really becomes a judgment call as to when one is a condition on 
the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tied selling is one of those things that the Competition Act 
says should not ever be done.  I agree with this.  The question 
now becomes one of interpretation or one of judgment as to when 
it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my final minute I want to suggest the need for government to 
recognize that not only should the Competition Act be amended as 
suggested, it should to go beyond that.  There are a couple of 
other proposals that would improve the Competition Act even 
further.  That has to do with the distinction between criminal 
and civil cases.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
morning we are debating Bill C-23, an act to amend the 
Competition Act and the Competition Tribunal Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence the bill brings together a number of initiatives 
from MPs' private members bills.  It is a bit of a cobble of a 
number of bills and initiatives proposed by various members on, 
among other things, the practices and procedures of the 
competition tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four aspects to the bill.  One concerns changes to the 
procedures of the competition tribunal in order to make it more 
effective. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT8"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT8"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035
<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect concerns the interim orders the competition 
tribunal can issue to prevent situations causing such lengthy 
prejudice that a corporation, even if it knows it is causing a 
prejudice, will eliminate a competitor and prevent his 
or her subsequent return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of it is to eliminate a practice that could make it 
advantageous to behave illegally, since it means that 
competitors will be eliminated and that the price to pay for 
this is perhaps less than the value of the resultant benefit. 
The tribunal could have more teeth and greater effectiveness as 
regards these two aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also amendments to facilitate international 
co-operation. In this age of globalization and rapidly evolving 
communications technologies, we now know that greater 
international co-operation is needed to improve the effectiveness 
of the consumer protection measures in the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fourth aspect of the bill, which everyone has heard about and 
which is perhaps the simplest to understand, includes amendments 
to prohibit deceptive contests, the kind that suggest we have 
won something and must pay money to receive our prize.  The 
bill contains provisions which make it an offence to send a 
deceptive notice by electronic or regular mail to an individual 
suggesting that he or her she has won a price and must pay money to receive 
it. 
We know that this kind of practice very often leads to abuses 
and questionable situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge everyone to exercise the greatest caution. 
When people win something and have entered no contest they should 
be on their 
guard.  There is something very fishy about this and, in 
general, the problems will be greater than the rewards. 
There have been so many abuses in this area that the time has 
come for legislators to send a clearer message that these 
practices will be dealt with much more severely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has many laudable goals.  We will obviously have to 
examine it in greater detail in parliamentary committee.  Then 
we will debate it in the House again.  We will be able to hear 
from witnesses on various subjects they feel we should know more 
about.  We will also have to take into account the jurisdictions 
of the various levels in order to ensure that the bill respects 
the work already being done by the provinces.  I am thinking, 
for instance, of Quebec, with its Consumer Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before having had the opportunity to examine the bill in detail, 
one has to wonder how it will ensure that consumers are well 
protected when a province already has consumer protection 
legislation to regulate such practices and the federal 
government gets involved with the Competition Act? There is a 
grey area but I am sure that the work done in committee will 
shed more light on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the bill is all about. 
My disappointment has to do with the fact that while the 
government is dealing with competition issues, one of the great 
frustrations and concerns of consumers right now is the gasoline 
issue and the behaviour of the oil industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is serious about finding tools to improve 
business and competitive practices, the oil industry definitely 
deserves greater attention because gas prices are reaching 
record levels and are constantly increasing. The prospect of 
paying even more for a litre of gas is a major concern to 
consumers, to those whose livelihood is dependent on an industry 
in which transportation is an important component and to those 
who live in regions where transportation is an unavoidable 
reality and a major production cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the case in a region like mine, the 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue.  We have to make heavy use of trucking to 
get our products out and others in, which adds considerably to 
our production costs.  It affects agriculture and it affects the 
trucking industry.  In the urban centres, it affects the taxi 
industry.  Thus there are many groups affected by the rise in 
prices.  I do not need to list them all but many people are 
seriously penalized by high gasoline prices.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that the increase in the price per barrel is the 
only reason we are paying such a high price at present.  The 
trade practices of the major oil companies are dubious, to say 
the least, and unfortunately are not being given any specific 
scrutiny by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to have seen action on a number of fronts, 
such as, first, in the short term, helping out the consumer by 
doing something about the tax in order to keep the prices down. 
At the same time, however, something needs to be done about the 
variables of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way I will ever be convinced that it is normal 
competitive practice for major competitors such as the big oil 
companies to always all have the same prices at the same time, 
for gas stations on four corners of an intersection to raise 
prices at exactly the same time in one place, while another 
place only a few kilometres away will have different prices. 
The transportation variable does not explain these price 
differences, nor do the variables of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain trade practices are used to do in all the little 
independents.  It is very clear that this is the strategy and 
action plan of the major companies.  Obviously it is in their 
interest, and understandably so; they are in business to make 
money.  If we do not do something they will use these 
strategies to increase their share of the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe, and this is a common perception, that the 
business practices of these firms cannot comply with the usual 
rules of competition.  There is a sort of collusion between 
these companies.  A mechanism must be put in place to 
continually monitor the conduct of the oil industry.  For 
example, let us give the competition bureau additional means to 
set up an oil industry monitoring section.  Let us ensure that 
the law makes sentencing or proof of anti-competitive practices 
easier to obtain.  In this regard, I wish the current bill had 
opened this window. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee, we will study the subjects presented.  Obviously, 
people will appear before the committee, but I fear that when we 
study the bill we will limit ourselves to the subject matter of 
the bill and not deal with this very important section of the 
Competition Act or the ways in which competitive practices in 
the oil industry may be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, I repeat remarks shared by many of the members opposite at 
one time.  Over 50 of them signed a report stating that the 
Canadian market was a real treat for the oil companies. 
The report also stated that, on average, Canadian consumers were 
paying 4 cents or 5 cents more for a litre of gas than U.S. consumers, 
and that taxes should be removed because of competitive 
practices in Canada where the federal government's approach to 
promoting the establishment of a strong industry has gone too 
far, to the extent that this was done at consumers' expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am somewhat surprised to see that only a few still hold this 
view, that the others have forgotten that they signed this 
report and that this issue is no longer one of their political 
priorities even though it is more important than ever to 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that at third reading some substantial amendments will 
have been made to improve competitive practices in the oil 
industry and to control these companies somewhat. People can no 
longer stand to see these companies making huge profits while 
they are paying exorbitant prices for gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to stop at some point. We must send the signal that we 
are concerned about this situation. Even though the bill has 
some good features, it overlooks an extremely important 
component in our daily lives, namely the oil industry. I find 
this difficult to accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in the end the bill will include a clause amending 
the mandate of the competition bureau regarding the oil 
industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read the summary of the bill so the listening public 
will know what it entails.  It states:

</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment amends the Competition Act and Competition 
Tribunal Act.  The amendments include the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>amendments to facilitate co-operation with foreign competition 
authorities for the enforcement of civil competition and fair 
trade practices laws; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must have been a hard thing for the government to put in fair 
trade practices laws, but that is okay.  The summary continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>amendments prohibiting deceptive prize notices; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>amendments streamlining the Competition Tribunal process by 
providing for cost awards, summary dispositions and references; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>amendments broadening the scope under which the Tribunal may 
issue temporary  orders; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>some housekeeping items. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of areas are being covered throughout the bill that 
need to be addressed.  I want to comment a bit further on the 
amendments prohibiting deceptive prize notices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from the Alliance commented about the number 
of scams that are out there involving individuals.  Toward the 
end of his comments he also mentioned whether or not something 
like this should be considered criminal or handled through a 
civil process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that area I am somewhat concerned that we would not look at 
deceptive prize projects as a criminal act.  We are not talking 
about people being ripped off by a few thousand dollars. In a 
good many instances tens of thousands of dollars are involved.  I 
know specifically of three people, who do have their wits about 
them but who got involved in very deceptive scams involving 
$5,000 to $10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disappointing that we are not dealing with scams as a 
criminal issue rather than on the basis of it decreasing 
competition.  Something seems to be amiss here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue that will probably not be addressed in 
the bill but it is also deceptive.  A small business operator in 
my riding purchased plans on how to access government grants and 
funding.  It was formatted in such a way, and with the coat of 
arms on it, that it appeared to be something put out by the 
Government of Canada.  It included a number of things that were 
available through government services by accessing different 
departments, websites and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the toughest things is to know exactly what grants and 
funding are available through different programs and how to 
access them.  As a member of parliament, I receive a number of 
notices and often at the last minute.  Two days before we can 
access funding, a government department will send out a notice 
saying that program funds are available.  As MPs we scramble to 
let people in our riding, who might have some kind of interest in 
these funds, know that they are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that one instance a small business owner paid $300 for this 
information.  It definitely was presented in such a way that it 
looked like it came from the Government of Canada.  There was a 
rider enclosed indicating that it had to be returned within so 
many days or the person lost money.  There really was nothing the 
person could do about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are getting caught up in these scams do have 
their wits about them.  They are genuinely looking to benefit 
from some things.  The saying is that “if you are getting 
something for nothing, chances are you  are getting nothing for 
something”.  That is the bottom line with a scam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the members who were involved in that particular 
project because it is certainly one part of the legislation that 
each and every Canadian would be able to feel the impact of 
personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major part of the bill deals with co-operation between 
foreign countries, which is of course needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how other members of the industry committee feel, 
but apart from not necessarily wanting any more work on our plate 
at the committee, which was the only thing holding me back from 
saying that I did not want the legislation to go through, it 
would be good to get the bill to committee as soon as possible 
because it does involve a lot of discussion.  I hope we get the 
opportunity to get on to it by September.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-23 today on behalf 
of our industry critic, the member for Kings—Hants, who has been 
very much involved with these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us are involved with competition issues almost every day. 
During my former job as transportation critic there were several 
instances where the competition bureau was involved, especially 
during the evolution of the airline industry.  There was a lot of 
involvement by the competition bureau when Canadian Airlines was 
consumed by Air Canada.  There still is and will be for some 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition bureau has outlined rules whereby Air Canada 
must allow competition to start and flourish in order to create a 
competitive environment in the aviation industry in Canada.  Air 
Canada is so strong that it effectively could put new companies 
out of business before they even start.  It can subsidize four 
revenue lines from its better revenue lines, thereby competing 
with other smaller airlines that do not have access to the more 
profitable lines.  It can lower rates on its lower revenue lines 
by subsidizing from the higher revenue lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone understands how the system works.  Air Canada has 
complied quite astutely but the competition bureau has been 
involved in a couple of cases.  That is just an example of what 
we are talking about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example that is a little closer to home.  A 
member of my family received a call saying that she had won a car 
or some huge prize.  She had to call a 1-900 number and answer a 
few skill testing questions.  I remember that the low end of the 
prize award was $2.73 and the high end was a car.  When she 
called the number she was kept on the line for almost an hour. 
They charged her a lot of money, and sure enough she had won the 
$2.73.  It was a total scam to make money on the phone call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another senior lady in my riding was scammed out of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars by two or three different outfits from the 
province of Quebec.  They were the same people who just changed 
names, identities and addresses.  They used all kinds of excuses 
to access this lady's money.  In the end she lost her home and 
her money.  It was a confidence scam.  She should have had quick 
and easy access to the Competition Act to prevent this sort of 
thing from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is pleased to see these amendments come in.  It is a 
credit to parliamentarians and private members' bills that have 
come before.  They have all been generated by people who have 
come to us as members of parliament and advised us that they had 
been scammed, cheated or were victims of abuse in some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament have responded by raising the issue with 
several private members' bills which are now reflected in Bill 
C-23.  Quite often people do not give us credit but the system 
actually does work.  It may take a while but it does work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are concerned about issues of conspiracy, bid rigging, 
predatory pricing, misleading advertising and deceptive marketing 
practices.  Many of us have been victims of those practices, 
including me and certainly some of my constituents.  When the 
bill is in its final form hopefully it will address those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-criminal or reviewable matters include mergers, abuse of 
dominant positions and people taking advantage of others.  They 
may not be criminal but they are reviewable and they are not 
fair.  This is where the competition commissioner should have the 
power to intervene and protect the citizens who have no other 
avenue or no other source of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition tribunal and the competition commissioner have 
done a good job with the tools they have had to work with.  Bill 
C-23 would give them more tools.  In any case I have been 
involved in the competition commissioner has done a thorough 
investigation, has heard both sides of the story and has done a 
good job.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was developed because parliamentarians responded to 
citizens through private members' bills.  However it has also 
come about through consultations across the country, through 
public policy forums and a consultation paper that formed the 
basis of the discussions entitled “Amending the Competition Act: 
A Discussion Paper on Meeting the Needs of the Global Economy”. 
All these sources of information certainly enhanced the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the issue is international co-operation.  That is 
important because the same people from the province of Quebec who 
were scamming other people were doing the same in the United 
States.  The American authorities had limited access to address 
this issue because of international rules.  The bill would allow 
a closer relationship between the law enforcement offices and the 
competition bureaus of both countries to deal with these 
international issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would deal with deceptive practices such as the notice 
of winning a prize as in the case of my family member.  A lot of 
Canadian companies are providing these services or promoting 
these scams in the U.S.  The same can happen the other way 
around.  American companies can scam Canadians.  There has to be 
some international co-operation, and the bill would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill intends to streamline the litigation progress, which is 
a good thing.  It would help the tribunal that manages each case 
it hears to be more efficient and to give easier access to 
people.  The tribunal would be able to award costs against a 
party, which is also a good thing.  Many people have taken on 
incredible legal bills to fight the mail and telephone scams I 
have mentioned.  In a decision the tribunal would at least be 
able to award costs to the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tribunal would gain the power to summarily dispose of a 
matter that it believes has no genuine basis for application. 
That is a good thing as well.  Frivolous actions are taken and it 
would have the power to determine whether or not an action is 
frivolous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new proposal the bureau would be able to issue 
temporary or interim orders prior to completion of the 
litigation.  This was perhaps led by some of the Air Canada 
judgments.  Powers would be given to the competition commissioner 
in the aviation case.  It could make judgments early and 
immediately, before the case even comes to the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore there is a lot of good in the bill.  Our party is 
anxious to get it to committee as well.  We want to make sure 
that it has teeth, as the government has proposed.  We want to 
make sure the teeth are actually there.  We want to make sure the 
competition bureau is independent.  We want to emphasize that 
this whole issue evolved from citizens complaining to members of 
parliament, who brought it forward in private members' bills and 
now in a government bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be pleased to see the bill go to committee and we will 
make our decisions and amendments there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we have before the House today a package of amendments 
to the Competition Act and its companion statute, the Competition 
Tribunal Act.  Together these statutes constitute a fundamental 
framework in the rules for the operation of free trade and a 
competitive marketplace for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act is a broad based statute that affects 
virtually all industrial sectors and business entities in Canada, 
whether large or small, domestic or international, or involved in 
manufacturing, services or resources.  The legislation seeks to 
enhance competitive market forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition is important.  It is not a means to itself but 
rather a means to an end.  Competition encourages firms to lower 
costs, reduce prices, improve services and develop new products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers are the prime beneficiaries of a competitive economy. 
After all, competition is driven by consumer demands.  In a 
competitive environment consumers decide what they want to buy 
based on their individual needs, preferences and incomes.  The 
marketplace responds efficiently to this demand by supplying 
consumers with the right product at the right price.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment being considered today would make it an offence to 
promote deceptive contests by mail, fax or Internet.  Under the 
new provision it would be a criminal offence to make people 
believe they have won a prize and that they must make a payment 
or incur a cost to collect it, to increase their chances of 
winning it or simply to get more information regarding it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deceptions of this sort hurt Canadians.  I have talked to people 
across the country about the devastating effects on the people 
that have been duped.  These practices also hurt responsible 
businesses and charities by undermining their legitimate 
marketing efforts and many of them damage our reputation abroad 
by targeting persons outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons such rackets must be stopped, and the sooner 
the better.  The new provision would add a valuable enforcement 
tool against deceptive marketing practices.  It would complement 
existing provisions against deceptive advertising and 
telemarketing and help ensure that consumers have the information 
they need to make informed choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sellers would be rewarded for their ability to offer good 
products at low prices rather than their cunning ability to 
deceive the consumer.  Honest businesses would no longer be 
threatened by the anti-competitive practices of dishonest 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed in the bill would help keep Canada's 
competition laws up to date, but the work is clearly not over. 
Globalization and rapid technological developments are 
continually changing the marketplace and the ways in which 
business is conducted.  To remain effective and relevant the 
Competition Act must remain both modern and dynamic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments constitute one step in the continuing evolution 
of our competition legislation.  The changes constitute a 
balanced package of amendments that would better enable the 
Competition Act to protect free competition and the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments would protect consumers and honest businesses 
alike.  The bill would strengthen and improve the overall level 
of competition in the marketplace and benefit all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wholeheartedly endorse the amendments and believe they are 
worthy of the support of all members of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak about this bill and about the new 
ground broken in terms of recognizing members' efforts to ensure 
that the legislation that comes before this parliament and its 
committees is an accurate reflection of the concerns we hear 
about in our ridings. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot to say on the bill and will try to be as brief as I 
can in the next nine and a half minutes.  Much of the bill 
reflects the efforts of members on this side of the House to 
effect much needed changes to the Competition Act.  It is for 
that reason that I thank the hon. Minister of Industry, his 
parliamentary secretary, the member for Scarborough Centre and 
the competition bureau that have been working very hard to ensure 
the Competition Act reflects the changes in market structure that 
we see throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a bit of background on why we are here today.  The 
hon. member for Kelowna said earlier that it is a beautiful day. 
I think it is a wonderful day.  There is finally a ray of hope 
that our competition policy will begin to look more globalist, 
will be open to small and large players, and will ultimately have 
more teeth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 when gas prices were heading up, 52 members on this side 
of the House began a study of the industry, particularly at the 
retailing end, and found the level of concentration to be 
alarming. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason one of the recommendations was to ensure that a 
more appropriate definition of predatory pricing be established. 
The House not only made private member's Bill C-235 votable.  It 
also ensured that it would be properly studied by committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That clearly was not the case.  Nevertheless, out of that came a 
more open process that allowed a number of issues to be studied, 
not just one area of competition policy.  One such issue was that 
section 45 of the Competition Act, the conspiracy section, may 
not be relevant in addressing problems in the economy or in 
ensuring that strategic alliances which may look collusive but 
have very strong competitive effects are somehow segregated from 
the egregious types of collusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the issue of predatory pricing, a move was made with the 
help of the industry committee to review some of the criminal 
aspects which are difficult to enforce if not to detect.  With 
the help of VanDuzer and Paquet we were able to propose 
changes to the Competition Act which would make it more user 
friendly and make criminal burdens of proof civilly reviewable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We followed that up with a commitment by the previous Minister 
of Industry, the current Minister of Foreign Affairs, who must be 
acknowledged here.  He began allowing the public policy forum to 
conduct a broad study of the Competition Act, particularly in 
terms of some of the legislation I brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my two colleagues who spoke before me, the member for 
Kitchener Centre and my colleague from Mount Royal who brought 
forward the bill dealing with international co-operation.  The 
public policy forum effectively criss-crossed the country last 
summer to determine the public's concern with respect to abusive 
dominance in the grocery industry and retail domination in almost 
any form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second recommendation dealt with private access, conspiracy, 
collusion and summary disposition of temporary orders which we 
see rolled up in the bill today.  The package received a 
significant amount of interest.  Most alarming, however, was the 
consistent pattern we saw among those with vested interests, 
particularly powerful lobbies that constituted themselves as a 
diversity of individuals but were really part of the same group 
that opposed almost any changes to the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I explained who wrote the Competition Act in 1986. 
There are not only concerns that it is an act whose time has come 
in terms of need for change.  There are questions as to who 
really wrote it.  Most of us in the House know, as Peter C. 
Newman said in the book <I>Titans</I> and in his interview with 
the chairman of the Business Council on National Issues, that it 
is interesting Canada is the only nation that has allowed its 
Competition Act to be written by the very people it was meant to 
police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has set off alarm bells in most circles and certainly in 
the House of Commons.  However more important is the impact it 
has had on the competitive process.  For that reason the 
competition bureau, in concert with the minister and with 
parliament, has taken a bold step today in saying that 
irrespective of what the interests are we must make sure the 
competitive process is honoured and that it flourishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opportunities have been made clear on several occasions in the 
industry committee.  People have testified to the committee 
suggesting that by the time the competition bureau makes a ruling 
the person it affects is out of business, the damage is done and 
it is irreparable.  The initiatives taken today are extremely 
valuable and should ensure there is an ongoing process for 
amendments to the Competition Act to ensure that it is pragmatic 
and changes with changing times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure the House understands that  the process 
before us today must be an open one.  The government has 
initiated, through the wisdom of the minister, an opportunity 
that would allow members of parliament to ensure that issues of 
importance to them and to consumers have a voice on the floor of 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members are talking about one of the bills.  My colleague 
from Kitchener Centre addressed the question of deceptive 
practices, particularly as transmitted through mail by using 
Canada Post or other means. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an extremely important issue with which the public 
readily identifies.  However there are other issues the public 
may not have seen.  Another initiative taken up here today is the 
whole question of international co-operation.  Why is that 
important?   Most Canadians do not know it, but for the past 
several years we have been part and parcel of a cartel that has 
forced up the price of citric acid, various important chemicals, 
certain vitamins and lycene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those issues were resolved, discovered, advocated and taken from 
the competition act in the U.S.  For that reason it is important 
to ensure that where there are international cartels Canada can 
effectively prosecute no matter where it occurs in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the competition bureau was successful in 
prosecuting these issues and bringing revenue back to Canada. 
That revenue, according to some, did not equal what the public 
lost in terms of higher prices, but it nonetheless helped the 
general revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also point out something that is not in the bill but 
which the industry committee has nonetheless been effective in 
transmitting to parliament.  I am talking about the need to 
ensure the competition bureau has the resources to carry out its 
very lofty mandate and to ensure the market remains balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions are being raised in many areas.  There is an 
opportunity for such questions to be addressed in the industry 
committee.  I caution hon. members that the pinstripes and the 
big suits will be coming to the committee.  I implore members of 
parliament to ensure a balance of the views of consumers and 
ordinary people out there who do not have a voice but who 
nonetheless are an important part of our economic structure. 
Those individuals count for everything in the economy and must 
count for something if the legislation is to be meaningful and 
successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament will be lobbied by some of the most 
interesting people in the country.  Members will need to decide 
for themselves, in committee and on the floor of the House of 
Commons, whether to enhance and maintain the competitive process 
for all Canadians or merely for those who happen to have the 
wealth and the power to influence them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very good day.  There are obviously a number of 
concerns we must address.  It is the beginning of a much larger 
process.  It is vindication for a lot of the work I have done and 
which I have brought to the attention of the House of Commons and 
on which other hon. members have worked so diligently.  Let us 
ensure that Canada remains ahead of the game, that its 
international reputation as a place for doing business remains 
pristine, and that Canadians benefit from a vibrant economic 
environment in which all people are meaningful participants and 
are treated as equals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
address the House at third reading of Bill C-18, an act to amend the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act with respect to the 
equalization program.  The bill fulfils the government's 
commitment made by the Prime Minister at last September's first 
ministers meeting to lift the ceiling for the equalization 
program for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to this commitment, the Prime Minister asked the 
Minister of Finance to consult his counterparts in the provinces 
and territories as to how best to ensure follow up.  The 
Minister of Finance concluded his consultations before the bill 
was introduced on March 15. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the first ministers meeting, landmark agreements were reached 
on a plan to renew health care, improve support for early 
childhood development and strengthen social programs.  These 
agreements resulted, through Bill C-45, passed in the last 
parliament, in the largest federal contribution ever made for 
health, post-secondary education, early childhood development and 
other social programs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next five years, federal spending in these areas  will 
total $23.4 billion, $21.1 billion of it under the Canada health 
and social transfer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the CHST is one of the three transfer 
programs through which the federal government provides support to 
the provinces for health care and other social programs.  The 
other two programs are territorial formula financing and 
equalization.  Equalization is the subject of today's debate. 
Today the federal government transfers approximately $40 billion 
to the provinces and territories through these three programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the equalization program is to ensure that less 
prosperous provinces can provide reasonably comparable public 
programs and services to their residents without their taxes 
being out of line with those of more affluent provinces. 
Equalization has played an important role in defining the 
Canadian federation since it was established in 1957.  In many 
ways it expresses the generous spirit of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program is unique among federal transfers in that its 
objective was enshrined in the Canadian constitution in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution states as follows: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament and the Government of Canada are committed to the 
principle of making equalization payments to ensure that 
provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide 
reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably 
comparable levels of taxation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is also unique in that it was one of the very few 
programs not touched during the period when the government was 
struggling to bring order to the nation's finances.  This 
reaffirmed the importance the government attaches to the program 
as part of the essential fabric of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments are unconditional and provinces can spend 
the money as they see fit.  In 2000-01 the seven receiving 
provinces, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, received payments 
totalling $10.8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the program has grown by 33% or $2.7 billion.  This 
rate of growth of the program demonstrates clearly that the 
government understands what equalization means to receiving 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the estimates, which are updated twice a year, the 
program is now at its highest level ever.  Over the same period, 
other non-transfer program spending has grown by 2.6%.  The 
latest estimates released in February by the finance minister 
show that payments to receiving provinces will be about $1.8 
billion higher than estimated last October.  These higher figures 
are due in large part to the exceptionally strong growth over the 
last two years in Ontario, one of the non-receiving provinces, 
not to the poor economic performance of receiving provinces. 
Those economies have been improving each year.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 27, 2001, the Minister of Finance announced that 
there would be an immediate increase in equalization payments of 
approximately one billion dollars.  Of this amount, $52 million 
is for 1999-2000 and $955 million is for 2000-01. The other $800 
million is the additional funding that will be provided to 
receiving provinces through passage of the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress also, as I did during the second reading 
debate, that the equalization program is reviewed on an ongoing 
basis by federal and provincial officials to ensure that 
differences in the abilities of provinces to raise revenues are 
measured as accurately as possible.  Those discussions are under 
way as we speak.  In addition, the program is renewed 
legislatively every five years, most recently in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A province's capacity to provide public services obviously 
depends on how its economy is performing.  Equalization payments 
therefore are based on a formula that measures the relative 
performance of provincial economies.  The formula applies in the 
same way to all provinces and adjusts automatically in response 
to economic developments in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a province's economy is booming relative to other 
provinces, its equalization payments automatically decline under 
the formula.  Conversely, when a province's economy and therefore 
its fiscal capacity, or ability to generate revenues, decline 
relative to other provinces, its equalization payments 
automatically increase.  In this way the program acts as an 
automatic stabilizer of provincial government revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge hon. members to keep in mind that individual 
provinces do not receive the same amount of equalization because 
they do not have the same economic circumstances.  This year, for 
example, Saskatchewan needs $230 per person to be brought up to 
the equalization standard, while Newfoundland requires $2,000 per 
person.  Equalization payments are also subject to ceiling and 
floor provisions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The capping provision, which has been applied in only 5 of the 
last 20 years, enables the program to grow at a rate that the 
federal government can sustain.  By setting a maximum payment 
level, this provision ensures that the program does not grow at 
an abnormally fast rate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The floor provision is the flip side of this coin.  It provides 
the provinces with protection against large and sudden decreases 
in equalization payments that would otherwise be warranted by the 
straightforward application of the formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization ceiling does not cut entitlements, as some have 
suggested.  Rather, the ceiling allows the program's growth to 
mirror the rate of growth in the economy and to grow at a 
sustainable rate.  Based on the forecast for GDP growth in last 
October's economic statement and budget update, the ceiling will 
rise to $12.5 billion in the year 2003-04. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to turn to the specific bill we are debating 
today, which lifts the equalization ceiling for the 1999-2000 
fiscal year and only for that year.  As I explained earlier, 
lifting the ceiling fulfils the commitment made by the Prime 
Minister last September at the first ministers meeting.  The 
final communiqué released at the end of the meeting states that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister agreed to take the necessary steps to ensure 
that no ceiling will apply to the 1999-2000 fiscal year. 
Thereafter, the established equalization formula will apply, 
which allows the program to grow up to the rate of growth of GDP. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the final cost of lifting the ceiling will not be known 
until the fall of 2002 when the final estimates for 1999-2000 
become available, it is currently estimated to be $792 million.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That amount will be allocated among the seven eligible provinces 
on a per capita basis.  In order to determine the payment that 
will go to each, the per capita amount is multiplied by the 
total population of each receiving province. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each eligible province will receive an additional $67 per 
person.  Viewed another way, here is the total breakdown per 
province.  Newfoundland will receive $36 million.  Prince Edward 
Island will be eligible for $10 million.  Nova Scotia will 
qualify for $62 million.  New Brunswick will receive $50 million. 
Quebec will receive $489 million.  Manitoba's payment will be $76 
million.  Saskatchewan will receive $69 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government realizes that not all parts of the 
country can generate the same revenues to finance public 
services.  Federal transfers therefore help ensure two things: 
first, that important programs are adequately funded, and second, 
that all Canadians receive reasonably comparable levels of public 
services regardless of where they live.  Bill C-18 contributes to 
achieving these goals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It underscores the priority the government places on 
equalization and helps ensure that the receiving provinces 
continue to have resources to provide the services their people 
need and want. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, it fulfils the Prime Minister's commitment to lift the 
equalization ceiling for the year 1999-2000, which means more 
money for receiving provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 continues the tradition of fairness through which 
equalization has been delivered for over 40 years.  I encourage 
all members to support the bill and pass it without delay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-18 on behalf 
of the constituents of Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I want to make it absolutely clear that the 
Canadian Alliance believes in the concept of equalization.  We 
believe in the concept that from coast to coast all Canadians 
should be receiving equal services.  The Canadian Alliance 
strongly supports the equalization method of ensuring that a 
quality standard of living applies across our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we certainly do have a problem with the way it is 
handled, the way the equalization formula is applied, and the way 
the Alliance feels it is used by the government to score 
political points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, at this time I wish to advise you that I will be 
splitting my time with my colleague from Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill takes away the ceiling and increases the money 
requested by the provinces.  We believe that the equalization 
system should serve the longer term purpose of equalizing 
economic opportunity and autonomy in all regions and should not 
create incentives for perverse economic policies on the part of 
provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lifting of the cap is a one time ad hoc reaction that fails 
to address the bigger and longer term problems and it was 
promised for purely political reasons.  It may be good politics 
but it definitely begs the question, is it a good policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this one time band aid solution is even being 
proposed indicates the need for an open discourse in parliament 
to review the equalization program.  The bill is part of a 
political effort to make up for the Liberal government's 
irresponsible $23 billion or 35% cut in health care funding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the first ministers conference the government agreed to 
increase the CHST but it never restored it to 1995 levels.  As a 
result, the provinces requested more money to address health care 
issues.  Therefore, the crisis was brought about by this 
government in the first place when it cut the CHST.  In order to 
balance that out and look good, the government said it would 
commit $792 million to the provinces.  That was because of its 
own shortfall in not raising the CHST transfers, as agreed at the 
first ministers conference, to the 1995 levels.  What we have is 
the government trying to play politics by trying to lift up the 
ceiling to address the issue, which originally it failed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has indicated why there is a 
necessity for a ceiling and we agree.  Otherwise it will spiral 
out of control.  We saw during election time the money given to 
the supposed future contender for the Prime Minister's office, 
the Minister of Industry, when he received more money in 
equalization payments just prior to the election so he would look 
good in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret across the nation that when the government cut 
the CHST it started a health care crisis, a crisis from coast to 
coast.  In my own riding we heard stories from people who came in 
to tell us what the cuts had done to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the federal government has the Canada Health 
Act.  We agree with the Canada Health Act, but the government 
uses it as a stick to the provinces, saying “this is how health 
care services must be delivered”.  On the other hand, the 
government took away the purse.  It is supposed to give money to 
the provinces to administer their rules in the way they feel they 
should be addressing the health care issues.  This is a 
contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in agreement with the five principles of the health act. 
As a matter of fact, we tried to put in a sixth principle, stable 
funding for health care, so that provinces do not in the future 
have to play games with governments that one morning decide to 
cut health care but will not make any changes to the Canada 
Health Act or will not give the provinces the leeway to see how 
they can deliver the services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The merits or demerits of how the provinces are going to deliver 
services or whether they will be private will be left to the 
Canadian public to decide.  As we have stated, we are not in 
favour of a two tier health care system.  As the government of 
Alberta has said quite clearly under its bill 11, it needs more 
innovative ways to deliver health care services because it does 
not have the money, the money that the government cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cut this money and then said it had balanced the 
budget, leaving the provinces to handle how they were going to 
deliver the services.  As we all know, as the population 
increases the demand on health care grows stronger.  Our own 
health care critic, my colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill, will be 
leaving shortly for Europe to study how the system there is 
delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care report we are receiving for Canada is that for 
the amount of money we put in, the end product, the delivery of 
services, is not that efficient.  Therefore it needs to be 
addressed.  As a matter of fact I saw today in a report that the 
premier of Ontario has been saying that he needs more money and 
that the surplus the government has should be given to health 
care.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in the provinces is demanding that.  Canadians who have 
been using health care services are demanding a better system. 
Health care workers, with their shortage of nurses, doctors and 
patients are all demanding a better system because health care is 
failing.  This all started because the government cut the funding 
for health care.  It did that in 1995.  Even when the government 
tried to bring the funding back up, even when it had the first 
ministers conference, it was not brought up to 1995 levels. There 
is also the factor of inflation and all these other things. When 
we add up all those figures and include the expansion and growth 
of services that is needed, the transfer of money from health 
care is bigger than what is indicated in the figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, we receive numerous calls from people 
who use health care services about how much trouble they have 
getting services.  I am sure members on the government side do as 
well.  Those who are rich are demanding that we do something 
because they have the money to get those services from the U.S.A. 
and it is not the right thing to do when we are supposed to have 
a public health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government turns a blind eye to that and trumpets about its 
past when health care was good.  Yes, it was good in the past, 
but the demands were there before the cuts.  The Minister of 
Health keeps saying that our health care system is good.  He has 
tunnel vision.  He closes his eyes and then stands up and huffs 
and puffs in parliament and tells us he is for a public health 
care system and that the government will maintain the five 
principles of Canada health care.  He keeps saying these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all fine and dandy, but he forgets to tell us that the 
finance minister keeps cutting the funding.  Of course, he is not 
the one who is implementing the delivery of health care services. 
It is being delivered by the provinces and the provinces are 
asking how they will deliver these services when the federal 
government cuts funding for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the CHST there is an agreement.  The federal government gives 
money to the provinces through the CHST.  The government says it 
has addressed this issue.  Has it really?  No, it absolutely has 
not addressed this issue, because we read in the newspapers and 
hear from our television stations that the provinces are still 
having difficulties and want innovative solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the government woke up.  Now we have a commission to 
look into health care, headed by the former premier of 
Saskatchewan, Mr. Romanow, which I think started two days ago.  I 
must say it was good for Premier Klein and Premier Mike Harris to 
say they want everything on the table.  I am very happy to hear 
that Mr. Romanow has said he would put everything on the table. 
Finally we have somebody to look into the whole situation and see 
how we can best deliver health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the equalization issue, I need to repeat that we 
in our party are in support of equalization, because we believe 
that all Canadians from coast to coast should enjoy a comparable 
quality and level of important government services.  However, we 
have a problem, as usual, with the way things are handled by the 
government.  Our opposition to the bill is not based on 
disagreement with the equalization principle but more on the way 
it is being handled, the way it is done, because we do not think 
this is the most effective way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Does the member have 
unanimous consent to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to enter this debate.  I 
hope that in the discourse of the debate the hon. parliamentary 
secretary will take back certain messages to the Minister of 
Finance, because I do want to introduce certain things in the 
debate that I think he would be very well advised to take to the 
Minister of Finance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague who just spoke emphasized, the Canadian 
Alliance is not opposed to equalization payments.  These payments 
are absolutely fundamental because we have provinces with varying 
economic development.  Some are very wealthy and others are not 
as wealthy and there is a way in which we can equalize that.  We 
certainly agree that provinces should not be penalized because 
their economies are in trouble or because they do not have some 
of the natural resource bases and so on.  They should still be 
able to provide programs and services that are roughly comparable 
to those of other provinces.  We agree with that principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not so much that.  I want to deal with the way in 
which the legislation has been introduced.  The first problem is 
that the legislation is actually retroactive legislation.  I 
think that is really bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister have committed 
the expenditure of funds without the parliamentary authority to 
do so.  That is an insult to the hon. members on this side of the 
House and to colleagues on the other side of the House.  We are 
here to look after the finances of our country and to find the 
best possible way to disburse funds across the various provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also would like to take issue with the way in which the hon. 
parliamentary secretary almost blew up his chest in a bragging 
sort of way as to what a wonderful thing the government had done 
by increasing the CHST transfers, as if the government given to 
the provinces something that was new and additional to what they 
had before.  The problem with what he said, and with what the 
Minister of Finance said before him, is that somehow this does 
not even replace what was taken away.  What kind of situation is 
it when the government asks people if they are not happy to be 
given $21 billion and then says, guess what, though, $22 billion 
has been taken away?  It is absolutely reverse logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us are parents and give a child an allowance of $5.  Let 
us say that one year when things are not so good we take away $2, 
giving the child an allowance of $3.  The next year we tell him 
we are going to restore the allowance.  What is the first thing 
the child thinks?  The child thinks he is going to get $5, but we 
only give him $4 and call it a restoration of his allowance.  It 
is not.  That is what has happened here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to be very careful about the way in which we 
create the message.  Let us tell the truth in the way it ought to 
be said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary said some very interesting 
things about the equalization formula.  That was very good.  Our 
listeners need to know how the equalization formula works. 
Unfortunately we do not have the time to go into the details of 
the formula to see exactly how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very interesting quirks within the formula 
itself.  It does not always produce the same results even though 
one would think that putting the same numbers into it would 
produce similar results.  The bases that are used in the formula 
for various provinces depend to a large degree on what the end 
result is on the equalization payments.  That is why we have some 
disparities within the formula itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have the time now to get into those details, but the 
hon. member will know that this is in fact the case and that he 
should go back to the Department of Finance and work through some 
of those details so that the bases used in calculating the amount 
of equalization payments are comparable, fair and equal across 
the provinces, that it is adjusted in the way it should be. There 
is an adjustment mechanism in there, but I do not think it is 
adequate at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point we want to register at this stage is that we 
need to recognize that this is the lifting of a ceiling for one 
year.  That is the assurance we are given.  I do not know how 
many of us here in the House have ever experienced a situation 
like this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1145
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a ceiling is lifted what is the expectation for next year? 
The expectation seems to be that we would reach that ceiling 
again.  What appears to have been a ceiling becomes a minimum or 
an expectation.  I am very fearful that is exactly what will 
happen in this case.  The ceiling this year will be increased by 
about $800 million then next year the pressure will be on to do 
it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the CHST transfers that have taken place. This 
is a government program that transfers money for health and 
social services to the provinces.  It is very clearly designated 
as a special plan and usually deals with welfare, education and 
health.  These are the three big areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These transfers are designed to do a particular job.  The 
government now has an equalization formula, and the argument is 
made that it will help some of the provinces.  When the agreement 
was made with the premiers, they said they wanted the 
equalization formula to be such that the ceiling would rise so 
they could subsidize the transfers of the CHST.  That is the 
practical impact of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the government is paying twice for the same thing 
under two different titles.  That is wrong because it misleads 
Canadians into thinking the CHST transfers are adequate and that 
the equalization payments are there for everything else when in 
fact that is not what happens.  We have to be careful that we 
tell the truth in these and other matters.  The government needs 
to recognize these particular issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I want to make is that the government needs to 
be a trustee of public funds.  When this amount of money is given 
away, it makes us question whether the role of the government is 
to simply see how much money it can extricate from taxpayers and 
then give it away when asked for more.  Is that the role of 
government?  I do not think so.  The government should treat 
public funds as a trust which it is managing on behalf of its 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this connection that I will refer to something I would 
like the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance 
to take to the minister.  It has to do with a letter that I 
received from one of my constituents, which said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Schmidt:  I am returning a cheque for $125 made out to my 
mother.  I am sure you must be receiving many such cheques.  I am 
sure you must agree it is ridiculous the way the Federal 
Government has distributed these funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother died in October 2000 and prior to that lived in an 
extended care nursing facility for the preceding 10 years.  I 
cannot even imagine how much of the taxpayers dollars have been 
needlessly wasted. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may ask what is the point of this.  The lady died in 
October 2000.  On January 31, 2001, she received a cheque 
representing the relief for heating expenses which was a fully 
funded initiative of the federal government.  It was a special 
one time tax repayment to low and modest income individuals and 
families to ease the burden of high heating expenses.  This lady 
had not paid heating expenses for at least 10 years and she died 
in October 2000.  Four months later she received a cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cheque stub said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have determined that you are eligible to receive an amount of 
$125 to provide relief for heating expenses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On what basis was this determination made?  It clearly was not 
made on the basis that she was alive.  Was it made on the basis 
that she was dead?  Was it made on the basis that she was in a 
home care facility for 10 years?  Was it made on the basis of her 
son or daughter?  On what basis was it made?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I was listening to the hon. member talk about the home 
heating oil rebate.  I fail to see the relevance to the 
equalization formula in the bill before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  As the hon. members 
know, there is a lot of flexibility in terms of what can be said 
or referred to within the context of debate in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
secretary for raising the question.  I think it emphasizes the 
point I was just making before I proceeded to refer to the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested to him and to all members opposite, in particular 
those in the government, that we must consider public funds, the 
taxpayer dollars that we collect, as a trust that we manage on 
their behalf.  We ought to do so with integrity, with the best 
judgment and intentions so it meets the needs of our people in 
Canada.  That is what we ought to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am suggesting with this particular example is that this 
does not demonstrate careful analysis.  It does not demonstrate 
acting in the best interests of Canadians.  It does not 
demonstrate either that it is helping this woman.  What do we do 
about this lady who is in the grave?  What is she going to do 
with $125?  She cannot even cash the cheque.  That is the point I 
am trying to make.  I think we really have to register these 
kinds of concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to look at exactly what the bill would do.  The 
bill would remove the $10 billion ceiling on the 1999 
equalization payments and would add about $800 million worth of 
funding for the seven provinces that qualify for transfers: 
Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That equalization program has already indicated that it is 
designed so that these provinces can offer roughly the same level 
of public services in health and education, for example, as other 
wealthier provinces without imposing excessively high rates.  The 
bill was designed in accordance with the agreement that was made 
last fall between the Prime Minister and the first ministers of 
the various provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to recognize that in the equalization formula we 
want to be careful that it is not manipulated in such a way that 
it benefits some provinces at the expense of other provinces. 
That can happen.  We need to be very careful about that.  We 
would strongly support a re-examination of that equalization 
formula itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, we want to recognize that we need to address the 
bigger, long term problems that were promised.  Promises seem to 
be such a vacuous thing for the government.  It seems almost as 
if it can promise one thing and do another, or totally ignore the 
problem or, in some cases, even deny the problem and vote 
opposite to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the government did that with the appointment of an 
ethics counsellor.  It said an ethics counsellor would be 
appointed by parliament, report to parliament and would advise on 
the ethics of ministers and the Prime Minister in particular. 
What happened?  We took the government at its word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed a motion in the House and said that the ethics 
counsellor should be appointed by parliament.  In fact we took 
the exact words out of the promise book.  Guess what?  Every 
Liberal in the House voted against that motion.  It makes one 
wonder about the integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Except for the few that did not show up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  That is not what I said.  My hon. 
colleague said that members who did not show up did not vote 
against it.  That is true.  However they may as well have because 
they were not here.  The only votes that count are those who are 
here.  Integrity is in question in either case.  First, members 
should have been here to vote because that was what they were 
elected to do.  Second, the government did not do what it had 
promised to do in the red book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government actually going to evaluate and re-examine the 
equalization formula?  Is it in fact going to be fair or is it 
going to operate in such a way that it can be manipulated and can 
change the way in which moneys are distributed?  These are very 
serious questions, which I think need to be addressed and need to 
be dealt with very quickly and efficiently.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to stop my remarks at this particular point and 
emphasize that we support equalization payments, that the formula 
for equalization has to be re-examined and that to lift the 
ceiling at this time is probably not the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we are going to oppose this particular bill but not 
for the reason that we do not like equalization payments.  We 
like equalization payments.  We want them, we need them and 
Canada needs to support them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity this morning to speak on 
this bill before us which deals with amendments to the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, or more accurately to 
deal with the inadequacy of the amendments to the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the way to dealing with the subject, I must say it was a bit 
like listening to two Sauls being converted on the road to 
Damascus when I heard the Alliance members singing the praises of 
equalization, of transfer payments and beating up on the federal 
government for having introduced such drastic unilateral cuts in 
1995 for which the people of Canada, particularly the people in 
the seven have not provinces, are continuing to pay a terrible 
price today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say like two Sauls on the road to Damascus undergoing 
conversion?  No voice, no force, no power in this House worked 
harder than the Reform Party, now reincarnated as the Alliance 
Party, in trying to bring about the very kind of drastic cuts 
that were introduced by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, let me clearly say that I and my party do not 
accept the notion that the Liberal Party should automatically, 
through force, implement the mean-spirited destructive policies 
represented by the Alliance.  Yet that is exactly what it has 
done in recent years.  It is absolutely clear that, not only the 
have not provinces but an overwhelming majority of Canadians, 
regardless of the party they represent, also do not accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I neglected to say at the outset, that I intend 
to split my time.  I would ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to split my time with the member from Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
co-operation from members.  I was so exorcised and frankly 
dismayed at the hypocrisy reflected by some of the previous 
comments that I was distracted from making that point at the 
outset.  I do appreciate their co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say at the outset that a fair formula for equalization 
is critically important to the constituents I represent, the 
people of Halifax.  More than that it is critically important to 
citizens who live in and throughout the four Atlantic provinces, 
as well as citizens in the provinces of Quebec, Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go further than that.  I do not believe it is only the 
people who are on the punishing end of the measures taken by the 
federal government to artificially have equalization payments who 
care about this issue.  I think what it means to be Canadian is 
to subscribe to a fair equalization formula capable of 
establishing not just the words to express it but the reality of 
Canadians, regardless of where they live, being eligible for a 
roughly comparable level of services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is about ensuring that we do not experience a 
growing gap between those who have and those who have not, as it 
relates to individual citizens and regions.  That growing gap is 
very alarming and is causing real strains in the lives of people, 
their families, their communities and inter-regionally, as a 
result of the government turning its back on a fundamentally 
important principle.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say very clearly at the outset the position of the New 
Democratic Party.  It has been championed by a succession of New 
Democrats in the House, but none more effectively than my 
colleague, the finance critic from Regina—Qu'Appelle.  He has 
been a faithful, inveterate champion of the importance of a fair 
equalization formula throughout the 30 years he has served the 
constituents of his own community and all Canadians who believe 
in the fairness a proper equalization formula represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very heart of our concerns about the bill before us and 
the inadequacy of the amendments is the fact that there is an 
artificial limit on equalization payments that will be reinstated 
in the year that is now upon us.  As far as we and fair minded 
Canadians are concerned the cap on equalization must be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the government needs to be reminded at every opportunity 
that Canada has a constitutional obligation to ensure that 
provincial transfers are set high enough so that all provinces 
have the capacity to serve the public interest and to ensure that 
the basic needs of the residents of all provinces are met.  For 
historical, legal and moral reasons this must be the principal 
goal of the equalization plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan as it stands fails to achieve the goal.  I listened to 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance say what 
the bill is about.  It would ensure that the objective of roughly 
comparable levels and quality of services is achieved for all 
Canadians.  If the cap on equalization payments is reimposed then 
it is absolutely clear the objective he stated in the House this 
morning simply cannot be met.  Not only can it not be met.  It 
will not be met.  The government has turned a deaf ear to the 
pleadings that the cap not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot possibly imagine that the parliamentary secretary, 
the finance minister and the Prime Minister do not understand 
that objective cannot be met.  One has to go further and say that 
they do not intend that constitutional obligation and that 
important principle to be met by the provisions in the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act amendments before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Liberal government has absolutely decimated fiscal 
transfers to the provinces, undermining the national interest and 
in the process destroying the very moral authority needed by a 
federal government that professes to believe in the concept of 
roughly comparable services being available to all citizens of 
Canada regardless of where they happen to live and regardless of 
the state of finances of their respective provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the federal government shows great surprise and is actually 
puffed up with indignation when a province like Alberta 
introduces bill 11, when a province like Ontario is as bold as we 
saw the premier being this week when he talked about going 
further into privatization and turning our health care system 
into a commercialized operation, one based on the notion that 
profits will be extracted from people's illnesses and 
misfortunes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot repeat too often the fundamental flaw in the fiscal 
arrangements act that is now before us.  Bill C-18 seeks to 
remove from the fiscal year starting April 1, 1999, the ceiling 
that would otherwise apply to equalization payments, but the bill 
then reimposes that ceiling for the year 2000-01. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it is worthy of note that all 10 Canadian provinces are 
in agreement.  They want the federal government to remove the cap 
on equalization.  Even the provinces that are in the have 
category, that are the net contributors to equalization payments, 
agree that it does damage to the fabric of the nation and that it 
erodes the quality and comparability of services to people in the 
have not provinces to artificially impose and maintain that limit 
on equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic provinces and Manitoba asked the government very 
effectively before the finance committee last week that if it 
will not make a commitment to remove the cap, to remove it 
permanently, it should at the very least rebase the ceiling on 
equalization to the higher level of $10.79 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finance ministers from all five of those provinces made their 
case this week before the finance committee and did so very 
effectively.  However the government, the Minister of Finance and 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance have 
turned a deaf ear to the concerns of those finance ministers and 
the people whom their governments represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of finance for Manitoba stated it very well.  He 
said that the equalization program should be allowed to do its 
job by lifting the ceiling as a preferred point.  As an 
accommodation it should be rebased to the level to which it grew 
in the year the ceiling was lifted, 1999-2000.  That would offer 
much needed support to the provinces that are still reeling from 
massive unilateral cuts to transfer payments by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must use a 10 province standard to ensure a truly 
equalized equalization formula and, more important, the concrete 
outcome the equalization formula is intended to achieve.  The 
federal government has so drastically cut CHST transfers to the 
provinces, strangling their ability to adequately fund health 
care and post-secondary education, that when Harris and Klein 
started down their privatization track the federal government was 
not in a very strong position to defend the Canada Health Act or 
did not seem to want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not have to be very insightful, and I do not think it 
is cynical, to suggest that in the process of weakening the 
commitment to comparable services across the country and of 
engaging in massive cuts to transfer payments that enable 
provinces to deliver health care, education and fundamentally 
important social welfare services the people need, the federal 
government knew it was destroying public confidence, absolutely 
eroding public confidence in the important public services 
Canadians depend upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the federal government must immediately restore funding 
to CHST transfers to the provinces.  It has invested a pittance 
into infrastructure and transportation, causing delays of much 
needed essential repairs to transportation infrastructure in 
every part of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has abandoned its federal constitutional 
responsibilities for far too long.  It should recommit on every 
front to ensuring that provincial governments achieve the goal 
enshrined in the constitution that goes to the very heart of the 
kind of country we say we want to be, the kind of country that 
with considerable success we were becoming.  That was recognized 
by others around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we fail to do that we are not only letting down the people 
who need and depend upon those services, but we are striking a 
blow to the very concept of Canada which means so much to people 
in this country and people around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's actions speak to an attitude of indifference 
toward the real needs of Canadians.  It is not too unduly harsh 
to say that the government is arrogant and out of touch with the 
real needs of Canadians, particularly in the less advantaged 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government introduced its throne speech it completely 
failed to address the fundamental issue of ensuring some 
semblance of comparability of services to every citizen in 
Canada.  At the time I raised a question on recognition and 
commitment from the government to deal with the problem posed by 
an unfair equalization formula, one that makes it virtually 
impossible for governments in have not provinces to make progress 
because of the excessive clawback of resources from offshore 
development, for example, that may now give an opportunity to 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland to move out of the have not status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On every front it seems that the government, not the people of 
Canada, has given up on the Canadian dream.  When a government 
stops dreaming, when a government abandons something as 
fundamentally important and changes an equalization formula to 
artificially restrict the capability of provincial governments to 
deliver on that dream, it should examine what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many elements to the battle to try to get the Canadian 
government once again to believe in that fundamentally important 
dream.  I can speak from a Halifax perspective of what it means 
to the citizens of my community to have the federal government 
quite cynically make a decision to remove the cap for one year 
and then turn around and reimpose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak about it from the point of view of what it means for 
citizens not to be able to get the health care they require, from 
the point of view of students unable to afford an education, or 
from the point of view of what it does to the lives of students 
if they go into debt to the level necessary to gain a 
post-secondary education these days.  In a very real way it 
becomes a double jeopardy situation for the government to 
artificially cap equalization payments and to pull back on 
transfer payments.  It becomes an out migration policy in effect 
of people going to the wealthier parts of Canada from the have 
not regions.

Canada we as parliamentarians are supposed to be here building 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I implore the government to consider that what is 
a very small matter in terms of the text of this fiscal 
arrangements bill is a very fundamental matter that will have 
massive consequences if equalization payments are to be 
artificially constrained by the continuation of the cap in the 
year 2001.  I ask the government to reverse itself and agree that 
the artificial cap should be removed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to say a few words in this debate before the 
House today as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider this one of the most fundamental parts of Canadian 
federalism.  We have had fiscal federal-provincial programs going 
back to the forties and fifties.  Back in the days of Pierre 
Trudeau, 1968-69, we had the department of regional economic 
expansion and equalization payments being expanded and made 
part of our law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big turning point came in 1981 with the patriation of the 
Canadian constitution.  It was decided then to make equalization 
payments part of our constitutional make-up. I think that was 
extremely important because we recognized that in our unique 
federation, which is one of the most decentralized federations in 
the world, we needed some way of equalizing conditions between 
people in all parts of the country.  We needed some way of 
equalizing the fiscal ability to have comparable services for 
health care, education and farm support programs from one 
province to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have great inequities between the provinces and the regions 
because of our constitution and because of our resources.  We 
also have great disparities.  We have three provinces, Ontario, 
Alberta and British Columbia, that have been better off 
historically than the other seven provinces which have 
historically drawn funds from equalization payments. 
Saskatchewan, my province, is one of those provinces that has 
usually drawn equalization payments but, from time to time, has 
had an economy where the growth rate was high enough that it did 
not receive those payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think part of the Confederation bargain was to support a 
program like equalization.  However, the government removed the 
cap on equalization, which was $10 billion for the year 
1999-2000.  In terms of payments, it went from $10 billion to 
almost $10.8 billion.  That was done, coincidentally, before the 
last election campaign.  What a coincidence.  The Prime Minister 
made the announcement to take off the cap and then dropped the 
writ.  He wanted to win more seats in Atlantic Canada, in 
Manitoba and in Saskatchewan.  What did the government do next? 
It reinstated the cap.  There was no election.  The cap went back 
on again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the ministers of finance from Manitoba and the four 
Atlantic provinces were before committee they told us that they 
did not want the cap on, or, at the very least, that the base 
go from $10 billion to $10.8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the Prime Minister made a commitment to 
take the cap off.  It is also interesting that all 10 provincial 
finance ministers said to take the cap off.  With a surplus 
predicted to be around $15 billion to $17 billion for the fiscal 
year, we now have the fiscal flexibility.  A minister's statement 
will be coming out in a couple of weeks.  We will be able to 
handle greater equalization payments to equalize conditions 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all that evidence, when we moved amendments in the 
finance committee a couple of days ago the parliamentary 
secretary would not entertain any idea of amendments.  Of course 
the committee itself cannot produce a ways and means motion to 
amend the act.  However, the committee suggested that the 
minister bring an amendment before the House at report stage to 
raise the cap from $10 billion to $10.8 billion.  Even 
that timid suggestion was turned down by the 
parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an irony of ironies—and I think this was reported in some of 
the Atlantic papers—my friend from the Bloc Quebecois moved an 
amendment asking the minister to consider the possibility 
and the wisdom of perhaps some day considering raising the cap. 
However, even that was turned down by the parliamentary secretary 
as being too radical.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is some serious parliamentary reform.  The 
committees need to have more independence to suggest what is 
right for Canadian people.  The committee I was talking about was 
told by all the ministers of finance from the Atlantic provinces 
and Manitoba that the cap should be gone or that it should at 
least be rebased at $10.8 billion instead of $10 billion per 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the committees are not given independence, we will have 
growing inequalities between the have and have not regions.  We 
will have growing inequalities in terms of health care services, 
education and social services.  We will have growing inequalities 
in terms of the taxation burden on Alberta and, for example, New 
Brunswick and many other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the constitution, Alberta is very blessed and 
fortunate to have all kinds of oil and gas.  In fact, this will 
be an interesting problem in terms of fiscal federalism in the 
future because Alberta, with the development of the tar sands, 
has more gas and oil than Saudi Arabia.  It will be an 
interesting situation to deal with in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fathers of Confederation did not foresee this kind of wealth 
in gas, oil and many other resources.  The rights to these 
resources have now been turned over to the provinces.  I support 
the provinces' right to have jurisdiction over gas and oil but I 
also believe it is the fundamental right of the federal 
government to have an equalization program that redistributes 
wealth in order to have a greater equality of conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the problems we will be facing in the future. 
Alberta's tremendous oil wealth, which will be more than Saudi 
Arabia's oil wealth, will be a very difficult issue to deal with 
because it will create tremendous inequities between two or three 
of the Atlantic provinces and, indeed, much of the provinces of 
Quebec, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  One of the ways we could deal 
with it is through the constitutional idea back in 1981 which 
called for equalization payments to be enshrined in the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By implication, that would force the federal government to make 
generous enough payments, which would be in accordance with our 
fiscal capabilities, to ensure equality of condition for every 
Canadian.  It would not matter whether one lived in Corner Brook, 
Newfoundland or Calgary, Alberta, everyone would have the same 
opportunity to send their kids to school, to get a decent 
education and to receive decent health care.  That is the basic 
philosophy behind equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the Alliance Party people criticizing the government's 
involvement in all kinds of different programs and talking about 
massive cutbacks.  The Alliance Party agenda calling for cutbacks 
and cutbacks, has had a great impact on the country and one that 
has spooked the Liberal Party.  It has spooked the Minister of 
Finance and the Prime Minister, and has made the parliamentary 
secretary pale with fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, in particular, there were massive cutbacks in 
government spending like we had never seen from a Conservative 
government any time in the history of this country, going back to 
R. B. Bennett in the 1930s.  In fact, it makes my Conservative 
friends over here look like raving socialists in comparison to 
what we saw across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  My Tory friend from Newfoundland said 
“we are”.  In comparison to the Liberals, they certainly are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had massive cutbacks in 1995.  The Liberals were pushed, 
prodded and poked by the Reform Party which was basically 
anti-government and anti-public program in terms of creating any 
kind of equality of condition.  The former Reform Party and now 
the Alliance Party stood for that and the government has picked 
up its agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to turn the corner.  We must now attack the human 
deficit, the people deficit, in terms of more social spending and 
more equality in our taxation system, and we have the capability 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Alliance people would lead us to believe that equalization 
means that the taxes of Alberta go directly to the people of 
Newfoundland.  That is anything but the truth.  The equalization 
payment comes from the consolidated revenue fund of taxes 
collected across the board by the federal government and then 
given out to the poorer provinces to create equality of 
condition.  The Alliance objects to this by trying to heckle us 
on the idea of equality, justice and fairness.  It wants a system 
where the rich get richer and the powerful get more powerful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance wants a flat tax, an idea that has been rejected by 
the Bush republicans in the United States.  Those are the kinds 
of ideas that cater to the wealthy, the rich and the privileged. 
No wonder the Alliance Party is in trouble with Canadians from 
one part of Canada to the other.

Their ideas are outdated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time in the debate to tell the government across the way 
not to be spooked by those sitting across from it, to do the 
right thing, and to do what the provincial ministers of finance 
have said, including the ministers of finance from Alberta, 
British Columbia and Ontario.  They have all said to increase 
equalization.  They have all said to get rid of the cap, or 
re-base the cap from $10 billion to $10.8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of Canada said that before the election 
campaign.  The four Atlantic provinces have come here asking for 
it, as well as Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  If we do not do it we 
will have greater inequalities, greater inequities between the 
regions and more people living in poverty and lining up at food 
banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that if we do what we should do as a parliament, 
we must make sure we have equality of condition for the common 
good, so that a child in the north, the prairies, Alberta, 
Newfoundland or Quebec has exactly the same opportunity as a 
child anywhere else in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would once again like to plead with the parliamentary 
secretary across the way to speak with his government and to come 
back before the House with a ways and means motion to amend the 
equalization bill before us, or at least, in the financial 
statement coming down in two weeks where there will be a 
budgetary surplus of $15 billion to $17 billion, to make sure 
that as part of that financial statement there will be an 
increase in equalization payments in order to treat every single 
Canadian with fairness and justice regardless of where she or he 
may happen to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I can easily pick up on the comments made by the 
previous member because there is much on which we agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more with the member's remarks when he talked 
about federalism and what Canada was all about.  It is about 
sharing; sharing our wealth and sharing the blessings we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time many provinces do not as well as others.  Some 
provinces that are doing very well today were not doing well in 
the past.  One province I will point to is Alberta. Until Alberta 
struck oil it was doing just about as poorly as Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus so that the listening audience will have a sense 
of what we are talking about.  We are talking about the 
equalization formula and the government putting a cap on it. 
Equalization is an unconditional transfer of payment from the 
federal government to eligible provinces that is determined by a 
formula which takes into account numerous economic, demographic 
and fiscal indicators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, before I go any further, I will be sharing my time 
with the member for St. John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization formula was designed to make up for a 
province's inability to raise sufficient revenues from its own 
economy.  Equalization payments are made so provinces have 
sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of 
public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. That 
is quite important to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the poorer provinces, to maintain health care, 
education and all the other services that governments deliver, 
simply cannot do that on their own.  It is quite noticeable in my 
home province where equalization payments are the single largest 
source of revenue for the province of New Brunswick.  I think I 
am being accurate when I say that also applies to Prince Edward 
Island, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government arbitrarily, without consultation, 
takes off the cap or caps the payments, it creates a handicap for 
those provinces. 
Basically the government is taking away the very spirit of the 
Constitution Act of 1982, when it is guaranteed in our 
constitution that those payments will be there.  When those 
payments are capped, the cap results in a handicap for us in the 
poorer provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Manitoba and Saskatchewan, as the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough just mentioned to me, 
are also recipients.  In fact I will refer to my notes so this 
will be on the record.  Seven provinces are currently recipients 
of equalization payments, namely:  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, 
Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those payments are made by the federal government from federal 
revenue sources to which all taxpayers contribute.  It is not 
coming out of one pot of money.  It is coming out of general 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before my colleague from Newfoundland gets on his feet to drive 
home what I think is a more regional message—I may be mistaken 
on that, but I think it is—I do want to go through the history 
of equalization in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a long established practice in the country to share the 
wealth, so to speak.  I refer to an article written by Kenneth 
Norrie, Richard Simeon and Mark Krasnick entitled “Federalism 
and the Economic Union in Canada”.  It is a summary of major 
developments with respect to equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, this practice began in 1867, at the very birth 
of our country, in the BNA Act, with what were then called the 
BNA Act statutory subsidies, payments made to provinces in return 
for surrendering indirect taxes to Ottawa.  There was a formula 
already established, then, for having given up direct taxation. 
In 1940 that was renewed with what they called then the national 
adjustments grants, which were recommended by the Rowell-Sirois 
report.  These grants were paid on the basis of fiscal need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1957 there was another look at equalization.  The first 
formal equalization plan was established in 1957.  It was part of 
the 1957-62 fiscal arrangements.  The federal government at that 
time agreed to bring per capita yields from three standard taxes 
up to the average yield in the two wealthiest provinces, hence 
bringing us up to a higher level based on the prosperity of some 
of the other provinces that happened to be doing better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1958 there was another look at it, with increased 
equalization for personal income tax.  Again it was a trade-off. 
The provincial share of personal income taxes paid to the 
provinces increased from 10% to 13%.  This entered into the 
equalization formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1958 and 1961 there was another look at it.  The 
government came up with the Atlantic Provinces Adjustment Grants 
and Newfoundland Additional Grants Act, an act of parliament. 
Additional unconditional grants at that time to the Atlantic 
provinces were rationalized on the basis of the provinces' low 
fiscal capacity, in other words, not as much strength in their 
economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1962 we revisited again as a nation what was then called the 
1962-67 fiscal arrangements agreement.  Again the personal income 
tax share rose up to 16% in accordance with the tax arrangements 
and there was the introduction of 50% of the three year average 
of provincial revenues and taxes from natural resources.  The 
equalization standard was again reduced to the national average 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1962 to 1967 another look was taken at it.  The provinces 
acquired an increased share of personal income tax.  In 1964-65 
there were some changes to the natural resources act.  Then we 
move on to our centennial year and the federal government 
introduced the representative tax system of equalization.  In 
1972 the same thing occurred and that program was extended. 
An addition of three new tax sources brought the total level to 
19 tax sources at the time.  Revenues from these three tax 
sources, racetrack revenues, medical premiums and hospital 
premiums, were previously equalized under miscellaneous revenues. 
There were some changes there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1973-74 school purpose taxes were included.  In 1974-75 there 
was energy revenue modification.  In 1977 the equalization 
component of the Fiscal Arrangements Act was passed by 
parliament.  In 1981 Bill C-24 had two provisions:  withdrawal of 
the sale of crown leases category from the program and a personal 
income over-ride with no province eligible for equalization if 
its per capita personal income exceeded the national average 
level in the current preceding two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, various Liberal and Conservative governments were 
taking steps all along the way and provincial governments were 
doing the same thing in recognition of equalization and how 
important it was for the stability of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 a new tax source was added.  In the 1982-87 fiscal 
arrangements there was the new representative five province 
standard equalization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one minute left and will conclude by saying that April 
17, 1982 is a date every Canadian will remember.  That was the 
date of the new Constitution Act.  The new Constitution Act of 
1982 was struck, signed onto by the provinces and the prime 
minister at the time.  There was a provision in the act ensuring 
that equalization was enshrined in Canada's new constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a long and good history of sharing the wealth in our 
country.  I think the present government's position and attitude 
are very meanspirited.  I look forward to hearing the comments of 
the member for St. John's West, who will carry on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague the hon. member for 
New Brunswick Southwest spoke of Alberta and also referred to the 
study by Ken Norrie on federalism and the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure the hon. member that we Albertans know we 
are very fortunate at the moment and we do want to share our 
prosperity with people in Saskatchewan or New Brunswick and 
elsewhere.  I wonder how the hon. member feels this situation 
should be handled.  How do we encourage people who might be out 
of work in his province, say, to come to Alberta?  As I am sure 
he knows, we are very short of skilled people in Alberta and we 
would like to have more people come to our province to help with 
things like the tar sands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he also have a comment with respect to what a caring and 
sharing country should do in terms of a province that is at the 
moment having very high surpluses, as I am sure all the members 
know? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle spoke I did not hear an 
invitation for questions and comments.  We went straight to 
resuming debate.  I did not rise as a consequence.  Am I mistaken 
or was there a difference between the previous speaker and this 
speaker in terms of questions and comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Yes, my colleague, there 
is.  As you know, we have started third reading of this bill. The 
first three speakers are allowed 40 minutes with no questions and 
comments.  In this case, the New Democratic Party asked for 
unanimous consent to split its time so that it would have two 20 
minute periods instead of one 40 minute period.  That is why 
there were no questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as of the remarks of this first speaker, the hon. 
member for New Brunswick Southwest, there will be either 10 
minutes for questions and comments or 5 minutes for questions and 
comments if members indicate they wish to split their time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
minister's question in relation to Alberta, the rest of Canada 
and my home province of New Brunswick.  In fact, we do have a lot 
of young Canadians leaving the poorer provinces of Canada to seek 
work elsewhere.  We like to see that mobility, but obviously it 
does create a problem in some of our provinces.  We talk about 
the brain drain to the United States, but there is also a drain 
of talent from eastern Canada to western Canada.  We can 
understand that and we appreciate it.  We do not want to see any 
artificial barriers put up, and I know the minister himself would 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in terms of putting a cap on equalization, one of the 
arguments the premiers used, and I think successfully, is that we 
are doing our best and we are moving ahead, and we want that 
stability so we can continue to move ahead and build the 
infrastructure that is needed and build an economy back home that 
will allow our young people to stay there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, the government cannot give with one hand 
and take back with the other.  For example, in the equalization 
formula we have a connection between that and the CHST, the 
moneys that the federal government transfers to the provinces in 
the health and social transfer.  When it takes money out of that 
pot and pretends to put money in another one, nothing happens. 
There is a sort of balance in the sense that we are really not 
moving ahead.  Giving with one hand and taking away with the 
other would be the correct analogy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the truth is that governments should not be doing that, 
because they have to look at the overall picture.  To build good 
education systems, health care systems and a strong economy in 
New Brunswick, we need that little bit of help to get us going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a fair degree of economic growth in New Brunswick. 
The numbers that are coming out of Atlantic Canada are looking 
pretty good, because we have built on some of our successes and 
we want to continue to build on those successes.  We do not want 
to be penalized because we are succeeding, and that is really how 
we look upon this, as being penalized for succeeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is still very important to us in this 
country, and it has to take the lead.  We do not want to penalize 
anyone in this country for being successful, either on the tax 
end as an individual or on the giving end in terms of recipients 
of equalization.  We want to build on our strengths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that we would love to see a society where young 
Canadians would not have to leave their homes to seek work 
elsewhere, whether it is in the United States or some other part 
of Canada.  That would be a perfect world.  We will probably 
never achieve that, but let us not penalize the poorer provinces 
for the successes they are enjoying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is enjoying a fair amount of economic 
success over the last number of years.  Let it share that with 
the rest of Canada, because every single Canadian has paid into 
general revenues and those are the dollars that are being used to 
help support the poorer provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank my colleague from New Brunswick Southwest for sharing 
his time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to him explain how we arrived at the present process 
of equalization and I listened to the leader of the NDP Party and 
the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle.  I must say that the more I 
listen to people speak on the equalization process, the more I 
realize that we all agree the present system of assisting have 
not provinces, and I use those words very loosely, is not 
working.  We all agree it is not working.  We all agree there are 
better ways of doing it.  Many of us recommend better ways of 
doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That begs the question.  If most of the parliamentarians in the 
House understand what is happening across our country, if we 
understand the fiscal realities of the have and have not 
provinces, if we understand the sharing, the equalization 
systems, the goods, the bads and the uglies, why is it that we do 
not do something constructive about it? 
Members on this side can only point out, recommend and represent. 
It is the people on the other side who must to do something, but 
we have not seen very much being done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18, which would remove the cap on equalization payments 
for one year, is a positive step and one which various provinces 
have asked for.  They have also asked that the cap be removed 
entirely, which is something I would also recommend, but removing 
the cap on equalization would not solve all the problems. 
Changing the whole equalization reality would equalize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word equalization is deceptive.  When we hear the word we 
think of the old Robin Hood syndrome:  if we take from the rich, 
being Alberta and Ontario, and give to the poor, everybody 
becomes equal.  If that were the case, what a wonderful country 
we would have, but that is not the case.  All we are doing is 
taking a very minuscule sum of money and sharing it on an equal 
basis depending upon status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Newfoundland has been looked upon by our fellow 
Canadians for years as a have not province, a province that has 
absolutely nothing to offer.  Those who are experienced and 
travelled politicians, or experienced in the sense of having read 
and educated themselves about all the provinces, realize that is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt if there is a province in Canada as rich as Newfoundland 
in relation to the resources within its boundaries.  If we look 
at the small population of Newfoundland, slightly over half a 
million people, and divide it into the value of our resources, on 
a per capita basis we could be richer than any province in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary from Alberta asked my colleague from 
New Brunswick Southwest whether it would not be good for the 
people of his province to travel to rich Alberta where they could 
find employment.  I say to the hon. member that many people from 
Newfoundland have travelled to Alberta and have contributed 
significantly to the growth of that great province.  Alberta and 
Newfoundland have been extremely close over the years.  I had the 
privilege of serving in a government in Newfoundland in the 
mid-eighties at the same time that Premier Lougheed was the 
premier of Alberta.  There was an exceptionally strong bond 
between our two provinces and that bond has held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent months, Premier Hamm of Nova Scotia has led the fight 
for drawing attention to the plight of equalization clawback 
arrangements.  It is interesting to see him being supported by 
other premiers who have not been directly affected and by the 
new leader of the opposition, Mr. Williams in the province of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Premier Hamm and opposition leader Mr. Williams took their 
plight nationally, the people of Alberta began to realize what 
they were being asked for.  It was not just more money from 
Alberta and putting nothing back in return.  When they saw the 
reality of what was happening, the people of Alberta, Premier 
Klein, former Premier Lougheed, the University of Alberta, the 
Calgary <I>Herald</I>—and I could go on—in their comments, their 
speeches and their editorials, all expressed support by saying 
that what these people wanted was right and proper and that it 
was not something that Albertans did not get in the past.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about Newfoundland and its riches.  Besides our 
forestry and farming potential and our small business and IT 
sector, which are growing rapidly, we have one of the greatest 
tourism potentials anywhere in the world.  We are one of the last 
frontiers in Canada, as many people are starting to see.  We are 
limited only by access because of unfair treatment by the central 
government in the type of ferry system we have, a monopoly 
airline, et cetera.  Other than that, we have the last frontier 
as it relates to all the other areas except the far north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have major resources.  People must remember that we 
brought the fishery into Canada.  We brought the Grand Banks of 
Newfoundland and all the surrounding fisheries around the coast 
of our province within the 200 mile limit.  For years Canada 
bartered Newfoundland fish for deals, such as the sale of wheat 
and other sales to Russia, China and Europe.  Everybody got a 
piece of our action, such as the Spanish, Portuguese and 
Russians.  Our fishing grounds were ravaged by countries given 
quotas in lieu of deals made to ship off other Canadian 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end Newfoundland paid the price.  Our water power in 
Upper Churchill was developed by an agreement with Quebec. 
Newfoundland receives about $10 million a year while Quebec 
receives closer to $1 billion in royalties out of our water 
power.  I do not blame Quebec.  It was a federally sanctioned 
deal, with absolutely no federal assistance, that provided a 
power corridor through to the United States markets, which is 
what was done for Alberta oil and gas across the rest of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland is extremely wealthy with minerals, especially the 
major find in Voisey's Bay.  It is not being developed for 
several reasons, but the main one is that people want to move it 
somewhere else in order to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our oil and gas, which is now being developed and, as Alberta 
grew and prospered on its onshore oil, Newfoundland will 
eventually grow and prosper.  As Alberta slides economically, 
maybe Newfoundland will be able to pick up the slack and 
reciprocate on the assistance it has received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confederation is supposed to be about sharing. Newfoundland, 
Nova Scotia and other provinces are not putting their hands out 
and saying “give us”.   They are asking for a chance.  They are 
saying that they have the resources to become a have province but 
that they need the chance to develop those resources and hold on 
to the royalties until they can create the infrastructure to make 
themselves a have province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to create equalization across the 
country, it should start doing it properly.  It should try to be 
fair so that some day each province in this country will be 
equal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the member for St. John's 
West speaks on behalf of many Newfoundlanders who have raised the 
concern about equalization.  I would like to go over some of the 
data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that equalization is a very important 
program.  It is meant to help those provinces that are the 
so-called have not provinces in order to deliver a roughly equal 
level of services and programs to their residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2001-02, Newfoundland and Labrador will receive almost $1.6 
billion in equalization.  That includes the CHST and 
equalization.  It will account for about 40% of Newfoundland and 
Labrador's estimated revenues.  It is expected to total about 
$2,930 per person, which is more than twice the national average 
and the highest of any province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at those per capita receipts, which are twice the 
national average, one intuitively reaches the conclusion that it 
is supposed to work that way.  On a per capita basis Newfoundland 
and Labrador will receive, by this formula, twice as much on a 
per capita basis as the national average.

to its residents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find the question 
basically insulting.  The parliamentary secretary seems to be 
asking if it is not enough that we are getting welfare and more 
funding than anybody else.  That is not what we are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about $1.6 billion being thrown into 
Newfoundland.  Just from our hydro resource alone we are putting 
a billion dollars into Quebec, not to mention the oil, gas and 
mineral resources.  We are getting nowhere near what we are 
contributing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be getting our fair share of royalties. We are not 
looking for more handouts.  That is what is wrong.  It is the 
attitude of government members across the way that tells us to 
take the welfare and thank them.  That is not what we want.  We 
want the opportunity to be a contributor.  We have the tools, 
resources and the intelligence to do it.  All we are asking is 
that the government let us do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
two questions to raise with the member for St. John's West.  I 
also applaud him for recognizing that it was the premier of Nova 
Scotia, not of my political stripe but of his, who spearheaded a 
lot of the battle for a fair equalization formula.  Our party has 
been very pleased to co-operate with that effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on the role and position of the former 
premier of his province of Newfoundland on the equalization 
formula?  I remind all members of the House that when he made his 
decision to run in the last federal election, wrapped in the 
unity flag and all sorts of rhetoric about equality of 
opportunity, he said that one of the reasons he was running was 
that he wanted to see changes in the equalization formula and the 
removal of the cap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member for St. John's West been tracking what the 
current Minister of Industry has done to contribute to persuading 
the government to lift the artificial cap on the equalization 
formula? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Premier Hamm has certainly 
been the one who has led the fight that has now been picked up by 
others.  I presume the hon. member knows the answer as well as I 
do to her question.  The Minister of Industry has done very 
little, either before or after his return to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  What about the $700 million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  The $700 million was announced five 
different times.  It was the same money over and over.  One of 
these days I will analyze the benefits to our region for the hon. 
member, and that will embarrass him even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry spent a lot of time in Ottawa and 
delivered nothing for Newfoundland as a premier.  The only time 
he raised the issue of equalization was during the election 
campaign when he was to save Atlantic Canada.  He was elected, 
but there were very few with him because he campaigned on a new 
equalization deal.  He did not deliver and that is no surprise to 
any of us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the hardworking and faithful hon. 
member for Vancouver Island North.  I could have used more 
adjectives, but I did not want them to go to his head.  It is an 
honour to stand in the House to talk about Bill C-18, a very 
important bill, and to address at this stage the broader question 
of equalization payments and the meaning of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot resist the temptation to lay down a bit of what one 
might call a philosophical foundation for the idea. 
That foundation is what we as Canadians believe in so strongly. 
We believe in community and sharing with those who have need. The 
Liberals have somehow exploited this in their communication 
pieces to try to pass it off to Canadians that they are the only 
ones who care.  They certainly are experts at caring in one 
particular way and that is taxing Canadians to death, then 
deciding how they can distribute the money they have gathered 
together.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just yesterday, without any previous debate or approval of the 
House, the Prime Minister declared some of his values in Toronto 
when he announced a $500 million program to aid culture in 
Canada.  180 
I shake my head at that when we have that same 
government saying that it will not increase the ceiling for 
equalization payments to help provinces pay for hospitals, 
education facilities for students and things like that.  The 
government is ready to give us $500 million more for its 
interpretation of what Canadian culture is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very narrow point of view of what it means to be 
Canadian and what it means to be community.  Very frankly the 
cultures that I see across the country are many and varied. 
These cultures for the most instance are very able in 
representing themselves and thriving without the aid of a bunch 
of government grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact in my riding we have a large Ukrainian community that 
does wonderful things to promote its culture and to keep it and 
its language alive.  I had a conversation not long ago, actually 
I guess it is over a year ago but at my age years fly into days 
or weeks, with several people from the Ukrainian community.  They 
said we should support more cultural grants from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I engaged them in a little debate and asked them where they 
thought the money came from.  We talked about it a bit.  I told 
them that we were overtaxed with the huge burgeoning bureaucracy 
that was involved in sending money to Ottawa and that the 
bureaucrats spun it through their centrifuges.  A bunch of that 
money would spill over the edges but would never get to the 
target for which it is intended.  Then finally some would go back 
to a select group chosen in some cases by the Prime Minister 
because, as I understood it, he had a lot of clout in cabinet. 
However if they did not happen to be one of those they would not 
get the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was able to show them that we would all do a lot better if we 
could simply reduce our taxes.  Then all of us in all our 
cultures could fund to our heart's content the Ukrainian schools, 
the German schools and other schools that we would have liked to 
have but were prohibited from because of the official program of 
the government of taking about half of everybody's earnings and 
distributing it according to its will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also say that in the broader sense of community I do not want 
to restrict my community just to the town near which I live, nor 
my riding.  It is a wonderful riding.  I welcome you, Mr. 
Speaker, to come and visit.  We have a national park in our 
riding.  It is called the Elk Island National Park, named after 
my riding.  It is a wonderful place and great place to visit.  I 
would not like to restrict my sense of community just to our 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned earlier today that Alberta in the last year or 
so had a very good economic picture because of the energy 
situation.  I can remember back a scant eight years ago when that 
was not the case.  Albertans were struggling with their education 
and health funding probably as much as anyone.  We had tremendous 
challenges in the province to rationalize the delivery of the 
health care system. 
A lot of it was due to the fact that this federal government 
reneged on what was originally an agreement to pay for half of 
the health care for the provinces.  Over the years it eroded it 
to a point where it was once again the responsibility of the 
provinces.  However it never reduced the taxes it sucked out of 
our provinces to bring to Ottawa.  Therefore, I feel the 
government funding of those programs was irresponsible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My country is my community.  I came to the House as a Canadian. 
I stand proudly when we sing the national anthem in the House. 
Some may remember that I was even unwittingly and unintentionally 
the centre of a lot of controversy a number of years ago when I 
insisted that there should be nothing wrong with my having a flag 
on my desk in the House of Commons. Ultimately, it was ruled not 
permissible.  It was considered a prop, so I am without my 
Canadian flag.  So be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I am a proud Canadian and this is my community.  I 
insist that we would do well by extending the word community 
across this whole country and that we provide the needed health 
care and educational facilities to our citizens, which are more 
or less equal, at comparable levels of taxation.   However it is 
impossible to have them exactly equal as that is just a practical 
consideration but they should be as equal as is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is worth drawing the attention of the members to the 
fact that this is in our constitution.  If we look at the 
Constitution Act, 1982, we will find section 36.  I am going to 
read it because perhaps some people have not heard it.  It 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without altering the legislative authority of Parliament or of 
the provincial legislatures, or the rights of any of them with 
respect to the exercise of their legislative authority, 
Parliament and the legislatures, together with the government of 
Canada and the provincial governments, are committed to 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) promoting equal opportunities for the well-being of 
Canadians; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) furthering economic development to reduce disparity in 
opportunities; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) providing essential public services of reasonable quality to 
all Canadians. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then subsection 36(2) of our constitution states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament and the Government of Canada are committed to the 
principle of making equalization payments to ensure that 
provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide 
reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably 
comparable levels of taxation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although that was brought in by a Liberal government, it seems 
to me eminently fine.  I have absolutely no problem with that 
particular clause in our constitution.  It behooves us to make 
sure that Canadians across the country have comparably equal 
services at comparable levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we need to make sure that there is not duplication.  We 
must ensure there is efficiency in the delivery of those 
services.  We must make absolutely sure that the provinces and 
the citizens in those provinces continue to have all the 
motivation in the world we can extend them to improve their 
situation, regardless of where that is.  I insist our country 
would do best if we neither hung a milestone around the necks of 
those who are doing well as they will then do better, they will 
expand our economy and they will provide more jobs, nor leave 
destitute those whose needs are greater.

I appreciate the opportunity to address the House on this 
important issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pride that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance rose in the House this morning to make his speech and 
say that the federal government has been generous in giving 
money back to the provinces. The government feels generous 
because, among other things, it gave Quebec $489 million in 
equalization payments.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government is returning money to each province 
through the equalization program, it is primarily because these 
tax revenues from the provinces and workers have increased, 
while government spending has decreased. The government has now 
eliminated its deficit, but not because it is a good 
administrator, not because the Minister of Finance is better 
than his predecessor. Rather, it is because the Minister of 
Finance decided to take $6 billion a year from the employment 
insurance fund. It is because he decided to make cuts to 
transfer payments to the provinces for health and education. The 
federal government has relinquished all responsibility for the 
maintenance of airports and piers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This money is not a present from the government, it is money 
owed to us. In a sovereign Quebec, we will manage the $33 
billion that is collected through taxes and we will tell the 
federal government “Keep your equalization program”. I am 
prepared to trade $33 billion for $489 million. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was just waiting for the end 
of the interpretation.  Unfortunately I am unilingual and I 
depend on those wonderful people in the booths to do my talking 
for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will answer the question in the following way.  Indeed there 
is but one taxpayer.  We are burdened to death with taxes at all 
levels of government.  The federal government takes the largest 
share, then the provinces and our municipalities take some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would definitely agree with the member but I would ask him to 
come to a small degree of realism.  Members of the Bloc are 
intent upon leading their people into forming a separate 
government independent from Canada.  That is their commitment. 
They are good at communicating it and I have to admire them.  It 
is a party that has managed to stay on track and focused on what 
its goals are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I caution the member, the members of his party and all 
citizens of Quebec to make sure they do the arithmetic 
accurately.  As residents of a recipient province in the 
equalization program, they would have a very hard time 
demonstrating to me, using hard facts and numbers, that they are 
not net beneficiaries of the program.  Undoubtedly they pay their 
share of taxes and I have no problem with that.  However they are 
net beneficiaries when it comes to the equalization program.  The 
numbers are very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than that the member was right on in his statements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is not the first day we have 
debated the bill but it is the first day we have debated it on 
third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a history and a track record to the legislation in this 
place.  The real track record was the first minister's conference 
communique of September 11, 2000, when the announcement was made 
on the one year lifting of the ceiling on equalization payments 
would occur.  Of course that was about one month before a general 
federal election was called.  People, particularly the Prime 
Minister who was the major part of making that announcement, 
would very much have had the election in mind at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an agreement that was reached in a very politicized 
environment.  It is for one year and one year only.  We really 
are talking about retroactive legislation.  The spin doctoring 
that has come out of the Liberals on this particular initiative 
has been absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the press release from the minister's office dated March 
15.  It spent more time talking about the fact that because of 
the Ontario's hot economy the total transfers were going to be 
$1.8 billion higher than it did the substance of the press 
release which was supposed to be about the legislation, this bill 
which was tabled that day in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a general recognition, a disquiet and a discomfort 
among some of the bureaucracy in the finance department and other 
places that this is a politically opportunistic, unprincipled way 
to approach the whole issue of financial transfers to the 
provinces.  They really are trying to bury the facts of how we 
arrived at this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real reason we ended up with that announcement last 
September 11 was that the federal government had balanced the 
books.  It got rid of the deficit between 1993 and 1999 in three 
ways.  First, it gutted transfers to the provinces, particularly 
the CHST which funds health, education and other important areas, 
by reducing it 33%.  Second, it gutted the Department of National 
Defence.  Third, it reduced all other programs by an average of 
3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see how much damage was done because the priorities of 
the government were obviously not the priorities of the people. 
This is an attempt to make up for the first set of cuts to the 
CHST, the health and social transfers to the provinces, on a one 
time basis in a politically charged atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great difficulty with all the breast beating coming from 
the Liberals about how generous they are.  They say this is a 
good announcement and pretend it will somehow continue.  The 
official opposition supports the principle of equalization.  It 
is the government that makes equalization look bad by this kind 
of ad hoc, band-aid reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is very narrow in scope, as I mentioned.  It deals with 
only one year, yet the government is attempting to make it look 
more broadly based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the notion that the federal government ought to 
equalize access to core public services at reasonably comparable 
levels of taxation.  There are many problems with the current 
system.  It should be much more open to discourse and debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to the member for St. John's West when he 
talked about how economic development, particularly in the 
non-renewable natural resource sector, is penalized by the 
current way the equalization system is applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of what we have done with the north.  Equalization 
payments apply only to the provinces, but in the north we have 
federal territories:  Nunavut, the western Arctic, the Northwest 
Territories and Yukon.  Federal transfers to those jurisdictions 
are the major part of their budget.  Anywhere from 80% to 90% 
plus of the total revenues of territorial governments come from 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the equalization formula has worked in a perverse 
way.  If a region creates economic development it is penalized on 
an almost dollar for dollar basis.  What is the incentive to 
become self-sufficient? 
This is contrary to economic thought and rational development 
policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the economies of countries with mobile 
populations.  I heard the Secretary of State for Latin America 
and Africa ask about the demand for skilled workers in the 
province of Alberta.  How do we get people to fill those jobs? 
How do we get them to move to that jurisdiction?  That is a 
crucial question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly demonstrated that one of the major reasons the 
U.S. economy is resilient and strong and has low unemployment is 
that culturally and by policy its population is used to 
travelling to new jurisdictions to seek employment.  The United 
States has the highest labour mobility in the world.  That is 
what gives its economy such great transitional strength and 
reduces its unemployment numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any country that makes it more convenient to stay in one place 
than to move to new opportunities is doing its people a great 
disservice.  The Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa 
was on to a very important question about which our young people 
are thinking a great deal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am truly impressed.  The adjectives I used to describe 
the hon. member have now been proven correct.  He gave a great 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions or comments.  The Prime Minister, 
during his swing through the Atlantic provinces in the election 
campaign or leading up to it, made a significant policy change. 
He announced that the cap on equalization payments would be 
removed for one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member think about a government that makes major 
policy changes for one year only during an election year?  If it 
is a necessary step, should it not be taken whether or not there 
is an election and not cancelled when the election is over? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I concur with that, but I 
attribute it to something more than a concern over the 
government's or the Prime Minister's behaviour in this regard. 
The larger concern is that we have a parliamentary democracy that 
does not allow for real ratification. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in most western democracies a prime minister or 
president could make a statement such as the September 11 
statement of last year outlining their intent.  However it would 
need to be argued, debated and ratified and there would be a 
great deal of uncertainty as to whether it would be approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, on the other hand, our democracy is so skewed that 
parliament is virtually a rubber stamp.  The Prime Minister or 
even a cabinet minister can now make these kinds of 
announcements.  The cultural announcement to which the member for 
Elk Island made reference is the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest portion of the $560 million announcement by the 
Prime Minister yesterday includes $108 million to foster and 
develop Canadian content on the Internet, and French language 
content in particular according to the heritage minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since when is money for Canadian culture usefully spent on 
getting us into Internet type stuff that the private sector, 
private investors and the stock market and everything else have 
run with from day one?  How did that become a priority?  How 
could an announcement be made when nothing has occurred in this 
place to enable the announcement to be made? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to this important issue because of the profound 
effect that equalization problems are having on my constituents 
in Dartmouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the current transfer formula does not treat my 
constituents in Nova Scotia and Dartmouth the same way that 
citizens in other provinces have been treated.  I will spend a 
bit of time talking about that this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equal opportunities need to be given to Nova Scotians under our 
federal transfer regime.  Sadly there are a number of barriers in 
our equalization formula which continue to work against poorer 
provinces such as Nova Scotia and which are causing real hardship 
to ordinary hard working persons in Dartmouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, Bill C-18 does not meet the real constitutional 
obligations of the government.  I will state what they are 
because I am not sure we all know.  Subsection 36(2) of our 
constitution states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the 
principle of making equalization payments to ensure that 
provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide 
reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonable 
comparable levels of taxation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at health care standards and the lack of availability 
of pharmacare, per pupil funding levels for primary, secondary 
and post-secondary education, and services for those living in 
poverty, including the thousands with disabilities in my 
community in Nova Scotia, it is self-evident that the lofty 
ideals of the constitution are not being met.  Canadians know, 
and study after study shows, that there are significant 
inequities in services and taxation levels across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concede that some of the inequities are the result of 
decisions made by provincial governments.  Many Conservative 
governments, rather than using budget surpluses to rebuild social 
programs, have brought in large scale tax cuts which benefit the 
wealthy.  That is not the fault of equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some inequities stem from the ability of some provinces to 
generate revenue from resources.  There is no doubt that Alberta 
has greatly benefited from the fact that it is situated on large 
lakes of underground oil and gas.  It receives full royalty 
revenues from those resources.  There is some accounting of this 
in the equalization formula. However another inequity is at play 
here. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That relates to the fact that offshore oil and gas revenues 
cannot be taxed by provinces in the same way that onshore oil and 
gas revenues are presently being taxed.  Therefore we are leaving 
the have not provinces in Atlantic Canada without the same 
ability to provide programs as Alberta has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I know there are different jurisdictions for onshore and 
offshore resources, it is difficult to give the legal mumbo-jumbo 
explanation to the people of Nova Scotia.  Nova Scotians have 
made their living off the ocean since the province was founded 
almost 400 years ago just as much as they have made their living 
off the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta's tar sands are a provincial resource, and telling Nova 
Scotians that Sable Island gas is not part of their province 
simply does not wash.  They do not see the legal argument.  They 
see that they are once again being kept poor by unequal rules set 
by central and western Canada, and they have a point.  The 
government is not treating them fairly and it obviously could if 
it wanted to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there was a temporary exemption of royalty revenue 
in the calculation of equalization payments which had been 
granted to Newfoundland and Labrador in the past.  This temporary 
measure helped boost the economy of that province, and Nova 
Scotia deserves no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the government to give Nova Scotia the same deal which 
was granted to Newfoundland and Labrador.  As my leader and 
colleague from Halifax said eloquently in today's debate, Liberal 
cuts to the CHST, their elimination of the Canada assistance plan 
and their general approach to giving a higher priority to tax 
cuts rather than rebuilding our social programs have hit Atlantic 
Canada very hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are policy barriers to governments in Atlantic Canada 
which the government should address, but it should also be 
fulfilling its constitutional role to create equity in services 
through the equalization formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 leaves barriers in place.  The biggest barrier is the 
cap on equalization payments.  It needs to be removed.  I am not 
alone in this regard.  As has been mentioned, the provincial 
ministers and the premiers have brought this matter to our 
attention.  Bill C-18 has failed to remove the artificial cap on 
equalization payments to poorer provinces for this fiscal year. 
It means that Ontario and Alberta keep more and Atlantic Canada 
keeps less.  How can the Liberals justify this?  Do they know 
what it means to the people in Atlantic Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it means is that Dartmouth students suffer with less 
funding and there is increased labour strife as school boards try 
to squeeze concessions from already underpaid workers. It means 
that post-secondary students have the highest tuitions and the 
most ineffective student aid program in the country.  It means 
that fewer sick people can afford the medications they are told 
by their doctors they need to stay alive.  That is not fair and 
it is not equal.  That does not meet the lofty goals set out in 
our constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically on post-secondary education, I repeat my request 
for the federal government to increase the support for legitimate 
post-secondary educational needs in Nova Scotia through a 
bilateral agreement that would recognize the significant price 
that Nova Scotians are paying to support a disproportionate 
number of out of province students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government of Nova Scotia would then use the funds to 
reduce student tuition fees, currently the highest in Canada, and 
increase the inadequate student aid plan.  Atlantic Canadians do 
not want handouts.  They want fairness.  Sadly our party believes 
that Bill C-18 would not deliver this to them.

Mr. Speaker, we have a problem in the country when policies are 
not made on the basis of good reason or good common sense but on 
the basis of pure politics.  That is what has happened in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A task force was convened back in 1995.  I would like to share 
with the House some of its observations. The clerk of the privy 
council asked Ivan Fellegi to chair a task force of senior 
officials to review the state of the government's policy 
capacity. 
The task force submitted its report in April 1995 and it 
concluded:

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was basically a condemnation of the way in which the 
government makes policy.  Its observations were such that it 
highlighted to those who read it the unfortunate political 
motivation behind too many of the policies that are 
misconstructed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such is the case here. The bill proposed by the government is 
after the fact.  It is designed to fulfil a promise made by a 
Prime Minister, in anticipation of a federal election, to a group 
of Canadians in the Atlantic region who he hoped to persuade 
through his promise to support them.  It is clear and obvious to 
members opposite that was the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the way policies should be designed and shaped?  Is that 
the way policies should be communicated to the Canadian people? 
The obvious answer is that it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a reflection of the government's ability to act in 
an ad hoc fashion rather than to plan.  There was no consultation 
in advance of the promises made by the Prime Minister.  The Prime 
Minister does not have to consult but he should.  The Prime 
Minister has made announcements before on behalf of various 
ministries and sometimes without consultation with his ministers. 
For example, the millennium scholarship fund was introduced by 
the Prime Minister without consultation with his finance 
minister.  This is not the way to make policy and design a better 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another problem in this case.  We have a problem for the 
people of Atlantic Canada because in many regions the 
constituents in Atlantic Canada elected Liberal members.  Liberal 
members were sent here not because they were bought, which is not 
the nature of the people of Atlantic Canada at least in my 
experience, but rather to represent their constituencies and to 
represent them well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I have not heard voices raised in the House in strong 
support of the people of Atlantic Canada on the equalization 
formula.  No one from the Liberal side has stood to condemn the 
words of the Prime Minister or his lack of action and the lack of 
action of the finance minister on this policy issue.  That is a 
shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard members from Atlantic Canada.  They have not 
attacked the Prime Minister's approach to this issue.  They have 
not attacked his lack of sensitivity around the needs of the 
people of their own regions or of other regions such as my own in 
Manitoba or in the province of Saskatchewan, both provinces which 
depended to some degree on equalization payments to offer the 
kinds of services to their residents they deserve to have.  I 
have not heard voices raised in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather I have heard voices raised in the House attacking 
provincial politicians in Nova Scotia and in New Brunswick.  I 
wonder at the wisdom of those kinds of personal, petty and 
partisan attacks.  I wonder why members opposite would rise and 
criticize the governing parties of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the only reason they would do so is that currently 
there are Progressive Conservative governments in those 
provinces.  That seems rather shallow.  It also seems at odds 
with what their constituents would want them to do, which would 
be to stand with Premier Lord, Premier Hamm and with many others 
in Atlantic Canada.  Their constituents are trying diligently to 
have this formula revisited and to ensure the resources they and 
their provinces need are made available to them under a fair 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partisanship is at its worst in the House when members opposite 
fail to address issues of importance to their own constituents. 
There are clear divisions in the Liberal caucus and among various 
ministers on this issue.

issue.  I have not seen it and I have not heard it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the minister on a lot of other issues as the people of 
Newfoundland have when he was there.  When they said goodbye to 
him I am sure it was with some hope that he would come to this 
place with a Newfoundland agenda in mind.  That has not been 
evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has not shown any interest either.  Rather 
he told finance ministers that this file would not be opened.  He 
said that a single act would suffice.  This ad hoc act and 
self-serving makeshift policy is not the way to deal with an 
issue as important as this one is to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister for some reason refuses to open the file. 
Perhaps it is because he does not want to give any credit to the 
industry minister, who may be behind the scenes raising this 
issue, although he is certainly not doing it where anyone knows 
that he is doing it.  This has been a closed debate and that is 
unfortunate.  It has been closed to a very few.  That kind of 
policy making is not the kind of policy making that people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat and listened to the debate with some interest. 
Members have unfortunately misrepresented Canadian Alliance 
policy.  I would like to put on record our policy on this issue. 
We recognize that different provinces and regions of Canada have 
different levels of wealth but all wish to provide similar 
services to their residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to the constitutional principle of making 
equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have 
sufficient revenues to provide their residents with reasonably 
comparable levels of basic services at reasonably comparable 
levels of taxation.  That is the Canadian Alliance policy, not 
the policy that has been misrepresented and put on the record in 
the House by some members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our policy reflects the desire for fairness and for some 
equitable treatment of all Canadians.  We believe that 
equalization should serve the longer term purpose of equalizing 
economic opportunity and autonomy in all regions of our country. 
It should not create incentives for perverse economic policies. 
It should not be used for self-serving political purposes. Rather 
it should be used as it was originally designed, to provide a way 
up for people, not just an excuse for a government to try to buy 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Donald Savoie in his book <I>Governing from the Centre</I> made 
some observations concerning the nature of the way in which the 
government has chosen to develop policy.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I argue that the centre and, in particular, the hand of the 
Prime Minister, has been considerably strengthened in recent 
years, this is not to suggest that the federal government is 
better able to define new strategic direction or a coherent plan 
to which all government departments can contribute.  It is ironic 
perhaps that as the hand at the centre has been strengthened, its 
ability to manage horizontal issues has been weakened. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see evidence of that in many policy areas and certainly we 
see it in regard to this file.  The Prime Minister's controlling 
hand is all over the legislation.  His desire to use legislation 
such as this to fulfil pre-election promises is obvious and 
self-evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the ability of the government to deal with the 
horizontal issues that affect all regions of the country? 
According to Donald Savoie, a noted observer of things political 
for decades, the ability of the government to deal with the 
horizontal issues that face our nation has been considerably 
weakened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that here and in many other areas.  Our desire as a 
political movement is to make sure that everyone in Canada feels 
they are a part of Canada.  That is not the case today in Canada. 
We have seen centrifugal federalism where the willingness of the 
government to practise and develop policies does not reflect the 
true Canadian fabric. 
Too often we have seen a willingness to use partisan judgment 
rather than develop good, comprehensive, intelligent, foresighted 
policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Council for Canadian Unity has been at work developing 
ideas, researching and looking into ways to enhance that sense of 
being a Canadian that should exist across the country from coast 
to coast.  It has just released the results of a study it 
conducted.  What it revealed is truly disheartening and should be 
disheartening to all hon. members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian residents were polled and asked the question “Do you 
feel that the federal government is respectful of your 
province?”  The results were tabulated by province and were 
truly sad in terms of what they revealed.  The results revealed 
that in only one province of Canada did the government get a 
passing grade from the people in that province.  That province 
was Ontario.  In nine other provinces from the west coast to the 
east coast, the Council for Canadian Unity study revealed that 
Canadian people do not feel their provinces are being treated 
with respect by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a condemnation of the way in which the government has 
chosen to develop its policies.  Perhaps it is a condemnation of 
the way in which it has chosen to communicate.  However, I doubt 
very seriously that venturing out to western Canada on feel good 
trips, for example, will change the perceptions of western 
Canadians toward the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What western Canadians are looking for, and I believe what 
people in the maritime region are looking for, is real change, a 
real change in the attitude and the approach of the government 
toward the people of those regions, a real change in the ways in 
which the government develops policy and does consultation.  I 
believe they are looking for a real change in the way in which 
the government and the Prime Minister deal with the reality of 
the need for democratic reforms, for openness, and for increased 
openness in the Chamber and elsewhere.  I believe they are 
looking for a real change in the institutional approach we have 
developed over many years in the country, a change that would 
allow for a greater sense of belonging to the country, a greater 
sense of control among the Canadian people, so that they would 
feel their input was being valued, that they were being respected 
as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the study was released, the reaction was silence on the 
part of the government opposite, but I genuinely hope that in the 
days to come we will not have to deal with any more of these 
pieces of legislation that are designed clearly and simply to 
fulfil promises made by the Prime Minister in isolation from any 
of his own caucus members and in isolation from any consultation 
with the Canadian people.  He simply made them, pre-election, for 
his own personal electoral purposes.  That is not the kind of 
legislation we should be dealing with in the House and yet we are 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that we in the Canadian Alliance will 
continue, as will I in my responsibility as the regional equity 
critic, to look for ways to genuinely develop a country of which 
all Canadians feel they are a part and in which they feel they 
are respected.  That has not been the case under the government's 
mandate.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY WATERS TREATY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK70">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 30 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-6, an act to amend the International Boundary Waters 
Treaty Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
the two minutes left before question period, which will be 
adequate for me to make my brief intervention, I would like to 
say that the bill before us has positive features and it has some 
negatives.  I will briefly outline them for the House's 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning with the positive, this act dealing with transboundary 
waters offers an ecological approach.  It deals with water as an 
important item that is dealt with as a basin.  It is seen as an 
ecological asset wherever it is found and therefore it is dealt 
with in an approach that is new and, from an ecological and 
environmental point of view, I think, most desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I will say that the bill also has some 
shortcomings because it relies on the voluntary approach when it 
comes to non-boundary waters in preventing the export of bulk 
water.  In other words, Bill C-6 is quite explicit.  It says that 
the export of water in transboundary lakes and river systems and 
the like is not to be permitted, but when it comes to waters from 
Newfoundland to British Columbia that are not shared with our 
neighbours, it is left to the provinces to decide whether or not 
the export should take place.  Therefore it covers only one 
aspect of our great ecological asset, namely, freshwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also leaves out bodies such as Lake Winnipeg, 
the island lakes from Newfoundland, and other lakes from 
Newfoundland to British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact, therefore, that emerges from reading the bill is that 
while a good step is being undertaken in the bill in covering 
transboundary waters, it leaves out a substantial body of lakes 
and rivers that are not being shared with our neighbours to the 
south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also does not contain any reference to reciprocity on 
the part of the United States.  It may be that this bill is not 
the appropriate place to have that kind of reference. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that such an omission could be corrected by an 
appropriate amendment to the 1909 Canada-U.S. Boundary Waters 
Treaty in a manner that would bind the United States as well.  I 
am not aware of initiatives south of the border that would be 
parallel to the one we are initiating in this parliament, and 
therefore I am raising this matter here this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on, the question of export of bulk water is one that has 
been of major concern to Canadians.  We know that the vast 
majority of our population does not want to see Canadian water 
exported in bulk.  Therefore maybe there is a solution to that 
problem by having the Government of Canada seek an interpretive 
statement under NAFTA whereby bulk water is to be defined as a 
non-tradable commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having obtained that interpretive statement, then we could use 
our constitutional powers given for international trade to the 
federal government and subsequently enact federal legislation 
banning export of bulk water, covering Canada as a whole and not 
having to rely on the vagaries of the voluntary agreements with 
the provinces, as we would by adopting this bill alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the approach I have just outlined of seeking an 
interpretive statement is not a new one.  It has been followed 
already for health services, which are not subjected to trade 
agreements.  It has been adopted in relation to education and it 
has been adopted in relation to certain natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is desirable, then, in the near future would be an 
additional piece of legislation that would replace the voluntary 
accord proposed by Ottawa in the case of removal of bulk water. 
We need that kind of legislation that would make it illegal to 
export non-boundary bulk water because it is quite safe to 
predict that the voluntary approach would not work in the long 
term, as leadership in provincial governments changes from time 
to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would say that we need this type of legislation 
with a certain element of urgency, because in certain provinces 
there could be a threat very soon for the export of bulk water 
from non-boundary waters, which might be authorized by some 
provincial government, as we have learned from media reports 
emanating out of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the remaining minute just to refer to the fact that 
the government introduced in August 1998 a very good piece of 
legislation called Bill C-156.  It was called the Canada water 
preservation act.  It contained a number of legislative measures 
emanating from the Pearse water report, which was initiated in 
January 1984 and completed in 1985.  It has been languishing 
since then, waiting for implementation.  It is an important 
report that certainly deserves the attention of this parliament.

Mr. Speaker, documents prepared for the industry minister by 
Western Economic Diversification Canada show that since the

regional economic development has been cut by more than half and 
that the rationale for funding certain projects is to gain 
“visibility and credit” for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder poll results released by the Council for Canadian 
Unity show that a majority of Canadians in nine out of ten 
provinces feel that their province does not get the respect it 
deserves from this federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want real change.  They do not want feel good tours 
and they do not want self-serving Liberal patronage either. For 
example, the council's research shows that 60% of western 
Canadians cite an elected Senate as a high priority and 55% cite 
free votes in the House as a high priority.

rightly saying that the assets of Canadians are being valued 
based on the U.S. dollar, a dollar without borders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One country requested that the texts be in Portuguese before

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of who does what, I believe there is a role for 
leadership by the federal government in their consistent

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

not be abused to expand protection beyond the period which is 
already prescribed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said when appearing before a committee in the other place

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is really interesting.  Canadians spent $15 billion 
on prescription drugs last year, the largest driver of our health 
care costs.  Generic versions of drugs are not only safe 
alternatives but allow competition to set the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brand name drugs are taking $186,000 per day out of the pockets 
of Canadians who can least afford it, the sick, seniors on fixed 
incomes.  Will the industry minister fix this problem today?  All 
it would take is a change in the regulation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a renewable resource resting within science.  Therefore, 
whatever decisions we make on this particular subject must be 
rooted not in emotion but in science and fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, a Pandora's box has been opened.  Right now six 
sites in our country are selling bulk water.  One of those 
particular sites is called Waterbank.  I encourage people to take 
a look at it.  It demonstrates that the cat is out of the bag and 
that private landowners are selling water over the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to address this issue but it is not being addressed in 
this particular bill. Why do we have to address it?  Because 
water flows through a hydrological cycle.  That hydrological 
cycle is interconnected between private and public lands.  There 
is no way to differentiate or separate that because water flows 
in that cycle regardless of what we do.  It is also affected by 
what we do, such as the building of dams.  At the end of the day, 
that hydrological cycle will let us know what will or will not be 
allowed in terms of bulk export of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to support this bill.  It is a very important first 
step, not only for public debate but also as to what we should do 
in the future.  I certainly hope the minister responsible will 
find the best scientists in and outside our country and use the 
best scientific research when determining the pros and cons with 
respect to bulk water sales.  On one hand, it can be an enormous 
renewable resource for Canadians who desperately require it.  On 
the other hand, it can be a source of jobs and job creation, 
particularly in areas such as Newfoundland and my province of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia, water actually evaporates from our oceans, 
falls onto the land as freshwater, runs through the cycle, 
through the rivers and then goes back into the ocean.  It is 
possible that there is a resource there.  However, if we extract 
anything, it must be done on the basis of good solid science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects with respect to water that are not 
touched on in this bill but should be.  One is the issue of water 
quality.  We saw the Walkerton tragedy.  We know from our 
communities that many of them are suffering the ravages of water 
which has been abused.  Pesticides and fertilizers in particular 
are acidifying our groundwater.  Water tables are eroding.  As a 
result of that communities are finding it very difficult to find 
the freshwater they require.  I know that some communities in and 
around my area of Victoria have had some very difficult times 
with respect to access to water.  We have been on water 
emergencies and water has been rationed as a result of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extent of the pollution has being largely ignored.  I know I 
mentioned examples in this House before of how badly our water 
tables are and how our water has been eroded with respect to 
poisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if we were to test the flesh taken from a Beluga 
whale found in the St. Lawrence Seaway we would find it polluted 
with cancer causing and taratogenic agents.  It would be 
considered a toxic substance.  Imagine, we have large mammals in 
the Gulf of St. Lawrence that are considered toxic waste.  The 
only reason those mammals would be considered as such is we have 
poisoned our water.  Those chemicals, which flow through our 
ecosystem, are being bioaccumulated in the mammals that live in 
our water systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go from smaller to larger species, the bioaccumulation of 
these carcinogenic and taratogenic substances are magnified. 
Therefore, in the top line predators there are considerable 
amounts of these toxic substances, to say the least.  This should 
act as a bellwether for us, the ultimate predator within our 
ecosystems, because we eat some of these fish.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great gaps in the government's analysis of these 
issues is environmental assessment.  The government has been told 
time and again that environmental assessments are required not at 
the end of a project or after a project but at the beginning of a 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public would find it shocking that environment assessments 
on 40% of all development projects take place near the end or 
after the project is complete.  It is an utterly useless 
exercise.  If development is to be done with environmental 
protection in mind, those assessments must take place at the 
beginning.  I encourage the relevant ministers to review this 
practice which simply must end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wars in the future will be fought over water.  Access to potable 
water in other countries is often a serious problem.  Here are a 
few facts.  Chronic water scarcity now impacts 10% of the world's 
population.  Eighty countries, imagine, 80 countries, with 40% of 
the world's population already experience critical water 
shortages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need only draw attention to the Middle East, to Jordan and 
Israel, and to what could become a Palestinian state.  These 
areas have an absolutely critical water shortage.  While people 
there are fighting over other issues, what may ultimately 
determine their actions and who can live in the area is not the 
gun but the amount of potable water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One-quarter of the world's population is expected to face severe 
water shortages in the next 25 years.  To show how bad it is, 
much of the world's population lives on eight litres of water a 
day.  That may seem like a lot, but each person in Canada uses 
325 litres of water per day.  That is extraordinary.  Canada 
possesses 9% of the world's freshwater, the lion's share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately other countries will look at our water supply with a 
great deal of envy and some of them may at times need urgent 
access to it.  It is up to us to protect the resource, be good 
stewards and implement solutions that will affect the resource in 
a positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than five million people die each year from illnesses 
related to unsafe drinking water.  Thirty thousand children die 
each day from water related diseases.  Having worked in Africa I 
know, as many people here know, that children are dying of 
dysentery.  It is a very serious problem in many developing 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I encourage the Government of Canada to work with 
other parties here today to put forth a bill that will protect 
our resources.  We must ultimately be stewards not only in what 
we do with our water but in how we protect it to ensure the 
potable water we have today will not be polluted.

listened very intently to the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
He said we had an obligation to enter into trade in the area of 
freshwater.  He talked about people who are unable to get the 
water they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are looking to buy our water are in fact not the 
people who cannot afford it.  The people who want to buy it are 
our cousins south of the border.  The hon. member also said we 
had poisoned the water in the St. Lawrence River and that we had 
whales that were proof of this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to reconcile those two points of view.  Do we have 
the right to sell something we have proven ourselves incompetent 
to look after?  At the same time can we talk about selling it to 
other people who, due to their own incompetence, have ruined 
their own water supplies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question.  The issue is how to manage our water resources 
responsibly.  I do not for a moment suggest that we sell any 
water.  I am saying that the cat is out of the bag.  There are 
Internet sites right now where private individuals with private 
land have offered to sell bulk water from their land.  That is 
not being addressed in the bill and it should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hydrological cycle, as I mentioned in my speech, is an 
interconnected one.  Water does not know the difference between 
public and private land.  All water flows together.  What a 
person does on private land can have a dramatic impact on what 
happens on public land.  We must build that into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of pollution, it behoves the hon. member to ask the 
Minister of the Environment why we have been such appalling 
stewardship of our water and why we have not implemented 
environmental laws to prevent rampant pollution from taking 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we not taking a critical look at the impact of 
fertilizer on the pH levels of water?  Fertilizers have a 
dramatic impact and cause algoblooms that kill off vast swaths of 
fish.  We need agriculture.  We need to develop the best 
practices to ensure that our agricultural products are safe and 
that we maximize productivity from our land.  However we must 
also respect our water resources.  Our future depends on it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the bill today.  I come 
from a riding in southern Alberta where one river, the Milk 
River, flows south and ends up in the Gulf of Mexico, while 
another river, the Oldman River, flows into the south 
Saskatchewan river system and ends up in Hudson Bay.  My riding 
is unique in that way.  In my riding water is an absolutely 
precious commodity.  If we did not properly manage and protect 
the water in the area we would be in serious trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the throes now of a drought that has seen in some 
places a 30% snowpack in the mountains, 70% below normal.  Our 
runoff this spring will be very low.  One of our irrigation 
districts has already told its producers they will be rationed. 
Those producers will receive half the water through the 
irrigation system that they would receive in a normal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the irrigated area of southern Alberta 4% of the land 
produces 20% of the crops.  This shows that if water is added to 
an area that gets as much sunshine as we do then the area can 
produce almost anything.  We grow all the pulse crops.  We grow 
beans, peas, sunflowers, sugar beets, all kinds of crops that 
demand high heat units.  We grow all these things, yet in that 
part of the Palliser triangle we would not have anything without 
proper water management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irrigation districts in our area take great pride in the 
fact that they are good managers of our water.  There is a 
gentleman in southern Alberta who has been a friend of mine for a 
long time.  He often comes to speak to me about water issues such 
as NAFTA, protecting our waters from trade, and interbasin 
transfers.  My riding is one area where it would be possible to 
take water out of a river basin and put it into another and send 
it in a different direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we are dealing with this issue.  The 
gentleman's name is Tracy Anderson.  I must mention him when I 
talk about water because to me he is Mr. Water.  He has spent his 
entire life dealing with water management.  He knows full well 
how precious a resource it is.  Former Premier Lougheed of 
Alberta said that by the year 2000 water would be more valuable 
than oil. 
He had the foresight to know that in time good, clean pure water 
such as we have in Canada would become a commodity more precious 
than oil.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we are proposing amendments to the treaty 
signed in 1909 between Canada and the U.S.  The government is 
doing so because it failed to exempt water from NAFTA, something 
it promised Canadians it would do in 1993 but never did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If water is ever traded as a commodity among Canadians then our 
NAFTA partners will have a right to the commodity as outlined in 
the agreement.  We cannot say yes to each other without also 
saying yes to the rest of North America.  There are situations in 
Canada where we could help each other.  In drought situations 
landowners could give up their share of water to a neighbour. 
However if we start trading water as a commodity it opens up a 
whole new area of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Boundary Waters Treaty Act would do three 
things.  First, it would prohibit interbasin transfers, the 
removal of waters from the basin in which they are located. 
Second, it would require a licence from the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs for any activity in boundary or transboundary waters that 
would alter the natural level or flow of waters on the U.S. side. 
The Americans would do the same.  Third, it would provide clear 
sanctions and penalties for violation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need such penalties.  As the previous hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca said, there are Internet sites in Canada 
offering to sell Canadian water.  We must be very careful how we 
handle this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize the provinces have jurisdiction over water.  However 
the federal government must work in conjunction with the 
provinces to structure legislation so that there is shared 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are becoming more concerned about the control of 
freshwater.  We notice this every time there is a proposal to 
sell our freshwater to another country because many Canadians 
come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 9% of the world's renewable freshwater supply.  That is 
a huge amount for the size of our country.  We need to realize 
that it is absolutely the most precious resource we have. Without 
good clean water nothing else can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An outright ban on exports would run contrary to NAFTA because 
water was not exempted.  These amendments are a way around that. 
Water should be exempted from NAFTA but it was not.  We therefore 
must deal with the issue in a different way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about our neighbour to the south.  What will happen 
if the U.S. has a crisis situation where it runs out of water? If 
we get to that stage our neighbour will put forward a hard case 
to come and get our water.  We must promote conservation the best 
we can.  We have the water supply.  Some of the things done on 
the other side of the border should perhaps not be done because 
water there is not as abundant as it is here. 
Weather and climate permitting, these functions should take place 
here.  If there is a process where water is needed to a great 
degree, it should also take place here.  Water should be treated 
as a raw material.  I suppose any time it can be valued added to, 
it should be.  It should be turned into crops, into vegetables 
and into food for the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that in the riding.  I was actually raised on five acres 
of what was called an irrigation camp.  My dad worked with the 
irrigation district.  I learned to appreciate at an early age the 
value of water and what it meant to our neighbours and the 
farming community in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we protect our water for future generations 
and that we ensure it stays under the sovereignty control of 
Canada.  The bill would go a long way in doing that, and we will 
be supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that we can ever forget that water as a tradable 
good should be exempt under NAFTA.  That is something that should 
be addressed by this government or maybe by a future government. 
Canadians should be able to help each other in need of water 
without putting it into the world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that we will support the bill. It is 
an important aspect of our environment and of our laws.  It does 
not go far enough, but what it does do we will support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill to amend the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act 
is only seven pages long and contains only 26 clauses. Yet it is 
a 
very important bill because the length of a bill is no 
indication of its significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the bill so crucial for Quebec? For various reasons. 
First, it has to be recalled that in Quebec in the fall of 1997 
a large symposium on water was held, bringing together several 
stakeholders, from the private sector as well as the community, 
institutional and municipal sectors, to develop a policy on water 
management not only at the international level but also within 
our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that symposium, the participants agreed to give the BAPE, the 
Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement, a clear 
mandate. They came up with a fairly eloquent report which 
reflected their desire to have their own water policy within a 
reasonable timeframe. The report was published in May 2000 and 
included many recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 4 essentially stated that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government should make the Water Resources 
Preservation Act, which bans bulk exports of groundwater and 
surface water, permanent legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commission is of the 
opinion that bulk exports need to be forbidden by law and no 
chances taken, with the uncertainties of international trade 
agreements, such as NAFTA, WTO and the like. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the BAPE recommendations because they establish the 
framework in which Quebecers wish this resource essential for 
Quebec be exploited. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one side, well before May 2000, there was a symposium on 
water. On the other side, the BAPE report in May 2000, 
established the framework within which we wanted the Quebec 
government and the federal government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the consensus reached by the BAPE, the government is 
now introducing a bill—the act is already in force in Quebec, it 
was passed on November 24, 1999—aimed at preserving water 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this because that bill said very clearly that the 
transfer of Quebec ground and surface waters outside Quebec was 
prohibited. That bill was passed unanimously by the national 
asssembly in November 1999 and became law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That new act said we did not want to see a natural resource such 
as water being transferred outside Quebec. It also said clearly 
that not only the Quebec government but also the national 
assembly—its institution—wanted to prohibit the export of 
water since the bill was passed unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the federal strategy, which has three elements, we 
see the government clearly wants a Canada-wide accord to prohibit 
bulkwater removal out of Canada's five major water basins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that the provinces gave this agreement a rather 
chilly reception at the time. 
Why? Not because the provinces reacted on a whim but, quite the 
contrary, because there already was in some provinces, namely 
Alberta, British Columbia and even more in Quebec, a moratorium. 
Why? Because we had passed unanimously, on November 24, 1999, an 
act for the preservation of water, which is a natural resource. 
This is the reason why this bill got a chilly reception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was Quebec asking for? It was asking for two things, even 
before signing the agreement. First, we wished to wait for the 
report of the International Joint Commission on Canada's 
referral concerning water exports. Second, there is the water 
management policy issue, which is a current issue, since it is 
still being debated. 
I am deeply convinced that the government of Quebec will 
announce, in the months to come, a real water management policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were asking that the joint commission be given the time 
to render a decision on the referral and that Quebec be given 
the time to develop a water management policy, table that policy 
and adopt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be recognized that the bill does not take into 
account even one of Quebec's demands. Water management policy is 
not a trivial issue but a fundamental one since it 
inevitably interferes with Quebec's laws. With the bill, the 
federal government will not allow Quebec partners—not only the 
government, but also its partners—to establish this policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another clear demand made by Quebec, and not only Quebec but 
also by BAPE partners, regarding the export of water was that 
the federal government take its responsibilities and have this 
issue excluded from trade agreements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the evidence and documents the group Au Secours gave to 
the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement. I also 
recall the evidence, documents and briefs the Centre du droit de 
l'environnement du Québec gave to that same agency. These people 
had only one wish, which is that the Quebec government would show 
leadership and call to task the federal government and the 
minister in charge of the negotiations to ensure that water 
export will not be included in international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the aftermath of the summit of the Americas in Quebec city, 
we would have liked our government and the Minister for 
International Trade to show this kind of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 35 states that took part in the negotiations met in Montreal 
two weeks before the summit of the Americas. The 35 environment 
ministers who met to discuss this issue did not indicate clearly 
the principles that should be included in the free trade area of 
the Americas agreement concerning this issue. The government 
should have taken its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point is the whole concept of watershed. The 
bill does not give a definition. Regulations will take care of 
that. In Quebec, our great fear is that the federal government 
will once again use this new power to interfere in provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment ministers held a conference on Monday in 
Winnipeg. The federal minister and the ministers of all provinces 
and territories were present. 
The Quebec minister of the environment took that opportunity to 
express his concerns regarding the bill before us. It was not 
one of the main topics, but the environment ministers discussed 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the Quebec minister of the environment clearly stated 
that in his opinion Bill C-6 interfered with Quebec's 
jurisdiction over the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries and 
duplicated the Water Resources Preservation Act, which was 
passed unanimously by the Quebec national assembly on November 
24, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also indicated that the government of Quebec 
clearly responded to the wishes expressed by Quebecers. It has 
already banned bulk exports of groundwater and surface water 
from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, the Quebec minister of the environment, who was at 
that meeting in Winnipeg, took that opportunity to reiterate the 
fact that through this bill the federal government clearly 
showed its will to interfere directly in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect relates to section 13 in Bill C-6, which deals 
with water removal. It is rather clear that the provision 
prohibiting water removal could be interpreted as applying to 
waters other than boundary waters and to water basins within 
Quebec's territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that such a disposition would go beyond the 
requirements of the 1909 treaty, to the point of encroaching 
upon Quebec's jurisdiction over water resource management within 
its territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that Minister Bégin wrote to the federal 
Minister of the Environment on November 29, 1999.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He indicated to his federal counterpart that he would never 
tolerate federal interference in these areas of jurisdiction 
through this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect concerns the powers that the minister tries to 
give to himself through this bill, powers that we on our side of 
the House, at least we in the Bloc Quebecois, consider 
substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the federal government both 
use Bill C-6 to blow their powers up like a big balloon. We will 
not accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I recall that the minister is assuming all the powers. In 
the area of licensing, he assumes all the powers for the 
selection of the eligible projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister 
of the Environment that, whether we pass Bill C-6 soon or not, 
the International Joint Commission already has these powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we were not to adopt the bill, there is still a process 
or mechanism under the 1909 treaty and agreement providing that a 
country or a province cannot make a unilateral decision as far as 
the analysis is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Joint Commission is playing an important role. 
This bill will not change the mechanisms used by the

That is what he wrote in a letter, and I quote:

</I></B></P><P align=left>...since they are defined in the International Boundary Waters 
Treaty, which prohibits bulk removal of boundary waters from the 
water basins in which they are located... it will not apply to the 
removal of other non-boundary waters inside the water basin over 
which the provinces have full responsibility. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Must I recall that, in spite of the minister's letters, all the 
documents from the federal Department of Foreign Affairs say 
exactly the opposite. It is hard to make any sense out of 
this. 
Between what the minister says, what his department believes and 
what for us is undeniable, which is that where there are 
projects the International Joint Commission is always involved. 
What we are asking is that the federal government recognize the 
consultation process put in place in Quebec following the 
symposium on water, through the Bureau d'audiences publiques en 
environnement, which made public its report in May 2000, and to 
respect the Quebec water preservation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would ensure that the consensus reached in Quebec on the 
exportation of water is respected and that in future accords 
such as the FTAA, the government include the fundamental issue 
of water not being treated as a commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we wish that the federal government would start 
respecting more generally Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. 
That is what we are asking today, that is what we will be asking 
tomorrow and that is the reason we oppose Bill C-6. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, we are 
vehemently and firmly opposed to Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, we support the objective of preventing bulk removals or 
diversions, which would not be advisable. However, we say the 
bill will not achieve this objective. This is all the more 
serious because the federal government is taking advantage of an 
amendment to an international treaty implementation act to give 
itself more powers than those provided for in the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to develop these last elements. The first one 
concerns water and its importance. The BAPE just reminded 
us in a great way by proposing an admirable policy for Quebec. 
The international joint commission, which was created under 
the boundary waters treaty, has produced a report containing 
recommendations, which both the environment minister and the 
foreign affairs minister said they drew on to propose the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All the international joint commission's recommendations 
dealing with the measures to be taken regarding removal, 
consumptive use and conservation concern the provinces and 
northern states of the U.S., which, since 1985, are signatories

provinces and states are obliged to carry out 
general consultations on issues stipulated in the charter, 
especially the issues addressed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Joint Commission set up under the treaty

recommendations to the provinces and the states. Let me quote 
some of these recommendations. First, on the issue of removals. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without prejudice to the authority of the federal governments of 
the United States and Canada, the governments of the Great Lakes 
states and Ontario and Quebec should not permit any proposal for 
removal of water from the Great Lakes Basin to proceed unless 
the proponent can demonstrate that the removal would not 
endanger the integrity of the ecosystem of the Great Lakes Basin 
and— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is followed by a series of conditions. It goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>States and provinces shall ensure that the quality of all water 
returned meets the objectives of the Great Lakes Water Quality 
Agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation II reads as follows:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation II. Major New or Increased Consumptive Uses 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid endangering the integrity of the ecosystem of the Great 
Lakes Basin, and without prejudice to the authority of the

consumptive use of water from the Great Lakes Basin to proceed 
unless— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also followed by a series of conditions. Recommendation 
III, under the heading “Conservation” reads “In order to avoid 
endangering the integrity” and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation IV states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces and states should set standards— 
</I></B></P><P align=left> 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then follows a series of recommendations involving the federal 
governments: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—federal, state, and provincial governments should move quickly 
to remedy water use data deficiencies. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian and American federal governments are involved 
in research. The same thing applies to underground water. The 
federal government is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to existing institutions and mechanisms. What 
does the International Joint Commission, established by the 
boundary waters treaty between the United States and Canada, 
have to say? This is what it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help ensure the effective, cooperative, and timely 
implementation programs for the sustainable use of the water 
resources of the Great Lakes Basin, governments should use and 
build on existing institutions to implement the recommendations 
of this report. In this regard, the governments of the states 
and the provinces should take action, with respect to the 
implementation of the Great Lakes Charter— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the statement by the Minister of the 
Environment. I will not make the mistake of naming him. His 
statement shed a different light on the recommendations. Nowhere 
does the International Joint Commission recommend that the 
federal governments change the dynamics of existing relations 
and enact legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT73"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT73"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1600

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot help but ask ourselves why the federal government is 
so keen on trying to pass legislation that is, and I repeat it 
because it is important, an amendment, not to the treaty—because 
this would be done between the two countries—that was signed by 
Great Britain and the United States in 1909 and implemented by 
an act  but to the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it normal that an amendment to a treaty 
implementation act should change the conditions under which the 
treaty is implemented, but above all that it should increase the 
federal government's powers by trickery? One can understand 
that the government would go this way if what it wanted was to 
increase its powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constitutionally, the powers—as read, for example, by the NAFTA 
commission for environmental co-operation with regard to the 
Canadian legal framework on the environment—are as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the implementation of an international treaty is 
usually effected by the initial ratification of that treaty by 
the federal government and the adoption, where necessary, of 
appropriate statutes as part of the internal law of the country— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the Canadian Constitution is silent as to the power 
of any level of government to make treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 132 of the 
Canadian Constitution refers only to the treaty-implementing 
power of Canada as a part of the British Empire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has since become an independent member of the 
international community and, as such, has the authority to enter 
into international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal government does not appear to have the 
authority to bind any of the provinces. Unless the courts were 
to hold otherwise in the future, nothing can force a province to 
perform, through legislation, the obligations set by a treaty 
signed by the federal government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the obligations given to the provinces by the treaty 
were implemented through the Great Lakes charter. I stress the 
fact that the federal government is using an excuse to extend 
its powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach is all the more intriguing, troublesome, because 
the Minister of Environment, in recalling that the international 
joint commission said, following its study, that the Great Lakes 
basin must be protected because there is only 1% of this 
enormous expanse of freshwater that is renewable—the rest is not 
renewable, being what was left behind after the glaciers 
melted—says that it is the greatest freshwater basin in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the international joint commission considers caution is the 
watchword for the management of water in the Great Lakes basin, 
is it not equally so for the smaller bodies of water or 
ecosystems across Canada, wherever they are located? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will deal with Newfoundland. He adds: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to address the trade 
implications of Canada's policy approach. A number of persons 
and groups have called on the federal government to use an 
export ban. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says the main problem is this: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Canadian governments have full sovereignty over the management 
of water in its natural state, and in exercising this 
sovereignty are not constrained by trade agreements. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says Canadian governments when he should have said the 
provinces. He goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's views on this matter has been supported by a wide range 
of expert opinion. The international joint commission came to 
similar conclusions in its final report. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also forgot to mention that the international joint 
commission believes it is likely that freshwater before removal 
will not be part of trade deals but that, given the rulings made 
by the WTO—and to put it more simply, given the fact that its 
regulations ensure that the Tower of Pisa keeps leaning the same 
way—there is no absolute guarantee that freshwater before 
removal will be excluded from future trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before the House a bill that is supposed to protect our 
water resources from the threat of trade deals. Who 
negotiates trade agreements for Canada if it is not the same 
government that is refusing to let the provinces take part in the 
negotiating process? Is that government not a bit schizophrenic? 
It is using the potential consequences of any future trade deal 
to warn us that we need an act prohibiting bulk water exports, 
removals and diversions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the bill, the government is grabbing some new powers. 
Pursuant to the bill, the government will now have the authority 
to make regulations defining what a water basin is. It will be 
able to determine through regulation what river or affluent is 
part of the basin when it is clear, as my colleague pointed out 
earlier, that the treaty does not deal with this issue. With the 
bill, the government is going further than the treaty and is 
ensuring that it can act through regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, this seemingly technical bill boils down to the fact 
that the Canadian government, instead of relying on the process 
that has been in place since 1985 and that can respond quickly 
to the International Joint Commission's recommendations, wants 
to have its own infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, a federal licence will be required to build a dam 
on a river which is not necessarily part of the water basin but 
which would be defined as being part of it under the 
regulations. For example, if Quebec decides to build a dam, the 
federal government will have the authority to prevent it from 
doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know that Quebec is the largest consumer of 
hydroelectricity. In environmental terms, this means that 
Canada's output of pollutants is lesser than if Canada did not 
include Quebec. 
Quebec has definitely chosen hydroelectricity over nuclear 
energy. Of course, it had mighty rivers to harness and it did 
it even though it had to correct a few things here and there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to read the BAPE 
conclusion, which is not about Bill C-6. This conclusion explains 
why we will strongly oppose Bill C-6 and why we will speak out 
against the illegitimacy of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the BAPE speaking. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—water is an element essential to life, an element for which 
there is no substitute.  The policy's first priority should be 
the health of aquatic systems, a prerequisite for human health. 
Because it is associated with the rights to life, access to 
water in Quebec must be considered a right.  Access to waterways 
and bodies of water in a manner yet to be undefined. Access to 
quality drinking water, and free and universal access for the 
needs inherent in human life. How rates are set must not 
interfere with this essential right to water of anyone living in 
Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The constant and driving search for quality is the common 
vision, the overriding focus and the ethical foundation for the 
management of water and aquatic environments.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the principle of precaution must guide decisions 
which ultimately affect biodiversity and life on earth.  The 
field of action is broad, and is founded on respect for common 
values. 
The management of river basins is a force of peace, security, 
development and harmony in its natural sphere of influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 3% of the planet's freshwater reserves, Quebec holds in its 
hands a part of humanity's common heritage. 
It must manage this heritage responsibly.  We hope that our 
report will make a useful contribution towards this goal.

not have optimistic plans, there is no hope.  Dreamers and 
utopia are needed to pave the way for the future”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that, Quebec must be able to have a comprehensive water 
policy.  We will not sit quietly by while the federal government 
attempts to erode our jurisdiction and impose a logic completely 
at odds with Quebec's objectives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</b>  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that the essential 
ingredient that we should all be talking about is sovereignty 
over water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the previous speaker's concerns in this regard 
because sovereignty can relate to Quebec, the provinces and to 
the federal government.  There are a lot of concerns when we get 
into federal and provincial areas, such as in this bill.  We have 
other examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of British Columbia we have some major concerns 
about a bill dealing with marine conservation being put forward 
by the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  We are very concerned that 
any initiatives we may want to take dealing with west coast oil 
and gas, which is a provincial initiative albeit usually with a 
provincial-federal syndicate, could easily be pre-empted by the 
actions of the Minister of Canadian Heritage with a totally 
different agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to elaborate a little more on the 
subject.  It is my view that federal short term initiatives or 
thinking can be a real detriment to regional or provincial 
initiatives and can circumvent what is for the greater good in

legislation that has emanated from this place recently.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thrust of my speech centres on the fact that the bill 
does not allow the institutions in place, which are essentially 
composed of the American states in co-operation, and the Canadian 
provinces in co-operation, to function as they have since 1985, 
in keeping with the recommendations of the international joint 
commission.  The federal government wants to inaugurate a whole 
new infrastructure instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague will certainly understand that deciding whether or 
not a permit for water diversion should be issued requires more 
than three public servants and four computers.  The bill has a 
distinct air of improvization about it, as well as 
an air of lack of confidence in the provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I have stressed the joint commission recommendations 
so much is that it strikes me as extraordinarily important that 
the IJC, as a body created under the international treaty, be 
able to recommend the use of existing institutions in order to 
get important recommendations into prompt, concrete and 
co-ordinated application.  Neither of the ministers has given any 
explanation in this connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that their bill is not a contradiction.  Their position 
is more defensive than confidence inspiring. I would even say 
that it does not show respect for the competency, intelligence 
and democratic sense of responsible populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no surprise but I must say that my astonishment is 
constantly renewed by the federal government's imagination in

justice system, and make administrative amendments to the 
Firearms Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I will deal with the proposed amendments to better protect 
our children.  The provisions that deal with protecting children 
respond to the government's commitment in the Speech from the 
Throne to safeguard children from criminals on the Internet and 
to ensure that children are protected from those who would prey 
upon their vulnerability.  They also respond to a consensus of 
ministers responsible for justice at the last FPT meeting to 
create an offence of Internet luring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet is a new technology that can be used to stimulate 
the communication of ideas and facilitate research, but, as with 
any instrument, when placed in the wrong hands it can be used for 
ill and to cause harm.  Canadians will not tolerate a situation 
where individuals, from the safety and secrecy of their house, 
use the anonymity of the Internet to lure children into 
situations where they can be exploited sexually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new offence seeks to address what has been reported as a 
growing phenomenon not only in our country but globally.  It 
criminalizes communicating through a computer system for the 
purpose of facilitating the commission of a sexual offence 
against a child or the abduction of a child. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to ensure that those who view, or transmit child 
pornography to others, will not escape criminal liability by 
using new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will extend the scope of current child pornography offences 
to make it clearer that actions that constitute an offence when 
committed with traditional means remain an offence when 
committed with electronic means. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 seeks to create four new offences: an offence of 
transmitting child pornography to cover one to one distribution, 
such as e-mail sent to one person only; an offence of making 
child pornography available to cover those who post child 
pornography on a publicly accessible website but take no other 
steps to distribute it; an offence of exporting child pornography 
to meet our international obligation; and an offence of accessing 
child pornography to capture those who intentionally view child 
pornography on the net but where the legal notion of possession 
may be problematic.  The offence is defined to ensure that 
inadvertent viewing would not be caught under this offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn to three other proposed measures to better 
protect vulnerable Canadians.  The first measure I wish to 
mention is the offence of criminal harassment, or stalking as it 
is sometimes referred to.  This is a serious offence that can 
have a devastating effect upon the emotional and physical 
well-being of the victim. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-15, this government is taking strong measures to ensure 
that the criminal justice system treats criminal harassment as 
the serious offence that we know it to be. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625
<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response to this issue is twofold: first, to 
strengthen the existing legislation; and, second, to strengthen 
enforcement of the law through comprehensive guidelines for 
criminal justice personnel on criminal harassment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-15 responds to our first commitment by proposing to 
increase the maximum penalty for criminal harassment when 
prosecuted on indictment from five to ten years.  This sends a 
strong signal to would-be stalkers.  Criminal harassment is a 
serious offence and its sentence would now better reflect this 
serious nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to our second commitment relating to enhancing the 
enforcement of the criminal harassment provisions, I am pleased 
to note that together with our federal, provincial and 
territorial counterparts a handbook for police and crown 
prosecutors on criminal harassment was developed and released in 
December 1999.  The handbook provides a practical set of 
guidelines for criminal justice personnel on all aspects of a 
criminal harassment case, including victim safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now wish to address the difficult issue of home invasions, one 
that has been raised by a number of my colleagues on all sides of 
the House.  The term home invasion is generally used to describe 
a robbery or break and enter of a private residence when the 
perpetrator forces entry while the occupants are at home, and 
this is key, and the perpetrator threatens to use or does use 
violence against the occupants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment to the criminal code would indicate that 
where the offender's conduct was in the nature of a home invasion 
the court must consider this to be an aggravating factor when 
determining the sentence to be imposed.  Such an amendment would 
provide clear direction to the courts and would express 
parliament's view that home invasion is a grave form of criminal 
conduct which must be dealt with appropriately during the 
sentencing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important measure proposed in Bill C-15 is the new 
offence of disarming or attempting to disarm a peace officer. 
This new offence would apply to anyone who tries to take away an 
officer's weapon when the officer is acting in the course of his 
or her duties.  It is proposed that this new offence carry a 
maximum penalty of five years to reflect the seriousness of the 
offence and to send a clear message that taking or attempting to 
take a police officer's weapon would not be tolerated.  The 
safety of police officers is a priority for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal law amendment act, 2001, would revive amendments 
introduced in the last parliament dealing with cruelty to 
animals.  The proposed reforms have two primary objectives: to 
simplify and better organize the existing laws and to enhance the 
penalties for animal cruelty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular we are increasing the penalties for animal cruelty 
offences with the highest penalty being five years in prison, up 
from the current maximum of six months.  We would eliminate the 
current limit of two years maximum duration for an order 
prohibiting the offender from possessing animals and would 
include a new power for the court to order as part of a sentence 
that the offender repay to a humane society the reasonable costs 
associated with the care of the animal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make clear this afternoon that these changes do 
not in any way negatively affect the many legitimate activities 
that involve animals, such as hunting, farming, or medical and 
scientific research.  These are regulated activities subject to 
specific technical rules and regulations and codes of practice. 
The criminal law is not being used to establish or modify 
industry standards but rather to prohibit conduct that is grossly 
unacceptable.  Simply put, what is lawful today in the course of 
legitimate activities would be lawful when the bill receives 
royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law already requires that we treat animals humanely and with 
respect.  These amendments would ensure that the law can 
adequately deal with those who would wilfully abuse animals.  I 
believe that all members of the House can support this principle. 
There is no subject on which I receive more mail from Canadians 
on a weekly basis than on the question of modernizing our laws in 
relation to cruelty to animals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak now in relation to the proposed amendments 
concerning firearms.  The Canadian firearms program is an example 
of the preventive approach our government takes to public safety. 
Moreover, the program is already achieving higher levels of 
public safety for all Canadians and the facts demonstrate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since December 1, 1998, more than 3,000 licences have been 
refused or revoked by public safety authorities.  The number of 
revocations is 26 times higher than the total of the five 
previous years.  Overall the licensing compliance rate in Canada 
is now over 90%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have learned from the licensing experience.  We have 
also listened to the concerns of gun owners and other Canadians 
about program efficiency and client service.  We are proposing 
administrative changes to facilitate the registration process and 
to continue to ensure a high level of service to clients.  These 
administrative changes do not affect the deadline of January 1, 
2003, for registration of all firearms nor the government's 
commitment to public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are responding to the needs and wishes of Canadians and 
firearms owners by proposing changes that will make the program 
more user friendly, more cost efficient and client oriented.  We 
will design a more streamlined system by simplifying the licence 
renewal process, by redesigning the registration process and by 
making better use of new and emerging Internet technology, for 
example, by allowing for registration of firearms online.  We 
also intend to improve efficiency and reduce costs, for example, 
by staggering firearms licence renewals to avoid a surge of 
applications in five year cycles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these amendments, we will reach a balance between the 
interests of responsible firearms owners and our shared objective 
of public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efficiency of any criminal justice system depends upon its 
ability to protect the innocent while bringing those who are 
guilty of crime to justice.  Despite all the precautions that our 
justice system takes to avoid the conviction of an innocent 
person, no system is infallible.  Wrongful convictions can occur 
and regrettably have occurred in the past.  The names Donald 
Marshall, David Milgaard and Guy Paul Morin make my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such cases our entire justice system finds itself in 
disrepute.  That is why Bill C-15 includes important improvements 
to section 690 of the criminal code, the conviction review 
process.  It is a final safety net for those who are the victims 
of wrongful conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1998 we released a public consultation paper seeking 
submissions on how our conviction review process could be 
improved.  The consultations informed the measures now found in 
Bill C-15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate decision making authority in criminal conviction 
reviews will remain with the federal Minister of Justice, who is 
accountable to parliament and to the people of Canada.  The 
Minister of Justice can recognize and maintain the traditional 
jurisdiction of the courts while providing a fair and just remedy 
in those exceptional cases that have somehow fallen through the 
cracks of the conventional justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, maintaining the status quo is not an acceptable option. 
Therefore the amendments to section 690 will provide 
investigative powers to those investigating cases on behalf of 
the Minister of Justice.  This will allow investigators to compel 
witnesses to testify and documents to be produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to make the conviction review process more open and 
accountable, ministers of justice will now be required to provide 
an annual report to parliament and a website will be created to 
give applicants information on the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that these amendments are the most efficient and 
effective way to improve the post-appellant extrajudicial 
conviction review process in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn briefly to the area of criminal procedure reform. 
The Department of Justice has been working closely with the 
provinces and territories on criminal procedure reform for some 
years.  This work is now in its third phase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of phase three are to simplify trial procedure, 
modernize the criminal justice system and enhance its efficiency 
through the increased use of technology, better protect victims 
and witnesses in criminal trials, and provide speedy trials in 
accordance with charter requirements.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to bring criminal procedure into the 21st century. 
This phase reflects our efforts to modernize our procedure 
without in any way reducing the measure of justice provided by 
the system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, the provinces and territories support 
these reforms.  As they are responsible for the administration of 
justice, I believe that we should do our best to give them the 
tools they need to ensure the efficient and effective operation 
of the criminal justice system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am sure the standing committee will give Bill 
C-15 its usual thorough review and examination.  I believe it 
contains a number of important improvements to the criminal 
justice system and measures that will contribute to the 
protection and safety of all Canadians.  I call on all members of 
the House to support the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance)</b> moved 
that Bill C-250, an act to amend the Criminal Code (theft of a 
motor vehicle), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to again rise to speak 
about one of my private member's initiatives.  Once again the 
Liberal majority on the subcommittee of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs has decided, for whatever reason, to 
make this initiative a non-votable matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go into a rant about that, but suffice it to say I 
have to wonder why a select few members of this place are able to 
control all private members' business to the extent that they and 
only they decide which issues have even a modicum of opportunity 
to become law within the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that many members from all sides of the House 
have become frustrated and disenchanted with the present scheme, 
but it will never change unless the government backbenchers 
forget about the carrots at the end of the stick the Prime 
Minister continues to hold out for them.  Members of this place 
should be doing what is right for the country.  I said I would 
not get into a rant, so I will move on to Bill C-250. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-250 is a relatively simple bill.  Its purpose is to 
ensure that a person who is convicted of more than one theft of a 
motor vehicle receives a minimum of four years' imprisonment for 
every conviction following the first conviction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is aimed at the repeat car thief.  Before those on the 
other side and perhaps the member for Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert 
attack me once again for being too tough on our poor misguided 
criminal offenders, I will point out that I am specifically 
aiming the legislation at the professional car thief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most of us know, professional car thievery is more and more 
attributable to organized crime.  I will illustrate the 
affiliation between repeat car thieves and organized crime in a 
few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not be entirely correct to claim that this proposal is 
only aimed at organized criminals in the normal definition of 
that term.  We have a number of criminal organizations that have 
developed a specialty of stealing motor vehicles just as a form 
of illegal activity.  They might just be a couple of individuals 
who want to supplement their annual income or they may in fact 
live for the benefits of their illegal enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, auto theft is and should be of great concern to the 
Canadian public.  We are all well aware of our increased auto 
insurance rates due to the escalation in motor theft.  From 1986 
to 1997, auto thefts in Canada increased by 94%.  In 1997, 
187,500 vehicles were reported stolen.  The problem costs the 
insurance industry approximately $600 million annually.  It only 
stands to reason that most if not all of that $600 million cost 
of motor vehicle theft is passed on from insurance companies to 
those of us who have to insure our vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has motor vehicle theft become such a growth industry? There 
are a number of factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with the sophistication of these professional offenders, 
there is relatively low risk.  Most of us have to leave our 
vehicles outside at some point during the day:  when we go 
shopping, when we drive them to work, when we leave them at the 
local transit parking lot, or even overnight while we are 
sleeping.  Motor vehicles are often left unattended for minutes 
or hours at a time and are so common that thieves can approach 
them with little fear of attracting attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is a high return.  With motor vehicle prices 
rising toward a common value of $30,000 and beyond, it becomes 
very profitable for crooks to specialize in auto theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is an avoidance of income taxes.  Regardless of 
what the Minister of Finance says, income taxes are particularly 
burdensome to most of our citizens.  One of the exceptions to the 
cumbersome weight of taxes is the criminal element.  Auto thieves 
avoid paying high taxes or any taxes at all by chopping or 
disassembling motor vehicles and selling the parts to the parts 
industry.  They also obtain vehicle identification numbers from 
wrecks, reattach those numbers to stolen vehicles and essentially 
put a new and improved auto back onto the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will divert myself for just a moment to give the House just 
one example of how devastating this practice of switching vehicle 
identification numbers, or VINs, can be to the unsuspecting 
buyer.  Just last week it was reported how Tammy Mulvey of Ottawa 
was victimized by this scheme.  She is a 22 year old who works 
for a mobile canteen company.  I can just imagine how proud she 
was when she purchased her first car for $8,000, a 1993 Honda 
Civic.  I do not know that I can imagine how she felt when the 
police helped a tow truck driver take it away.  It was stolen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tammy had little protection.  She bought the vehicle with a VIN 
that was free and clear from problems or legal claims. 
Unfortunately, that VIN did not belong to the car she bought.  It 
was identified by the police as part of a $10 million 
international motor vehicle theft ring.  Tammy was the loser, a 
victim because that car actually belonged to someone else.  A 
loss of $8,000 at the age of 22 is a nasty life experience for 
someone just starting out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the other factors that ensure that motor 
vehicle theft is a growth industry?  As the example illustrates, 
organized crime finds it quite profitable.  Organized crime also 
finds many other uses for its ill-gotten gains.  Police are 
convinced that many, if not most, of the biker gangs drive stolen 
vehicles and motorcycles.  With motorcycles it is relatively easy 
to have three or four individuals pick up a Harley off the street 
and throw it into the back of a pickup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard stories about how criminals use stolen 
vehicles to commit crimes, crimes like drug trafficking and armed 
robbery just to mention a couple.  A car is stolen.  It is used 
in the offence and is then dumped through various means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stolen vehicles with fraudulent paperwork can become a currency 
within organized crime activity.  These vehicles are traded for 
other items of value.  Stolen vehicles have been bartered for 
drugs from foreign countries.  Apparently it is quite simple to 
ship motor vehicles in those sealed international shipping 
containers we have all seen travelling across the world on ships, 
trains and trucks.  Many North American vehicles are worth double 
their value in many foreign countries.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become very profitable for organized criminals to steal a 
luxury vehicle, put it in a shipping container, put it on a ship 
and sell it to a wealthy buyer, with no questions asked and no 
international vehicle tracking system in place.  We should 
recognize that many countries have few car dealerships and high 
tariffs on imported vehicles.  These criminals are filling a void 
that cries out for this form of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I will discuss about the causes of auto theft as 
a growth industry has to do with the little risk of jail time for 
the offence.  We have enough difficulty convincing the Liberal 
government to impose jail time for violent offences.  Auto theft 
is not a violent offence.  Our courts often look at auto theft as 
being protected by car insurance.  We all lose a bit but no one 
suffers a great deal.  That is absolutely wrong headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we be sponsoring criminals who refuse to abide by the 
norms of society and who sponge on all law-abiding citizens?  Why 
should we be permitting organized criminals to expand their 
enterprises, to expand their influence and to increase the threat 
to society when it is so easy to address just one aspect of their 
operations?  The bill would impose a mandatory minimum sentence 
of four years on professional vehicle thieves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now provide some anecdotal support for what I have been 
saying.  An RCMP intelligence report dealing with a multimillion 
dollar organized crime ring whereby luxury cars were stolen and 
shipped overseas stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups, motivated by the low risk, huge profits and light 
penalties associated with auto theft, are operating virtual 
stolen-car pipelines. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ring then funnelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to a 
terrorist organization, according to the RCMP report.  We can see 
how profits from the theft of motor vehicles generates far more 
serious and dangerous criminal activities.  The director of RCMP 
criminal intelligence said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been increasing use of violence, including 
car-jackings and home invasions, to obtain cars. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Canadian Police Association listed auto 
theft as one of the major activities of organized crime. 
Constable Jim Messner of the RCMP auto theft squad in Calgary 
says that his city has become a shipping hub for stolen high 
priced vehicles for organized crime rings.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind that the majority of unrecovered 
stolen vehicles is a result of organized crime.  We know 
organized crime groups have stolen vehicles for a number of 
things, including transporting contraband. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one weekend last year, 31 vehicles were stolen in Burnaby, 
B.C.  I do not have the figure for how many were stolen that 
particular weekend for Vancouver, Surrey, New Westminster or 
North Vancouver, but 31 vehicles for the Burnaby portion of the 
lower mainland is a symptom of a major problem.  In one seven day 
period last year, 128 vehicles were reported stolen from the 
streets of Ottawa.  According to Statistics Canada about 450 
vehicles are stolen every day in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these statistics are in spite of car owners having to ensure 
their vehicles are locked each and every time they are left 
alone, and in spite of anti-theft devices and car alarms.  Motor 
vehicle theft is a matter of significant public interest. 
Unfortunately it does not seem to be of any significant 
government interest as it has decided not to make the bill 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent operation against organized crime police from Canada 
and the United States were able to lay 270 charges and recover 
close to $10 million in stolen vehicles.  Some 193 vehicles were 
recovered from as diverse a distribution as Ottawa, Toronto, 
Waterloo, Texas, Florida and Panama. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For any of those listening who do the math most of the vehicles 
recovered were from the high end of the motor vehicle industry. 
Lincoln Navigators, Volvos and Mercedes were particularly 
attractive to these individuals.  Twenty-five people were 
arrested and  at that time the police had warrants for 
twenty-four others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that many will get a slap on the wrist 
for stealing vehicles.  The authorities will only be able to 
guess how many vehicles passed through this organization 
successfully while our police were forced to expend scarce 
resources on their enterprise.  More than 150 officers were 
involved in this takedown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obviously time to change the law.  It is not right that we 
merely warehouse these individuals for a few months.  For them it 
is merely an opportunity to rest up before returning to our 
communities to pick up where they left off.  For them these 
lenient sentences are nothing more than a cost of doing business. 
We must show that as parliamentarians we are very serious about 
addressing this form of crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today to Bill C-250 which would amend part 9 
of the criminal code dealing with offences against property.  The 
proposal calls for the creation of a new offence:  theft of a 
motor vehicle with a value of more than $5,000.  It then provides 
for a minimum sentence of four years if convicted a second time 
for theft of a vehicle over $5,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume that the purpose of the legislation is to combat the 
very serious problem of car theft.  Unfortunately the bill 
ignores two basic realities.  First, all theft over $5,000 is 
already an indictable offence under section 322 and 334 of the 
criminal code.  It is already effectively dealt with under the 
existing sentencing provisions of the code.  More important, the 
legislation would do little to combat the problem of auto theft, 
a problem that the government is fighting on many fronts in 
partnership with Canadians from every province and territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment to the criminal code sweeps aside the 
fundamental principles of sentencing currently in place and 
establishes a very specific regime for an individual facing a 
second or subsequent auto theft.  The theory is that if we catch 
all the repeat offenders and throw away the key for four years 
the war against auto theft would be won.  I recognize that some 
convicted criminals reoffend, but imposing a mandatory four year 
sentence for a second offence does not make sense in light of all 
that we know about this offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what we do know.  The vast majority of car thefts are 
joyriders or individuals who use the stolen vehicle in the 
commission of another offence.  We know this because according to 
the Insurance Council of Canada the rate of recovery of stolen 
vehicles is very high, about 70% to 80% in recent years. Further, 
young offenders commit almost half the reported auto thefts. 
How does the proposal address these aspects of the problem?  We 
know that hard time in a penitentiary itself does little to 
rehabilitate offenders, so how do we address this serious 
problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the second reality the proposed legislation 
fails to recognize.  While auto theft has been and continues to 
be a serious problem, it is actively and aggressively being 
addressed.  The problem is being attacked not only by the 
sanctions available in the criminal code but by every level of 
government, policing agency, private company, association and by 
individual Canadians.  The existing sanctions within the criminal 
code and case law effectively achieve the objectives of criminal 
sentencing for both first time and repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Auto theft falls under the class of offences in the criminal 
code relating to thefts of property.  Section 334 of the criminal 
code provides that the theft of property exceeding $5,000 is an 
indictable offence for which the individual is liable to 
imprisonment for up to 10 years.  This provision reflects 
parliament's recognition that theft over $5,000 is a serious 
offence and it includes auto theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, joyriding is a specific offence under the criminal code 
to take into account the very unique nature of this crime.  In 
addition, if an offender has prior convictions the sentencing 
judge, under current procedures, is bound to treat this as an 
aggravating factor that would result in a harsher sentence than 
would otherwise be imposed.  A sentencing court does not stop 
there, however, nor should it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of sentencing in Canada require a judge to look 
at all the circumstances of the crime, including those of the 
offender and of the victim, the good and the bad, the mitigating 
and the aggravating.  Those circumstances must be weighed in 
light of the fundamental principles of sentencing.  The first and 
paramount principle of sentencing is that the sentence must be in 
proportion to the crime or crimes committed, and to the degree of 
responsibility of the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put simply, shoplifting by an 18 year old teenager versus the 
robbing of a convenience store by a professional criminal may 
both be prosecuted as theft under section 334 of the criminal 
code.  However, to sentence both to six months in jail would not 
make any sense.  The entire sentencing structure of the criminal 
justice system is built around this basic principle of 
proportionality.  That is why, for example, there is no minimum 
mandatory sentence for a section 334. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentencing court must also consider the remaining well 
established objectives of sentencing: the protection of society; 
reparations to and acknowledgements of victims; deterrence to 
others; denunciation of the crime; and the rehabilitation of the 
offender.  Unfortunately, Bill C-250 would, in too many cases, 
force the sentencing court to throw away these long established 
and useful sentencing principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government clearly supports the notion that those who 
habitually re-offend ought to be punished to a greater extent 
than the first time offender.  However, our current system, 
recently revamped in 1996 by Bill C-41, the Sentencing Reform 
Act, provides the necessary flexibility to accomplish this 
objective.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The determination of sentences therefore requires the 
consideration of a number of sentencing principles and 
objectives.  In the absence of the proposal contained in Bill 
C-250, the existing regime enables courts to impose sentences for 
auto theft that are just and fair to the victim, to society and 
even to the offender.  Many sentencing options are available 
which can and should be fully considered to tailor the sentence 
to the specific circumstances of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the problem of motor vehicle theft is international in 
scope, the recent international crime victimization survey 
conducted in 1996 revealed that Canada's rate of vehicle theft 
ranked as one of the lowest among industrialized countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, 18 out of every 1,000 Canadian vehicle owners 
experienced a motor vehicle theft, compared to, for example, a 
rate of 33 per 1,000 owners in England, and since then we have 
made considerable progress.  We have seen a steady decline in the 
rate of vehicle thefts every year to 5.3 thefts per 1,000 
vehicles in 1999 according to statistics from Statistics Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent amendments to the criminal code introduced by the 
Minister of Justice would make it easier to investigate and 
prosecute organized crime rings which would put a further dent in 
vehicle theft.  The government is currently co-ordinating a 
multijurisdictional analysis of the role of organized crime in 
auto theft as part of our national agenda to combat organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a number of non-statutory measures have been 
employed over recent years to prevent motor vehicle theft in 
Canada, a measure that the government either initiated or 
partnered with other governments, agencies, organizations and 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we are actively involved with the provinces and 
numerous police agencies in the establishment of the national 
stolen and wrecked vehicle monitoring program designed as a 
comprehensive database available to the police from coast to 
coast.  This would make it tougher to steal a car at one end of 
the country and sell it at the other end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another initiative involves car manufacturers working in 
conjunction with the police and insurance companies to design 
more effective security features for their motor vehicles.  The 
government recently initiated the business action program on 
crime prevention in partnership with police and insurance 
companies across Canada to educate Canadians as to what they as 
individuals can do to fight auto theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these measures are designed to reduce car theft and together 
with the existing criminal code provisions provide a 
comprehensive scheme for addressing this serious problem.  While 
the imposition of a four year minimum sentence for a second or 
subsequent offence may look appealing to a few hardliners, it is 
simply not a realistic alternative to what already exists.  It 
does not give the police, the prosecutors or the courts any 
additional tools to combat the problem.  As a result, the 
Minister of Justice cannot support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to compliment my hon. 
colleague, the member for Surrey North, for his work on this 
non-partisan bill and for his presentation to us today.  The bill 
is meant to add to the protection of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As individuals, certain things that come under special 
categories are perhaps more personal to us than other things.  If 
I were to start down the list, my family would be number one in 
importance, my home would be next and my car would follow.  I am 
only one of many individuals who would say that we do love our 
cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the first car I bought after joining the workforce 
and being able to spend more than a couple of hundred dollars on 
it.  One day I came out of my house and noticed that my car had 
been smashed by a hit and run driver.  I was thankful that it was 
not stolen.  It was not a car in the category of cars we are 
talking about today, but I will never forget the agonizing 
feeling I had in the pit of my stomach when I saw what had 
happened to my car. 
We need to recognize that a car may be in a special category.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize minimum sentences are something that we have been 
reluctant to put into Canadian law in many cases.  However there 
are quite a number of cases where there are minimum sentences.  I 
do not think this is something that would be put forward only by 
hardliners or those who would be considered extremists in one way 
or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want protection from crime and from risk of injury, 
especially protection from fear associated with the different 
crimes committed in Canadian cities.  Canadians expect and desire 
this from their government.  Therefore, many of my constituents 
seem to be quite prepared to be a little more tough on crime, if 
that is what this would be, especially on theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of instances where minimum sentencing is 
used, for instance in the firearms, bookmaking, living on the 
avails of a person, wounding with intent and some impaired 
driving conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to again reiterate that the Canadian Police 
Association has listed car theft as one of the main avails of 
organized crime.  I also read the comments of the RCMP member 
from Calgary.  He stated that that place was perhaps a hub for 
organized crime and car theft.  He agreed that many other police 
groups across the country would see this as a very important 
problem which needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs associated with auto theft are staggering and rising. 
It is a waste of our personal resources.  We have a major problem 
that is simply not going to go away, as just business as usual. 
Without penalties that would increase enough to exceed the 
benefits of crime, it is hard for us to think about deterring it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My city of Regina is notorious for auto theft and vandalism. 
This again is a little different category.  Just this week my 
executive assistant was shot at in Regina.  We are becoming 
famous for shootings in Regina.  A couple of weeks ago several 
vehicles were shot at.  We were lucky that my assistant's car was 
not hit with a real bullet.  It was a paint gun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem illustrated here is the fact that there is such 
little respect for personal property belonging to others.  This 
causes fear, loss of work, police costs associated with this, the 
removal of the paint from the car and all the effort and energy 
that went into dealing with this sort of misdemeanour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of disrespect springs out of the lack of 
accountability in so many areas of those who would be involved in 
the life of crime.  Auto theft in Canada is in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars and is rising.  I would ask at what point 
would we as parliamentarians be prepared to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Province-wide, Saskatchewan shows that the number of claims have 
moved from 2,700 in 1999, at a cost of $8.7 million to 2,944 in 
the year 2000, at a cost of $9.3 million.  By March 1 we had 563 
claims at a cost of $1.9 million.  Breaking that down to the city 
of Regina, in 1999 there were 1,437 claims costing $3.9 million. 
In the year 2000 there were 1,574 claims costing $4.4 million. 
This year's bill to March 1 is already up to $900,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that these costs do not even include the 
articles taken from vehicles.  They do not include the damage to 
vehicles that were eventually recovered and then repaired at cost 
less than the $700 or so deductible that we have in our insurance 
plan in the province of Saskatchewan.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police costs also must figure into the cost of car thefts.  One 
of our goals should be to curb auto theft to the point that 
perhaps we could divert some of those police funds and associated 
costs to crime prevention of other types. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cost of courts is also an ingredient.  Auto thefts place a 
burden on our court system and they will be a demand for more 
judges and court officials to deal with an ever increasing crime 
load in this area, if something is not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then of course there are always rehabilitation and detention 
costs for those who have offended and those who are apprehended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are tired of having to pay for all of this over and 
over.  They expect that we would be sensitive enough to adjust 
the penalties imposed in order to be a little stronger deterrent 
to crime, especially as it relates to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Insurance costs to individuals are something that we need to 
really remember.  Insurance rates rise.  When we consider the 
$600 million that auto theft costs the country each year, it 
costs us as individuals even more than that because our rates 
rise.  We also have to pay the deductibles and those kinds of 
things.  It becomes very important economically.  It is the 
inconvenience of it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan, if we do not lock our cars when we are out, 
even if we hop out for a moment for a cup of coffee at Robin's, 
then there is a question as to whether or not the insurance will 
even cover that.  There are all kinds of minor inconveniences 
from security at home to security when we are on the road or 
whatever that must be taken into account simply because we do not 
get serious enough with those who would steal our vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The council also reported that there were 165,000 vehicles 
stolen across Canada in 1999.  It is unacceptable to have 450 
vehicles stolen each day in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is targeted at organized crime and does not increase 
the punishment for a young offender who steals the vehicle for a 
joyride.  That is another important issue which needs to be dealt 
with.  I am glad the hon. parliamentary secretary pointed out 
that the bill does not address the crimes committed, the joy 
rides, by young offenders.  May I add, unfortunately neither does 
the new young offenders bill.  The new youth criminal justice act 
also fails to address this problem.  I am glad the parliamentary 
secretary noted that.  It would be wonderful if we could make 
some changes in the young offenders bill perhaps to address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this bill targets a certain level of car theft, that 
which would be carried out by organized crime, so we need not 
cross the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks to increase the penalties and drive back 
organized crime related to auto thefts to make it more of an 
infraction, to give a little encouragement to the courts to be 
stronger when these offences are repeated and repeated.  There is 
no issue respecting judicial discretion, but parliament must 
determine the penalties and the judiciary must honour and respect 
the wishes of parliament.  If not, who speaks for Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I compliment my colleague from Surrey 
North for putting Bill C-250 forward.  Ever since he arrived here 
in 1997, the he has repeatedly put forth eloquent and 
constructive suggestions to the government on a wide variety of 
issues, in particular the Young Offenders Act.  I hope the 
government has seen the wisdom of what he has been saying and 
implements many of the suggestions that he has put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's bill, Bill C-250, strikes a balance and deals with the 
issue of theft of cars in a very reasonable way. The scope of the 
problem cannot be under estimated.  More than $1 billion worth of 
cars are stolen every single year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition about a quarter of a billion dollars worth of damage 
is done to those cars.  It costs taxpayers about a half a billion 
dollars per year.  The rate of increase in car theft is 
extraordinary.  Between 1982 and 1994 the rate doubled and there 
is no end in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard about the various motivations for stealing cars, which 
I will not reiterate.  One of the major reasons is linked to 
organized crime.  The government has put forth a bill that we 
will support.  It is a good start in dealing with organized 
crime, but there is much more that can and should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RICO like amendments, which were brought in the United States, 
should be implemented in Canada.  That will enable our police 
forces and courts, in particular, to go after the proceeds from 
crime.  Police forces say that to deal with organized crime we 
have to go after its money.  The courts must go after their 
money, then we might have a chance to decrease the number of 
organized crime gangs in Canada.  It also involves pushing the 
limits of our charter.  I will encourage the government to do 
just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to fight fire with fire.  A lot of these organized crime 
groups hide behind the law when it is convenient for them and 
abuse it when is convenient for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extent of the problem, and it is perhaps related to the 
degree of organized crime, can be seen in the numbers and the 
demographics of theft.  My province of British Columbia, as well 
as Manitoba, have the highest rates of car theft.  Many of these 
cars are going to chop shops where they are pulled apart.  The 
parts are then sold illegally or sent to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A way to deal with this, which is quite innovative and used in 
the United States, is to attach transmitters to the cars.  The 
transmitters cost about $600.  The United States found that the 
rate at which cars with transmitters were stolen was 25% less 
than the risk to other cars.  The savings were massive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the cost to us as individuals is huge.  Also the cost to 
insurance companies is large.  I believe in Canada in 1996, which 
is the last year for which I found statistics, it cost insurance 
companies $600 million in insurance costs.  That is huge.  We 
need to somehow decrease those costs because they are ultimately 
passed on to the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had transmitters on cars then the rate of theft would go 
down and the cost to insurance companies would go down.  We would 
then a net saving to both the consumer and the insurance company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the insurance companies could decrease the comprehensive 
insurance costs for car owners who attached transmitters to their 
cars.  This is something that is imminently doable and should be 
implemented as quickly as possible.  I would encourage the 
Insurance Corporation of British Columbia to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also look at the issue of drug abuse.  Many thefts 
that take place in our society are attached to drug abuse. 
Addicts yearning for that next hit have to find the money.  Some 
turn to prostitution but some also turn to theft.  To get their 
fix, the drug abuser will steal something they can sell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at a more comprehensive way of dealing with the 
illicit drug trade.  We know if we try to block it off at source, 
for example Colombia in the case of cocaine and heroin, that it 
does not work.  We have to is take a new approach to drug abuse 
and deal with it on the demand side.  We have to decrease demand. 
If there is no demand there is no production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us flip the equation around and deal with the demand side. I 
was in Colombia in February and met with President Pastrana.  I 
was very encouraged to see that he was very much in agreement 
with North America taking a greater role to decrease demand.  At 
the same time Senator McCain was as were a number of other 
congressmen and senators from the U.S.  For the first time the 
Americans were saying that they had to get their own house in 
order.  As a nation we also have to do the same.  How do we do 
it?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully, new medical evidence shows how the brain works with 
respect to addictions.  There are some very exciting programs in 
Europe that have a 60% one year success rate for hard core 
narcotics abusers.  These programs take a different approach. Not 
only do they deal with the issues of treatment and counselling, 
they also involve work and training skills.  These programs also 
get people out of their drug environments for an extended period 
of time.  As we know, that is critically important, because an 
individual who has a substance abuse problem and is living in an 
environment where drug abuse is taking place has a very difficult 
time breaking the habit.  These models in Europe, while a bit 
expensive at the front end, work very well in the long term for 
decreasing the incidence of drug abuse in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prevention works too and Canada has some exciting models.  The 
Minister of Labour has been a champion of prevention through her 
head start program in Moncton.  There are head start programs 
around the world that also work very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By working with the provinces and using the best of all the 
models available we will be able to develop a national program 
for early intervention.  We could do this by using existing 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, prevention has to start early, particularly at the 
prenatal stage because at that time parents can learn how to be 
good parents.  The issue of fetal alcohol syndrome can also be 
addressed.  As members know, fetal alcohol syndrome has been 
devastating in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By taking the best models from around the world and focusing on 
strengthening the parent-child bond using existing resources, 
that kind of head start model would have a dramatic impact on 
drug use.  There is a profound decrease in drug use among 
children, youth and adults who go through an appropriate head 
start program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have done in the past, I encourage the Minister of Justice 
to work with her counterpart, the Minister of Health, and work 
with the provinces.  I urge them to call together the first 
ministers to implement a head start program using existing 
resources.  This program should not be some huge, dramatic, 
expensive, bureaucratically bound national program but one that 
works at the basics of strengthening the parent-child bond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my colleague from Surrey North for putting this 
bill forward.  It focuses on mandatory sentencing and separates 
auto theft from other thefts.  His bill gets to the heart of a 
significant theft problem in Canada.  This bill also implements 
tough solutions to deal with those individuals who have 
repeatedly and wilfully demonstrated an abuse of public trust and 
an abuse of other Canadians.  I hope that the government will see 
fit to implement Bill C-250 as soon as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am honoured to have the privilege of speaking to Bill C-250, 
the bill sponsored by my colleague from Surrey North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He began his speech by lamenting that even though he got his 
bill drawn the “impartial” committee decided that it would not 
be voted on.  I would like to say two things about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I lament with him that his bill is not a votable item. It 
is very unfortunate that the rules of the House permit certain 
members of parliament to bring forward private members' bills 
that lead nowhere.  It is wonderful to be able to debate a bill, 
but we should also be able to vote on it.  That would allow 
members of parliament to show by their votes where they stand on 
an issue such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the member has been in the House for one term less than 
I.  I have never been picked to present a private member's bill. 
He is fortunate in that regard.  He is ahead of me on that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-250 has to do with auto theft.  I always take a step back 
when I think of this type of crime.  Auto theft in Canada takes 
place at two levels, I think, and they are almost quantum leaps 
apart.  At one level it is mostly youths who take vehicles for 
what is called joyriding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one of our colleagues from British Columbia had a 
private member's bill on that particular offence, whereby young 
people for some reason have it in their heads that it is not 
wrong for them to hop into a vehicle that is not theirs, take it 
for a ride and abandon it somewhere else.  Some of the young 
people are repeat offenders.  They just do it for a lark and yet 
what they are doing is very wrong and should not be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another level, if we can classify auto theft as being 
at different levels.  Joyriding is a low level classification 
even though some offenders are guilty of very frequently 
committing the offence.  The other level, of course, is the 
organized one, whereby people actually make a living by taking 
someone else's property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely true that when people steal vehicles we all pay 
for it.  In regard to the total cost, I think I heard a total of 
$600 million being bandied about.  That is a tremendous cost 
because we have only 30 million Canadians and I am sure that we 
do not have one vehicle for every man, woman and child in the 
country.  The amount of money is just atrocious and we all pay 
for it through higher premiums on our insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides that, it is just the wrong thing to do.  I really wonder 
why in our society we have people who actually feel that somehow 
they have the right to take property that is not their own.  Some 
of them actually even get into the business of stealing vehicles, 
altering serial numbers and either chopping down the vehicles or 
putting them into containers and sending them to different parts 
of the world where they fetch a very good price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really need to do something about it.  As I have said in some 
of my previous speeches on justice issues, it seems to me that we 
have to make sure we do not forget what the purpose of the law 
is.  We cannot pass a law that will make people good and prevent 
them from committing crimes because it changes them on the 
inside.  That is another function and that is something we really 
ought to be working on.  We should be working on changing the 
personal convictions of people in terms of what they deem to be 
right and wrong.  It is a big job and one that I think takes 
place primarily in strong families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second aspect of this is of course that the law must act as 
a deterrent, so my colleague is proposing that there be rather 
stiff penalties for people who engage in this over and over.  It 
is significant that he does not say that the first time a kid 
takes a car for a ride in a joyride situation we would lock him 
up and throw the keys away, as some would accuse us of saying. We 
in fact favour methods that will retrieve and reform the young 
guy who starts that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when it is a repeat offence, and particularly in the 
crime rings where they make huge amounts of money by literally 
ripping off Canadians, by stealing their vehicles and of course 
indirectly then charging the insurance companies and all of us 
through our premiums, those are the people who we want to stop 
with a law, because obviously they are not induced to stop it by 
themselves.  The law must act as a deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very honourable thing the member is proposing.  He is 
proposing that there be a minimum four year sentence on this 
crime so that judges do not have the option of being lenient with 
repeat offenders.  That is what should happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a person who has now moved into the city of Edmonton but 
used to live in my riding.  His name is Ken Haywood.  I think he 
would probably appreciate me saying this.  For a number of years 
he owned a car dealership in the city of Edmonton.  When he 
retired he sold his business and, because of this theft problem, 
he became interested in curbing auto thefts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He been working with all levels of government, both federal and 
provincial.  I visited with him when he was in Ottawa.  He has a 
newsletter that he puts out and also a website.  I do not know 
the address of the website but if people used a search engine and 
looked for Ken Haywood I am sure they could find it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is looking at technical ways of reducing auto theft.  He is 
working with automobile manufacturers as there have been some 
technical innovations in the last little while.  Many of the 
newer vehicles now have key coding, but a skilled thief can still 
easily dismantle the key column and drive the vehicle away.  In 
some cases a thief will drive a truck up to the vehicle they want 
and drag it onto the truck.  There are different technical ways 
that can be used to prevent someone from driving away with a 
vehicle, but it is pretty difficult to prevent someone from 
putting a hook to it and dragging it onto a truck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Haywood is searching for different and innovative methods. 
He is very intrigued and interested in tracking methods, 
including electronic methods in order to identify vehicles making 
it more difficult to change serial numbers and other initiatives 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go on record as saying that I support my hon. 
colleague.  It makes no sense for me to ask other members to 
support the bill because they will not have a chance to vote on 
it.  That is one of the changes, Mr. Speaker, that you were very 
interested in.  We need to change that in parliament to allow all 
private members' business to be votable, so that we can come to a 
conclusion and do something about the problems, instead of just 
talking about them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I stated at the beginning of the debate, the standing 
committee in its infinite wisdom decided to deem the bill as 
not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are doing today is placing the issue on the political 
agenda.  Hopefully in some not too distant future, the government 
would change and realize the importance of amending the criminal 
code to address the shortcomings of the sentencing provisions 
concerning auto theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is on record as recognizing the issue. 
In 1999 she stated “The public has a very strong interest 
in dealing with auto theft.  It is a growing crime in terms of 
the number of people whose property is being stolen”.  However, 
rather than deal with the criminals who are creating this strong 
interest and concern over property, she put some money toward 
educating Canadians on how not to leave their keys in the 
ignition.  I wonder if the minister is aware of the term punched 
ignition switch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to be the way of the government, spend tax dollars to 
make it appear that something is being done.  Heaven forbid that 
we should try to hold criminals accountable for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I deliberately avoided mentioning youth involvement in 
the auto theft industry.  Whenever I bring up youth crime I am 
criticized and characterized as wanting to gang up on our youth 
by locking them up and throwing away the key.  Those who know me 
know differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However according to police statistics, about 40% of the cars in 
Canada are stolen by youths between the ages of 12 and 17, and 
only 12% are ever caught.  What does that teach impressionable 
youth?  It teaches them that they can steal cars and get away 
with it.  Who do organized crime recruiters seek out?  I suggest 
that young car thieves with successful and profitable track 
records appear quite attractive to organized crime recruiters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to address youthful criminality early.  We should not 
and cannot wait until it is too late and they develop into more 
professional and experienced criminals.  We are doing an 
injustice to those youth by allowing them to get away with the 
crime at an early age.  We are doing an injustice to our society 
by permitting the initial training ground in crime to flourish 
and mature into more sophisticated activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who think that car theft is not really a danger to our 
society, I wish to relate the instance of the 13 year old driver 
of a stolen car who was involved in a crash that killed 16 year 
old Sarah Machado in Vancouver. 
The 13 year old driver was linked to an organized ring of 
juvenile thieves, many too young to drive legally.  According to 
evidence obtained by the police the 13 year old driver was being 
followed by friends in two stolen Jeep Cherokees.  As they were 
not involved in the crash, they escaped.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about that for a moment.  An organized ring of 
offenders as young as 13 and 14 involved in stealing motor 
vehicles.  Why?  It is because it does not seem like much of a 
concern to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we refuse to address these crimes within Canada I ask that we 
think about what we are doing to foreign countries.  As I have 
said, an increasing number of stolen vehicles are making their 
way into sealed shipping containers.  They make their way to the 
docks in Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax and are shipped 
overseas.  It has been described as our fastest growing export 
business.  I do not think this is what the Minister for 
International Trade has in mind when he promotes exports.  When 
these illegal exports reach other countries I do not think it is 
a legitimate businessman who takes ultimate possession of the 
vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are helping corrupt those other countries by assisting their 
own illegal organizations and by inducing individuals to become 
involved in the questionable activity of buying hot motor 
vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might think I am exaggerating the problem.  Nothing could 
be further from the truth.  The Insurance Bureau of Canada 
estimates that the ordinary thief who steals a Jeep Grand 
Cherokee earns a tax free $150 to $500 upon delivery.  The 
ringleader of the organized crime enterprise pays about $2,500 
for the Jeep to be packed in a container and shipped abroad. When 
the Jeep arrives at its destination it is sold for twice the 
Canadian market value, in the neighbourhood of $100,000, a nice 
tidy profit to the crime boss of about $97,000 for just one motor 
vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we should have more serious punishment for multiple car 
thieves.  We need to discourage the activity to a far greater 
degree than we are at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home town of Surrey it is said that there is a motor 
vehicle theft every 90 minutes.  Last year Surrey RCMP had three 
officers in its stolen auto unit.  They have little hope of 
keeping pace with the crime.  As parliamentarians we must do our 
utmost to provide them with the tools to control this illegal and 
mushrooming activity.  The bill would have been a step in the 
right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said the statistics are going down. 
A few years ago I was returning home from playing a recreational 
hockey game.  When I rounded a corner with my wife on our final 
six blocks home I saw flashing red lights in the distance and 
knew there had been a serious car accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My daughter and her friend had left the arena about a half hour 
before us and this was directly on our way home.  As hon. members 
can imagine, my heart went into my throat.  Fortunately it was 
not my daughter or her friend.  I found out from friends on the 
police force that it was a 34 year old lady who had been on her 
way home from a church meeting, travelling along 88th Avenue 
through a green light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fellow going north on 144th Street, a young man with a 
serious lengthy record of multiple auto theft and well known to 
police, was driving past the police and giving them the finger, 
yelling at them and not paying any attention.  He ran through a 
red light and T-boned the lady's car and killed her.  He drove 
her right across the street, through a fence and into a yard and 
killed her instantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with these kinds of things let us forget about 
statistics.  I do not care if the statistics are coming down. 
This was a person involved in multiple repeat auto thefts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter MacKay:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I have just arrived in the Chamber and was scheduled to 
take part in the debate on Bill C-250.  Given the time remaining 
on the clock and given that we started this debate earlier by 
consent, I wonder if I might seek unanimous consent to 
participate in the debate for the remaining time that was 
originally allotted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Deputy Speaker:</b>  For the record, the time remaining 
would be approximately five minutes.  At 5.40 p.m. and no later 
the Chair would have to intervene.  First and foremost the member 
would require consent of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

our consent, provided the member agrees not to move any motions 
and that we recognize that the debate has concluded.  There is no 
room for any further motions.  With that proviso we are happy to 
give our consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Deputy Speaker:</b>  The Chair can certainly be helpful 
also.  The member has already had the floor under right of reply.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Some hon. members:</b>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</b> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all hon. members present for their 
magnanimity.   To begin with, I commend the hon. member for 
Surrey North.  I know he has been a very active member of the 
justice committee, a great proponent of issues that stem from our 
current justice system.  I also know that he has a keen mind for 
these issues and a real pragmatic approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is yet another bill coming forward from private members 
that would strengthen criminal code provisions.  I would suggest 
it is very much aimed at raising the bar in terms of both general 
and specific deterrents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-250 would ensure that a person convicted of more than one 
theft of a motor vehicle having a value in excess of $5,000 would 
receive a minimum of four years of imprisonment for every 
conviction following the first offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get into the graphic detail of the range of 
sentencing.  I know other bills have been brought forward.  His 
colleague from Calgary brought forward one dealing with home 
invasion and break and enters which dealt with a two year minimum 
sentence requirement.  I would certainly in principle agree with 
the nature of the particular motion and the need to put forward a 
strong message of deterrence in our criminal code because of the 
elevated occurrences of these types of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-250 clarifies and makes more effective subsection 334(a) 
of the current criminal code which talks about punishment for 
theft of motor vehicles, which is the focal point of the member's 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did a bit of research with respect to the Insurance Board of 
Canada.  Statistics from 1999, which are the latest available, 
indicate that over 160,000 incidents of motor vehicle theft were 
reported to the police, an average of over 450 vehicles per day 
in Canada.  Although there is car insurance, unless it is stolen 
by a household member or somebody who has been given permission 
to drive it, insurance in many cases is under comprehensive or 
specified perils coverage, which does not cover the complete cost 
of the particular vehicle.  The upshot of all this is the 
components estimate that the cost to Canadian policyholders is in 
the range of $600 million per year in insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Car thefts in recent years have become far more dangerous.  As 
the hon. member and others mentioned, high speed chases often are 
the result of motor vehicle thefts.  Individuals who are becoming 
more involved in this activity are doing so in a much more brazen 
fashion because of the remuneration or the reward.  They are 
doing so in broad daylight.  They are doing so often while the 
vehicle is occupied, while the vehicle is being driven, in a form 
of car-jacking, which has occurred in some of our big cities in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A huge element of organized crime is often involved that in many 
instances uses young offenders and drug addicts in the need of 
quick cash to perpetrate organized theft rings.  The focus is 
usually high priced vehicles: SUVs and foreign vehicles such as 
the Mercedes and BMW, fan favourites of thefts.  They put those 
vehicles into containers and they are shipped in many cases to 
Europe, to the Soviet Union, out of the port of Vancouver or 
Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very comprehensive problem is coming to light.  It is not 
uncommon to hear of injuries and even fatalities resulting from 
car thefts, either by virtue of a motor vehicle accident or the 
use of violence in the perpetration of the theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals who choose to engage in this activity have to be 
reminded, which is the cut and thrust of the particular bill, 
that there will be severe consequences and imprisonment if they 
choose to engage in this type of reckless activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, I support in principle the hon. member's motion. 
The attachment of a specific sentence of four years might be 
deemed excessive, given the sentencing scale that exists for 
other types of offences.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill introduced by his colleague from Calgary is an obvious 
example of where the crime of home invasion while a person is at 
home would receive a minimum sentence of two years.  On the 
relative scale one would have to ensure there was parity in 
sentencing.  Judges often look for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The degree of violence which is involved, the theft, the 
recklessness and the value are all sentencing factors, but in 
principle this is a good bill and I hope hon. members give it due 
consideration.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
on February 28 of this year I raised a question with the Prime 
Minister concerning the upcoming summit of the Americas in Quebec 
City.  At that time I expressed concern to the Prime Minister 
about the efforts in Quebec City to effectively turn the city 
into an armed militarized fortress during the summit.  At the 
same time I asked the minister about the contempt for democracy 
involved in failing to make public the text of the agreement that 
was being negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes I have available to me this afternoon, I will 
follow up and voice my very serious concerns about what did take 
place in what I consider to be a very serious abuse of police 
powers in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thomas Berger, a respected former judge, an outstanding civil 
libertarian and lawyer, wrote a book called <I>Fragile 
Freedoms</I>.  What I think is abundantly clear is that our 
constitutional freedoms, the freedom of speech, the freedom of 
association, the freedom to peaceful and non-violent dissent, 
came under assault in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in any way condoning the violent actions of a very 
small number of protesters who hurled paving stones and other 
objects at police officers.  Certainly I condemn those actions 
unreservedly, as well as the actions of a small number of 
protesters who attacked and beat a police officer.  That was 
reprehensible and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were over 50,000 protesters who marched in a peaceful 
demonstration on Saturday, but there were also many others who 
peacefully and non-violently, close to the four kilometre wall of 
shame in Quebec City, chose to demonstrate against the profoundly 
undemocratic nature of the FTAA negotiations that were taking 
place inside the wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally witnessed attacks by the police on peaceful 
demonstrators, the excessive use of tear gas and the use of 
plastic bullets, which was absolutely reprehensible and 
unacceptable.  Indeed independent observers, including la ligue 
des droits et libertés and the five observers appointed by the 
Quebec government, came to the conclusion that the use of plastic 
bullets was totally unacceptable and that there had been abusive 
and excessive use of tear gas on Saturday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I are calling for an independent inquiry into 
this gross misconduct by the police force, by the Sûreté du 
Québec, by the RCMP and by two other police forces involved. This 
is not democracy.  This is the antithesis of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that one of the demonstrators, Éric Laferrière, had 
to undergo an emergency tracheotomy because he was hit in the 
throat by a plastic bullet.  As the Speaker knows, I was struck 
by a plastic bullet as well.  In a democracy this is an outrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will as well draw to the attention of the House the appalling 
treatment of Jaggi Singh.  Jaggi Singh was a demonstrator who was 
arrested in Quebec City and who remains the only demonstrator not 
to have been freed on bail.  His offence was supposedly using a 
weapon, a 25 foot catapult that hurled teddy bears.  In fact this 
was no threat to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask:  Why is Jaggi Singh the only protester who was 
arrested during the protest who remains in jail?   Why does the 
crown believe that he who was not convicted of any violent 
offence is dangerous enough to be kept in prison? 
This is an outrage.  I would hope that the government would 
recognize that there must be an independent inquiry into the 
appalling conditions that people were held in Orsainville prison, 
as well as the very serious abuses by the police in firing tear 
gas and plastic bullets at peaceful, non-violent demonstrators.
