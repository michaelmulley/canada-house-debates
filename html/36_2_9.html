</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.) </B>moved that Bill 
C-6, an act to support and promote electronic commerce by

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to 
have this opportunity to address the House of Commons again on 
Bill C-6, the personal information protection and electronic 
documents act.  This act was developed in response to a very real 
and pressing need.  Canadians have told us in clear terms that 
they want their personal data protected no matter where it goes, 
no matter who uses it, trades it or holds it.  Business wants a 
level playing field, with competitors bound by the same rules. 
As well, Canadians want the option to communicate with their 
governments electronically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy is something that Canadians feel very strongly about. In 
a July 1998 Angus Reid poll 88% of Canadians polled said that 
they found it unacceptable for companies and organizations to 
sell, trade or share lists containing personal information with 
other organizations.  Bill C-6 will give Canadians the privacy 
protection which they desire and which they are entitled to 
receive. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a legitimate exercise of the federal government's 
authority to legislate in respect of trade and commerce in 
Canada. The increasing ubiquity of networks and the speed of the 
technology means companies are collecting more information, 
circulating it more widely and combining it more ingeniously 
than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal information is now a commodity which can be bought, 
sold and traded. It has commercial value in and of itself. That 
information is crossing all boundaries—provincial, territorial 
and national. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces acting alone and even together cannot pass laws that 
can effectively protect information crossing those boundaries.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A company in Alberta company collecting information from 
Manitobans may disclose it to another company in New Brunswick 
or New York. Canada needs a federal law to protect personal data 
in these circumstances. We also need a harmonized regime—with 
the provinces and territories playing their part in their areas 
of competence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 establishes the right of all individuals to privacy in 
a way that is consistent with the reasonable needs of 
organizations to collect, use and disclose personal information. 
As our competitors around the globe scramble to put in place the 
frameworks that will create the consumer confidence to make 
electronic commerce a practical reality, the privacy protection 
in Bill C-6 will put Canada at the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parts 2 to 5 of Bill C-6 will eliminate the paper bias in our 
federal laws by making them media neutral.  Bill C-6 will put 
electronic transactions governed by federal laws on the same 
footing as paper ones.  It will ensure business and citizens that 
an electronic document and an electronic signature has legal 
standing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 will make the electronic transmission of information 
through computers an option that is realistic, practical and 
legally sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge at this point the excellent work of 
the Standing Committee on Industry.  The committee members have 
been conscientious and helpful in improving the legislation and I 
am grateful to them for their efforts.  They have helped to make 
a good bill better.  In particular, I recognize the efforts of 
the member for St. Catharines who served as my parliamentary 
secretary until August and who provided tremendous support in 
bringing this bill to report stage. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee members identified and addressed the needs of 
stakeholders with regard to this legislation, and the bill is 
stronger for their scrutiny and attention. Amendments resulted 
in key areas such as the primacy of protection of privacy, 
protection for whistleblowers and provisions for a review of the 
effectiveness of the bill every five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee members always remembered that the goal is a balance 
product and that when you add a bit to one side of the scale you 
must also keep the other side in mind, to ensure that 
equilibrium is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware that the legislative process can be both and 
complicated. 
But again, the process of public hearings and debate has 
resulted in a superior outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight briefly what some key witnesses told 
the Standing Committee on Industry during its hearings on the 
personal information protection and electronic documents bill. 
Consumers and privacy advocates supported the bill and expressed 
a desire to see it passed now, even if not all of their 
requested changes were made. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some privacy advocates called for more powers for the privacy 
commissioner.  Some even demanded binding powers for the 
commissioner.  However, the federal privacy commissioner himself 
stated quite eloquently that he did not want binding powers and 
that the most elegant and least cumbersome way to achieve the 
desired results would be through a proactive approach based on 
education and ombudsman-like powers.  In the end, the validity of 
the privacy commissioner's arguments was recognized and 
prevailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was the business community's turn to address Bill C-6 
many stressed their support for the legislation and appreciation 
for its basis in the CSA standard.  The view was expressed that 
the smooth harmonization of privacy frameworks across the country 
is highly desirable.  Businesses and consumers alike told the 
industry committee that they also welcomed parts 2 to 5 of the 
bill, which will permit the government to deliver services to its 
citizens electronically and permit the government and the courts 
to use and accept electronic documents and signatures.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business community needs the continued ability to gather 
information to detect fraud and the violation of agreements. 
This ability is important to sectors as diverse as the computer 
software and insurance industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of Bill C-6 is to strike a delicate balance between 
these entirely legitimate needs and consumers' equally valid 
expectations for privacy protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments aimed at helping businesses combat fraud were 
carefully designed to maintain that balance.  The committee 
received the benefit of appearances by the federal Privacy 
Commissioner, the Ontario commissioner and the British Columbia 
commissioner and a brief from the Quebec commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioners were very strong in their support for public 
education and held that its value in changing the landscape of 
privacy protection is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario commissioner emphasized this point. She stated  that 
public education changes practices for the better and reduces 
complaints. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Topics such as harmonization and duplication of regulation 
received thoughtful consideration.  The Quebec commissioner made 
suggestions for avoiding areas of potential confusion, while 
other commissioners held that the bill could be passed first and 
appropriate administrative arrangements worked out afterward 
among commissioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill's structure was also a focus of comment.  The B.C. 
commissioner dismissed any criticism that the bill might be 
awkward to read as some had argued.  He stated that many laws, 
even consumer protection laws, were written in complex language 
and expressed his confidence that Canada's privacy commissioners 
would be competent enough to interpret and implement Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever mindful of the need to continuously improve on the bill, we 
introduced amendments after the industry committee's report to 
the House.  We improved the primacy clause and required 
confidential measures in federal court hearings.  We have amended 
clause 30 to clarify how the bill applies in its first three 
years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And we have made changes to ensure that law enforcement bodies 
can continue to carry out their mandate as they currently do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These law enforcement amendments clarify for organizations the 
circumstances under which they may accede to the lawful requests 
of government institutions for personal information for national 
security for enforcement or administration purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments allow the status quo to continue and allow 
businesses to continue to co-operate, where appropriate.  These 
amendments do not grant new powers to government institutions, 
nor do they create new obligations on business. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill is to regulate the commercial use of 
personal information.  For instance, in the case of the publicly 
funded health care system, the bill is not intended to impede the 
flow of information necessary for the protection of patients' 
health and the improvement of the administration of health care. 
To clarify this, I tabled an amendment on October 15 which 
specifically addresses the need to share information without 
consent when it is necessary for the administration of a law or 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information highway offers opportunities to improve the 
efficacy and indeed accountability of our health care system. 
Organizations such as the Canadian Institute for Health 
Information assists in this endeavour.  Bill C-6 is intended to 
facilitate these initiatives as it provides a basic set of fair 
information practices around which all stakeholders can 
harmonize. 
In the pursuit of a harmonized privacy protection regime for 
Canada, we encourage all the provinces and the territories to 
move swiftly to legislate broadly in their own jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, a brief overview of what the personal information 
protection and electronic documents act will accomplish will 
reveal how the government has addressed the concerns of witnesses 
who appeared before the committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overarching goal of Bill C-6 is to codify a right to privacy 
without placing a heavy burden on business, intruding unduly on 
the right of freedom of expression or destroying our historical 
memory by interfering with the preservation of documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 will foster responsible privacy practices.  Oversight 
will be complaints driven, but the Privacy Commissioner has been 
given a strong public education and advisory role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner will be able to help businesses comply with the 
law, launch investigations, compel witnesses and evidence and 
conduct audits where he has a reasonable cause to think that 
something might be happening that is contrary to the law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 will establish harmonized national rules to avoid 
different sets of rules for business and the resulting confusion 
for citizens.  The provisions will also encourage provincial and 
territorial action to legislate.  Only Quebec has its own privacy 
law in place.  British Columbia is working on one, and with the 
strong federal leadership that the bill represents, we expect 
others will soon follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is unique in the world for having developed a national 
standard to protect privacy.  Considerable momentum already 
exists in the application of the CSA code in the marketplace.  A 
number of industry associates and firms have CSA based codes.  It 
makes sense to build on that consensus and momentum and that is 
what Bill C-6 has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally, the adoption of Bill C-6 will show the way to 
the future.  The use of standards is an accepted way to resolve 
trade disputes over differing national rules and Canada will 
continue to support the movement toward an international privacy 
standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need and they want privacy protection.  The right of 
Canadians to control their personal data is within their reach 
with the bill.  The bill before the House is a product of 
informed review by many experts in the field of data protection 
and electronic commerce, of widespread public consultations and 
of an extensive examination by members of the House.  It is a 
good bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In releasing his annual report earlier this week, Mr. Bruce 
Phillips, Canada's Privacy Commissioner, said this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill represents considerable ingenuity and not a little 
courage.  It is no magic bullet...But we must begin by doing 
something and doing it quickly.  If we fiddle in the face of 
lobbying and jurisdictional disputes, Canadians' privacy and the 
business opportunities on-line will burn. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more.  It is time to move the bill on.  I urge 
all members of the House to support passage of Bill C-6, to 
support the right of Canadian citizens to protect their own 
personal, private information. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, Bill C-6, which is the old Bill C-54 
from the last session of parliament, is a bill largely about the 
future.  The government is trying to catch up with technology to 
regulate for reasonable order and safety, much like governments 
did as they tried to keep up with the emergence of the motor car, 
airplane, travel, telephones, radio broadcasting, television and 
now a universe of information transfer and monitoring never 
imagined by the writers of our constitution passed in 1867.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Form continues to follow function and I am sure that the present 
bill will be subject to much amendment in future years as society 
attempts to respond to issues of sovereignty, rights, protection 
and general order. Maybe it could be said that Alvin Toffler was 
right that social change accelerates and we all struggle to deal 
with future shock, even governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future is now, and the bill is written to support and 
promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information 
that is collected. used or disclosed in certain circumstances by 
providing for the use of electronic means to communicate a record 
of information or transactions and by amending the Canada 
Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute 
Revision Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 1 of the bill establishes a right to the protection of 
personal information used in commercial activities in connection 
with the operation of a federal work, undertaking, or business or 
interprovincially or internationally.  It establishes principles 
to govern the collection, the use and disclosure of personal 
information. It deals with accountability, identifying the 
purposes for the collection of personal information, obtaining 
consent, limiting collection, limiting use, disclosure and 
retention, ensuring accuracy, providing adequate security, making 
information management policies readily available, providing 
individuals with access to information about themselves and 
giving individuals a right to challenge an organization's 
compliance with these principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It further provides for the privacy commissioner to receive 
complaints concerning contraventions of the principles, conduct 
investigations and attempt to resolve such complaints. 
Unresolved disputes relating to certain matters can also be taken 
to the federal court for resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 2 sets out a scheme by which requirements in federal 
statutes and regulations that assume the use of paper do not 
necessarily expressly permit the use of electronic technology, 
may be administered or complied with in the electronic 
environment. The bill grants authority to make regulations about 
how these requirements may be satisfied by using electronic 
means.  Part 2 also describes the characteristics of secure 
electronic signatures and grants authority to make regulations 
prescribing technologies for the purpose of the definition of 
“secure electronic signature”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 3 amends the Canada Evidence Act to ease the admissibility 
of electronic documents, to establish evidentiary presumptions 
related to secure electronic signatures and to provide for the 
recognition as evidence of notices, acts or other documents 
published electronically by the Queen's Printer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 4 amends the Statutory Instruments Act to authorize the 
publication of the <I>Canada Gazette</I> by electronic means, 
which will certainly be thanked by many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 5 amends the Statute Revision Act to authorize the 
publication and distribution of an electronic version of the 
consolidated statutes and regulations of Canada. This is a 
democratizing barrier removal for all citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been at the Canadian democratic experiment at least 
since 1867, 132 years or more, with our evolution to responsible 
and accountable government from dependent colonialism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here in parliament as a Reformer in part because it is too 
evident that we still have a lot of work to do on that score to 
take up the job of expanding the boundary of democracy, of 
implementing needed change. Sadly it is a quest that the old 
reformers forsook, those who became the true Grits, for the 
Liberals who have long forgotten about being the repressed 
underdog in governance, for they are now so smugly superior, 
secretly plotting to avoid real public political accountability. 
In view of what happened, it could be reasoned that the Reform 
Party are the liberals of the 21st century, for we are now the 
agents of change, struggling against an entrenched establishment 
party that is reluctant to let go of privilege and power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an ideological gap that I am talking about.  With Bill C-6 
they are playing catch-up.  As in commerce, Canada has a long way 
to catch up politically, even reforming this very parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada started with a constitution that was rooted in certain 
basic principles and was written by some incredibly brilliant 
people who understood that times would change, the definitions of 
fundamental things of governance would change and that 
circumstances would require people to rise to the challenges of 
each new era by applying old values in practical ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is recognized that as Canada changed from being an 
agricultural to an industrial society that the laws made under 
simpler conditions of living could not handle the complex 
relations of the modern industrial world,  and now even the cyber 
age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill attempts to deal with some technological matters 
that have gone way ahead of governance, Reformers also work for 
the day when we can bring this creaky institution of parliament 
into the cyber age of political accountability, using technology 
to more fully obtain political consent from an informed 
electorate who watches, engages and decides, often through 
electronic means.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is present day Reformers that seek to move the boundaries 
between old and new.  We might even get TV cameras in the Senate 
some day and have more committees televised.  Parliament needs to 
get fully plugged in, turned on and really connected to the 
people it is supposed to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers of old, it must be remembered, fought hard to adapt 
our institutions to new realities, to update vital protections 
for our citizens, to expand the developing notions of the right 
to privacy which has become most valued by our present culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the midst of another vast social transformation.  Once 
again the law needs to govern fluid markets, documentation and 
legal exchange.  They are so dynamic they could not have been 
imagined in the British North America Act of 1867 when it 
enumerated responsibilities.  But the pace of change is very 
different, not just the nature of change but the very pace of it. 
Once again we have to respond, applying our oldest values and 
practical ways that allow them to be preserved and enhanced in 
modern times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that technology and competition have revolutionized 
the financial services industry.  I think most of us believe that 
by and large these changes have been very good.  But many people 
do not have the knowledge to properly evaluate what is truly a 
dizzying array of options.  Some are falling victim to new 
abusive practices.  Others are being left out of the financial 
marketplace altogether.  That is why we have to deal with these 
things in parliament, to give all Canadians both the tools and 
the confidence they need to fully participate in the thriving but 
highly complex 21st century economy that will often be focused in 
the world of electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term electronic commerce refers generally to commercial 
transactions, involving both organizations and individuals, that 
are based upon the processing and transmission of digitized data, 
including text, sound and visual images, and that are carried out 
over open networks.  Although much media attention is focused on 
online merchants selling books, wine and computers, the vast 
majority of products marketed electronically business to consumer 
are intangibles such as travel and ticketing services, software 
entertainment such as online games, music and gambling, as well 
as banking, insurance and brokerage services, information 
services, legal services, real estate services and increasingly 
health care, education and government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of these realities there are some principles that must 
be regarded.  The first thing we have to do is to protect every 
Canadian's financial privacy.  There has been analysis to 
identify where privacy is at risk and finance certainly was the 
first obvious area of great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technological revolution now makes it easier than ever 
before for people to dig into and collect our private financial 
data for their own profit.  Some private financial information is 
protected under existing federal law. One's banker, broker or 
insurance company could still share with affiliated firms 
information of what one buys with cheques and credit cards or 
sell this information to the highest bidder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need better laws to give Canadians the right to control their 
financial information, to let the consumer decide whether they 
want to share private information with anyone else.  They need to 
know where it goes and why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To enhance financial privacy we must also protect the sanctity 
of medical records.  With a growing number of mergers between 
companies, financial institutions and lenders potentially can 
gain access to the private medical information contained in 
insurance forms or from government subcontractors.  We need to 
severely restrict the sharing of medical information.  People 
should not have to worry that the results of their latest medical 
physical exam will be used to deny them a home mortgage or a 
credit card. The possibilities must be carefully anticipated for 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be understood that our basic privacy is at stake.  As 
electronic commerce develops, the volume and the nature of 
personal data such as name, address, interests and records of all 
purchases can be disclosed on networks during electronic 
activities and these transactions certainly will increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New methods for processing the vast accumulation of data such as 
data mining allow the creation of customer profiles that combine 
demographic data, credit information, usage patterns and minute 
details of transactions.  If consumers do not have control over 
the collection and use of their personal data, electronic 
commerce must facilitate the invasion of their privacy.  But if 
consumers are in a position to either decline or to give informed 
consent to the collection and use of their personal data, 
electronic commerce will not be too much different from 
traditional commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's world, consumers may participate in what we call 
fidelity or loyal shopping plans, or choose to exchange their 
privacy for something they value such as lower prices, 
convenience or personalization. 
Businesses and consumers will have to help adjudicate the 
tradeoff between protecting privacy and obtaining the benefits of 
electronic commerce that both value.  Education on this issue is 
therefore of primary importance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has come up about illegal and harmful content. 
There has been much public concern about the content of some of 
the information distributed and accessed on the Internet. 
Disagreeable or detrimental content is not more prevalent on the 
Internet than beneficial content, but the people who distribute 
and access disagreeable or detrimental material on the Internet 
enjoy the same advantages offered by the Internet as others do. 
The positive elements are vast in terms of opportunities for 
electronic commerce, community development, communication and 
access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that with those benefits come the difficulties of 
coping with content judged to be detrimental.  The development of 
electronic commerce could potentially be impeded by illegal and 
harmful content issues where users fear unwanted content and 
where network service providers fear the liability they will take 
on if they are expected to be responsible for the content that 
flows across their systems. Although traditional methods for 
addressing these issues may not be as feasible in the electronic 
environment, advances in technology are offering new ways to 
resolve some of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must require greater public disclosure and enhance every 
consumer's right to know.  Consumers received millions of credit 
card solicitations last year.  Some offers contained new traps 
for the unwary.  For example, sometimes credit card companies 
advertise low interest rates known as teaser rates to reel in 
consumers who are then surprised with unexpected interest rate 
hikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of consumers have also found out the hard way that 
making only minimum payments rarely helps retire debt and almost 
always results in very large interest payments.  We should 
require clear notice of how long and how costly repayments would 
be if the consumer makes only the minimum payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to do more to combat consumer fraud.  It is remarkably 
easy now for a thief to take out huge loans in someone else's 
name, run up enormous credit card debts and tap into bank 
accounts.  We have now heard at least twice this year in the 
Commons that the RCMP do not have the basic resources to attack 
consumer commercial fraud.  Consequently capacity creates its own 
demand and it will only flourish if the government is not minding 
the people's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to give priority to cases involving identity theft, 
particularly those involving organized crime groups with the goal 
of increasing the number of prosecutions.  It must be made harder 
to steal someone else's identity in the first place.  Telephone 
long distance fraud is also rampant and the millions lost is 
reflected on my telephone bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to crack down on fraud committed over the Internet. 
If we want to seize the Internet's full potential, we have to 
stay ahead of those who would use this open medium to manipulate 
stock prices, commit fraud on online auctions or perpetuate any 
other type of financial scam. We need a national co-ordinated 
approach for tracking Internet fraud and to train those in 
provincial and federal law enforcement how to recognize and root 
out these schemes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be said that the law enforcement community compared to 
people who are doing criminal activity are like unaware parents 
trying to keep up with their children who go on the computer.  It 
is an endless effort. We need to organize and systematize a 
continuous retraining effort and have a federal government with a 
vision to commit the resources needed so that we can stay ahead 
of the crime curve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investors need better information to protect themselves against 
online securities fraud.  Complaints of Internet fraud are 
greatly increasing, for every new medium of exchange brings a new 
opportunity for criminal exploitation.  Are the Liberals on top 
of it?  I doubt it, for they have shown time and again that they 
are not really wise managers of the public trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must provide services for those who have been denied access 
to the wired world and ensure opportunities for all. Technology 
can bring, for example, credit and banking services to the 
disenfranchised.  We need to continue to expand the bounds of 
service for the aged and the challenged with low fee bank 
accounts and services in ways that maximize the possibility of 
technology yet preserve safety and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic commerce dramatically reduces the economic distance 
between producers and consumers.  Consumers can make their 
purchases directly without involving traditional retailers, 
wholesalers and in some cases distributors.  They benefit from 
improved information, lower transaction costs and thus lower 
prices, and larger choices which can include products tailored to 
individual requirements and instant delivery for intangible 
services and products in digital form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For sellers, electronic commerce also presents many advantages. 
Small scale manufacturers can gain access to a global marketplace 
with relative ease. 
Specialist resellers enjoy the same advantage. Neither need 
maintain a physical store or shop and inventory can be managed 
more efficiently.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour cost savings can be considerable.  For instance, one 
estimate places the cost of buying software on the Internet at 20 
cents to 50 cents per transaction as opposed to $5 for a 
telephone order and $15 our a traditional retailer. But just as 
electronic commerce offers new market opportunities, it will also 
intensify competition.  It will probably make some provisions of 
provincial labour codes obsolete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government must strive to provide the opportunity for everyone 
to have access to electronic commerce.  The key difference in 
having rights and benefiting from them is the degree of 
participation and full exchange.  Anyone with access to the 
Internet has access to electronic commerce.  Online commerce 
requires hardware such as computers and servers, software, and 
the ability to connect to the network itself which may involve 
access to telephone, cable TV, cellular mobile networks, 
satellites or broadcasting networks. Equipment costs, access 
charges and the complexity of the evolving Internet itself are 
barriers to universal Internet access.  At present, regulatory 
structures in many countries still limit market access by 
infrastructure providers.  This is changing with the 
liberalization of telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Estimates of the number of Internet users vary between 30 
million and 50 million.  It is a rapidly growing population. Just 
three or four years ago the number of users was only in the 
thousands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of commercial transactions made over the Internet is 
also rapidly growing.  Nearly all analysts predict growth by 
factors of 10 or more and that electronic commerce will overtake 
the size of mail catalogue sales in the United States alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The networks are being built but they will likely never be 
comprehensive or fast enough for changing demands.  Sadly, the 
law, protections and regulatory climate will always be behind, 
especially if the Liberals stay in power in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internet communications are generally established through 
telephone systems which were built to carry voice, not data. 
These systems need to evolve.  At present most customers connect 
to communications networks via a standard telephone line.  Local 
telephone tariffs currently account for more than 60% of the cost 
of Internet access.  The expansion of electronic commerce depends 
on speeding up data transmission while keeping the costs very 
low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing competition in the communications market is the best 
way to encourage network upgrading.  One key to increasing 
competition is to put in place regulatory structures that 
encourage the creation of networks providing and supporting all 
types of applications, including entertainment, voice telephony 
and electronic commerce.  However, it seems that we will always 
have one hand tied behind our backs in this country, because we 
have a Canadian policy for Luddites who vainly resist in the name 
of Canadian content which seems premised upon a cultural 
inferiority complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our law must properly follow the opportunities of technology for 
jobs, growth and trade.  By raising economic efficiency, 
electronic commerce will increase overall wealth.  In doing so, 
it will impose adjustments on existing economic structures, for 
electronic commerce may well result in the loss of employment in 
traditional distribution and retailing.  However, experience 
demonstrates that technological change will create new and better 
replacement jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic commerce is already creating new high quality 
computing and communications jobs linked to the development of 
global digital markets.  Of course the NDP will rail against it 
and claim it needs an even more iron fisted union to stop the sun 
from rising, the light of new knowledge coming in, or it will 
want a world ruler of the Tobin tax to mitigate against what it 
cannot comprehend.  Outdated political ideologies hurt people, 
stunt potential, breed poverty and perpetuate oppression and 
servitude.  That is what the NDP ideology must be understood to 
bring, in light of discussing the implications of Bill C-6 and 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the perspective of the firm, the cost of doing business on 
new electronic networks is significantly lower than the cost of 
traditional methods.  This advantage plus the ability to offer 
high value, content rich products and services has led to 
exponential growth in the number of firms entering electronic 
commerce and related businesses.  This is most evident in the 
urban North American centres but is becoming evident in other 
countries as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By bringing buyers and sellers closer together, electronic 
commerce will facilitate trade growth. Canadian wealth is based 
on international trade, but there is no help from the NDP 
anti-traders belief system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about also has consequences for taxation and 
tariffs.  Jurisdictional rules applying to taxes and tariffs are 
generally based on concepts of physical geography, such as place 
of supply or residence of a taxpayer.  As electronic commerce is 
not bound by physical geography, it may become difficult for 
taxpayers and governments to determine jurisdiction and revenue 
rights.  For consumption taxes, there may be a need for action to 
avoid double or non-taxation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The availability, reliability and completeness of commercial 
records generated in an electronic commercial environment, 
including those from electronic payment systems, are also of 
concern.  Such records must be relied upon to ensure that 
taxation and tariffs have been appropriately and fairly applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many forms of taxation and tariffs are levelled on physical 
goods.  The ability in electronic commerce to create electronic 
substitutes like electronic books presents challenges for revenue 
collection and the archaic quota regimes overseen by our heritage 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existence of electronic products also raises issues of 
fairness between taxes and tariffs imposed on physical goods and 
electronic substitutes.  The ability within the electronic 
distribution channels to bypass any or all of these traditional 
middlemen between producer and consumer raises serious issues for 
the collection of taxes, particularly withholding taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of electronic commerce technologies in the form of 
intranets by multinationals and collaborative groups may tend to 
increase the prevalence of transfer pricing and increase the 
difficulty of detecting such behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The predicted growth of international electronic commerce, much 
of which may be undertaken by smaller less sophisticated 
businesses, may mean the number of unintentional breaches of 
international revenue laws could increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the global nature of electronic commerce, it is important 
that the decisions taken by government continue to allow for the 
international flow of data.  Moreover, technological tools will 
offer new ways to allow users to protect themselves.  Some of 
them are mechanisms for verifying information such as labelling 
systems which certify that an online business meets certain good 
standards of business.  Other mechanisms exist for notifying 
consumers of legal jurisdiction or venue for resolving disputes 
arising from a transaction.  Some others allow consumers to 
access educational messages that describe their rights in the 
context of electronic transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada certainly needs to work with the international community 
to provide a forum for continuing exchange of views on developing 
technologies and an institutional framework to support them.  We 
also have to increase the financial and electronic literacy of 
the Canadian people.  It is not enough to know how to balance a 
chequebook any more.  Even those fortunate to have the help of 
accountants sometimes have a hard time understanding all the ins 
and outs of investing in an RSP, paying off credit card debt or 
refinancing a mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowledge is power and as Canadians understand technology they 
will use it in ways that make it accountable to them, as it 
enhances their quality of life.  Laws and regulations must go 
hand in hand with an informed public if technology is to serve us 
rather than us serving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As reported in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> today, Ontario residents 
may soon have a single computerized card that will do everything 
from providing access to health care to serving as a driver's 
licence under a new project unveiled by the province.  The smart 
card concept announced in the provincial government's throne 
speech yesterday, it is hoped, will mean more convenience for the 
public and less fraud.  The term usually refers to a credit card 
with a tiny computer chip that contains lots of information about 
the cardholder that can replace the need for many cards.  The one 
card will include a driver's licence, access to services such as 
medicare, social assistance and senior benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future is here.  How far off will it be that a ton of 
information that can be put on one small card will simply be put 
on a microscopic chip under the skin on one's hand?  By then the 
universal numbers will be assigned at birth, which can be the 
international drawing rights credit card, citizenship and right 
to vote registration for the world, and contain personal 
international telephone and computer access numbers.  The 
technology seems to be coming, but are the law and society ready 
for these realities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are trying to do with Bill C-6.  It is an 
attempt to improve privacy, enhance disclosure, combat fraud, 
increase access and bring the transactional world of commerce and 
law under some semblance of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the official opposition engaged fully in the process 
of the bill.  We offered a number of constructive improvements 
which the government was rather arrogant about accepting, as old 
style governments usually are.  Nevertheless Reformers support 
the bill since it is as good as we can get it at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform recognizes the fine line between the right of Canadians 
to have freedom of speech and the right of privacy.  The need for 
that balance has become acute as Canadians embrace new 
technologies.  Therefore we support the regulation that Bill C-6 
introduces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the world changes and the proposed act needs adjustment in 
the future, I hope it will not take as long to do as the years it 
took the hapless Conservative and the bumbling Liberal 
governments to update the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 
Nevertheless the government had at least one good minister to 
finally get it done, the Minister of Industry.

the ones used to harness the opportunities and benefits of the

so, as they were a century ago.  It is now time to use them to 
seize the enormous potential of the information revolution for 
every Canadian citizen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, here we are 
at third reading of Bill C-6, formerly Bill C-54, whereby the 
federal government intends, as far as we are concerned in 
Quebec, to become king and master of what the protection of 
personal information should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of all the attempts on the part of the Bloc Quebecois 
and all those who came before the parliamentary committee to 
show how bad this bill would be for Quebec, we are not debating 
it at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further, I want to salute the excellent job 
done by my colleague from Mercier who single-handedly carried 
this matter for a year to bring government members to realize 
the impact this bill would have in Quebec and how flawed it is 
even for those Canadians it purports to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the real efficiency of this bill which is 
more about promoting electronic commerce than protecting 
personal information. This week, the government decided to ram 
through this bill by the end of business today and to defer the 
division at third reading until the beginning of next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains some amendments coming from the government. 
It is important to know that, half way through, the government 
saw the holes in its bills and started improvizing, trying to 
improve certain areas, tabling amendments of its own after 
witnesses were heard in committee. Thus, the government, 
realizing its bill was flawed, brought in new amendments, but 
did not allow any debate on them to give people a chance to be 
heard. Groups who appeared before the committee never saw them, 
which creates a very dangerous situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strangely enough, some of the last-minute amendments exempt the 
government from the application of its own act in a number of 
cases. Is it not strange that the government should come to this 
realization only after the committee hearing stage, and that it 
thought appropriate to give itself and its components some 
manoeuvering room in order not to abide by its own law? 
This is a bit surprising coming from a government that says it 
wants to protect people but is looking for ways to avoid doing 
so itself whenever possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the case of Quebec.  For five years now, 
Quebec has had an act for the protection of personal information 
in the private sector.  This act serves as a model, because 
there are very few others like it; in fact, it is the only one 
of its kind in North America.  Now the federal government has 
decided to take a page from our book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a desirable thing that all Canadians be protected with 
respect to the distribution of their personal information.  But, 
seeing how slow the other provinces have been to act, the 
federal government decided to introduce legislation.  I would 
point out, however, that the provinces, in conjunction with the 
federal government, had already embarked on a process of 
harmonizing legislation. 
But, last year, the federal government decided unilaterally to 
withdraw from the process and come up with its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It withdrew from the joint effort it had embarked on with the 
provinces, an exercise in which Quebec had pointed out that it 
had its own legislation.  By the way, there are two relevant 
instruments in Quebec: the act, and the Civil Code, which also 
governs the protection of personal information.  If memory 
serves, the applicable articles of the Civil Code are 35 to 40. 
The act is thoroughly steeped in Quebec's civil law tradition, 
as opposed to the common law tradition on which the federal 
government's approach is based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enforcement will be extremely 
difficult.  It is no accident that the Barreau du Québec, the 
Chambre des notaires, the Conseil du patronat, and a union body 
such as the CSN told the government that what it was proposing 
for Quebec was ridiculous, that it would be unworkable and 
complicated for businesses, a complete disaster.

the federal government.  It does not need any legislation to 
encourage it.  It is developing at a phenomenal rate and will 
continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed is assurance of the protection of distribution, 
disclosure and transmission of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has seen fit to provide for this in a 
schedule to its legislation, not in the legislation itself, and 
in a conditional mode.  I will give hon. members an example of 
the very fuzzy concepts its contains.  In the Government of 
Quebec's legislation, the consent for release of specific 
information must be very clear. 
The individual must have consented to the transfer of his 
personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level, the approach is far more vague, so things 
are not as clear.  Explicit consent is not necessarily required. 
Once again, it can be seen that the two governments are guided 
by two very different mindsets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue by quoting from the testimony of some of those 
who appeared before the committee. In fact, I intend to quote 
two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was preparing my speech for this morning, a comment I 
heard came to mind. A man spoke of his fear that the 
organizations with the greatest interest in invading our privacy 
were the ones setting the legislative agenda. 
He said “Now it is clear that Bill C-54”—now Bill C-6—“is an 
initiative on e-commerce.  I believe it is useful to note that 
the words `consumers', `businesses', and `industry' appear 78 
times, while `citizen' appears only ten times”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So said Valerie Steve, a professor at the human rights research 
and education centre.  This then is a very different approach 
from what the government was boasting about this morning, saying 
that it wants is simply to protect personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now quote from the remarks made by the former president 
of the Quebec bar association, who also has interesting things 
to say.  He said “From a very careful reading of Bill C-54, in my 
opinion, this would mean a significant step backwards for 
Quebec”. I repeat “in my own opinion, this would mean a very 
significant step backwards for Quebec”. 
He added “These regulations, in fact, this sort of voluntary 
standard, are given the status of law by making them a schedule. 
They are not stringent enough to protect consumers.  They are 
full of loopholes for commerce.  It is based in large part on a 
completely outmoded approach to consumer protection with 
virtually non existent rights of recourse”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that we will soon be proceeding to Statements by Members 
and Oral Question Period. I will continue afterward.  I will 
return to the notion of recourse for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask for unanimous consent to have my speaking time of 
40 minutes split into two 20 minute periods, since I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Mercier. 
I have used about ten minutes so far and, after my second ten 
minute period, the member for Mercier will finish the 40 minute 
period, if there is unanimous consent. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to permit

farmers across the country are going broke or are having a 
difficult time making ends meet.  For most it is through no fault 
of their own.  Farmers are paying the price for this government 
letting them down in trade talks, for this government overtaxing 
them everywhere they turn and through everything they buy, for 
this government imposing unfair user fees on them and for this 
government burdening our farmers with unnecessary red tape and 
over regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For six years Reform has fought for the government to lower 
taxes, to remove unfair user fees, to reduce red tape and to get

compensating farmers through a trade distortion adjustment 
program for losses resulting from unfair trade practices on the 
part of Europe, the United States, Asia and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely even this government must see that it is reasonable for 
farmers to receive compensation for losses resulting from unfair

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberals need to stop saying one thing when they 
mean another.  Take the notion of pay equity.  Canadians want 
anyone doing the same job to be paid the same.  Same job, same 
pay, that is pay equity, except if you are a Liberal.  To them 
the state should decide what your job is worth and which job 
should be paid the same as other jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the state make this leap of logic?  The Liberals cannot 
really say.  But naturally they know better than workers, unions 
and employers what jobs are worth, and once that dollar figure 
has been pulled out of the Liberal hat, someone has to pay a lot 
of money, unless that someone is a Liberal.  They fight for years 
not to have to pay the price of their own foolishness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equity means fairness and equal treatment.  Only the Liberals 
could undermine this fine principle by using it to cloak 
arbitrary state intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians beware, fairness can become what the government says 
is fair not what citizens agree is fair in free negotiations.  Is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this week 
has been the fourth annual YWCA Week Without Violence, the 
campaign where all Canadians are challenged to build solutions to 
violence in their own communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of parliament for Dartmouth, I know where much of 
the violence in my community comes from.  It is from poverty, 
from hopelessness and from an sense of deep frustration of being 
left out of the good things which the country has to offer.  It 
comes from running up against brick walls as people look for 
jobs, decent housing, pensions, as they stand in line at food 
banks.  It comes from seeing government policies that do not 
address these issues but instead continue to maintain high levels 
of poverty, unemployment and economic barriers to higher 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we applaud the YWCA for its efforts to draw attention to 
violence, let us here in the House collectively address the roots 
of poverty with progress and with humane policies that put people 
first, children first and equity first.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>APEC INQUIRY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister claimed in the House that there was no proof that 
he was involved in the APEC security arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, documents released by the RCMP Public Complaints 
Commission show that the Prime Minister and his office were up to 
their eyeballs in taking action against the APEC protesters.  The 
Prime Minister told the House that he had nothing to do with it 
and yet we now find that he and his staff were intricately 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister and his office tell police that they 
had to find some way to get those protesters out of there? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this matter is being considered by the Public Complaints 
Commission under the former Mr. Justice Hughes.  This is an 
independent tribunal.  I suggest we let the tribunal get on with 
its work in examining this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also point out that senior officials of the Prime 
Minister's office have already testified.  I suggest that the 
hon. member look at what they have to say and take that into 
account as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
incredible as it sounds, in order to stop the protesters at the 
APEC meetings, the Prime Minister arranged to temporarily lease 
land from UBC so that he could charge any protesters for 
trespassing, arrest them and then throw them in jail.  In other 
words, where it was perfectly legal and lawful to protest one day 
it suddenly became a place to charge, arrest and jail students 
the next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these legal shenanigans the Prime Minister's way of getting 
around the charter protected rights of these protesting students? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I reject categorically the premise of the hon. member's 
question.  I do not accept it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat that this matter is being considered by an arm's 
length tribunal headed by a very distinguished former judge.  He 
will take all these documents into account.  Let us wait until he 
states his conclusion. 
That is what we should do if we respect the work of the tribunal. 
That work should not be carried on in the House when the tribunal 
has been set up to do that work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, here 
is what an independent RCMP Public Complaints Commission found. 
It found that the chief of APEC security was quoted as saying 
“Even they, the prime minister's staff, say they are not 
concerned about the security aspect of the Prime Minister's 
visit; it's the politics of it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Prime Minister and his office were prepared 
to move in on protesters, not because they did anything wrong, 
no, it was because the Prime Minister did not want it to look bad 
for the dictator Suharto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister pressure the RCMP to compromise the 
legal rights of the protesters in order to protect the dictator 
Suharto?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not accept, in fact I reject the premise of the 
hon. member's question.  At the same time, I wonder why the hon. 
member does not respect the jurisdiction of the tribunal and 
wants to have its work duplicated improperly in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very distinguished former judge is looking into this matter. 
Contrary to what the hon. member has said, the tribunal has not 
reached any conclusions.  We will be happy to see the conclusions 
and have them considered once they are reached and announced by 
the judge.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the opposition rejects the premise of the Deputy Prime Minister's 
answers.  He is trying to throw a wet blanket on APEC and that is 
not going to work.  It is not going to go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister still denies he was directly involved.  Let 
me read a quote from one of the police officers at that time. The 
police officer said “We know how we normally treat things, but 
then the Prime Minister is not directly involved.  But right now 
the Prime Minister of our country is directly involved and he's 
going to start giving orders”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What part of that quote does the Deputy Prime Minister not 
understand? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what I do not understand is why the Reform Party is 
unwilling to let an independent arm's length tribunal carry on 
its work and allow the commissioner, Mr. Hughes, to consider all 
the matters in question, including the evidence of senior 
officials of the Prime Minister's office, and then reach his 
conclusions and issue his report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Reform Party not understand the process of justice 
in the country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B> It would be 
nice, Mr. Speaker, if the Deputy Prime Minister answered 
questions instead of asking them all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister on October 28, 1998 said “At that time I did not 
have time to discuss anything with police.  Anybody with common 
sense would know that”.  Not only was the Prime Minister burning 
up the phone lines, but now we learn he was busy leasing land in 
order to crack down on student protesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister continue to stubbornly deny he was 
directly involved in APEC operations when everybody with common 
sense knows he was? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I again reject the premise of the hon. member's 
question.  There has not been a finding to that effect by Mr. 
Hughes.  The commission has not completed its hearings.  Mr. 
Hughes has not rendered his judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member asks why in addition to answering questions I 
ask them, I want to demonstrate that the Reform Party members on 
this or any other subject fail to have any real, meaningful or 
important answers.  They do not have the answers and they do not 
have the facts.

it is clear that there is a big difference between the Reform 
Party and our government. I remind everyone that the Reform Party 
in its electoral platform said: “We will discontinue employment 
equity programs and will repeal section 15(2) of the charter of 
rights and freedoms”.  That is the section about equality 
rights.  I do not think we have any reason to hear from the 
Reform Party on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bureaucrats assigning an arbitrary value to jobs has nothing to 
do with fairness.  It has nothing to do with unity.  Every other 
worker in the country can now kiss a tax cut goodbye so the 
government can finance its loss to the federal court.  It is hard 
to see the equity in that.  There goes the surplus.  There goes 
tax relief.

cause the government to back down on its commitment in the throne

Speaker, the consumer price index shows that the price of energy, 
the linchpin of our economy, is driving inflation hard.  Overall 
energy costs are up 13% over the past year, but gas prices are at 
record highs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These high energy prices are driving up rail and trucking costs 
and reducing the disposable incomes of Canadians while giving big 
oil companies record profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the Minister of Industry ignored the competition 
problems in gasoline retailing when the clear result has been 
record high gas prices, higher inflation and the potential for 
higher interest and mortgage rates?  When will he start 
protecting consumers instead of big business? 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is ironic to listen to a member of the NDP from 
Saskatchewan make a statement like that one.  Even in Ontario 
yesterday the provincial government recognized its responsibility 
for pricing in the retail sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Government of Saskatchewan wishes to follow the example 
of the Government of Prince Edward Island, the Government of 
Quebec and what is proposed in Newfoundland to have a provincial 
pricing regime for gasoline, let the member take it to his own 
government which is of his own political stripe.

to say that since the minister has become the minister of 
fisheries he has been sleepwalking through the Marshall file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even more shocking that the current Minister of the 
Environment, the former minister of fisheries, did not even give 
a political heads up to the new minister on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that these two ministers and cabinet in general have, to 
be polite, lost all credibility on the issue, will the Deputy 
Prime Minister stand in the House today and make two principles 
very clear: that conservation and preservation of lobsters stocks 
are paramount and, second, that the livelihoods of traditional 
fishers will not be jeopardized by any potential decision that DFO 
may undertake?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and

by putting conservation as the priority, our government position, 
and we followed that through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as commercial fishermen, I have said in the House before

exactly what we are doing through dialogue and co-operation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, during question period today a member on the other

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lakeland, when the President of the Treasury

in response to the member's point of order, I think, as you are 
well aware, our emotions run high during question period and 
during debate in this place. 
In fact, the member for Peterborough last week called me a racist 
in this place.  I did not get up and ask for a withdrawal of that

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of motion that Bill C-6, an act to 
support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal 
information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain 
circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic means to 
communicate or record information or transactions and by 
amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act

<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
information of our viewers, I would like to point out that today 
we are debating Bill C-6 at third reading stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is the one and only day of debate on this bill at third 
reading, because the government has decided to gag all those of 
us who would have liked to give their point of view on this bill 
after today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are familiar with House procedure know that Friday is 
the sitting day that has the shortest period for government 
orders. The gag order has been imposed, and we will not be able 
to continue this debate after today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is something else. It is rather curious in our system, 
and it is part and parcel of the problems of the Canadian 
federation. Two ministers of the Quebec government have asked 
for a meeting with a federal minister in order to discuss the 
terrible problems this bill will create in Quebec. These two 
ministers have asked for a meeting. That is not a big deal. But 
they got a rather cool reception: the federal government is not 
in the least bit interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week ago, in a long speech called the throne speech, this same 
government was extolling the virtues of the Canadian way, the 
co-operation between the federal government and the provinces. 
Two elected ministers representing the people of Quebec asked 
for a meeting and got no other answer than the one given here 
during Oral Question Period, namely that the federal government 
was not interested in meeting them, that it was not interested 
in their point of view, that it had decided to go ahead because 
it believed it was in the public's best interest to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, this same government delivered lengthy speeches, 
claiming to be co-operating in what it called the Canadian 
approach. But there is the rhetoric, and then there is the 
reality. Today, we are talking about the reality, and the 
reality is that there is no co-operation. 
And then the federal government wonders why, year after year, 
for the past 35 or 40 years, more and more people in Quebec want 
out of this political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to Bill C-6, a number of government amendments were 
made after the committee discussions. As a result, none of the 
witnesses were able to comment on them when they appeared before 
the committee. I will mention two in particular, which are 
extremely worrying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Division 1 of the bill, which deals with the protection of 
personal information, clause 7 says, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>7. (1) For the purpose of clause 4.3 of Schedule 1, and despite 
the note that accompanies that clause, an organization may 
collect personal information without the knowledge or consent of 
the individual only if— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about exceptions whereby the government could, 
without the knowledge of the individual—what is meant by that is 
explained further on—collect information without the consent of 
this individual. And then comes the list of exceptions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government bill provides for an exception for investigative 
bodies in specific instances. That exception, for investigative 
bodies, applies to circumstances where the government believes 
or has reasonable grounds to believe that offences have been 
committed. Therefore, it is possible, under such circumstances, 
not to comply with the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This started out as a rather limited definition or exception. 
Already, in committee, that definition began to be broadened a 
little. 
What the exception says is that it is possible not to comply, 
without the knowledge or consent of the individual, only if the 
disclosure is 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>d</I>) made on the initiative of the organization to an 
investigative body and the information relates to an offence 
under the laws of Canada or a province that has been or is about 
to be committed— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then this has been added: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—or to activities suspected of constituting threats to the 
security of Canada; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the committee hearings, this concept of exception began to be 
broadened. The federal government felt that it was a good idea 
to have that exception for threats to security, and now, after 
the committee stage, it is adding, in what is becoming subclause 
<I>c</I>.1), what is suggested in the government's Motion No. 15: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>c</I>.1) made to a government institution or part of a government 
institution that has made a request for the information, 
identified its lawful authority to obtain the information and 
indicated that 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) it suspects that the information relates to national 
security, the defence of Canada or the conduct of international 
affairs, 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there is now reference not to “reasonable grounds” but to 
suspicions and three categories are defined: “national 
security”, “defence of Canada” and “conduct of international 
affairs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing how paranoid the government gets when sovereignist 
members of parliament go overseas and do a good job of 
expressing Quebec's point of view, we also must ask how far the 
government will go in its suspicions about international affairs 
and national security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will now be able to ignore its own legislation if 
it thinks that the information it is seeking—I am sorry, I guess 
I should say if it suspects that the information it is seeking, 
and some wise guy could get up one morning and say that he 
suspects—concerns these things. The federal government, a 
government agency or a subdivision of such an agency, if it has 
suspicions, will be able to ignore this act, which should 
guarantee the protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is not enough to worry you, it certainly is enough to 
worry me and I am convinced that it also worries a lot of 
Canadians. I hope that the Privacy Commissioner will also be 
worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to hearing his comments on the proposed 
amendments, as the minister quoted him earlier as speaking 
highly of this act. I am convinced that the commissioner will 
not approve of this initiative and of these last minute 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if by chance, and I have a hard time believing that the 
government did not mean to do this from the beginning, these 
amendments were tabled after the committee hearings. It is  as 
if the government had not wanted to hear people's comments on 
this particular part of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has presented another motion dealing with 
investigative bodies. I will attempt a comparison here. For the 
investigative bodies who believe that there was a violation, the 
exception will apply if they have reasonable cause to believe 
that the violation occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the investigative bodies, the words are “reasonable cause to 
believe”. 
However, where national security or the conduct of international 
affairs arre involved, suspicion is enough. The same act, on the 
same page, uses two different concepts. It will be enough for 
the government to suspect, whereas the investigative bodies will 
need a reasonable cause to believe. It is in fact a lot more 
reasonable to require a reasonable cause than only a suspicion. 
But then again, this does not mean that there was no recourse in 
the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is possible to swear out a warrant to obtain information. To 
obtain such a warrant, one must explain why the information is 
needed. The system offers some protection, since the warrant is 
issued by a judge who must ensure that the information required 
will be obtained by appropriate means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is much cause for concern. I said so earlier this 
week in a press conference. We do not know how the government 
will use the information and what it really has in mind. It is 
the Big Brother syndrome. The government wants to control all 
kinds of information and is setting up the legislative framework 
it needs to do whatever it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of this bill give rise to many very serious 
concerns. Let me repeat our objections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are against the bill because Quebec has already passed 
legislation on this and because the federal act will only create 
duplication and cause many problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a harmonization and discussion process was started with 
the provinces to establish a common framework. However, the 
federal government pulled out of this process and decided that 
it would decide on its own what is good and in the interest of 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? For reasons of international visibility, because Canada 
wants to show leadership and boast that it passed legislation. 
Yet, the bill is riddled with loopholes. 
Even if in some parts of the bill the government is proposing 
measures that are both flawed and vague, it can still say that 
is does have legislation. There is more to it than just passing 
a law. There has to be some real impact to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives us 
another reason to oppose this bill, since the protection of 
personal information under this bill is subject to many 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be hard to enforce this bill. The people who want to do 
e-commerce have a lot to gain by using personnel information, but 
the citizens would have liked better protection. Here again, we 
have another reason to oppose this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to play with rhetoric. 
I listened earlier to those who are in favour of the bill. They 
were defending some fundamental principles, as if they were 
speaking on a motion to protect personal information. This is 
not what we are doing here: we are considering a bill with real 
provisions in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that I am very surprised to see the Reform Party 
supporting this bill; in fact, I am stunned. But they will have 
to defend their stance, it is their problem. I am also very 
surprised to see that federal Liberal members from Quebec are 
not interested in this issue and come to the House only to 
reiterate what has been said by the industry minister, who does 
not seem to care much about what is going on in Quebec in this 
area as in many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not a peep out of these Liberal members. We did not 
hear from them, we did not see them. It is as if they simply did 
not care. 
I am convinced that some of them do not even know that there is 
a personal information protection act for the private sector in 
Quebec. Where are the people who defend this bill? Who are they 
defending? Are they defending their government in Quebec, or are 
they defending their Quebec voters in Ottawa? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is the first option. These people are strictly 
propaganda agents in Quebec, nothing else. This is very 
regretful. Next week, and this is my prediction, we will see 
another example of this with the Young Offenders Act. These 
Liberal “carpet MPs” from Quebec will do the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not one of them will rise. Yet, there is a great deal of 
opposition in Quebec regarding the legislation on young 
offenders, as there is regarding the bill now before us. And 
this opposition is not just from the Bloc Quebecois or the 
Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commission d'accès à l'information presented a very detailed 
submission to the committee. The Barreau du Québec also came and 
said the same things. The Chambre des notaires du Québec told us 
about the problems that this bill would create. The Conseil du 
patronat and the CSN did the same. So, representatives of the 
management, unions, lawyers and notaries, in other words all 
those who will have to live with this legislation, are telling 
the government, if only it is willing to listen, that what it is 
doing does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this is not important to the Minister of Industry. It does 
not bother him at all. He does not even want to take the time to 
discuss his bill with the Quebec government, is spite of 
repeated requests to that effect. This all began in November 
1998. It continued in January, in April, and recently through 
letters. 
The government never agreed to meet the expectations and 
requests of the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, this is my last intervention on this bill. My 
colleague, the hon. member for Mercier, will use up the time 
left. I will conclude by saying that even if the bill is passed 
by next week, the government will continue to hear about it 
because, as far as we are concerned, the fight will not be over.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a lot of practical issues and we will be here day 
after day to remind the Minister of Industry of the negative 
impact that his bill will have in Quebec. The minister will 
still hear from us. I hope that some Liberal MPs from Quebec 
will soon wake up and remember, when the time comes to vote next 
week, who elected them and whom they should represent in this 
House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want 
to thank my colleague from Témiscamingue for sharing his 
speaking time with me. He knows how much the fight against this 
legislation is close to my heart, and I think that he is 
carrying the torch beautifully, as usual. I know he will 
continue to fight in this House against this legislation that 
cannot be allowed to go unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having followed this legislation through all the stages since 
its tabling in early September, last year, effectively 
suspending the long-standing consultation process between the 
provinces and the federal government, it is clear to me that the 
minister of Industry could have used the time available to him 
to try to harmonize his bill with the Quebec legislation. But he 
obviously did not even try to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, this minister is an intelligent man. Why has he not 
tried to make stock of the Quebec experience? I should point out 
that Quebec is the first North American state to have passed, in 
1994, a legislation for the protection of personal information. 
Quebec's five-year experience made it possible to confirm with 
businesses that the law was starting to be enforced seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no personal information protection culture. Neither is 
there sufficient training for the public. In Quebec however the 
law was starting to be seriously applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of building on this experience, the minister has 
developed an altogether new logic based on a national standard 
originally designed as a voluntary measure by businesses. That 
is what he would rather have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He decided to change this proposal, which was not as stringent 
as a legislative proposal would be. He made it into a 
legislative proposal and an appendix to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the opinion of several legal counsels and according to 
witnesses who appeared before the committee, this is the worst 
legislation ever developed. But this act is not just any act. It 
does not respect the spirit of the Speech from the Throne and is 
not some kind of government provision. No, it is an act similar 
to the Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act is one people will actually have to work with. Citizens 
who want their personal information to be protected will depend 
on it. The situation will be extremely confusing for Quebecers. 
Why? Precisely because the minister decided to ignore Quebec's 
experience and did not even try to accommodate Quebec's act. He 
chose to use a completely different logic. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say this: I know that those who worked to have a Canadian 
standard, a voluntary standard for businesses, developed—and we 
have nothing against that, on the contrary—are for the most part 
from Quebec. The Civil Liberties Union was one of them. But some 
of the individuals who participated in this process told me that 
they would never have done it had they known that their work 
might be used as the foundation for a piece of legislation, 
because it was not designed for legislative purposes. It does 
not specifically provide citizens with rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now reviewing a legislation that will soon be enacted. On 
the pretext of dealing with electronic commerce, this federal 
act would infringe upon a jurisdiction that comes under the 
provinces, and Quebec in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that the other provinces, after reacting strongly, 
through their justice ministers, when they looked into the 
federal government's bill, decided to put up with this, with the 
exception of Ontario with regard to health information, and 
maybe a number of other provinces in western Canada. The fact is 
that they did not have any legislation in that area. This bill, 
which will soon become law, means that Quebec will have to 
enforce a federal act in an area under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must know that, prior to the federal government legislating 
in that area, personal information enjoyed complete protection 
under Quebec's legislation. According to the legal 
interpretations we have seen, only the adoption of a federal act 
could challenge the application of the provincial act. Again, I 
do not know what decisions will be made but, for the time being, 
Quebec's legislation continues to provide complete protection 
with regard to personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the federal act do? It says—actually, it is the 
minister who introduced it and the government that supported it 
who had the nerve to say this—that, in an area that comes under 
Quebec's jurisdiction, it will be up to the federal government 
to decide in which circumstances the provincial act will apply, 
in what area and to which organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a mess. Will this mess promote better enforcement of the 
law? It will, and for a long time, not provide greater 
protection but, on the contrary, slow down the process that gave 
Quebec a system that was working more and more smoothly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say briefly that, contrary the federal legislation, 
Quebec's legislation is clear. People can see what their rights 
are. 
It is easy to apply because any citizen can go to the Human 
Rights Commission where, after an inquiry, a decision is 
rendered. The Commission can make a ruling and exercise this 
right so all citizens can obtain justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most people, the issue of personal information protection is 
about changing some incorrect information contained in a 
person's file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal legislation provides that that person must try to 
agree with the company, and when this is not possible, he or she 
must file a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner. After 
reviewing the case, the commissioner makes a recommendation 
which is forwarded to the complainant. A report is produced 
within a year and if the complainant is not satisfied, he or she 
may take the case before the federal court. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Privacy Commissioner can also decide, in 
exceptional cases, to take the case himself before the federal 
court. Otherwise, after the long process provided in the bill, 
the complainant is back at square one and still has to pay if he 
wants the recommendation to become a ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the minister say that Canadians want their personal 
information protected. Yes, they do and they should not have to 
wait. 
But when he says, however, that the bill will ensure the 
protection of personal information, I respectfully submit that 
the minister has maybe relied too much on his counsellors and, 
above all, that he has not looked at Quebec's legislation. He 
has not considered that there could be more efficient and 
clearer ways to protect the rights of citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more. Not only the federal legislation will be 
enforced, but it will also state in what fields the provincial 
legislation can be applied. But does the citizen who has a 
problem with a business know if it is federally or provincially 
regulated according to this legislation? What will he do? He 
will either not file a complaint at all or file one with the 
wrong government, in which case the legal time limit could 
expire. This legislation will create more confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for good reason then that, on five occasions, Quebec's 
ministers wrote to the industry minister and requested a meeting 
with him, and asked him to postpone the process in order to 
harmonize it. We, members of the Bloc Quebecois, have repeatedly 
tried to convince the industry committee and the minister to 
take advantage of the delays during the session of Parliament, 
or even of the summer recess, to make an attempt at 
harmonization. Why did the government not try to do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended the Forum of Federations, where I heard what I 
already know: Federalism—and I am not talking about Canadian 
federalism—is a system that is theoretically flexible. It is a 
system that, in theory, allows different cultures and languages 
to coexist. 
I say theoretically because the process of legislation on 
personal information in which I have been involved for more than 
a year is not the least bit flexible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the theoreticians, including those working for the 
Forum of Federations, federations work best in homogeneous 
countries.  That is the problem.  The problem is that Quebec is 
a people and a nation.  Its privacy legislation is governed by 
civil law, with its origins in France.  But it is civil law. The 
rest of Canada is governed by common law—this is not a defect, 
just a difference. 
In fact, in the western world there are two major traditions, 
civil law and common law.  Now, instead of trying to take the 
difference into consideration, the federal government has chosen 
to eliminate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one more lesson. 
Any student of law, politics or anyone else wanting to know the 
status of Canadian federalism has only to trace the process of 
passage of this legislation.  It is a significant piece of 
legislation, since it goes to the very heart of Quebec civil 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to accompany the 
minister to the G-8 summit, where one of the issues addressed was 
e-commerce security. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I discovered, and the minister ought to have before me, when 
there are international negotiations on harmonization—as there 
will have to be, because a degree of harmonization on personal 
information based on existing legislation will be necessary—he 
will find that Quebec is not alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European countries with 
their differences and their civil law will do as Quebec has 
done, use a definition of a positive right for citizens.  He may 
also, of course, find there are other countries with a common 
law tradition that will settle for standards—I will withdraw 
that expression—will prefer protection related to standards to 
which businesses agree to comply. 
Someday, negotiations will have to take place, and Canada could 
have benefited from the fact that it still has a province, 
Quebec, which has a civil law tradition, instead of trying to 
bury this tradition and replace it by something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of making good use of the time it had on its hands to 
harmonize both legislations, it has steadfastly refused to do 
it. Instead of using to its advantage the Quebec experience to 
deal with an issue that is quite difficult, as it will find out, 
it preferred to go about it in a completely different way, with 
a totally different logic, by relying almost totally on 
businesses' co-operation. Quite well. Everything is fine when 
businesses do co-operate, but what happens when they do not? What 
should we do? Should we let private citizens fend for 
themselves? Of course not. That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the citizens' rights are not clearly and precisely spelled 
out, when the means to have them respected are not free and 
efficient, we can have all the legislation we want, it is of no 
use to them. Instead of using the Quebec experience, in which 
companies will have to abide by a certain set of rules, it will 
force companies in Quebec to follow two set of rules, never 
knowing for sure which one applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has refused 
to even try to harmonize its legislation with the one in Quebec. 
Instead of taking this advantage it will soon need in 
international negotiation, that is the experience of harmonizing 
two great traditions, the civil law and the common law, the 
government chose to set one of these traditions aside, the 
French one, to bury it, and forget about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chambre des notaires is extremely concerned about the 
definitions of signature. 
The Chambre des notaires can only accept a document if the 
signature meets the conditions set out in the Quebec Civil Code. 
This is a whole aspect of French live, Quebec tradition and 
culture which is at stake, and the minister, instead of 
understanding the intensity of the responses triggered by this, 
and the depth of the problems created, prefers to ignore the 
whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this bill, when it becomes law, will come back to 
haunt the government because it is not true that it will promote 
the development of electronic commerce. Everybody has been 
saying that people must feel safer before they engage in more 
electronic commerce. This bill will certainly not achieve this 
goal in Quebec, on the contrary. 
It creates—as if on purpose, but let us assume it is not on 
purpose—additional problems for every Quebec company and for all 
the companies that do business in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the international level also, this bill will come back to 
haunt the government. For my part, I came to the full 
realization, once again, that when it comes to the legislative 
process, Canadian federalism is not consistent with the main 
characteristics of federalism.

<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the last presentation and I 
agree with some of the points that the hon. member made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to participate in today's debate.  This is 
probably one of the most important debates that we will have in 
the House for some time dealing with the future of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it must be difficult after lunch to have so many members 
in the Chamber trying to stay awake to listen to my presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember giving a speech once and there was a young man in the 
back of the crowd.  He kept saying, “Yea, yea”.  I thought it 
was very nice and very encouraging.  At the end of my speech I 
was commenting to one of my friends about this young man's 
enthusiasm.  My friend said “Did you not notice that he had his 
headphone on and was actually listening to the hockey game”. In 
any event, I know, Mr. Speaker, that you will be listening to my 
presentation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very enthusiastic about speaking to Bill C-6 today.  The 
bill aims to support and promote electronic commerce by 
increasing Canadians' confidence in online transactions, 
providing protection for personal information that is collected, 
adjusting the legal framework for the electronic environment and 
providing an alternative means for the federal government to 
provide services to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct my comments in particular to the people in the gallery 
who I think sometimes get the wrong impression that we are here 
in the Chamber fist-fighting, arguing and yelling at each other 
all the time when in fact most of the time it is fairly boring 
here.  I mean boring in a sense that it is very straightforward. 
I am probably not going to change that mode this afternoon as I 
make my presentation on Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I normally like to be a bit more flamboyant in my presentations 
but this is a very detailed piece of legislation.  It is very 
specific and very integrate in terms of dealing with protecting 
Canadians' privacy.  I will quote from the privacy commissioner's 
annual report of 1998-99 when he refers to this specific 
legislation and states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the bill will take the most important step in defence of 
individual privacy since passage of the Privacy Act bound the 
federal government in 1982. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of our concern here in this place for people's security 
and the security of their personal information, whether it is 
medical records, financial records or whatever, this piece of 
legislation takes us further than any other piece of legislation, 
bar none, with the exception perhaps of the Privacy Act itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner goes on to say that the bill is a major 
leap forward by providing a mechanism for independent oversight, 
mandating the Privacy Commissioner of Canada to investigate 
complaints, issue reports and conduct audits.  As a last resort, 
it provides recourse to the federal court and empowers the court 
to award damages when it feels the penalty is justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on, but the privacy commissioner basically 
states that this is really important and significant legislation. 
It recognizes that the world of commerce, in which all of us 
participate either in our roles as businesses or as consumers, is 
more different today than it ever has been.  It has taken on a 
speed and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  It is not a 
nine to five operation any more as it used to be just a handful 
of years ago. There is indeed a business-industry revolution 
taking place before our eyes.  The transactions are so horrendous 
in both scope and speed that something has to be done in order to 
protect Canadians' private information.

using it.  Hopefully, the person at the other end of the line is 
not an unscrupulous type.  In terms of the need for privacy, this

we have all been there and are concerned about it.

little quote that I read somewhere which describes the Internet 
as “A worldwide network of university, government, business and

Jason”.  We all smile because we know that children are very 
comfortable with these new technologies.  In fact, I suspect that 
most adult learn their skills from their children when it comes 
to learning how to work our computers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the substance of my remarks, I would like to 
emphasize the importance that I feel the entire House of Commons, 
without regard to political affiliation, should attach to this 
matter.  We are really debating something that is very important 
to our children and their children's future.  When we talk about 
implementing legislation in the public interest, we have to 
acknowledge the entire public, and clearly that includes the 
young people of the country who are probably a whole lot more 
tuned in to what I am talking about today than most people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has been at this experiment for many 
years.  We started with the constitution and the charter of 
rights rooted in certain basic values.  The people who drafted 
our constitution and the charter of rights understood that times 
would change.  Indeed, they understood that definitions of 
fundamental things like privacy would also change. They also 
understood that circumstances would require people to rise to the 
challenges of each new era by applying the old values but in very 
practical ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, this change occurred when we went from an 
agriculture economy to an industrial economy.  This change is now 
occurring with the move toward a new modern digital economy.  It 
is our responsibility to fight to adapt our institutions to new 
economies and markets and to update and modernize our citizens' 
rights to uphold their right to privacy in the midst of these 
vast economic transformations occurring before us.  In the past, 
leaders recognized and lived up to this responsibility.  Now it 
is our opportunity and our responsibility to do the same once 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pace of change, not just the nature of change, is very 
different.  Once again it is our responsibility to respond to 
this change applying the oldest basic values and principles in 
practical ways that will allow them to not only be preserved but 
enhanced by our modern technologies during these modern times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that technology has revolutionized the way we 
live and the way we do business.  I suspect that we have only 
seen the beginning of this.  I am sure that many of us, in 
different ways, have experienced how new technology, such as the 
Internet, can be a valuable tool and a valuable resource. 
However, it is only valuable when placed at the service of 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology, by its very nature, requires unconditional respect 
for the fundamental interests of society.  On this theme there 
are only two direct topics that I would like to focus my remarks 
on today.  First, Internet technology must be at the service of 
humanity and of unalienable rights.  It must respect the 
prerogatives of a civil society, among which is the protection of 
our privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, guiding principles and values cannot be inferred from 
mere technological efficiencies of from the usefulness occurring 
to some at the expense of others.  New technologies must promote 
our integral development for the benefit of all citizens of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am going to concentrate my remarks about Bill C-6 on 
these two topics.  We have all made presentations in the House 
over the last little while about some of the very specifics of 
the legislation as well as its overall thrust.  I want to focus 
simply on two topics, the first one being the protection of our 
basic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that new technology and the amazing advances that 
have been made in telecommunications have changed the way we all 
communicate with each other.  There is no question that we are 
living through a revolution in the telecommunications industry 
with cheaper, easier to use and faster ways to communicate and do 
business with people within our homes, communities and around the 
globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that on the whole the Internet and electronic commerce 
do present outstanding possibilities for the advancement of our 
basic rights and values and, on the whole, are very beneficial 
tools to the citizens of Canada.  No doubt things such as 
education and commerce will be improved in the next few years 
because of the Internet.  Generally speaking, our daily lives 
will likely be improved.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I was visiting an elementary school.  I asked some 
rhetorical questions to I think a grade 4 or 5 class.  The 
students looked awfully little.  One young boy said “I will run 
out and find out.  I will get on the Internet and I will come 
back”.  I did not quite know what he was talking about, but he 
came back with a long printout of all the answers to the 
questions that I had been asking.  In other words, this little 
boy knew he could run out, get on the Internet and find out 
information that would probably take me a good day of searching 
in some library to find out.  I realize I have a long way to go 
to catch up to this young person who, in this case, was probably 
in grade five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A byproduct of this technological revolution is that supervising 
our rights takes on a new dimension of responsibility.  New 
Democrats realize that when the world changes so do our 
responsibilities.  Just because new technologies are developed 
does not mean that our basic rights and responsibilities no 
longer apply.  At the present time there is very little 
protection or, More precisely, there is no legislative protection 
or legal deterrent of our privacy rights in cyberspace.  There 
are mostly voluntary codes for businesses to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever exists, it does not loom large in cyberspace.  For 
example, a website posts a privacy policy.  Does that mean our 
privacy is protected?  Not really.  I do not think so, nor do 
most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task before us is to make our laws and principles apply to 
changing technology.  The old laws may require some redefinition 
but the same old general principles around protecting our privacy 
rights must stand very firm.  We must find the means to protect 
our personal information in modern times.  We cannot be neutral 
in the development of or application of these new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not acceptable that these new technologies be endorsed 
simply because of their efficiency.  In the interest of advancing 
human rights, we all have a responsibility to make sure that new 
technologies respect the values of a civil society, among which 
is the protection of our privacy rights.  That is where 
legislation like Bill C-6 comes into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Bill C-6 partly grew out of a public concern about 
personal privacy in the face of this rapidly changing technology. 
We have all become data subjects.  All sorts of organizations and 
companies have personal details about us in their computer 
databases.  While growing up our mothers may have told us that a 
person's mail is private, but in today's digital world I am not 
so sure that is the case any more, at least our name and address 
certainly are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chances are very good that most of us have had, at some 
point or another, our mailboxes stuffed and overflowing with 
catalogues, sales ads, prize offers which we never requested and 
probably do not want.  How many times have one of us been 
notified that we have won a huge benefit or something and all we 
have to do is phone up, pay a couple of thousand dollars and they 
will send it to us?  There are all kinds of legitimate 
initiatives but there are also a lot of scams out there. The 
point is that somebody somewhere gets hold of our personal 
addresses and of information about us personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that companies have sold or traded mailing lists 
containing our personal information time and time again. The 
public concern is that if the information is entirely wrong, is 
out of date, is confused with someone else's, or, in the worst 
scenario, the information is abused, it can actually cause 
serious problems.  People could be unfairly treated, denied jobs, 
housing, benefits, insurance, credit or even a spot in a 
university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today information is becoming increasingly valuable. Information 
is a valuable commodity and New Democrats believe we have to be 
leaders in developing these new ways of doing business through 
protecting individual's privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We obviously have to protect our privacy rights.  We also have 
to ensure that we solve the problem that we set out to fix and 
that the solution is in the best interest of our society.  The 
essential questions are:  Is Bill C-6 a strong law; and, if 
enacted, does it demonstrate that we have lived up to our 
responsibility of protecting privacy rights in the face of these 
new technologies? On the whole, I think the answer to that 
question is yes.  That is why New Democrats will be supporting 
Bill C-6 at this particular reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address one other theme before I close and that is 
ensuring that new technologies benefit all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin discussing this second theme, which is the need 
to ensure that we all have opportunity to benefit from the new 
technologies, by saying a variety of all commentators from all 
sorts of disciplines have commented on the increasingly important 
role that electronic commerce is playing in the lives of everyday 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not often quote the chairman and CEO of Bell Canada, but I 
guess we try everything once in our lives.  Mr. Jean Monty told 
delegates at the Ottawa OECD conference last fall that “What we 
are witnessing today is the birth of a new economy, a new 
economic order that is based on networks and chips.” 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A quick glance at the current electronic commerce situation in 
this country reveals that not all Canadians are being given the 
same opportunity to participate in this new economic order. If we 
assume, and I believe this is a safe assumption, that 30% of 
Canadians have some sort of access to the Internet, and this may 
just be the fact that they have a connected computer at their 
school, we must acknowledge that about three-quarters of 
Canadians remain in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even worse, many Canadians in rural areas have begun to voice 
concerns that they may see exorbitant increases in the cost of 
local phone services in the near future.  Traditionally, phone 
companies were able to subsidize local phone rates in rural areas 
with money taken from long distance funds and urban areas. 
However, with the increased competition in the long distance 
market through deregulation, these subsidies are drying up.  If 
future governments cannot ensure reasonable local phone rates for 
rural Canadians, I wonder then how they can expect the farmer in 
rural Saskatchewan for example to invest in a second phone line 
for Internet purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's responsibility and indeed our 
responsibility to make sure that all Canadians have the necessary 
opportunities to participate in the new economy.  All Canadians 
must be given an opportunity to get on board this new economy. 
Otherwise, we risk creating a future society of electronic haves 
and electronic have nots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of businesses, we have heard small and medium size 
businesses complain that the costs of participating in electronic 
commerce are often simply prohibitive from their point of view. 
Ideally e-commerce would provide an excellent means for small 
businesses to expand their market reach.  Unfortunately, many 
cannot afford the fees charged by banks for setting up the 
necessary security and privacy protection services.  The costs 
are keeping electronic commerce in the big leagues and small 
businesses could be put at a competitive disadvantage as a 
result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that Industry Canada has implemented a community 
storefronts program which helps small businesses become online 
merchants, but we need an expansion of this program if Canada is 
to have a thriving small business presence on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another issue, it is impossible to deny that when electronic 
commerce becomes the way of doing business, thousands of 
Canadians will risk losing their jobs.  Many commentators, 
including American expert Jeremy Rifkin, have warned of the 
adverse effects electronic technology will have on society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a potential danger that as e-commerce takes off, whole 
types of workers could easily be displaced.  Those at risk are a 
diverse group, everyone from stockbrokers to call centre 
operators, to shipping clerks in warehouses.  A society in which 
there is a large pool of labourers with displaced skills and no 
work and a group of information elites is not what New Democrats 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Ottawa OECD conference, Mr. Bill Conner, the general 
secretary of Britain's largest union for retail employees, 
expressed disappointment that “the meeting did not consider in 
any detail e-commerce's potentially devastating effects on 
traditional low and middle income workers”.  He added that the 
euphoria over the potential for exponential growth of e-commerce 
overshadowed concerns about what may be left in its wake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is certainly not a good thing to see.  It demonstrates a 
lack of vision and a lack of ability to see the big picture.  It 
is not working toward our goal of ensuring the majority of 
Canadians have the opportunity to participate in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We New Democrats agree that Canada must be a world leader in 
e-commerce technology.  However, we also believe that true 
leadership requires attention to all of the implications of this 
issue.  That is essentially the difference between our party and 
some of the others that have spoken to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is limited and I have much more I would like to 
say, but I am not going to have a chance.  I will simply say that 
in terms of protecting privacy, as the privacy commissioner has 
indicated, this is a major step forward.  However, in terms of 
those people who will clearly be displaced by the introduction 
and the expansion of e-commerce, this is something that all of us 
must take much more seriously unless we are going to have an 
increasing society of those who have and those who have not.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would simply 
like to say that the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland

opportunities and the challenges of e-commerce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that all members of the House read that very 
thoughtful speech and take to heart many of the points the member 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
by my hon. colleague.  I have known him for a long time and 
respect the work he has done in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use this opportunity to add one further point which I did 
not have time to make in my original presentation and that is 
about the need for proper education and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government has introduced the possibility of 
implementing Internet sites across the country that would be 
serviced by 10,000 young people with Internet skills and 
presumably other computer skills.  That is obviously a major step 
in the right direction, but let us not lose sight of the ongoing 
need to properly educate and train people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say we all agree that one of the impediments to 
the process is the tremendously high tuition fees students face 
at our universities, colleges and technical schools.  The 
economic burden is sometimes prohibitive and a lot of people who 
ought to be improving their educational training skills are 
unable to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take the bold step and acknowledge that if we are 
moving into the knowledge based economy of the 21st century, we 
should ensure that everyone has equal access to our colleges and 
universities. We should consider joining the other 16 OECD 
countries that have tuition free colleges and universities.  The 
cost would be $2.6 billion. We have a contingency fund in this 
year's budget of $3 billion. If we had the will to do that today, 
we have the finances that would ensure that every young person 
and not so young person in the country had access to university 
and college education without paying any tuition fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone imagine a better millennium project for the 
government and parliament than to implement such a program. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on this 
issue, the government's position or rather its insensitivity in 
setting up a system that contradicts or even impacts on the 
whole concept of civil law, is of course well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how the NDP member would have reacted. He 
is obviously arguing in favour of an act like the bill before 
us. Is he at least more sensitive with respect to the complaints 
made to the government? On that, I would like to quote the 
Quebec bar association, which said that the protection of 
personal information is under provincial jurisdiction because it 
concerns property and civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the Quebec system is based on civil law and not 
common law and that important practical problems are to be 
expected. We wonder if the government is the only one to think 
along those lines and we also wonder what the other parties' 
position is on the fact that the Government of Quebec, the 
Quebec bar association, the Chambre des notaires du Quebec, the 
Conseil du patronat du Quebec and Quebec unions have all said 
that it would have been better to recognize Quebec's 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bar association even went further and said that Quebec's 
legislation must apply in areas under federal jurisdiction areas 
to ensure that the law is the same everywhere and that it is 
understood by everybody, particularly as Quebec's legislation 
contains flexible mechanisms for consumers who feel that the 
protection of their personal information is being interfered 
with. There is a simple appeal mechanism, not too complicated, 
that does not involve the traditional courts, where things are 
complicated and intimidating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the NDP member and his party have the same approach as the 
government or would they be a bit more flexible? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am well aware of the 
interventions made by the groups during the hearings into this 
legislation that my hon. friend referred to.  I acknowledge that 
he has a point.  The situation in Quebec is significantly 
different than in most other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the debate yesterday when we were talking about 
the replacement of the Young Offenders Act. The same case was 
made that the Quebec experience in terms of dealing with young 
offenders is much more advanced than in some of the other parts 
of Canada, is much more effective and that we have much to learn.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I acknowledge my friend's point, we now have an 
opportunity as a country to be on the leading edge of 
technological change in terms of electronic commerce.  It will 
benefit business and consumers.  I acknowledge that the 
government has taken some steps in this direction.  We have much 
to learn from the Quebec experience particularly in terms of the 
appeals process my friend has referred to.  I am not an expert in 
this field but perhaps there are other areas we could learn from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is to acknowledge as a country that we are 
poised on the edge of revolutionary change in the way society 
operates as a result of these new technologies.  We are in a 
position to take global leadership on this issue.  If this 
legislation takes us one more step toward that, Canada can lead 
the way in the development of new technologies.  Canada can show 
other countries ways of approaching these issues by implementing 
policies both in terms of privacy and in terms of acknowledging 
and not forgetting the people who will be replaced by technology. 
We have a great contribution to make not only to future 
generations of Canadians but indeed to the world itself. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a comment to clarify what 
I asked the NDP member previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want him to understand one thing clearly. I fully share his 
concern that there must be a legislative framework, that Canada 
wants to take a leadership role and fulfil its own obligations. 
I have no objection to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the problem we have is that, in order to meet a need in 
other parts of Canada, in the nine provinces of Canada, the 
government is significantly changing a balance that was in the 
making because of a very progressive law in Quebec. In fact, the 
problem is not only with this bill. He mentioned the bill on 
young offenders. The same thing applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the New Democratic Party open to the idea that some asymmetry 
could be allowed occasionally, or does it feel that there should 
be a national objective at all cost, and too bad if Quebec 
already has its own legislation? Their point of view is: “We 
Canadians need a law, therefore we will impose it to Quebecers 
too, because we need that law and we want to play a role”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there not room for recognition, in the federal legislation, 
of the Quebec legislation, and should it not simply say that, 
where legislation on the protection of personal information 
already exists, that legislation will be allowed to apply? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This especially true in the case of Quebec—I know it could be 
different in the case of the other provinces—as Quebec has a 
civil law system, while the other provinces have a common law 
system that is different in its approach and philosophy. They 
are not different for nothing. In speeches, Quebec is recognized 
as distinct, among other things, because of its civil law, but 
in reality, this bill does not recognize that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, I would like to know if the member would be 
willing to go as far as to support the bill's recognizing, 
because of civil law, that in the objective of regulating 
electronic commerce and protecting personal information, where 
there is a civil law system, civil law and its legislation 
should apply, because these provisions are even in the Quebec 
civil code, and to give precedence to those provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments could then hold discussions to ensure harmonization 
for businesses involved in interprovincial trade. Does the hon. 
member believe that the federal legislation should apply in 
Quebec and prevent the Quebec government from making 
regulations under civil law? This is what I am asking the hon. 
member. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague raises an 
interesting question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This perhaps is one of the ongoing dilemmas we often face when 
we are trying to introduce a pan-Canadian approach to a problem. 
We recognize that one province abides by a civil code and 
therefore has different approaches from the rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be open to further discussions on this.  The need to 
integrate the systems is critical.  We must recognize and take 
into consideration that a different legal system exists in the 
province of Quebec.  It is something that is certainly open for 
consideration.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the PC Party of Canada I am pleased to speak to Bill C-6, the 
personal information protection and electronic documents act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin I would like to thank many witnesses who took the 
time to make submissions, either in person or in writing, to the 
Standing Committee on Industry.  Their representations were 
extremely helpful with respect to bringing new issues to light. I 
would also like to pay tribute to my colleagues on the industry 
committee for their vigorous discussion of the contents of the 
bill, in particular my colleagues from Mercier, Lévis and 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine.  Regardless of our political 
differences we are all trying to ensure that parliament acts 
appropriately on legislative matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I would like to note the efforts of the member for St. 
Catharines, the former parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
industry, in terms of his credible defence of the government 
position.  I would also like to commend the member for Durham for 
bringing forward an amendment at committee to section 18 of the 
bill which was identical to an amendment I had sponsored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always a rare pleasure to see Liberals deviate from the 
government line.  Perhaps we will see a day when the chair of the 
industry committee shows similar courage, but I digress from the 
subject at hand, Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of Bill C-6 is a positive one.  The bill 
unfortunately has become known as the e-commerce bill, which is a 
bit of a misnomer.  Part 1 of Bill C-6 deals with the protection 
of personal information irrespective of whether it is in an 
e-commerce environment or whatever.  Meanwhile parts 2, 3 and 4 
of Bill C-6 pertain specifically to electronic documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the industry committee spent most of its 
time on part l of the bill at the expense of the other parts.  We 
really did not delve into the technological feasibility of the 
bill's clauses related to electronic signatures.  For a so-called 
e-commerce bill, the committee should really have devoted more 
time to sections pertaining to electronic documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, let us never forget that this is as much a 
personal privacy law as an e-commerce law.  The two distinct 
issues have become intertwined.  It is the growth of e-commerce 
that is driving initiatives such as Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I noted during my remarks on second reading the increase of 
electronic commerce in Canada and throughout the world, more 
appropriately North America, is growing exponentially.  We 
require a law to carefully examine the extent of government 
regulations in this domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union has before its member countries a hard 
hitting directive to require companies to take exhaustive 
measures to protect the privacy of their customers.  Meanwhile 
the United States has chosen the route of self-regulation.  In 
essence, it is letting companies prove their worth in protecting 
the personal information of their customers.  As someone who has 
spent 28 years working for one of Canada's largest high tech 
companies, with many of those years spent in sales and marketing, 
I understand the logic of the U.S. approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector has a strong stake in protecting its 
customers, especially as it relates to the still unrelated realm 
of e-commerce.  If customers do not trust a company with their 
information they will find another company that will. Competition 
is therefore a strong motivator for companies to take meaningful 
measures to protect the information of their customers.  While I 
understand the U.S. approach, and I do believe it is the right 
answer for Canada, I also understand that the U.S. is now 
beginning the process to develop a privacy and e-commerce act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I listened to the industry minister in the House when he 
said that we must do something and that people were saying we 
must do it now.  I am not saying that the privacy and e-commerce 
act is not important, but when I look at privacy, at e-commerce 
and at the consumer or the customer, I think we should have been 
a lot more transparent.  We should have had a comprehensive 
e-commerce privacy act that incorporated all the provinces, more 
importantly, and made sure that we were in step with our biggest 
trading partner, the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party and I believe in the need for legislation to 
protect personal privacy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many flaws in Bill C-6 that I have attempted to 
address at committees, flaws which many witnesses have asked 
parliament to correct, flaws which the government continues to 
leave in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, subclause 18(1) gives the privacy commissioner the 
right to audit a company based on a dispute regarding recommended 
business practices which are listed under schedule 1 of the bill. 
Recommended business practices are just that, recommendations. 
They are not laws and should therefore not be enforced as such. 
The privacy commissioner should be allowed to conduct an audit 
only when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the law 
has been violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Audits are intrusive and place a heavy administrative burden on 
the business operations of Canadian companies.  The audit power 
under Bill C-6 should only be used to cover alleged violations of 
mandatory obligations set out in the bill.  The privacy 
commissioner should not be permitted to micromanage whether a 
company complies with recommended business practices such as what 
type of passwords or encryptions are being used by a company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 18(1) as presently drafted is not necessary since Bill 
C-6 already provides the privacy commissioner with the tools 
needed to ensure the compliance of schedule 1.  For example, 
section 11 allows an individual to file a complaint if he or she 
feels that an organization is contravening the legislation or not 
following a recommended business practice.  Furthermore, section 
12 gives the privacy commissioner the power to investigate all 
complaints including complaints that an organization is not 
following recommended business practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also reiterate the longstanding objections of a variety 
of witnesses to the far-ranging powers granted to the privacy 
commissioner under clauses 12 and 18.  While I do not object to 
extending search and seizure powers to the privacy commissioner 
under Bill C-6, it is in the best interest of all concerned that 
his office be required to obtain prior judicial authorization. 
The lack of any obligation for the privacy commissioner to obtain 
the approval of our courts before exercising certain seizure 
powers is deeply troubling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 12 and 18 of Bill C-6 create a fundamental conflict by 
allowing the privacy commissioner to determine whether to 
exercise search and seizure powers and execute those same powers. 
The authorization should be granted by a neutral third party as 
in the case of criminal investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 already provides the privacy commissioner with broad 
investigative and audit powers.  The commissioner may summon and 
enforce appearance of persons under oath, converse with any 
person, compel the production of documents and receive and accept 
any evidence in the same manner as the superior court.  It is for 
these reasons that additional safeguards are needed in Bill C-6 
as it relates to the privacy commissioner or his delegate 
actually entering the premises of a private organization and 
seizing records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Blair Mackenzie of the Canadian Newspaper Association 
told the industry committee that the provisions within Bill C-6 
are “frightening”.  Other witnesses have alluded to a challenge 
under the charter of rights and freedoms if the privacy 
commissioner acts on clause 12 or 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I am also troubled that the government did not 
bring forward any study or report on the cost impact of Bill C-6. 
From a legal, constitutional and economic standpoint these 
unfettered audit powers constitute a tremendous defect in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly the Liberal majority decided to ignore the fears of free 
speech advocates and the pleas of the private sector and chose to 
defeat my amendment to oblige the privacy commissioner to obtain 
a court order before exercising certain seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are many other problems with the bill which the 
Liberals chose to ignore.  As Bill C-6 is currently drafted there 
is no provision to facilitate the sharing of personal employee 
data between management and the union pursuant to a collective 
bargaining agreement.  Again the Liberal majority defeated my 
amendments before the industry committee to remove these 
potential obstacles to the employee-employer relationship. 
Moreover, I do not feel that the amendment brought forward by the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine to clause 27 adequately 
addresses this problem with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal majority also defeated my amendments to limit the 
costs charged by an organization for those seeking personal 
information to the same level of fees charged by government 
organizations.  Despite the great rhetoric from the Liberals 
regarding personal privacy, Bill C-6 leaves the door open to the 
application of high fees for someone's personal information which 
if not properly regulated could become a barrier to access.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 also raised the spectre of a new round of 
federal-provincial battles.  The governments of Canada's two 
largest provinces, Ontario and Quebec, have spoken loudly and 
strongly in opposition to Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry committee heard from distinguished constitutional 
lawyers including a former deputy minister of justice.  They 
disagreed passionately on whether or not Bill C-6 intrudes on 
provincial jurisdiction.  I found it quite troubling that one of 
these distinguished experts mentioned the possibility of Bill C-6 
as presently drafted becoming another referendum issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals had a chance to suspend clause by clause 
consideration at committee to allow the industry minister to 
negotiate a possible solution to prevent a constitutional 
challenge but the Liberals said no.  They refused to co-operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario ministry of health also expressed its concern that 
health information falls clearly under provincial legislation. It 
was better prepared than the federal government to bring in such 
legislation.  Regrettably the federal Liberals did nothing to 
address these concerns.  They seem more interested in provoking 
fights than finding real solutions.  Anybody who witnessed the 
partisan Liberal attacks against the Ontario ministry of health 
bureaucrat would attest to the poor attitude of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give credit where it is due.  For example, the government 
supported my amendments to subparagraph 7(3)(h)(i) which would 
protect personal information for the shorter of 100 years after 
the record's creation or 20 years after the individual's death. 
Bill C-6 previously would have allowed for the disclosure only 
after the shorter of 110 years after the record's creation or 20 
years after the individual's death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As amended, this provision of the bill is now a more reasonable 
balance between protecting the personal information of the living 
and allowing the use of such information for historical, research 
or literary purposes.  This is still a relatively small aspect of 
Bill C-6.  I thank the government for helping me to get this part 
of the legislation right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank the government for supporting my amendments to 
remove a clause from the original version of Bill C-6 which would 
have allowed the government through order in council to change 
schedule 1 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of these minor improvements the bill remains 
fundamentally flawed.  The PC Party supported Bill C-6 with the 
hope that the government would allow the industry committee to 
correct many of these errors and omissions.  Sadly not enough of 
these flaws were corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill opens the door to legal battles due to the unfettered 
power given to the privacy commissioner.  It unduly restricts the 
legitimate activities of small and medium size businesses.  It 
causes a new restrictive, regulatory framework without a cost 
impact study.  It aggravates the delicate relationship between 
the federal government and the Ontario and Quebec governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It rushes headlong into meeting an European Union directive when 
our number one e-commerce and overall trading partner has adopted 
a position with the directly opposite approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to be constructive and I have tried to improve the 
bill at committee, but by and large the Liberals have refused to 
co-operate.  They have refused to compromise.  Without concrete 
evidence they ask us to trust them that all the problems will 
sort themselves out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the PC Party I oppose Bill C-6 and urge the 
government to respect and act upon the differing points of view 
raised by so many in opposition to the bill as it is currently 
written.

Speaker, it is very important for me to speak on Bill C-6. I 
want to indicate that I will be using the whole 20 minutes that I 
am entitled to.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 is very important to me. As our NDP colleague pointed 
out, the protection of personal information in the private 
sector, what with the technological progress being made, must be 
regulated if we are to protect our fellow citizens from coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the purpose of Bill C-6? First, part 1 of the bill will 
ensure the protection of personal information collected, used 
and disclosed by the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians and Quebecers know that Canada already has a law 
that ensures the protection of personal information collected 
and used by the federal government, as have all of the provinces 
except Prince Edward Island. However, these laws do not affect 
the private sector. Up until now, Quebec was the only province 
to have a law protecting personal information, which applied and 
still applies to the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to talk about this bill and the protection it will 
afford all Canadians, and then I will address the concerns 
raised by my hon. colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will this bill protect personal information? First of all, 
“personal information” means information about an identifiable 
individual. 
This includes but is not limited to the following information: 
race, ethnic origin, colour, age, marital status, religion, 
level of education, medical record, criminal, financial or 
employment information, address, telephone number, numerical 
identification codes such as social insurance number, 
fingerprints, blood type, tissue or other biological samples, 
personal opinions or viewpoints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a broad list, and I did not cover all personal 
information that could identify a person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is designed to protect this type of information by 
requiring organizations to respect the obligations set out in 
the model code for the protection of personal information 
prepared by the Canadian Standards Association, or CSA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code is entrenched in the bill, which I hope will be passed. 
This means that it will have force of law as schedule 1 of the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So where and when will this bill apply? Once it is passed, this 
bill will apply to any organization which collects, uses or 
discloses personal information in the course of commercial 
activities. Commercial activity means any activity that is of a 
commercial nature, which includes selling and buying as well as 
other activities such as barter and exchange transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is an organization? An organization can be a business, an 
association, a partnership, a person or a trade union, for 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are organizations to which this bill will not 
apply, for example organizations that do not conduct commercial 
activities, such as a hospital, a public health clinic or a 
doctor who provides public health services. It will not apply to 
organizations that use personal information for journalistic, 
artistic or literary purposes only, nor will it apply to the use 
of personal information for personal or domestic purposes, such 
as Christmas card lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To facilitate the harmonization of provincial and federal 
legislation on the protection of personal information, the 
coming into force of this bill will take place gradually.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a one-year transition period, the bill will apply to 
private sector fields, and I repeat to private sector fields, 
subjected to federal regulatory control. But what are the 
private sector fields that are subjected to federal regulatory 
control? That is described in the Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some areas are strictly of provincial jurisdiction whereas 
others are strictly of federal jurisdiction. Others yet are 
mixed. Those fields that are subjected to federal regulatory 
control are: telecommunications, radiobroadcasting, banks and 
interprovincial transports, as far as the protection of personal 
information from clients and employees is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will also apply to agencies that share personal 
information outside the provincial or national borders. I will 
say it again because I want to make sure that my colleagues from 
the other side of the House fully understand this notion. This 
bill will also apply to the agencies that share personal 
information outside the provincial or national borders, for 
example credit assessment officers and some insurance companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After tree years, the act will be extended to include all 
personal information collected, used or disclosed within any 
commercial activity, whether it is subject to federal regulatory 
control or not. However, if a province pass a legislation that 
is essentially similar to the federal bill, the agencies or 
activities falling within the provincial act will be exempt from 
the federal act. 
As all of us in the House today know, and as many Canadians and 
Quebecers know, Quebec has had such legislation since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address a few concerns raised by Bloc Quebecois 
members.  First, the fact that, in their view, there is no need 
for this bill in Quebec.  We have been told several times that 
the Barreau du Québec, of which I am a member, the Chambre des 
notaires, and other professional bodies and societies made their 
positions known on Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the Barreau du Québec did not claim that the 
personal information of a non-resident of Quebec that is 
disclosed or exchanged outside the borders of Quebec would be 
protected by the provincial law. 
The provincial law is clear: its purpose is to protect the 
personal information of Quebecers when this information leaves 
Quebec's borders.  The law is silent about the personal 
information of non-residents of Quebec that is collected in 
Quebec and disclosed or transferred outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need exists.  I am speaking to Quebecers throughout the 
province, whether they live in Sept-Îles, Chicoutimi, Ville-Marie, 
Shawville, Bedford, Montreal, Lachine, Saint-Lambert, 
Châteauguay, Charny, Lévis, Charlesbourg or Sillery.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very proud when the Government of Quebec adopted the 
protection of personal information act in 1994.  As a Quebecer, 
I was very proud.  It is a wonderful piece of legislation, but 
it is not perfect.  Furthermore, representatives of professional 
bodies who appeared before the committee said so.  They even 
pointed out safeguards in Bill C-6 that do not appear in Quebec's 
legislation.  I could mention whistle blowing. I will get back 
later to this form of safeguard, which exists in Bill C-6 and not 
in Quebec's legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need in Quebec and not just in the other provinces. 
It was suggested today in the House that the need exists in the 
other provinces because they did not give themselves a law to 
protect personal information within their boundaries and that 
only Quebec did—that there would be no need in Quebec for such 
a federal law, but that need could exist in the other provinces. 
I am sorry, but the need exists from sea to sea in Canada, 
including in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said previously in the House, in the case of a Quebecer 
living in Quebec and dealing with a company outside Quebec, if 
that company collects personal information about that individual 
and discloses that information to some other companies, 
associations or organizations and if that Quebecer tries to 
complain or to sue that company which is not carrying on its 
commercial activities in Quebec but in some other province, he 
will be ruled out of court. The first thing the court will say 
is that the Quebec law does not apply to that company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 is needed to ensure the protection of personal 
information about all the Quebecers and all the people who are 
not necessarily Quebec residents but who were in Quebec at the 
time the information disclosed outside Quebec was collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was suggested that provincial areas of jurisdiction are 
invaded. I invite my colleagues to go attend a course on 
constitutional law. That is a well known subject. Here we have a 
federal system and our constitution has set some areas under 
exclusive federal jurisdiction. Some other areas are under 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction and a third category of areas 
is under joint jurisdiction. When dealing with the commercial 
sector, I regret to have to tell my honourable colleagues in the 
Bloc Quebecois that commerce is an area coming under federal 
jurisdiction also. 
When a company carries on commercial activities outside Quebec, 
that is interprovincial or international, we are getting into an 
area of federal jurisdiction. You can laugh—

again invite our colleagues seated to your left and my right to 
perhaps take constitutional law 101 to find out about federal 
jurisdictions, provincial jurisdictions and joint jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> On the other side of the House they are 
saying that I did not invent the term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The activities of the organizations I just mentioned come under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also say there was no consultation.  I am quite surprised 
to hear it claimed in the House today that there was no 
consultation with the provinces and with those interested in the 
whole issue of protecting privacy and personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very members claiming there was no consultation are saying 
that the Barreau du Québec was consulted along with the Chambre 
des notaires.  There is some confusion in their minds, to say 
the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were consultations between governments, which led to one 
excellent thing: almost all the governments, if not all the 
governments in Canada, recognized the need for legislation to 
protect personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, not all these provincial governments had time enough to 
pass legislation. 
British Columbia is preparing to pass legislation.  But, Bill C-6 
addresses this problem, and as I mentioned at the start of my 
remarks, it is precisely in order to permit the provinces to 
pass legislation that may be implemented progressively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of three years, if some provincial or territorial 
governments have yet to pass legislation to protect personal 
information, the federal law will continue to apply in all areas 
of commercial activity in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the case of governments passing legislation that is 
essentially the same, the organizations covered by provincial 
legislation will be exempted from the application of the federal 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close on this.  About the claim that Quebec is best 
protected, I must tell you that, if—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
anxious to have an exchange of views with the Liberal member on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, she spoke of law 101. Well, we are also going to 
tell her about politics 101, because she said that the 
Government of Quebec had been consulted.  The fact that the 
Quebec bar association or the Conseil du Patronat spoke out in 
committee does not mean that the Government of Quebec was 
consulted.  There is a difference between the Quebec bar 
association, the Conseil du Patronat, the CSN and the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is a different institution, one elected 
democratically by the people and representing Quebecers.  That 
is my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, she says we were wrong when we said that this was a 
provincial jurisdiction.  I have here a letter from the Quebec 
bar association to the Minister of Industry, who is with us 
today, and will read something from the end of its third 
paragraph. She can discuss it with the bar association, since 
she is a member.  The letter reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the protection of personal information is based on 
provincial jurisdiction over property, under the civil code. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would imagine that a nice little discussion between bar 
association colleagues will ensue, since it is the association's 
opinion that this is an area of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter is fairly recent, February 4, 1999.  I imagine they 
took into consideration the British North America Act, which has 
been around for more than a hundred years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing with this letter, because it is most interesting, 
they go on to speak of practical application of the legislation. 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that a considerable number of companies established 
in Quebec will from now on be subject to the federal legislation 
rather than the Quebec legislation, and this is not likely to 
make it any easier for members of the public seeking to find out 
what their rights are in this context of changing legislation. 
As well, Quebec-based businesses will be required to master a new 
system for the protection of personal information, one which 
differs considerably from the one in place in Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the phrase “a considerable number of companies 
established in Quebec will from now on be subject to the federal 
legislation rather than the Quebec legislation”, this means that 
they were previously subject to the Quebec legislation. 
Does the hon. member realize that there was no legal vacuum, as 
she seems to be implying, that it is not like everyone was 
urging the federal government to get involved and set up 
different rules? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to the recommendation made by the Quebec bar, which 
supports that of the access to information commission and which 
provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid any confusion and ensure that Quebecers can continue to 
benefit from a comprehensive personal information protection 
program, we submit that Bill C-54—now Bill C-6—should be amended 
to provide expressly that the federal legislation will not apply 
to businesses governed by the Privacy Act in the private sector. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can already see the hon. member getting ready to say “Yes, but 
what about those for whom that act would not apply?” Her friends 
from the bar added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We go even further. In our opinion, the bill should 
incorporate by reference the 
Quebec legislation, even in areas of federal jurisdiction, to 
avoid confusion, overlap and duplication in the legislation 
applied in Quebec”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes from the Quebec bar, which represents lawyers. These 
are experts who looked at this legislation and told us that it 
will create chaos and make things extremely complicated. To 
avoid that, they propose a simple solution. But this government 
will never recognize the primacy of the Quebec law, even if it 
concerns the civil code, which makes us so distinct in the eyes 
of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government defines Quebec's distinctive 
character, it usually points to two or three elements. The 
government includes as few elements as possible, but it usually 
mentions the civil code. Yet, with this legislation, it is not 
even prepared to recognize the civil code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, what does the member have to say to the Barreau?  Not to us 
on this side, to the members across the way to her right and to 
your left, Mr. Speaker. What does she have to say to the Barreau 
du Québec, which is suggesting this should be the  solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, before concluding, I would like to come back to one point. 
She says:  “Yes, but we will not be able to regulate 
out-of-province companies doing business in Quebec”.  If that 
logic applied, how is the Government of Canada going to be able 
to regulate an American company doing business in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using her logic, it could not, because she is saying that 
Quebec's legislation does not apply to a company holding 
information obtained in Quebec, if the company is based outside 
Quebec. 
So what is she going to do about an American company that 
obtains information here and holds it in the United States?  If 
the Government of Canada can do it, why would Quebec not be able 
to do it for Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something a bit illogical about what she is saying and 
I would like her to explain to me why she thinks Quebec cannot 
fully legislate this situation when, if this were true, the same 
logic would apply to Canada, which would be able to legislate in 
respect of American companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to explain this and to respond to the brief 
from the Barreau that I have just cited and which is very 
specific.  If she wishes, I can give her a copy of the document.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
remarks. The federal bill will be completing the protection 
afforded consumers in Quebec by the legislation of that 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both laws deal with different activities, and the federal 
legislation will be filling the gaps in the protection given by 
the Quebec law. In Quebec, the federal legislation will target 
situations where the activities of an organization are not 
regulated by the Commission d'accès à l'information. I can think 
for example of companies under federal jurisdiction, and of the 
problems Quebecers can encounter in their dealings with 
companies outside their province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 settles problems that cannot be handled through 
provincial laws, even when these laws have been prepared with 
great care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When data are transferred across the borders of 13 provinces or 
territories, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada is in a better 
position to investigate and settle cross border problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second example would be the case of a company headquartered in 
Alberta collecting information on Quebec consumers. Since 
Alberta and Quebec are not bound by each other's legislation, 
there is a need for federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec businesses that transfer personal information within 
Quebec and between provinces will have no problem complying with 
both laws. When the Barreau du Quebec, of which I am a member, 
or the hon. member opposite submit that this will cause 
confusion, they are saying in fact that our Quebec businesses 
are not capable of coping with situations where two laws are 
applicable. They are already familiar with that kind of 
situations. They are obeying industrial safety legislation as 
well as legislation governing their commercial activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec businesses have already had to organise their commercial 
activities in compliance with different laws, federal as well as 
provincial. It is a shame to claim that our businesses are not 
capable of doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 and Quebec Law-68 may be drafted differently but their 
intent and impact are rather similar. Both pieces of legislation 
require businesses to obtain the consent of a person before 
collecting, using or disclosing his or her personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both pieces of legislation give people access to their personal 
information that is maintained by private sector organisations. 
Both provide for monitoring by a privacy commissioner and allow 
redress mechanisms for people whose rights are affected. Above 
all, both provide for rights and obligations which are basically 
similar, since both have the same starting point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is that starting point? It all started with the guidelines 
established by the OCDE in 1980. 
Sure, there are differences, but Canada can manage them. Canada 
may be the only country in the whole world which provides in its 
charter of rights and freedoms that it shall promote its 
diversity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-6, an act aimed at 
promoting electronic commerce at the expense of privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of the week, I have noticed that the Liberal 
government opposite, with Bill C-6 and Bill C-3, an act in respect 
of criminal justice for young persons, has been speaking from 
both sides of its mouth. The government tells Quebec and the 
rest of Canada: “We are going to talk with the provinces, we 
will come to an agreement before introducing new bills.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really disillusioned with this government's double talk. I 
believe Quebecers and Canadians must realize that this 
government ignores everything that moves both in Quebec and the 
rest of Canada. 
This is the general image we have had of this government for the 
two years we have been sitting in the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not tell me it is because I am a sovereignist, an 
independentist or a separatist that I talk this way. I am 
defending the interests of a francophone riding in Quebec, the 
riding of Jonquière. When I travel through my riding, my 
constituents tell me this about the current government: “What is 
wrong with them, why do they want to re-invent the wheel, redo 
what has already been done, and why do they not take the best in 
other laws to improve the justice system and health care system 
in Canada?” No, what they want is to re-invent the wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too much is too much, or not enough is not enough, but I think 
the government has time to waste, because it has no vision for 
the next millennium that is fast approaching. I think the 
government doe not know hoe to go forward. It wants to relive 
the past, to return to the time where it was not in power, to 
give itself good conscience. We have a concrete example of that 
with this Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to ask the Minister of Industry if he is 
familiar with the Quebec privacy act that was passed in 1994. I 
would have liked to know if he is aware of the Quebec 
legislation on the protection of personal information in the 
private sector, which is unique in North America. Quebec is the 
only state in North America that has a legislation to protect 
personal information in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister noticed that we have a legislation in 
Quebec. Of course, nothing is perfect, and I think we can 
rewrite a legislation to improve it, because time goes by and 
society is evolving. He could have looked at this legislation 
and say: “Quebec did this, why not do the same for the other 
provinces of Canada, and also cover other areas that the Quebec 
legislation does not cover?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Minister of Industry do? He told us he had 
consulted with the provinces. I could give you some evidence 
that the Minister of Industry did not consult with the 
provinces, because on September 21, 1998, the federal minister 
sent a legislation proposal to his provincial counterparts. He 
asked for their comments. On October 1, 1998, he said: “I do not 
need the views of my counterparts, I will act unilaterally, I 
will table a bill in the House”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 30, the 12 provincial and territorial justice 
ministers unanimously called—I am not sure if the word 
“unanimously” has the same meaning in English as in French, but 
this word means that everyone was in agreement—on the federal 
Minister of Industry to withdraw Bill C-54, because it was “a 
major intrusion into provincial and territorial areas of 
jurisdiction”. This can be found in a press release that 
followed that federal-provincial-territorial meeting of the 
justice ministers, held on October 30, 1998, in Regina, 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the facts. The government brags about consulting the 
provinces. 
Is this the meaning they give to the word “consultation”? I am 
curious as to what dictionary they might be using. To consult 
people is to sit down with them, to submit your projects and to 
ask them for their opinion. That is what consulting is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you hear about some legislation somewhere that is protecting 
privacy and working just fine, you sit down, negotiate and take 
the best of this legislation to try and make a society, a 
country like Canada a leader in that field to ensure the best 
protection for its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, my hon. colleague from Témiscamingue made an 
eloquent speech in which he gave a clear explanation of privacy. 
Personally, I would not like for someone, anyone, to scrutinize 
my every move and say: “Maybe she should have done this instead 
of that. We should investigate the matter.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not know if you would like that, but I 
certainly would not. I rise up against this tactic that the 
government of Canada wants to use against me and my fellow 
citizens who live in my riding of Jonquière and in Quebec. 
Enough is enough! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Minister of Industry understand? The Minister of 
Industry created a whole constitutional litigation that could 
have been avoided had he agreed to work in co-operation with its 
counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-6 is implemented in Quebec, the rights of Quebecers 
regarding personal information protection will suffer 
significant setbacks regarding consent and remedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine<B> </B>says she is a legal 
expert. There are several legal experts in my family. 
We see more and more shortfalls in the legislation passed in the 
House of Commons. I think there are many shortfalls in Bill C-6. 
We must not let these legal experts implement legislation as 
they like. In all conscience, we must ensure that these bills 
help our fellow citizens, not the legal experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a setback regarding the collection of information 
from a third party. Moreover, the Bill will be confusing for 
companies and individuals in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implementation of Bill C-6 in Quebec will require the setting 
up of two systems for the protection of personal information and 
it will be confusing for companies and individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is October 22. 
I do not know if the Minister is aware of the fact that the Bill 
he introduced in this House is a source of confusion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is confusion there is a need for interpretation. I 
call upon the minister of Industry to exclude Quebec from his 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in Quebec—and I believe that some people in the House will 
laugh—are pioneers in privacy protection. The Quebec charter of 
rights and freedoms allowed our legislators to be at the 
forefront of privacy protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from me the idea of pretending that we are perfect, but I 
can say that we have always been listening to our fellow 
citizens to be able to take care of their wellbeing and to 
answer their needs through our charter of rights and freedoms. 
We are constantly listening to people to improve our 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 does not improve on Quebec legislation, it will diminish 
it. We have a civil code in Quebec. Contrary to Ontario and the 
other provinces of Canada, we are not in a system of Common Law. 
We reviewed our civil code three years ago because we thought 
that it needed to be improved and adapted for the next century. 
We did it and the privacy protection act we passed is based on 
our civil code. If the minister does not know that code, I would 
recommend him to read it because it is a little gem as far as 
the protection of civil rights of Quebecers is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not repeat everything that was said by my colleagues, the 
member for Témiscamingue and the member for Mercier, but through 
you, Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the Minister of Industry—it is 
never too late to recognize one's mistake—to change his mind 
before it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Minister of Industry to wait, to meet both Quebec 
ministers as they requested and allow them to explain their 
position. This would make sure that the Liberal government in 
Canada is listening to the people and does not pass laws that 
duplicate or undo what has been done in the provinces. I am 
waiting for an answer from the Minister of Industry and I am 
putting a lot of energy into this to make sure that my request 
gets to him through you, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 2.15 p.m., pursuant to order made 
earlier this day, the question is deemed to have been put and a 
recorded division deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday, 
October 26, 1999, at the expiry of the time provided for
