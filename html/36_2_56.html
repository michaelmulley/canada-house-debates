</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer Your Honour to Standing Order 47 which states 
clearly that points of order should be raised in this instance 
following the daily routine of business.  I know of no reasons 
which would allow a member to rise on a point of order and 
pre-empt the daily routine of business when the standing orders 
clearly state that points of order are to be raised at the 
conclusion of routine proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite Your Honour to look at this now and determine the 
question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, I am surprised by what the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He himself rises on a point of order to say that we cannot rise 
on a point of order at this point in the proceedings. There is 
something of a paradox in what he is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, based on my understanding of the rules, members are 
authorized to rise on a point of order at any time during the 
proceedings, except during oral question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you will enlighten me on this issue, but I 
believe that those who have sat in the Chair since December have 
authorized Bloc Quebecois members, and any other member 
interested, to rise on such points of order before routine 
proceedings. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The point of order 
from the parliamentary secretary is indeed an interesting point. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, it is true that, for some time now, the Chair 
has entertained requests for unanimous consent for the tabling 
of such documents. For this morning, we will therefore carry on 
in the same fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, you

request for the tabling of a document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to get the unanimous consent of all the members of this 
House, primarily Liberal members, to properly enlighten them on 
Bill C-20, which seeks to infringe upon the fundamental rights of 
the people of Quebec.

Intergovernmental Affairs...and soundly criticized the bill on 
referendum conditions, becoming the first well-known federalist 
to openly express his dissent. 
In particular, Mr. Ryan said that by judging the clarity of any 
referendum question, parliament and the federal government “were 
directly interfering with the wording of the question”, an 
attitude that the former politician described as “not real 
federalism, but rather as a system whereby a government was 
being put under trusteeship”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Twice already, for my colleague from Laurentides as for my 
colleague from Châteauguay, probably because we were stunned by 
the forceful arguments they were making, we did not hear any 
noes. We did see some heads shake, but is it the same for the 
Chair to see heads shake as to hear an audible no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Absolutely not. I clearly 
heard government members say no. Perhaps I should ask them to 
speak louder. They do not all have voices as strong as that of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, to allow the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to come out of his 
constitutional obsession and see that, outside Parliament Hill, 
there are realities our citizens are asking us to confront, I 
ask for the unanimous consent to table a document that will 
greatly inspire him about the real problems. It is the most 
recent book of Michel Chartrand and Michel Bernard on the 
concept of guaranteed minimum wage for all citizens.

carefully to what I have to say and hopefully grant my request.

here an article from the Canadian Press in which we read that 
“Mr. Ryan felt that, by making a decision on the clarity of a 
referendum question, the federal government would, to say the 
least, interfere directly with the drafting of the question. He 
added that this attitude was not real federalism but a 
trusteeship system. Such a system, he said, if not contrary to 
the federal government's responsibility should—”

</I></B></P><P align=left>It says that Joseph Facal, the minister for Canadian 
intergovernmental affairs, will testify Thursday morning before

testifying at this very moment before the legislative committee—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. We 
heard the leader of the government in the House yelling from his 
seat that the Chair did not need to know the details of 
everything we want to table with the unanimous consent of the 
House. Let me refer him to the book of Montpetit and Marleau, on 
page 501: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanics of requesting and granting unanimous consent must 
be carefully observed. A Member wishing to waive the usual 
notice requirement before moving a substantive motion would ask 
the unanimous consent of the House “for the following motion”, 
which is then read <I>in extenso</I>. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should be authorized by the Chair to read out what he 
has to say before asking for unanimous consent. This is what is 
said on page 501 of Montpetit and Marleau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I do not see this type of 
intervention as a motion. I repeat that I would like to hear the 
title of the articles, the author and then the request for 
unanimous consent.

Chair had a gift as far as guessing is concerned, but there is a 
limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, you cannot consider right away what will be asked as 
a substantive motion, but you must at least listen to what the 
hon. member has to say in order to be able to establish whether 
or not it is a substantive motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I think that if an hon. 
member wants to introduce a motion, it would be a good thing if 
he said so right away. Then, I would be prepared to listen 
through to the end.

rise today to speak to Bill C-13, an act to establish the 
Canadian institutes of health research.  While I am in favour of 
the bill overall, I will take this opportunity to speak on a few 
aspects of it and the process that has been involved to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is true that the objectives of the bill should be 
attainable—and I have personally received numerous letters and 
e-mails from the medical and research community to support 
it—there are several aspects of the bill that I feel could have 
been better and stronger.  I mention this because all these 
things were brought before the Standing Committee on Health, and 
in the usual Liberal manner, they were given little true 
consideration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have just witnessed in the House is that when the 
government decides that it does not want to hear any more 
legitimate democratic debate on an issue, it simply decides that 
we have all had enough time and it brings in either time 
allocation or closure, to the shame of the government, to cut off 
legitimate debate.  It is all part of the frustration that 
Canadians in general and opposition members in particular feel in 
giving any kind of real input into the decision making process of 
the House, especially when the opposition represents some 62% of 
the population of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same kind of thing that went on in the making of 
this bill and in the way in which it was brought through 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that some variations of these proposals were 
recognized and given support by some members of the other 
opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-13 is to excel, according to 
internationally accepted standards of scientific excellence, in 
the creation of new knowledge and its translation into improved 
health for Canadians.  It is to provide more effective health 
services and products of a strengthened Canadian health care 
system.  Finally, it is to replace the Medical Research Council 
of Canada to provide a more direct and systematic approach to 
research in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all noble and just objectives and ones with which I 
agree.  Who would not agree with the provision of better health 
care, improved research capabilities, more effective health care 
services and a strengthened health care system?  All of us in the 
House would agree with those objectives today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems lies in how we get there.  How do we achieve 
these goals?  The Liberals have clearly shown us how not to 
achieve them.  They have shown us how to disrupt and break up the 
Canadian health care system.  Because of the current Liberal 
government's inaction and reduced funding for our health care 
system it has, in effect, already created a multi-tiered system 
of service in the country.  It is shameful.  Canadians know it 
and they now say that health care is their number one concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process that the Standing Committee on Health worked through 
for this bill was no different from the process used by most 
other committees of the House of Commons.  The subcommittee 
reviews what topics and subjects are pertinent.  We have our 
discussion.  We decide what we believe are the most important 
things to discuss.  However, we find out then that the health 
minister has already written his letter to tell us what to do and 
we simply have to go along with the government majority, which is 
completely different from the overwhelming desire of Canadians in 
terms of the issue at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never mind that these issues greatly affect Canadians.  The 
Liberal majority on the committee simply bends the knee and 
follows the minister's wishes.  Then, of course, the committee 
goes through the charade of calling witnesses, reviewing 
pertinent research, amply supplied by the Library of Parliament, 
and debating parts of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do this for the benefit of those who are watching on 
television and wondering how we get to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that the committee goes through its paces, whether to 
interview witnesses, amend the bill or report recommendations to 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, most committees again favour the party line and 
do not truly listen to the recommendations of opposition members 
of parliament.  Regardless of their validity, it is rare that 
committee members will adopt amendments put forward by anyone 
other than a government member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such was the case with Bill C-13.  Although most members around 
the table agreed in principle with the bill, numerous amendments 
were put forward to legitimately improve it.  Unfortunately, the 
vast majority of these were turned down at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Health is not unique in these aspects. 
We have seen the same scenario over and over again.  We have 
watched as the government did not even listen or pretend to 
listen to the people of British Columbia over the debate on the 
Nisga'a treaty.  It was not until the Reform Party denied the 
finance committee the opportunity to travel in its prebudget 
deliberations that the go-ahead was finally given for the 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development 
to do likewise and meet with the people of B.C. 
Surely it is our job as members of parliament to hear what the 
people have to say.  Even then, the committee blatantly stacked 
the witness list.  Imagine going to the city of Prince George on 
an issue like this and not hearing from anyone who lives there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a saying:  not only must justice be done; justice must 
appear to be done.  The appearance of justice is not apparent in 
the many dealings that go on in this Chamber.  I will refer to 
yet another example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently have Bill C-2, the elections bill, before the 
House.  As my colleagues and I, and in particular the hon. member 
for North Vancouver, spoke this week and in the past about the 
inadequacies of the draft legislation contained within Bill C-2, 
I was reminded of how many times the government has missed 
opportunities to improve something.  It has failed to grab hold 
of those opportunities.  Bill C-2 could be a vastly improved bill 
if the government chose to listen and act on the recommendations 
put forward by opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government fails to recognize that each member represents 
thousands of people.  When the Prime Minister dictates to 
government members how to vote and what actions to accept and not 
accept, the wishes of millions of people are blatantly ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To paraphrase, the people of Canada must not only see that we 
are a democracy, they must see that we are a democracy enacted 
and fulfilled.  On this issue I believe that the government has 
failed the people of Canada miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 could indeed have had many improvements made to it. 
The majority of the amendments before us are worthy of true 
debate and consideration and I hope that members of the House 
will give them due deliberation.  Among these I would include the 
following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the recognition of provincial jurisdiction in the role 
of the provision of health care.  In far too many instances the 
government has attempted to manipulate or manage a program or 
service that has not any legal or constitutional jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the administrative bureaucracy should be limited 
to a maximum of 5% of the total budget and use definitions which 
are normally applied to departments by the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be certain that the main thrust of this bill ensures 
that support for health research is based upon scientific merit. 
Funding should be based upon the validity of the project, not on 
the basis of employment equity groups or political connections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be certain that research funding methods are 
accurate and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be sure that the clause dealing with ethical issues in 
this bill is strengthened.  Those issues include such topics as 
biomedical research, reproductive technology, gene therapy and 
other ethical issues of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that there will be a subcommittee for the CIHR 
which can act as an ombudsman for complaints by researchers and 
private sector partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that there are problems with this bill.  In the main, 
however, I support the bill.  I believe that we need to 
strengthen research in the medical community in Canada.  Canada 
has been a world leader in many areas of medical research, but it 
needs to take its place in other areas.  We need to do what has 
been suggested through this bill to put together both the 
framework and the financial resources to bring together medical 
researchers to work on specific areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a step in the right direction.  It will indeed 
divert the flow of good medical brains that are going to the U.S. 
The Prime Minister has been quoted as saying that he does not 
think there is any serious problem in terms of brain drain.  Let 
me say that in the medical profession it is a real problem.  I am 
glad to see that there are some people in the government who have 
the intestinal fortitude to recognize that brain drain and to do 
something about it in a bill such as this, which will create the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research.  Because of that I will 
be supporting this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
although we worked very hard in committee and I was diligent in 
my efforts there to improve Bill C-13, I cannot resist 
mentioning as an aside that we are sad today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people watching us must realize that once again the Liberal 
government has been barbaric with the opposition by imposing 
time allocation in a most inconsiderate and cavalier manner. 
That said, I would like to speak to Bill C-13.  I would add, 
incidentally, that the doormat Liberal members from Quebec have 
once again not risen to defend the interests of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 concerns an important issue, that is, the efforts we 
have to make in research and especially in the biomedical 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting, because in the early 1990s, the Medical 
Research Council of Canada asked parliamentarians to do, in the 
biomedical research sector, what had been done in the 
communications sector in the 1960s, that is make it a leading 
edge sector. 
We can understand that, historically, Canada has invested in the 
communications sector because this is obviously a big country, 
and necessitates several communications networks working 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three problems with Bill C-13, and they are the focus 
of our amendments.  We do not oppose it.  I want to be very very 
clear and I am all the happier to be clear, with the member for 
Jonquière by my side here. She has always been interested in 
such questions because of what goes on in the riding she 
represents here in the House and will have the opportunity to 
introduce later on today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that we must invest massively in biomedical research. 
We are pleased to see that, next year, $485 million will be 
allocated for biomedical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we cannot understand why the provinces were not more 
closely involved in the drafting of the bill. Sure, the interim 
governing council included people from Quebec. I am thinking of 
Mr. Bureau, from the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec 
and one of Quebec's top experts in the field. There was also Dr. 
Renaud, a sociologist by profession and chair of the Humanities 
Research Council of Canada. I hope members from all sides of the 
House will give them a good hand of applause, because these 
people were extremely dedicated in establishing the interim 
governing council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that the bill, in its present form, not only 
promotes research in the biomedical sector, but is also 
intrusive. The current wording of the bill alludes at least 15 
times, in the 52 clauses, to health research or to health 
related issues. This creates an opportunity for the federal 
government to get involved which, unfortunately, is of concern 
to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its last budget, the Quebec government earmarked $406 million 
over a two year period. This gives an idea of the scope of the 
projects. 
The Quebec government, which is setting up a science and 
technology department, is allocating $406 million over two 
years, while the federal government will earmark $500 million a 
year for all ten provinces. This is to say that Quebec is making 
considerable structuring efforts to provide a consistent 
framework, a concerted action plan for its research initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have been a good idea—and this is exactly what the 
amendments before us today are all about and I hope that 
government members will vote in favour—for the provinces, Quebec 
for example, which historically has received 33% of Canada's 
Medical Research Council grants and has trained generations of 
top-notch biomedical researchers, to be able to provide lists to 
guide the federal government in its recommendations so that the 
governing council is truly representative of the people that 
would have been selected by the provinces?  This is what the 
amendments before us have in mind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in close touch with the scientific community, and we 
know that it is not easy to be a researcher.  It takes 
perseverance; generations of equipment must be replaced every 5, 
6 or 7 years.  We are not opposed to $500 million being 
invested, particularly in the biomedical research sector, but 
why stipulate in the bill that there will be a single institute? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked this question again and again. 
If they want to establish 15 research institutes, which they 
claim will operate autonomously, why word the bill as if there 
were a single research institute, with a single governing 
council, a single series of appointments by the governor in 
council, as well as equipment and research to order that will 
become the property of the Crown? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have been desirable, as my colleague from Jonquière 
and I indicated to the committee, most assiduously and in a most 
articulate manner, for us to have a truly decentralized bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government was not willing to bow to the 
arguments of the opposition, and that is why today we are here 
with some thirty-plus amendments. 
I would ask the parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, known in certain circles as “the man 
with the millions” and who is feigning ignorance, to lend an ear 
to our arguments and our amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say again: this is a bill that means a lot to us.  There is 
not a single democrat in this House today whose heart is not 
heavy.  There is not a single democrat in this House today whose 
thoughts are not for the future, and who does not say “shame on 
you” to this government, which is making a travesty of democracy 
and showing its contempt for the opposition and its lack of 
respect for Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the government is acting in such a cavalier manner, 
because we cannot count on the members of this parliament who 
sit at the Liberal caucus table to defend the referendum act, 
and because we cannot count on them to defend the extraordinary 
vitality of the democracy of the National Assembly and its right 
to decide on the matter, I have no other choice but to move the 
following, pursuant to Standing Order 60:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to make a few 
comments on Bill C-13, an act to establish the Canadian 
Institutes of Health Research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to thank the witnesses who appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Health to provide their input and give 
their strong support to this bill. This was very much 
appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention the work done by opposition members who, 
in general, were very regular in attending committee meetings. 
They also made suggestions. Finally, I thank members of my own 
party, who also worked very hard on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of amendments are before us and we are currently 
debating the first group of these amendments. I should point out 
that, for us, investing in health research is the best possible 
preparation to ensure adequate health services in the years to 
come and to continue to provide such services to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member. I ask all members to have the courtesy of following 
the debate with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Madam Speaker, health services, health 
care and quality research into health, are all linked in our 
opinion and will mean improved health care services for 
Canadians in general.  Each poll tells us that health is the 
number one priority in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We decided, by transforming the existing health research 
structure into the institutes, to invest and to double our 
investments in the coming years in health and health research, 
and I think that the people of Canada are generally pleased with 
this decision. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of health research institutes has been thought to 
address key issues of importance to the health of Canadians.  It 
will allow greater focus for health research than existed with 
the previous granting council model. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the research institutes model, which we will call 
virtual institutes, research will be better integrated across 
the entire country. The research done here in a number of fields 
will also be in daily contact with the best of what is being 
done internationally. This is the sense of the way we want to 
integrate these new institutes. I think the people of Canada 
will surely benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we do not want these research institutes to be 
limited to theoretical research only ending up as impressive 
reports for a few dozen specialists.  We want this research to 
mean specific benefits for the people, specific applications. 
It will not just be a matter of information circulating among 
highly specialized individuals, but measures, drugs and improved 
services arising from this research for the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our style on this side of the House.  Instead of talking 
we are acting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also ensures collaboration with provincial governments. 
Our second group of amendments includes clarifications that 
address the loud— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members: </B>Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> —but not necessarily lofty—concerns 
expressed by a number of members of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order.  I am 
afraid that the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies is misleading 
the House when he says that he has the support of provincial 
governments.  I am prepared to table a letter to show that the 
government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> This is not a point of 
order.  It is part of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Madam Speaker, as the House is well aware, 
Bill C-13 was based on the recommendations of an interim 
governing council composed of 34 well-respected Canadians 
representing all fields of health research in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This interim council includes people from provincial governments, 
universities, hospitals, the academic community and charitable 
organizations in the health and private sectors, as well as 
researchers from all fields of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes work with organizations that focus on the three 
areas of health, health care and health research.  For us, this 
is all interconnected, since research is what makes quality care 
and services possible.  In general, the Canadian public and the 
research community have been receptive to this message and given 
it their strong support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research also provides Canada with an important opportunity to 
contribute to improving people's health, not only in Canada but 
internationally as well.  That is one of our responsibilities as 
an industrialized and developed country.  Canadian researchers 
in fact—and this is something to be stated with pride—are often at 
the leading edge of their specialties and their contributions 
are recognized worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be obvious to everyone that decision makers in the 
political arena need to have research data to call upon.  Those 
of us who have to make decisions, who are in politics with the 
people in the various departments backing us up, need to be 
informed of the top research data when the time comes to make 
decisions on policy, regulations, or mechanisms for managing the 
programs for which we are responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public access to research material and reports on public health 
related issues is also governed by the Privacy Act and the 
Access to Information Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are acts to protect people's rights while guaranteeing 
public access when appropriate.  Some of the amendments are, 
therefore, prompted by the bill itself, or by other bills 
ensuring the public of access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for conflict of interest issues, which are addressed by some 
of the proposed amendments, and matters of ethics, the health 
committee's report contained a recommendation to the government 
that application of the principles of ethics be enhanced as far 
as the health research institutes are concerned. 
Our committee recommended “that the Governing Council develop 
and implement appropriate conflict of interest guidelines for 
the agency, including the Institutes of Health Research”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are waiting for the government's response to this 
recommendation. This recommendation shows that our committee is 
concerned by this issue and has brought it to the government's 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is not necessary to state in the act that the 
governing council has the authority to develop a conflict of 
interest code. The federal government has already taken measures 
to ensure that organizations have a conflict of interest code 
that meets their specific needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's ethics counsellor will work with the 
president of the institutes to develop a code that meets the 
specific needs of the new organization. As part of this process, 
they will determine whether it is necessary to develop 
additional conflict of interest policies for all members, 
employees and volunteers of the institutes' committees and 
advisory boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood that these institutes are headed by a 
president. There is also a governing council and there are 
advisory boards. When developing a code of ethics on conflict of 
interests for the institute, it will be necessary to take into 
account the various levels within the organization and the 
positions held by those concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the concerns expressed earlier by opposition parties, 
including the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois, concern 
motions in both Group No. 1 and Group No. 2. Later on, when we 
discuss Group No. 2, we will have the opportunity to provide 
answers to these concerns. Some of these answers are in the form 
of amendments proposed by the government to meet these concerns 
expressed by the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee did a good job and its Liberal majority took good 
note of the most important suggestions made by the members of 
the opposition parties.

<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise with pleasure today to talk about Bill C-13, an 
act to establish the Canadian institutes of health research and 
to repeal the Medical Research Council Act.  I agree with the 
objective of the bill and the new Canadian institutes of health 
research. Before I speak to the bill which I am pleased to 
support, I want to take a moment to speak about the decorum in 
the House and what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came in here earlier this morning a member from the Bloc 
was speaking about the bill.  The member said it was a very 
important bill for Canada.  I listened to the hon. member's 
speech.  I would hope that Bloc members would show the same 
respect for all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the Bloc members are upset about closure being 
brought in at the committee stage on the clarity bill but that 
does not give them the right to derail the entire House. It is 
okay to take a stand on a bill and I acknowledge we did it on the 
Nisga'a bill.  However it does not mean that they should try to 
derail the whole House and cause problems on every single bill 
over their one issue. I appeal to the Bloc members to give all 
members of the House including those on the government side the 
respect to be heard on this bill.  It was very important to say 
that at the outset.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this bill so important?  At first glance one wonders 
whether it will create another billion dollar boondoggle.  On 
really looking at the bill I agree with the concept of what it is 
trying to do.  It is putting money back into medical research. It 
is very important that we make this investment.  It will also 
help stem part of the brain drain by making this investment in 
our scientific community and will put the resources into medical 
research. The intent is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian institutes of health research appear to have a 
precise game plan with the sole intention of promoting research. 
There are couple of qualifications.  First, there is little time 
available to consult the scientific community for input on 
research projects that are to be undertaken.  It is important to 
make sure that the scientific community is targeted.  Second, I 
have some concerns that the president of the Canadian institutes 
of health research may bypass recommendations of the governing 
council and simply appoint people to the advisory councils based 
on individual choice rather than their qualifications. I say that 
because of what we have seen historically in that appointments 
become much more political. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one reads the bill it does appear that the appointments 
will be independent and made at arm's length from the federal 
government.  I applaud that and hope that will be carried out. Of 
course, we will not know until the bill is passed and we see the 
appointments but that issue seems to be addressed.  Again, I 
point these concerns out because it is very important that the 
institutes operate independent of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I could say that was the case at HRDC.  This all ties 
together.  It is government grants going out as subsidies. Again, 
I think it has to happen in scientific research.  That is an 
important role the government must play and that is why I support 
that.  But we must make sure that the money gets to where it is 
supposed to be and is done in a non-partisan way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we have seen the billion dollar boondoggle at 
HRDC. Not only that, it is the whole culture that flows through 
all levels of many government departments. I personally witnessed 
it with the TAGS program and the fisheries in Atlantic Canada. 
The federal government paid $2.8 billion for fishermen to stay at 
home and wait for the fish to come back. The government did not 
achieve any of the desired goals.  We have seen it in Indian 
affairs, CIDA, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and the 
list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out these concerns because if this is to work and we 
make this investment in our scientific community, we have to make 
sure it is done in a non-partisan way.  The government has 
addressed that in the bill.  That is why I intend to support it 
but it is important that we follow up and make sure that it 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All grant money should be administered that way.  The new 
Canadian institutes of health research will replace the Medical 
Research Council which until now has not been accountable. It has 
not worked and that is why there must be a change. It is very 
important that the money is fully accounted for and transparent. 
This is the first step in making that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in the past and on the front page of every paper 
for a month concerning HRDC, that it has not been accounted for. 
Most important it has not been transparent. Canadians are 
wondering where their tax dollars are going. I hear over and over 
again from people in my riding and in the medical community that 
it is very important that we make investments in research.  That 
is an appropriate goal for government but it has to be 
transparent.  It has to ensure that the public has access to 
where the money is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only one aspect.  I wanted to raise it because I believe 
this can play an important role in curbing the problem of the 
brain drain.  I have talked about this before in the House. 
This issue is very dear to me.  Some of our best and our 
brightest in particular in the areas of health, engineering and 
the high tech sector are going south.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that we need that private sector and 
government partnership.  The bill addresses that.  It brings in 
the private sector for that partnership aspect.  It is a very 
important component.  I encourage the government to look at that 
in all ministries and departments. If we are going to help stem 
the brain drain, I absolutely fundamentally believe we need to 
lower taxes, but we also have to allow the private sector to 
create the jobs.  It is not a role government can play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make investments in the scientific community. 
However, in other areas such as industry, and areas of grants 
where there is no transparency and accountability, that is not 
working.  The private sector has a very important role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for the bill.  I support it.  It is 
very important.  We are putting money into scientific research. 
It appears the government has tried to keep it at arm's length 
and I applaud that.  It appears that 95% of the resources will go 
to front line research and that only 5% will be used for 
administration.  I applaud the government. It is an encouraging 
first step.  It will help reduce the brain drain.  Hopefully when 
the bill passes, this will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can apply this whole concept to other ministries such as 
HRDC.  We need to invest in our people but it cannot be a 
political fund which is used to buy votes.  That culture has 
grown and grown and grown.  We need to change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting this very important bill. I look forward to 
seeing the results and to our scientific community benefiting 
from these so very important research dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 we exported over $360.6 billion worth of goods; 11.9% 
more than in 1998.  Much of this growth can be attributed to 
increased domestic capacity in the automotive industry and high 
demand for Canadian built models in the United States.  Our 
television and telecommunications equipment industry also 
contributed significantly.

additional assistance to agriculture.

riding of Rosemont.  Relevant community partners were consulted, 
including the province and the local MP.  The company discussed 
with the Montreal centreville HRDC office its difficulty in 
finding a suitable location in Rosemont.  The local office agreed 
to fund the project as long as jobs would still be created in an 
area of high unemployment.

impossible to find a place to locate a textile industry in 
Montreal.  Montreal is the textile capital of Canada.  Better to 
head to the pulp and paper capital in Shawinigan, but that is 
another story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, how is it that the lists she has given us

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the hon. member continues to use the information in 
different ways.  First, the $850 million is from 1978 to today. 
He is counting 22 years.  It is not the budget for CIDA.  CIDA's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, everyone in the House is 
aware of the low income situation of a number of Canadian 
farmers, particularly those in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both levels of government have been working to find means in 
which to help alleviate that situation.  Last month we as a 
federal government announced another $1 billion over the next two 
years to assist.  Today, after long negotiations with the 
provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Prime Minister, the 
premiers and the government announced that we will make available 
another $400 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on February 1, CANDO sent the human resources minister 
an urgent e-mail about the missing money:  “We are in 
jeopardy”.  The next day it tried again by fax:  “Critical 
situation.  We are seeking your help”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What help did the minister give?  Absolutely nothing, none, 
while all the while she is telling everyone that she is fixing 
things. Why were there no steps to recover this money stolen from 
the taxpayer?  Or, was the minister just too busy trying to fix 
her image? 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. member again that this 
particular issue involved an employee of the company itself.  The 
company referred it to the police and the police are 
investigating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the bigger issue here, we are talking about grants and 
contributions that have been extraordinarily valuable to 
organizations and to individuals across the country.  The value 
of these undertakings is understood by this side of the House. 
Clearly it is not by that side of the House that would scrap all 
grants and contributions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, here are the facts.  In early February the minister was 
alerted to the theft of grant money.  On February 8 she told the 
House: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...we can do a much better job in administering our grants—I 
have taken it seriously.  My department has made it a priority. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we find out that her words were absolutely hollow.  Money 
was missing.  She refused to do anything about it.  The only 
reason the group went to the police is that the minister totally 
ignored them.  What is the minister getting paid for, anyway?

to get opportunities they may not have otherwise.

a leadership role to deal with the energy price crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday Yukon energy minister Trevor Harding wrote to the 
federal government saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the public's concern about increased fuel prices, I believe 
it is critical for the federal government to play a leadership 
role, and I urge you to convene a meeting of your provincial and 
territorial counterparts...to discuss common strategies for 
addressing this matter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other provinces have approached the government as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. Will he 
agree to convene an energy summit of the provinces, the 
territories, the oil companies and other stakeholders to address 
the soaring energy prices? 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first I am pleased to note that to date, higher prices 
for fuels in Canada have not contributed to higher inflation. 
Indeed inflation declined during the month of January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the hon. gentleman's suggestion, at our last 
federal-provincial-territorial meeting of energy ministers we 
discussed the oil pricing issue. I have no doubt that item will 
be on the agenda for the next meeting as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime I will canvass my territorial and provincial 
counterparts to seek their views and to determine if they have 
any plans within their jurisdictions to act on the matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am surprised to hear the minister say that because the 
last meeting of the council of energy ministers was in June 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister does convene a summit I ask that four things 
be included on the agenda: immediate aid for those who need it; 
elimination of the GST and/or a reduction in federal fuel taxes; 
energy conservation components; and an approach to the OPEC 
cartel to restore oil production levels. Will he put those items 
on the agenda? 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to OPEC, the OPEC ministers will be meeting 
within the next month or so.  It is obviously their jurisdiction 
since Canada is not a member of OPEC.  OPEC is very aware of 
Canada's views which do not support the actions which OPEC takes 
in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to diesel fuels, it should be noted that most of 
the consumers of those fuels qualify for such as things as the 
GST tax credit.  The impact of that tax credit has the effect of 
reducing the burden on consumers.

are to be issued. The committee met last week and recommended 
that Canada Post issue a stamp to commemorate the Queen Mother's 
100th birthday. Canada Post will issue such a stamp.

<A NAME="LINK208">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-13, an act to 
establish the Canadian institutes of research, to repeal the 
Medical Research Council Act and to make consequential amendments 
to other acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee, 
and on Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to participate in this debate on Bill 
C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very outset I cannot help but indicate to you, Mr. 
Speaker, a certain amount of cynicism about the process.  Time 
and time again we were told by the members of the Liberal 
government that this bill was urgently needed.  We were under 
considerable pressure at committee to get it through the whole 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, there were many occasions when Liberal members 
failed to show up for their responsibilities at the committee. In 
fact, there was a meeting where we could not proceed because no 
Liberal member chose to show up.  We had that real push to get 
this through, yet the government could not even ensure that the 
process was followed with integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have to indicate my cynicism around this bill.  While we 
are debating a bill that parliament has a say on, the Minister of 
Health is out trotting across the country announcing money under 
the auspices of the Canadian institutes on health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had press release after press release.  On January 11, 
28 and February 4 the Minister of Health announced grants for 
research saying that they were under the MRC, soon to be renamed 
the Canadians institutes on health research.  It was very 
cleaver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen parliament bypassed on many occasions and this is 
just another example of how little weight this place has when it 
comes to thorough review of legislation.  That disregard for 
parliament and the democratic will was evident throughout the 
entire process on Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today we heard Reform members and other members who 
participated at the committee talk about how seriously we took 
the process at committee in terms of amendments and discussions 
with no credence or support from the Liberal members on that 
committee for that kind of participation. 
I think it is absolutely important to put that on the record.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was introduced, we in the New Democratic Party 
said—and I think other caucuses have said the same—that we 
support the concept behind the Canadian institutes of health 
research and we endorsed the principle of the bill at second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we also identified a number of concerns that we felt 
had to be addressed at committee stage.  We therefore 
participated actively in that process by listening to witnesses, 
seeking clarification and proposing amendments.  In that regard, 
it is important on the part of everyone in the House to thank the 
dozens of individuals and organizations who either appeared 
before the committee or wrote to us with very thoughtful 
presentations and indepth analysis of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me, and I am sure struck others who were at 
committee, was a recurring theme, an opinion repeated time and 
time again, to the point where we had to take it seriously.  The 
theme was yes, but.  It is a good idea on paper but how will it 
work?  How can we be sure that the noble principles of the bill 
will be translated into action?  That really is the essence of 
our concerns with the bill before us today and with the process 
that we are involved in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what the bill attempts to do.  We know it ends the 
Medical Research Council and establishes the Canadian institutes 
of health research.  It appears to support a considerably 
expanded range and volume of health and health research in 
Canada.  It deals with addressing a full range of health research 
priorities in the country today, from biomedical services to 
applied clinical research, to health systems and services 
research, and finally to research on the broader social and 
economic determinants of health that lie outside the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can disagree with that?  Obviously that is something many of 
us have been saying for a long time.  It is much needed in Canada 
today.  On the basis of that stated objective, it is a bill worth 
supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we are left with is trying to answer the question: 
In terms of the details of the bill, are we sure?  Have we been 
guaranteed that these noble principles will be put into practice? 
Is the bill prescriptive, clear and detailed about how this 
transformative approach to health research in the country will 
happen?  Or, are we left with vague statements and unclear 
requirements that leave in doubt the application of the 
principles?  That is exactly the situation we are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point members to a very useful presentation we received 
at committee from a well-known health researcher and policy 
analyst in the country today, Bob Evans.  He wrote a letter to 
the committee, dated November 19, saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My impression, watching mostly but not entirely from the 
sidelines has been of a continuing struggle between those 
genuinely committed to this broad view of the CIHR mandate, and 
those who would prefer to see an “MRC on steroids”—a vastly 
expanded program of basic biomedical and clinical research, with 
at best a nod in the direction of research on either the 
provision (and financing) of health services, or the more 
fundamental determinants of health embedded in human social 
economic and economic environments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That point has to be addressed by the House today because we 
were unsuccessful in committee in terms of trying to convince the 
government to put more weight on the whole issue of research 
based on economic, social, cultural and environmental 
determinants of health and well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over again presenters mentioned how imbalanced the 
legislation was when it came to this very issue.  A great deal of 
weight, a lot of words and a lot of emphasis on biomedical 
research and applied clinical research but only passing 
references to economic, social and environmental determinants of 
health. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from many groups involved in women's health.  We 
certainly heard from people involved in environmental health.  I 
want to briefly quote from a document presented by the Canadian 
Labour Congress, which really captured the essence of this 
difficulty.  It states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the fact is that there is no central focus given to the 
environmental determinants of health, no priority given to 
research on the prevention of ill-health and no mention at all of 
the importance of research into the causation of ill-health. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That reflects a very important gap in the legislation and one 
which has to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of concerns.  I have said that we support the 
principle, but we obviously have a number of concerns with the 
bill.  Let me go through those concerns, because it will help to 
reveal how much disregard the government had for the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill mentions commercialization and in fact includes as one 
of its objectives facilitating the commercialization of health 
research.  There is no need for legislation dealing with public 
health research to emphasize commercialization.  There are other 
places where we deal with the question of the commercial 
advantage of business in the country, but surely our job in 
parliament is not to give any credence to the needs of private 
interests over the wishes of the public.  We tried to amend the 
bill to get rid of those words about commercialization. We 
failed.  The Liberals said no to that amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On conflict of interest, there is no provision in this bill to 
ensure that people who are appointed to the board have no 
pecuniary or proprietary interests in the pharmaceutical industry 
or the medical devices industry.  We proposed a clear conflict of 
interest amendment to ensure that kind of situation would not 
occur.  What did the government do?  It said no to that 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also tried to ensure that there was an independent process 
around ethics.  We called on the government to put in place an 
independent ethics advisory board to ensure that we could 
guarantee the protection of human beings in all clinical trials 
of research projects undertaken.  What did the government say? 
It said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made proposals on some basic, fundamental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said that there should be in this day and age, given what the 
Liberals themselves have said, gender parity on the board.  We 
thought that would be a normal assumption and that the government 
would gladly adhere to that principle of equality between women 
and men on appointments to the board.  The government said no. 
Liberal members on the committee said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not win on that one, so we suggested mainstreaming in 
terms of a provision for the institutes of health research.  What 
did the government do?  It said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then proposed a women's health research institute.  The 
government said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then proposed that the government address some of the other 
concerns by looking at ensuring that there was an institute on 
aboriginal health.  We proposed an institute on occupational and 
environmental health.  The government said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devil is in the detail and that is why we have concerns with 
this bill and why we want the government to take seriously the 
need for amendment to ensure that this bill is a shining beacon 
when it comes to transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, could I have the unanimous consent of the House to 
continue for two minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre has asked for the unanimous consent of the House 
to continue for two minutes.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I 
appreciate the flexibility you have provided me on this very 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really want to support this bill because the principle is 
such an important one, but it is very difficult to give our 
blessing to a bill when the government refuses to address very 
fundamental questions which would ensure that the principles are 
translated into action the way they have been outlined and 
portrayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government not agree to some basic changes to the 
bill to ensure transparency and accountability?  Why is there no 
provision on conflict of interest in terms of appointments to the 
governing council?  That was supported by numerous organizations, 
including the Canadian Healthcare Association, the Canadian 
Nurses Association, the Canadian Medical Association, the 
Canadian Labour Congress, the Women's Health Research Institute, 
and the list goes on and on.

be no questions of conflict between private greed and public 
need.

is not that kind of specificity in the bill.  We would implore 
members opposite to consider amendments that would actually 
improve the bill and give people guarantees and the comfort that 
in fact we will transform the research agenda and improve and 
enhance Canada's public health care system.

because of the number of motions we have on the Order Paper, you 
would recognize the Bloc Quebecois members, and then the 
Progressive Conservative members and finally the New Democratic 
Party member spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would you please explain the rationale for the order in which 
you intend to recognize speakers or what you expect that order 
to be, so that we may know where we stand? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We discussed what 
the order would be.  There is no formal order.  I had said that 
there would be the opportunity for the government to respond. 
However, as is the tradition, every time there is a set of 
motions a member from each of the recognized political parties 
has the opportunity to speak.  The hon. member for 
Compton—Stanstead will be the first speaker representing his 
party.  Then we will recognize a member on the other side and 
then we will recognize the hon. member for Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the Bloc has many motions and from now until 
the end of the day we will keep that in mind. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of my hon. colleague from New Brunswick Southwest, I rise 
to speak to the amendments he has put forward at report stage of 
Bill C-13, an act to establish the Canadian institutes of health 
research and to repeal the Medical Research Council Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my hon. colleagues on all sides of the House will listen 
carefully to the motions that are being put forward and will give 
them every consideration when it is time to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my belief that these motions will by no means take away 
from the bill, but in fact will add to its credibility.  We could 
probably even say clarity at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must demonstrate a commitment and respect for the 
principle of accountability through public access to research 
material and reports pertaining to public health issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health has given us a bill that is specific in 
its explanation of the organization of the CIHR.  The CIHR will 
consist of a president and governing council.  Together they will 
be responsible for the overall direction of the institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states that the members of this governing council will 
reflect the highest standards of scientific excellence.  The bill 
further states that the appointments will be made by the governor 
in council; by definition, the cabinet and ultimately the Prime 
Minister.  Here we go again.  This is a very cozy arrangement and 
the very reason we should be concerned.  In other words, cabinet 
and the Prime Minister will decide who will hold these positions.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president and the governing council of the CIHR will hold 
these positions at the pleasure of the government and they will 
be up for review every five years.  The motions before us speak 
clearly to the re-examination of the formula we currently use for 
appointments to positions such as these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the motions before us today offer a distinct 
opportunity to move beyond partisan politics.  We must put in 
place a process that is both transparent and principled, a 
process that will be dependent on the credentials of the highest 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I read the bill it became increasingly evident that I was on 
familiar ground.  The bill projects Jean Charest's plan for 
Canada's next century, the platform for health care that I ran 
and won on in the 1997 election.  I cannot fault the minister for 
coveting the plan of the Progressive Conservative Party because 
our plan is visionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Mr. Charest said, we should continue to adopt new medical 
treatments, new pilot and experimental programs that would 
provide Canadians with state of the art, cutting edge services 
and treatments, and new technologies to improve the access to care 
in rural and remote areas of the country.  He said there would be 
programs to test new integrated delivery systems aimed at 
providing health care based on the the highest quality of health 
practices.  He spoke of the development and maintenance of a 
Health Canada worldwide website on the Internet to provide a 
state of the art health care information system, including advice 
on the prevention and treatment of illness to help hospitals and 
researchers link their knowledge bases in the country.  Is that 
not the task of the new agency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Progressive Conservative Party said that it would 
create a national institute for health with membership drawn from 
the health care field.  It would have a board that would be 
co-chaired by the federal minister, along with the provincial and 
territorial ministers.  The Progressive Conservative platform in 
1997 laid out the right process to save our health care system. 
It was one of vision and challenge. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal policy is a disaster for our research institutions 
and probably the major cause of the brain drain, particularly on 
top of very high taxes.  Are members aware that people with 
cancer are being sent to the United States for very high-priced 
treatment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, they are forced to go after those brains for the new 
technology and superior equipment that we should have here. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Progressive Conservative Party support Bill C-13 
in principle since we had already written most of it.  However, 
the government now, more than ever, is under scrutiny by the 
Canadian people for its accountability, responsibility and lack 
of transparency and it might do well to give consideration to the 
motions before us today, which pertain to these very issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to speak to the report stage motions in Group 
No. 1 to amend Bill C-13.  As a member of the health committee I 
had the opportunity to listen to the excellent witnesses who 
appeared before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourteen institutes of health research will be established.  It 
turned out to be a bit of a love-in early in the testimony of the 
witnesses.  Many groups and organizations appeared before the 
committee to lobby with regard to issues concerning cancer, 
women's issues, aboriginal issues and so on.  It became very 
clear that there are far more demands for health research dollars 
in specific areas than there will be research institutes.  That 
means that it will be a very difficult process for the governing 
council of the new Canadian institutes of health research to 
determine how to properly structure those research institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous NDP speaker, who did an excellent job in 
representing her views on the committee, suggested that the 
government was opposed to setting up specific institutes for 
women, for aboriginals and so on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill that is the responsibility of the 
governing council.  It is not a matter of the government being 
opposed to any particular research institutes or promoting any 
particular research institutes.  Those are the responsibilities 
of the governing council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member also raised a twofold issue with regard to 
conflict of interest.  All order in council appointees will 
automatically be subject to the public service conflict of 
interest rules.  However, the member was quite right to point out 
that there was an extension in this regard to the extent that 
there would be appointees by the governing council which could 
include the executive committee and the various advisory and 
standing committees of the institutes of health research and of 
the governing council.  They will not specifically be subject to 
any conflict of interest guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would therefore seem appropriate to ensure, as with every 
agency exercising authority in terms of government funding, that 
appropriate conflict of interest guidelines be established. There 
is a generic clause in the bill that requires them to put into 
place all good management practices.  It is included implicitly 
although not as explicitly as the member requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we were beyond the lobbying for who wants to have health 
research institutes, the issue for a number of witnesses changed 
to that of accountability and transparency.  As the previous 
speaker mentioned, it is a very important issue with respect to 
all legislation with which the House deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the government model for the Canadian institutes 
of health research, the Public Policy Forum published a document 
called “Proposed Governance Structure for the Canadian 
Institutes of Health Research” on January 4, 1999.  It 
articulated excellent points for consideration, which were taken 
into account by the advisory committee to the government, with 
regard to structuring the legislation and designing the 
governance model for the CIHR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It laid out six principles of a good governance model and No. 3 
was accountability and transparency.  It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those within the CIHR, those who make decisions about funding the 
CIHR, and the Canadian public in general, must be able to hold 
accountable those in whom the responsibility for health research 
has been entrusted.  The lines of accountability must be clear 
and clean.  Making that accountability clear is the transparency 
that is deemed fundamental to the CIHR. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many references in this document with regard to 
accountability and good governance, transparency, et cetera.  It 
is an issue to which we are very sensitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of interveners before the committee decided to raise 
specifically some of these issues.  Dr. Susan Pisterman was one 
such intervener.  The Canadian Nurses Association, the Canadian 
Medical Association and the Canadian Health Association all 
raised the same theme with regard to transparency and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of interesting quotes.  To put it in context, 
the first one is from Dr. James Turk, executive director of the 
Canadian Association of University Teachers.  His final issue was 
commercialization and he said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—there is a potential conflict of interest of members of the 
governing council, which is not addressed in this bill.  Quite 
frankly, no one who represents major private commercial interests 
should be able to be appointed to the governing council. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter is covered by the conflict of interest guidelines to 
which order in council appointees by the governing council will 
be subject.  I believe that concern has been appropriately 
addressed.  However, as I said earlier, any other appointees by 
the governing council who are not covered by the public service 
conflict of interest guidelines should be adequately covered by 
good management practices.  He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a public body that will control millions of dollars of 
research money and will be probably the most decisive institution 
in Canada with respect to the health of Canadians. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question about that.  The Canadian institutes of 
health research will be responsible for peer review and 
consideration of about $500 million worth of grants.  In view of 
its size and importance there is no question that accountability 
and transparency issues will be carefully taken into account by 
parliament to ensure that they are in place.  I am very confident 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other concerns were raised.  The Canadian Health Association and 
its spokesperson, Mrs. Sharon Sholzberg-Gray, also raised issue 
about the fact that the CIHR president and the chairperson of the 
governing council would be the same person and that there should 
be a review in that regard.  She also recommended that to further 
strengthen transparency and accountability Bill C-13 should 
include provisions for a parliamentary review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was consistency with regard to those who came to talk, not 
just about the importance of having an authoritative body to 
manage such an important area as health research in Canada but to 
ensure that if there were ever any problems with regard to the 
Medical Research Council, or any others, the mechanisms are in 
place so that the public and parliament are comfortable with the 
provisions of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude my comments.  I support the bill.  I support 
those who came before the committee to compliment and to 
congratulate the government with regard to the structure of the 
governance model being proposed.  I am very sure the concerns 
raised by a number of the witnesses with regard to issues such as 
accountability and transparency have been adequately dealt with 
in the bill and will be taken care of as we move forward to 
establishing probably one of the most important health 
institutions in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows:  the 
hon. member for Churchill River, The Environment; the hon. 
member for Halifax West, Visible Minorities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in the House to speak to Bill C-13 at report stage. We 
are dealing with the first group of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is aimed at officially creating Canadian institutes of 
health research to organize, co-ordinate and fund health research 
at the federal level. These institutes will replace the Medical 
Research Council and will receive additional funding totalling 
$65 million for the 1999 fiscal year and about $500 million 
until 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the institutes of health research do? They will 
promote new ways of conducting research on biomedical themes and 
also on issues more directly related to social sciences, which 
is something totally new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, these institutes will be virtual, since they will 
allow researchers in universities, hospitals and other research 
centres in Canada, as well as university students, to 
communicate with each other and to share information 
electronically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutes will have various themes on which they will be 
able to focus their research, including ageing, arthritis, 
musculoskeletal development, cancer, molecular biology—a new area 
of research—the health of children and their mothers and the 
relationship between the two, clinical assessments, technology 
assessments, heart disease, and many more. They should also look 
at new genetic and reproductive technologies. These themes will 
be studied from a social perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of these institutes also includes other interesting 
and innovative elements. 
Ethical issues are to be taken into consideration. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am always surprised when this issue is raised, because the 
feeling is that, in the scientific community, ethics are at the 
forefront. It seems however that, with the new developments in 
science, this issue will become more pressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Emphasis will also be placed on the need for integrated health 
research with the co-operation of several groups: various 
organizations, women's groups and governments currently involved 
in research. This will be an important element in the future. 
The approach is clearly multidisciplinary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the institutes will not be dedicated, which will allow 
them to be more flexible and to alter their priorities to adapt 
quickly to the changing nature of society and the fast-paced 
developments in the research field. This is in response to the 
OECD, which has been urging Canada since 1993 to increase its 
investment in R and D. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is expected that the health research institutes governing 
council might start its activities as early as April 2000, in 
keeping with the wishes of the government and the scientists who 
are insisting on this timeline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, whose support for increased R and D funding is 
unwavering, salutes the efforts of the scientists who were 
involved in the drafting of the bill to ensure they would have 
access to innovative tools to improve the dissemination of 
health information and facilitate the development of cutting 
edge technologies in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However—and this is significant—in its present form, Bill C-13 
might encroach on provincial jurisdiction over health. The Bloc 
Quebecois cannot support the bill as it is currently worded. The 
problem is not the creation of the institutes per se. R and D 
falls under residual powers and, as such, is theoretically 
subject to federal jurisdiction. The problem comes from the 
possibility of direct encroachment on provincial jurisdiction in 
the area of public health care, without any prior earnest 
consultation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois is proposing a series of 
amendments mainly designed to highlight the importance of 
respecting and sharing jurisdictions, and to reaffirm the 
primacy of provincial jurisdiction in the area of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Bloc Quebecois supports increased investment in 
health research, and it is vital Quebec receive its fair share 
of federal research and development funds, especially since, 
historically, Quebec has received only 14% of federal spending 
on research and development on infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is particularly noteworthy, however, that we receive about 
30% of funding for researchers awarded on the basis of an 
evaluation by their peers, because this funding is awarded on 
the basis of merit.  This means, therefore, that our researchers 
are productive in Quebec and excel in such fields as mental 
health, cancer research, genome research and biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the multidisciplinary vision of Bill C-13 is 
commendable, it is unacceptable that the provinces were not 
given a major role. 
Respect for Quebec's jurisdisction should be at the heart of any 
intervention in the field of health.  This is why we must oppose 
the bill, if our amendments are defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is doing a good thing by investing more money in 
research now, but there is no need to lose sight of the need to 
reinstate the transfer payments to the provinces.  In fiscal 
year 1999-2000, the shortfall in social transfers to Quebec is 
estimated to be nearly $1.7 billion.  Of this amount, Quebec is 
denied nearly $850 million annually in the area of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We supported the principle of Bill C-13, we support the flexible 
and multidisciplinary structure, the increased funding to 
research and development, which could make researchers feel more 
secure and slow down the brain drain. However, our basic 
conditions are that the government re-establish transfer payments 
and respect provincial jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I declare the motion lost. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to the amendments to 
Bill C-13, the CIHR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to publicly congratulate Dr. Friesen on the great work he 
has done in pushing this through.  I also want to make some 
comments about my friend from the NDP, the health critic, who 
also brought up some excellent points that were ignored in 
committee and to which answers were not forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, when I sat on the committee last year as the 
health critic, we as a party were firmly in support of the 
essence of the bill, the organization of it and the 
public-private partnership notion.  It had a great deal of 
foresight.  Dr. Friesen and his colleagues deserve a great deal 
of credit for that.  It is a good idea and something that we in 
the Reform Party support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a number of very constructive solutions that our party 
put forward at committee stage were repeatedly shot down.  Why? 
Because once again the committee demonstrated very clearly that 
it was not demonstrating the autonomy that it ought to have if it 
was going to have credibility as an institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee members made amendments that would have strengthened 
the bill and allayed the concerns of the research community. 
These amendments were universally defeated by the government 
without, I might add, a great deal of forethought.  The 
amendments put forward—some by the NDP, some by the Reform Party 
and some no doubt by other opposition parties—would have 
strengthened the bill and made it better.  However, those 
amendments were defeated because they came from the opposition, 
and I think that is a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this takes place far too often in committees. 
Committees are supposed to be an avenue where members from across 
political parties can negotiate, discuss and debate issues 
related to bills in a manner that is largely beyond partisanship. 
The health committee chose not to pursue that course on a bill 
which could be enormously supportive of the research community 
and of the health and welfare of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization is fairly good.  We support Dr. Friesen's 
contention and promise that a maximum of 5% of the moneys 
allocated toward research will go toward administration, making 
this a lean, mean organization, one where 95% of the money is 
spent on the hard edge of research, which we support. 
In order for this to happen, I put forward an amendment on behalf 
of the Reform Party but it was not accepted.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important issue is to ensure that basic research, a 
fundamental aspect of research in Canada, would be secured and 
that 20% of the money that was available would be proportioned 
directly to basic research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems of involving a public-private partnership is 
that basic research, which does not have any short term to 
intermediate term benefit and no observable, concrete benefit in 
terms of profit-making for the private sector, would not be 
adequately funded in Canada.  Dr. Polanyi, our Nobel prize 
laureate in chemistry, and other researchers, sent letters to all 
committee members saying that this was very important.   We put 
forth an amendment to ensure that at least 20% of the money 
allocated to the CIHR would go toward basic research but that was 
defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no assurances in the bill that basic research will be 
financially supported, basic research that may not have the 
support of the private sector.  This is a flaw in the bill which 
I hope the government will rectify as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also found that there was not enough support for conflict of 
interest provisions, which the NDP health critic talked about 
very eloquently.  These provisions could affect the decision 
making and allocation of funds through the CIHR.  This needs to 
be addressed and I would ask the government to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have further issues that need to be addressed in the bill for 
the sake of research in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, at least 20% of the money that is available should go 
toward basic research.  I challenge the new CIHR to investigate 
naturopathic substances.  As a physician, one of the problems we 
have in the practice of medicine is trying to incorporate 
naturopathic substances.  We know some of it has a placebo 
effect, is not useful and is not backed by any science. Others 
have a demonstrative therapeutic effect on people but we do not 
know if it is a placebo effect or if it is based on good science. 
The medical community would love to know which naturopathic 
substances have a therapeutic effect and which ones do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pharmaceutical companies are not prepared to engage in the 
roughly $500 million required to determine if a substance has an 
effect.  Therefore, it would be up to organizations like the CIHR 
to engage in a public-private partnership to see which of these 
naturopathic substances have an effect and which do not.  This 
would be fascinating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frustrating to see substances such as EDTA being used by 
people in Canada and the United States with allegedly profound 
impacts on cardiovascular disease when there is not enough 
evidence to show whether it truly works or whether it has a 
placebo effect.  If it does not work, then we should know about 
it.  If it does work it could have a profound impact on lessening 
the need for surgical and non-surgical interventions in treating 
cardiovascular disease.  Statements have been made by patients 
indicating that this has had a profound impact on their health 
and well-being.  I have no factual evidence to back this up and 
no scientific proof that substances such as EDTA work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>St. John's wort can work very well for people with depression. 
This is the impression we have and it has worked on patients. 
However, we would like some scientific basis as to why these 
things work.  It would certainly help medical practitioners in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to bring up the issue of research and how 
moneys are allocated.  Too often moneys are allocated on the 
basis of special interest groups.  The interest group that 
screams the loudest gets the most money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Vancouver North Shore has done a yeoman's job 
in bringing the issue of prostate cancer to the forefront.  For 
many years prostate cancer did not get the funding it warranted 
based on the number of people it affected. 
Similarly, breast cancer did not get the funding it required 
based on the number of women it affected. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should base the research, and the moneys that are 
proportioned to it, on the morbidity, mortality and economic 
effects a disease has on society.  It should not be based on the 
group that screams the loudest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House might be interested to know that unipolar disorder or 
major depression will have a profound effect on our country in 
the future.  In fact, it will be the second leading cause of 
disability in the next 20 years.  Just imagine major depression 
being the second leading cause of morbidity in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue our policy makers are ignoring is the impact that 
psychiatric disorders, particularly dementia, will have on our 
health care system in the future.  There is not enough leadership 
on this issue.  I plead with the Minister of Health to meet with 
his ministers to look at what can be done today to address the 
future problem of dementia.  As we get older the issue of 
psychiatric and dementia problems in the geriatric population 
will have a profound impact on our health care dollar. If we do 
not put in place today the tools to deal with it, we will be 
caught in a very difficult situation in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now put a plug in for my private member's motion that 
passed in the House in May 1997 for the national headstart 
program.  I know it was supported by members across party lines, 
but we need a spark to ignite it.  It will save the taxpayers 
billions of dollars.  It will save thousands and thousands of 
children in the country.  It will deal with issues such as fetal 
alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects.  It will reduce teen 
pregnancy by 40%.  It will keep kids in school longer.  It is 
something that will benefit children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is prepared to work with members from across party 
lines to put this into action.  I implore the relevant ministers 
to call their provincial counterparts in justice, health and 
human resources and work together to put a national headstart 
program in place that will benefit all Canadians.

<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to speak today in the debate on report stage 
of Bill C-13, the short title of which is the Canadian Institutes 
of Health Research Act.  I would like to congratulate my 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for the excellence and 
relevance of his speech this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My pleasure at being able to speak on the institutes of health 
research stems from my very longstanding interest in this 
matter. 
As far back as 1997, I wrote the federal Minister of Health 
submitting a medical research project in the area of genetics 
that had been prepared by a leading group of researchers in the 
region I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I asked him to examine the merit of the proposal in 
order to award it some funding.  At that time, unfortunately, 
the Minister of Health informed me that there was no money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June, I again wrote the Minister of Health, inviting him to 
take advantage of being in my region to meet a team of 
researchers interested in the possibility of a virtual research 
institute which might meet their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I have long been calling for a fair share of R and D 
investments for Quebec, and if these were to benefit my region, 
all the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude this overview by mentioning that last 
week I sent a letter to the Minister of Health in which I 
pointed out my disagreement with federal government cuts since 
1993 in the health sector and with the longstanding unfairness 
in the disbursement of federal research and development funding 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then observed that of course we would respond favourably to an 
opportunity to receive our fair share of these new investments 
and to provincial jurisdiction over health being respected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, I also wish to thank the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for giving me a prime spot in committee 
during clause-by-clause consideration of Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used the opportunity to invite two researchers from my region 
to appear as witnesses.  Dr. Marcel Mélançon, director of 
Quebec's genetic and ethical research group at the Université du 
Québec à Chicoutimi, and Michel Perron, director of the ECOBES 
research group at the Cegep de Jonquière, which is studying the 
living conditions and needs of populations, pointed out that 
expertise in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region in the field of 
genetic determinants in the health of the population is very 
promising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also reminded committee members that it was important to 
consolidate scientific expertise in the regions and to promote 
the integration of researchers and interdisciplinarity.  Mr. 
Perron said that it was essential to support the training of 
research graduates from the regions and that incentives were 
necessary to keep them in contact with regional health problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mélançon testified that project evaluation should be done by 
peers, i.e. other scientists, and that it was essential that a 
single committee of experts not be given sole authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIHRs should ensure that science is conducted with conscience 
and that it serves the public's best interests.  The 
contribution of normative social sciences such as ethics and law 
should not be neglected. 
This is why he was saying that CIHRs should have ethics 
committees or even that an institute dealing exclusively with 
ethical issues in research would be totally justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be good if people outside the scientific community, 
sometimes called lay persons, could have their say, without 
interfering with strictly technical decisions, so that the 
wishes and concerns of the people can be heard and so that 
scientists are not isolated in their ivory tower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party, the Bloc Quebecois, and I have long supported the idea 
of reinvesting in research. The Bloc Quebecois supported the 
principle of the bill at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we agree with the principle of the bill, it does not 
mean that we are willing to accept it as is. 
The Bloc Quebecois has proposed amendments which, if adopted, 
would make the bill acceptable. I truly believe in the 
importance of this bill and I think it is possible to amend it 
to make it better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, has brought 
forward essential amendments, which would recognize the 
provinces' jurisdiction in the area of health and which would 
subject CIHRs to a consultation process with the provinces. It 
is crucial that the bill be more explicit with regard to the 
importance of treating the regions fairly in allocating the 
research institutes that will be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly summarize the amendments brought forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
Specifically, the first group of motions is comprised of 11 
amendments, which clearly specify that the bill is about health 
research, not about a potential expansion of mandates beyond 
that research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is to ensure that decisions about the choices and 
principles underlying health networks and services to the public 
come under the exclusive authority of the provinces, as provided 
by the Constitution, which the Liberals claim to protect when in 
fact they are violating it through increasingly more 
unacceptable infringements on provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are simply asking that the bill allow the establishment of 
the institutes while respecting the division of powers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT53"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT53"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1720
<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we insist on these amendments, which seek to clearly 
indicate that Bill C-13 is about health research. Again, it is 
not the establishment of institutes that poses a problem to the 
Bloc Quebecois, but the possibility of infringement on a 
provincial jurisdiction, namely health services to the public, 
without meaningful consultations with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that the federal government make it clear that 
it has no intention of using this bill to create parallel 
structures and that it supports the initiatives undertaken by 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is prepared to co-operate with 
the federal government to amend this bill, so that it will truly 
serve health research while also respecting federal and 
provincial jurisdictions, for the benefit of the public's 
health, and so that the region of Jonquière, which I have the 
honour of representing, can benefit from it. In our region, we 
have top researchers who, in spite of limited funding over the 
years, have made their mark at the local, provincial and 
national level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I call on the government to pay very close attention 
to the Bloc's amendments. If it does, we will be pleased to 
support its bill. But if the government does not do that, we 
will unfortunately have no choice but to oppose the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
extremely important that the Bloc Quebecois be here to speak to 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this may also be true of other provinces, we all know 
that, in Quebec, research, and health research in particular, 
has been extremely hard hit by the cuts made by the central 
government. We have just gone through a period when transfers 
were cut by some 40%. Universities have seen their budgets 
reduced. We has been hard to provide training to new 
researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, Quebec has continued to contribute more than Canada, 
allowing Canada to build up its resources, which, as we now 
know, have become surpluses the importance of which we will find 
out on Monday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, while graphs on the growth of health research in 
the United States showed an increase, those on health research 
in Canada for the same period showed a decline. It was urgent 
for the Canadian government to invest in health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have nothing against the Canadian government investing in 
health, on the contrary. But how does it go about it? It decides 
to change the structure. Instead of putting money back into the 
centre for biomedical research which had been funding and 
supporting, all over the country, groups that may also find 
other funding sources and thrive, as was often the case in 
Quebec—Quebec and its research groups are often cited as 
examples—the federal government has seen fit and necessary to 
centralize biomedical research through this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that these are virtual centres. True, but the 
intention is clear. That is why one the Bloc's amendments seeks 
to change a paragraph in the preamble of the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 2 of the bill it states, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Parliament believes that health research institutes 
should be created to coordinate, focus— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not invent the word “focus”. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and integrate health research based on 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they talk about co-ordination, one might wonder, because 
this usually involves independent entities. 
They use the word “focus” in reference to research, but 
focussing is not always necessary; sometimes complementarity is 
required, and teams working in different directions may, at some 
point in time, through healthy competition, achieve results 
faster. This bill however seeks to focus and integrate health 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that distinguished people have worked on that issue, but 
we are here to fulfil our responsibilities as politicians and, 
in politics, one cannot rely on politicians and deputy ministers 
fits of generosity. We read the enactments. If we did not read 
them and report what we found in them, we would not be doing our 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many extraordinary efforts have been made in the field of 
biomedical research in Quebec, and too much creativity and 
genius has been put into not only discovery but also preparation 
and organisation processes to let the federal government step in 
with its maple leaf and centralise and integrate health research 
when money is being invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally unacceptable. There is no doubt that those who 
drafted this bill knew that it was totally unacceptable to 
Quebec, but they also knew that the research industry has become 
exhausted because of lack of funding and that it needs money. We 
do understand that. But it is our responsibility to say that we 
will not agree to anything just because we need money. 
Otherwise, we would be saying that the government was right in 
doing what it has done since 1994, which was to empoverish the 
provinces, and particularly Quebec, when we all know how the 
health budget was treated the last time. It would be saying that 
the government had been right, because it would allow it to take 
control over the centralization and integration of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clearly shows the importance of the Bloc Quebecois' 
presence here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under such conditions, Quebec's opposition is not surprising. I 
am sure that nobody is happy about it, because we all know very 
well that we need the money, but we cannot easily give up what 
could be called community ownership. It would be utterly 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although its authors' intentions are praiseworthy, this bill is 
dangerous and unacceptable as it stands, and the Bloc will say 
that it is dangerous and unacceptable. Would it be so difficult 
for members opposite to accept to take away the words “to 
centralise and integrate the research”? I would be very 
surprised if they accepted to take that passage out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening with Bill C-20 can be seen in a general way in 
the attitudes. I know that the members opposite are laughing, 
but I urge them to try to understand that the people of Quebec, 
its representatives, the National Assembly and all those who 
defend our common heritage cannot understand that, for this 
country that they claim to care for, they do not accept to make 
amendments that are only legitimate, normal, necessary and 
minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will therefore strongly oppose this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, all proceedings of the Senate 
of Canada in the Senate Chamber should be televised. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this evening's debate revolves around 
Motion No. 98, which states that in the opinion of the House all 
proceedings of the Senate of Canada in the Senate Chamber should 
be televised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the House of Commons will not hold a recorded vote on this 
subject, it is my sincere hope that perhaps some senators are 
watching and may finally take action.  Perhaps some senators are 
even watching tonight's proceedings live on television.  Maybe 
they are working late on Parliament Hill.  Maybe they have gone 
home and are watching a rebroadcast on CPAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I say something particularly outrageous tonight they may see 
it repeated on television newscasts throughout the day tomorrow, 
but I would never do that.  I must therefore choose my words 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that our debates in this Chamber are open to 
television cameras.  We have nothing to hide in this place.  To 
senators watching tonight this may seem surreal.  We are in front 
of television cameras debating whether the Senate of Canada 
should allow television coverage of its debates.  Currently the 
Senate forbids such broadcasting.  Granted, it allows some 
cameras into selected committees, but the Senate of Canada is not 
a group of committees engaged in study after study.  It is a 
legislative body.  It is the other half of Canada's parliament 
and it is a chamber where unelected people debate proposed 
legislation.  It amends bills.  It adopts bills.  It even defeats 
bills passed by this elected chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of how one views our current set-up, whether we want 
it to be reformed, abolished or left alone, surely we want to be 
able to watch our senators in action.  We ought to be able to 
watch them stand and be counted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate of Canada should draw back its dusty curtains and 
expose itself to the scrutiny of television.  Perhaps I should 
contrast the Senate's approach to television with our experience 
in this place.  The House of Commons reached agreement to go on 
the airwaves in 1977. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of background, I should say that the legislative chambers 
in all democratic countries and states have public galleries. 
Since the days of the Magna Carta the public's business has been 
seen by the public.  If I flash forward from 1215, some 762 years 
later a debate occurred here in the House of Commons on extending 
the galleries by way of television, realizing that in the era of 
electronics and as the medium known as television matured it was 
the ideal and modern way of extending the principle of the public 
galleries in the Commons into Canadian homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 25, 1977 the House adopted a motion to broadcast live 
all of its debates and proceedings.  In September 1977 our 
Chamber went on the air.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of extending the galleries is based on some very 
clear and sound philosophies.  First, as I have said, the public 
has a right to see its legislators debating the public's 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, for our federal chambers to be relevant—and we have to 
be more relevant—debates and proceedings must be fully 
accessible to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, public broadcasting gives viewers firsthand experience 
of legislators at work, as opposed to what otherwise would be 
received through reports or commentaries prepared by journalists. 
Quite simply, it is not filtered and it cannot be construed or 
censored in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that today more than 100 countries 
broadcast their legislative chambers' proceedings on a daily 
basis, yet in this parliamentary precinct, which was the first 
elected chamber in the world to broadcast its proceedings, there 
is an exception and it is called the Senate Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should tell the House that the only debate in that place on 
this issue took place on November 5 and December 3, 1975, 25 
years ago, when senators expressed a majority opinion that the 
public should not view their proceedings by way of television.  I 
will provide details on this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House to the Senate rule book, which 
is the equivalent of the standing orders of the House of Commons. 
Its rule book says that the televising of proceedings is strictly 
prohibited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should declare my own bias concerning the Senate.  It will 
come as a great shock.  It would be my preference to see it 
abolished.  In fact, I have joined with other members of this 
elected chamber in circulating petitions in support of abolition. 
I want to read part of the official response to these petitions. 
This is an official response from the government, and it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government shares the petitioners' concern about modernizing 
parliamentary institutions.  However, a constitutional amendment 
would be required to abolish the Senate— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A consensus does not exist on what the role and form of the 
Senate should be in the future, that is, whether it should remain 
as it is, or be reformed or abolished....In the meantime, the 
Senate will continue to play a fundamental role in the federal 
legislative process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat that.  “The Senate will continue to play a 
fundamental role in the federal legislative process”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look around the world.  There are 80 countries which 
televise all of their legislative chambers' proceedings, yet we 
in this parliament average 50%, one out of two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British House of Lords, for example, went on the air in 
1985, about four years before the British House of Commons, and 
rather than affect the general demeanour of that place, public 
opinion polls suggest in Great Britain that it has clearly 
revealed two points.  First, the public in Britain actually like 
the House of Lords.  In fact, it became a rating success. Second, 
it is agreed among the British public that the quality of debate 
in the House of Lords went up, not down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to repeat that we live in an electronic 
information age.  I have to ask, is it not ironic that the other 
place, the Senate of Canada, is not available to Canadians 
through the medium known as television? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can gain inspiration from the practice of televised 
proceedings elsewhere in Canada.  It is alarming to realize that 
the Senate of Canada is the only major assembly not to televise 
its proceedings.  I think it is odd that such a centrally 
important institution is effectively not open to the public. 
Other sorts of assemblies in Canada are required to bear the 
democratic weight of visibility.  Why should the Senate not meet 
this democratic litmus test? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of Canadians are 
effectively barred from the affairs of the Senate.  For the 30 
million Canadians who do not live within the boundaries of the 
national capital region and cannot make it to the Senate public 
galleries, the lack of television coverage means that they are 
unable to follow the business that is being transacted supposedly 
in their names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why deny access to a key component of our legislative process? 
Whether someone agrees or disagrees with a unelected Senate, the 
fact is that it is a central player in our legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No government bill, private member's bill or finance minister's 
budget can be enacted without the Senate.  The Senate signs off 
on every piece of legislation it receives from the Commons. 
Without the Senate's acquiescence laws could not be made.  That 
is the law of this country.  That is the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the constitution the Senate holds as much power as this 
place, the House of Commons. 
While it has usually been the practice of that place of the 
unelected senators to defer to the elected Commons, there have 
been occasions when it has invoked its constitutional prerogative 
to reject or to withhold approval of Commons legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know by our constitution, principally by the British North 
America Act, that the Senate is central in the lawmaking ability 
of what we call the federal parliament.  Canadians need to have 
access to this component of the Canadian legislative process.  It 
is 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not willing to televise the Senate places a shroud over an 
integral part of Canadian governance and, at worst—and I think 
this is becoming more common—it creates the perception that 
something is going on that the Senate is hiding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us open up the old heavy oak doors, part those old dusty 
curtains to allow the fresh breath of public transparency and the 
bright light of visibility into a place that has been, some would 
say, dark and stale for too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate belongs to all Canadians and, while only a select few 
can trespass on to its royal red adornments, it is important to 
at least provide some degree of ownership to citizens over an 
institution that is key to the conduct of public affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as though what I am proposing can even be considered 
radical or trend-setting because legislative assemblies across 
Canada already broadcast their proceedings, as do municipal 
councils, school boards and all kinds of quasi-judicial 
tribunals.  Even the Senate of Canada standing committees have 
been known on occasion to allow the public to catch a glance of 
senators at work in committee, although it should be noted that 
Senate committees involve only a dozen of the 105 people who 
occupy that place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only in Canada, but elsewhere upper chambers have their 
proceedings televised.  As I have said, the U.K., the United 
States, Australia and over 100 other chambers in countries around 
the world televise their proceedings.  I should say that in my 
own municipality of Sarnia I can get the Sarnia city council, I 
can get the Chatham council, which is about 75 miles away, I can 
get two city councils, but I cannot, unless I have a Ouija board, 
get the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House of Lords of the United Kingdom daily sittings have 
been permanently broadcast since 1985.  The opponents of Canadian 
Senate broadcasting wrongly argue that TV would destroy its 
deferential and so-called polite decorum at the very high level 
of civilized debate that we are told takes places in the Senate. 
One senator has even described the place as being serene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1980s, when the House of Lords was discussing 
proceeding with broadcasts, some peers echoed a similar concern. 
However, the track record tells a different story.  The decorum 
and the politeness of the lords' debates has not gone down, but 
has probably gone up.  The Senate of Australia, an elected body, 
has been broadcasting since 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wonder of the Westminster parliamentary system is its 
ability to evolve toward greater democratic governance with 
stronger links to citizens.  The history of parliaments in Canada 
and the U.K., and I assume elsewhere in the Commonwealth, has 
shown that they have never shied away from strengthening the link 
to citizens.  Televising the Senate should be viewed simply as 
another logical step in that evolutionary process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though television did not exist in 1867, the Senate, I 
would suggest, has a duty and a responsibility to adapt toward 
greater accountability and visibility so that the link with 
citizens is strengthened.  Letting public business into the 
living rooms of Canadians is a good thing.  Not only will it let 
citizens hold senators to account in a more effective way, it 
will also contribute to a heightened legitimacy of parliamentary 
institutions, this place known as the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, as senators maintain, they are truly effective and they make 
a positive contribution, they should not fear television.  Their 
deliberations should be able to withstand the bright lights of TV 
cameras. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, in 1975 the Senate debated the idea of televising 
proceedings.  It decided against the practice at the time and 
since that time it has been loath in any way to discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1975 former Conservative Senator Martial Asselin provided 
insight into why the Senate is so apprehensive about televising 
its proceedings. At that time he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you my own point of view, since I feel that the best 
way to get the Senate abolished is to permit television and radio 
coverage of our proceedings. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Senate <I>Hansard</I> showed, some hon. senators concurred 
by saying “aye, aye”.  They obviously did not feel that the 
Senate's work at that time was all that valuable.  He seems to 
indicate that it would not be able to stand up to public scrutiny 
and that upon seeing the Senate in action, or should I say 
inaction, the public would call for its abolition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a sad state of affairs when senators themselves do 
not even have confidence in the work they do to hold up their 
institution to public attention.  I think I speak for all members 
in saying that we certainly hope senators no longer believe this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close by referring to an op-ed piece written by 
a senator who occupies that place at the moment.  Senator Joyal 
lists his daily schedule and tells how busy he really is, or says 
he is.  He may have chosen a busy day to illustrate his schedule. 
His examples are by no means an accurate composite of activities 
for all senators, nor does his schedule appropriately address the 
substance that a senator might encounter in a typical day's work. 
It was a criticism against a newspaper article. I think Senator 
Joyal's criticism should not be directed to a columnist's 
assertions that most Canadians would agree with, but rather 
should be directed to the institution and its members who have a 
massive credibility problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that 90% of Canadians would prefer to see it changed. Of 
them, half would support it being abolished and the other half 
would support it being elected in some way.  We know that 10% 
have no opinion or like it the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an institution which has an incredible problem of 
legitimacy. I am saying that TV would encourage senators to 
respond to issues that Canadians care about, lest citizens judge 
them as completely useless.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, why 
should the Senate be televised? 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regions of Canada need to be more involved in decision making 
and policy making at the national level.  To meet the hopes and 
dreams of those who live in the west and the Atlantic, a reformed 
Senate is essential.  It must be a Senate that is elected, 
effective and equitable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the words of the Prime Minister as recorded in 
<I>Hansard</I> on September 24, 1991. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I on the other hand support Senate reform. If it is done 
properly, a restructured and revitalized upper chamber can give 
Albertans a voice in the governance of Canada.  If elected 
Liberal leader I pledge to work for a Senate that is elected, 
that has legislative powers of its own and contains strong 
representation from all regions of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was said by the present Prime Minister on June 23, 1990. 
“You want the triple E Senate and I want one too”. That was the 
Prime Minister again in the Toronto <I>Star</I> on February 2, 
1990. “The Liberal government in two years will make it elected. 
As Prime Minister I can take steps to make it happen”. Once 
again that was the present Prime Minister speaking to 400 
delegates at the annual general meeting of the Alberta branch of 
the federal Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal prime ministers agree that the Senate needs to be 
reformed.  One of the steps to make that happen, one of those 
true reforms, is what the member for Sarnia—Lambton has put 
forward today in the House of Commons, which is the idea of 
making the Senate televised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the grandmother of all parliaments, in Westminster, in 
1985 the House of Lords televised its proceedings.  Indeed the 
House of Commons in the grandmother of all parliaments followed 
four years later and televised its meetings in 1989.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Senate is a place that is undemocratic in that it is 
appointed.  Our Senate is a place that is not accessible. Instead 
of providing information via the electronic method where most 
people get their understanding of the news today, our Senate 
instead is a place that is out of control.  It allows people like 
Andy Thompson to spend but one day in the spring sitting and one 
day in the fall sitting and collect a full salary.  Only because 
of public pressure, because of media pressure, because of light 
shed on the institution and scrutiny brought to bear did those 
things change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate should be a place that has nothing to hide, that 
stands behind no shroud.  As a result TV cameras should be in the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk about the public support for Senate reform, 
in particular an elected Senate, because it hinges on this very 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia 84% of people are in favour of an elected 
and reformed Senate.  In Manitoba 86% are in favour of such 
reforms.  In my home province of Alberta 91% of people are in 
favour of reform of the Senate, of modernizing this institution. 
Television would modernize the institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a recent development.  One of the senators, the last 
Progressive Conservative or Tory senator in the province of 
Alberta, has expressed the intention to resign his seat as of 
March 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year Albertans elected Bert Brown, a man who has been 
campaigning for an elected, equal and effective Senate for over 
10 years.  He received more votes than any other federal 
politician in Canadian history.  Even if we went back prior to 
1867, nobody could compare to Bert Brown in the amount of votes 
he garnered. During the Senate election, in the midst of that 
process, the Prime Minister had the audacity and disrespect for 
the people of Alberta to appoint someone to sit in that chamber 
in Bert Brown's place.  Shame on the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully there is an opportunity to have that made right; that 
wrong can be made right.  When that seat becomes vacant on March 
31, I implore on behalf of the people of Alberta, on behalf of 
the premier and the letters he has written to the Prime Minister, 
and on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people who cast 
their ballots, that the Prime Minister do the right thing.  I ask 
that he stand by the convictions he ran for as Liberal leader in 
1990 in Calgary, Alberta when he won his election, and by his 
predecessor Pierre Elliott Trudeau whom he served in cabinet, and 
uphold that idea of an elected Senate and appoint Bert Brown to 
that place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Sarnia—Lambton is talking about changing the 
rules of the Senate, section 130(1), which only allows for audio 
broadcasts in the Senate.  My hon. colleague would like to expand 
it beyond audio broadcasts to broadcast the proceedings on 
television, to carry the business in the Senate as people see me 
tonight here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wherever they live should be able to see their 
government at work.  They have seen their government at work in 
the House of Commons since 1977.  The debate for that began in 
1973.  They now see their provincial legislatures at work from 
coast to coast to coast. They see their municipalities at work. 
Municipalities across the land have taken it upon themselves to 
televise their proceedings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>More than that, even school boards in this country have gone so 
far as to televise their meetings so that the public knows what 
they do in their interests and that the business be known to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve to know what they are getting for the $50 
million plus a year they spend on the Senate. Last year the House 
of Commons attempted to draw before it those members of the 
Senate who did not want to explain their budget appropriations, 
their 16% increase in their budget.  The people of this country 
deserve to know and to see with their own eyes what goes on in 
that place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, people have to go into that chamber. Only from 
that vantage point, those few precious seats in that red chamber, 
are they allowed to see what goes on.  As a matter of fact last 
year the Senate took steps to restrict access to the printed 
records of who takes their seat in the Senate and does their 
public business as they are paid to do.  It is a crying shame 
that people are not even allowed to see those minutes, to have 
them published and available on the Internet as is other business 
of this Commons and of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael O'Connor, a fellow who lives in Ottawa, was so upset 
over that very predicament that he took time away from his part 
time job to sit in one of the rooms in the Senate.  He 
transcribed all of those sittings of the Senate to know who was 
or was not there and who was collecting his taxpayer dollars to 
sit or not sit in that place on his behalf.  That type of thing 
is egregious and should not be going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider that 80 countries in the world permit the 
broadcasting of all proceedings in their chambers and now over 
100 countries permit some form of broadcast, the idea that our 
Senate allows none of its main chamber is a disgrace. The Senate 
must be reformed and televising it is but one of the mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There has been some

word creep into the proceedings of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have previously intervened if the term has been used to 
describe a specific member or a specific minister or describe a 
specific person's actions.  It has been used in the House to 
describe the actions of a group.  While it is still a word that 
must be used in the English language, we are going to measure its 
use very carefully.

powers in a partisan way. They are exercised by people who often 
use this money and these powers for personal and partisan 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want more Canadians to be aware of what is happening in 
the Senate, we should ensure that its budgets are more 
transparent and that the auditor general can examine the Senate's 
books. I think people would then be much more aware of what is 
happening in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that only one auditor general's report, the 1991 one, 
dealt with the Senate. The auditor general found that the Senate 
lacked transparency, that it was trying to hide what goes on 
there. Indeed, my Reform colleague pointed out how it is 
difficult to get a precise account on Senate attendance. All the 
information on the Senate is very difficult to access, or they 
are trying to hide it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators have no benefit in being known to Canadians. 
Nevertheless, ensuring transparency on spending and budgets 
would be sufficient for people to call for the abolition of the 
Senate. Ultimately, this is the only solution: the abolition of 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, for example, how the money is badly spent. 
We know that the Senate costs more than $60 million a year. 
Public accounts show an amount of only $47 million. However, if 
we add the services provided by a range of federal departments 
and organizations, the cost of the Senate exceeds $60 million a 
year and could even reach $70 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one knows that. At this time, no one in Canada and not a 
single member of this House knows exactly how much the Senate 
costs. If only we knew the exact amount, we would be getting 
somewhere. We do not know how much the Senate costs because, 
unfortunately, this kind of information is not disclosed. About 
two years ago, the House of Commons invited the Senate to appear 
before the House's standing committee to explain its expenses 
and cost increases, which had reached 16% over the two previous 
years. 
Well, the House of Commons was not allowed to know how the 
Senate had spent its $47 million budget which, as we know, 
actually exceeds $60 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that senators do not work very hard. They sit an 
average of 65 days a year, for about three hours a day, and half 
or at least a third of the senators are absent half of the time. 
I did a calculation of the efficiency of senators and if you 
take all those factors into account, the cost of a senator 
reaches between $3,000 to $6,000 an hour. Those people, who 
spend $60 million of the taxpayers' money, do not account for 
what they do and, furthermore, some of them may even use their 
position as senators to advance private interests, to become 
members of boards of directors or to get involved in many 
partisan activities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, people should know that senators use their status, 
their offices, their funding, their privileges and their 
frequent flyer points for partisan purposes, either for the 
Liberal Party or the Progressive Conservative Party. I find it 
utterly immoral and unacceptable. However, it seems that here, 
in Canada, such practices are accepted in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, senators can sit on boards of directors, which opens 
the door to potential conflicts of interest. Senators who sit on 
such boards are required to disclose the names of the companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that one senator sits on Power Corporation's board of 
directors as vice-chairman. 
Last year, just for sitting on that board, he received $430,000. 
Add to that what he gets for sitting on other boards of 
directors, his salary as a senator and all the benefits he gets 
as a senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with people who sit on the boards of large 
corporations being paid $1 million. However, I find it immoral 
that they also sit in the Senate and use their privileges as 
senators to lobby officials in various departments. It is not 
illegal, at least not for now, but it is highly immoral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks closely at the Senate, when one sees how 
undemocratic and archaic it is, one realizes that it should have 
been abolished a long time ago. The longer this kind of 
institution is kept in place, the easier it will become to see 
how rotten it is, or so I hope. 
It is not necessary to put cameras in the Senate because I think 
that it would only be money wasted over and above what the 
Senate already wastes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that my colleague from Sarnia—Lambton go directly to 
the heart of the issue. As a Liberal member, I find him very 
courageous to voice his opposition to the Senate and to work for 
its abolition. I think that we must go all the way and simply 
abolish the Senate. That would be doing an excellent service to 
everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would save the $60 million given each year to that 
institution. That money is wasted each year. This is not money 
that we waste once in a while but money that is thrown out the 
window every year. Over ten years, that adds up to $600 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that money were invested in job creation or in constructive 
projects, I think it would be a lot more useful to Canadians 
than to give it to tired old politicians who are there only due 
to patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals, among others, had the courage to do so, it 
would be very easy to get rid of the Senate. All they have to do 
is  vote against the Senate's budget in June. That is what I 
suggest they do.

incredible motion.  As a matter of fact I consider it to be quite 
mischievous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went door to door during the 1993 federal election campaign 
and 90% of the constituents in my riding signed the petition to 
abolish the Senate.  The other 10% did not want to talk to me 
because they were concerned about other issues, were busy making 
supper and did not have time to sign it.  There was not one 
person in my riding, and I canvassed about 45 polls, who said 
they would not sign a petition to abolish the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Televising the Senate proceedings would be like archaeology, 
moving a set of bones from one grave to another. 
They could have a sitcom style program if they televised it: 
<I>Who wants to be a millionaire senator</I>.  Of course the 
questions would be rigged and the moderator would be the Prime 
Minister, and only his friends would win.  That is what the 
Liberals would do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it already costs $60 million a year to operate the Senate, 
television producers might consider a weekly format.  They could 
call it <I>What's in it for me</I>.  Selected senators would 
discuss a piece of government legislation and how it would 
personally benefit them or their friends or the Liberal or the 
Conservative parties.  It would be a great program, but there are 
no New Democrats in the Senate.  There never have been and never 
will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they televise the proceedings in that place, which by the way 
I do not support, I hope the Canadian public understands that it 
is just a Liberal and Tory chamber, somewhat like a bedchamber. 
Televising the Senate would the parliamentary version of the 
sitcom <I>Friends</I>, or I mean friends of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a novel idea is televising the Senate.  Ratings would go 
through the roof.  Can we not see the viewing public glued to 
their television sets while watching the senators cavort for the 
cameras?  It would be like televising the <I>Titanic</I> at the 
bottom of the ocean hour after hour, week after week, year after 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be some difficulties in translation if we were to 
televise the Senate, because how would we translate snores? 
Televising the Senate would be like televising homemade bread 
rising.  Watching homemade bread rise would be more exciting than 
televising the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have 10 top reasons why the Senate should be televised.  The 
No. 10 reason for televising the Senate is to assist Canadians 
who are deprived of sleep.  No. 9 is to show Canadians the fine 
and expensive furnishings of the Senate chamber.  No. 8 is to 
provide an outlet for people experiencing anger management 
problems.  No. 7 is to provide Canadians with a true non-news 
program.  No. 6 is to provide Canadians with the funny side of 
politics.  No. 5 is to give Canadians a break from reality.  No. 
4 is to encourage young entrepreneurs who want to know how to 
make a fortune by not doing anything useful with their lives. No. 
3 is to endlessly bore Canadians.  No. 2 is to frustrate 
Canadians.  The No. 1 reason for televising the Senate is to 
reveal just what a bankrupt, nonsensical, patronage ridden, 
decrepit, useless outfit it really is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fact of the matter is that parliament as a whole 
includes the Senate of Canada.  One of the arms of governance of 
our country is the Senate of Canada, as is the supreme court, as 
is this Chamber.  If we do not respect the occupants at any 
particular time, we must respect the institutions.  If we choose 
to change the institutions then let us change the institutions in 
a parliamentary manner.

reflections on any of the chambers as a whole.  I will not get to 
reflections on the Chair.  We will save that for a different day.

Speaker, on a point of order. You have just read a short excerpt 
from Montpetit-Marleau. I must say that it makes me uneasy, since 
this excerpt says that we must show deep respect for the 
institution of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem with that because if, as elected members of 
parliament—we know full well that the members of the other place 
are not elected—we want to make major changes to the other place, 
it means that we do not have a very flattering opinion of it, so 
to speak. If we want to bring about theses changes, we will be 
forced to voice opinions that might be less than flattering or 
more or less unrespectful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such a case, how will we settle this conflict between what 
the jurisprudence says and what our own convictions are, if we 
really want to make changes to the unelected Senate? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  One of the 
distinguishing characteristics of the Bloc is that although the 
Bloc came to parliament with a specific raison d'être, it has 
worked scrupulously within the confines of the democratic 
process.  That is, in my view, a great honour for members of the 
Bloc Quebecois.  The nature of our parliament is to have the 
freedom to do what we need to do to change the way our country 
works but to do so within the regulations that are set down 
before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to change those regulations then we should change 
them; and they can be changed through democratic and 
parliamentary means.  It is not impossible to make the statements 
that are necessary to be made in order to effect a change in the 
other place and still have fidelity to the rules by which we 
conduct ourselves.  It may require persistent application of 
imagination and it may require quiet consultation, but it can be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I meant it very sincerely when I said that if there is one group

them.  He will stand advised and be guided by your remarks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I appreciate the 
intervention by the parliamentary secretary.  I chose, rather 
than to draw specific attention to any one member at any one 
time, because this is something that has been going on for some 
time, to make a statement to parliament as a whole.  It was not 
my intention to address this to any one member.  For that reason, 
I would not ask the member to withdraw his statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your remarks. 
The Speaker is always correct in his observations and I respect 
that.  If I have offended anyone, I apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue my remarks by saying that the Senate can never 
be reformed.  The Reform Party members have said that the Senate 
costs us $60 million and that they want to reform it.  They want 
an elected Senate which will cost Canadians $120 million or more 
every year to operate. If we put this question to a referendum 
and asked Canadians if the Senate should be abolished, my sense 
is that they, in a unanimous way—probably around 80% to 
90%—would support the abolition if the alternative, as the 
Reform has said, will cost twice as much money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put the case forward that if we abolish the Senate we would 
encourage Canadians to petition us in the House of Commons to 
strike yet one more level of government that would cost all this 
money.  I bet there would not be a lot of people signing a 
petition to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I say that is because we are already overgoverned in 
this country.  We have municipal governments, urban hamlets, 
towns and villages, rural municipalities, counties, school 
boards, hospital boards, provincial governments, the federal 
House of Commons and the Senate.  We have more governments than 
people want to pay for.  They are asking us to downsize the 
number of politicians not to increase the number of politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should be doing instead is undertaking a referendum on 
the abolition of the Senate.  We should be downsizing the number 
of politicians we have in the House of Commons and eliminate the 
Senate.  We should argue and put the case forward for more 
democracy for the members of parliament who are elected to 
represent constituents in this very important Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should, for example, have a forced representation system to 
empower Canadians to elect as many individuals as they see fit. 
Whether they vote for the NDP, the Bloc, the Reform Party, the 
Liberal or the Conservative Party, their vote would count. 
Therefore, on a percentage basis, if the Conservative Party got 
20% of the votes it would get 20% of the seats in the House of 
Commons.  The same would go for the NDP, the Bloc, the Reform 
Party and the Liberal Party.  This means that Canadians would 
have a vote that counted as opposed to the vote they now have 
where, in many ridings, they cast a ballot for candidates in 
political parties that do not get elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also move to more free votes in the House of Commons. 
This would empower members of parliament.  Committees would be a 
little more worthwhile and a little more important if we gave 
members of parliament a little more authority in committees. If 
we made committees more democratic they could actually look at 
reviewing the thousands of appointments made by the Liberal 
government every week and month.  They could make sure that 
appointments were reasonable and fair and that the people who 
were appointed were fairly competent, as opposed to the many 
cases where they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final check and balance we need once the Senate is gone is 
to have less power in the Prime Minister's office.  Let us share 
the power with some of the cabinet members and some of the 
members of parliament like they do in other countries through the 
proportional representation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell a story that I think is very important.  If we 
were to have two elected bodies at the federal level, including 
an elected Senate that the Reform Party is always pushing for to 
spend more money on government and politics, the result would be 
gridlock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour and the occasion to meet Bob Dole's campaign 
manager.  Bob Dole ran for president of the United States four 
years ago.  His campaign manager told me that he admires the 
Canadian democratic process because in the House of Commons the 
government is accountable every day to the opposition which is 
elected by other Canadians.  He said that what they have in the 
states is total gridlock.  He told me that he was withdrawing 
from the political process because all they have are very wealthy 
individuals getting elected to congress and the senate, who are 
looked after in terms of their priorities and their time by the 
12,000 registered lobbyists in Washington.  He said that only the 
wealthy had access to their politicians. 
They are not accountable every day as we are in this House.  We 
may not like the answers we get in question period, we may not 
like the things the government says from time to time, but the 
importance is that we have a democratic process in this country 
that with the House of Commons alone, if it was empowered in 
terms of more Canadians becoming involved, empowered because we 
would have more individual influence on committees, on free votes 
and so on, we have a very democratic process here.

support the abolition of the Senate, as I and all other members 
of the NDP do, I am not sure we will able to support the motion, 
although individually some might.  However, I really believe that 
spending extra money on the Senate at this time is throwing good 
money after bad.  We should try to husband our resources like 
they are our resources, as opposed to the ministers' and the 
Prime Minister's money.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to the private member's motion, Motion No. 98. 
I find it rather disturbing, with all the serious problems facing 
Canadians throughout the country, that the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton would choose to introduce a motion calling for 
the introduction of television cameras in the Senate to cover 
Senate proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened closely to the debate this evening and two words 
keep coming to mind to describe it.  Those two words are 
gratuitous frivolity.  I have to question why we are debating 
having television cameras in the Senate at all. It is obviously 
not a point for the House of Commons to debate. It is a question 
for the Senate to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Quebec Est discussed, at some length this 
evening, the attendance of Senate members.  We never refer to the 
attendance of members of the House of Commons.  It is against the 
rules to refer to the attendance of members of the House of 
Commons, yet we stood here and talked about the attendance of 
members of the Senate of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, Mr. Speaker—and I am saying this very 
carefully trying to stay within the rules—that any member who 
introduces any bill, private member's bill or other bills, in the 
House should stay for the full and complete debate of that bill. 
I think that would be following parliamentary procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton who 
proposed the motion has been openly critical of our Senate.  He 
has certainly voiced his opinion on this subject through a number 
of mediums.  Now he wants to use the time allotted for Private 
Members' Business to once again address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major changes to the Senate, as all Canadians know, whether we 
are talking about the abolition of the Senate or the introduction 
of an elected Senate, will require constitutional change.  I am 
convinced that Canadians do not have the patience for renewed 
constitutional discussions.  Remember, we are not that far 
removed from the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. 
Minor changes to the Senate, such as TV cameras, must come from 
the Senate, not from the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Confederation there has been a certain decorum that has 
been strictly adhered to by the upper and lower Houses.  The 
House of Commons governs the way we operate just as the upper 
chamber governs itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there have been many disagreements among members of 
both chambers, there has, nevertheless, been a sense of mutual 
respect for each other's role in our confederation.  Both Houses 
have their own important role to play in our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sarnia—Lambton appears to want to infringe upon 
the responsibility of the upper chamber.  He wants to impose his 
views on how the business of the upper chamber should be managed 
and reported to the Canadian public.  We may or may not agree 
with his opinion on TV cameras.  Really, that is a moot point. It 
really does not make any difference.  It is not up to us to 
decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure his intentions are honourable.  Perhaps he believes 
there is not a role for the Senate in the Canadian confederation, 
that it is a waste of money.  Perhaps he believes we should have 
a cameral versus a bicameral system of government.  To make this 
point he introduced a motion that would see the government invest 
significant amounts of money to televise Senate debates.  This 
little gamesmanship is being played at the expense of the 
Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we rise in the House it costs Canadians money.  Why 
is the member for Sarnia—Lambton not focusing on some of the 
major problems that we have in the House of Commons rather than 
going on a tangent about the upper chamber?  Would we not think 
that after witnessing the terrible debacle that was orchestrated 
by his government over the past three weeks that he would be 
looking to make significant changes in the House of Commons and 
leave the Senate be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Department of Human Resources Development being 
involved in the greatest example of government mismanagement in 
the history of Canada, we would think that the member would be 
pushing his government colleagues to provide Canadians with 
answers to how $1 billion in government mismanagement was allowed 
to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is he not pushing for changes within the House of Commons 
and, more specifically, question period?  Right now question 
period is simply that, questions.  We ask the questions of the 
government and it either chooses to ignore them completely or it 
answers something that is totally irrelevant to what was asked in 
the first place.  Why is the member not pushing to change 
question period into question and answer period, whereby the 
government would be forced to answer the questions that are being 
put to it?  Would that not be a novel idea? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past three weeks the acting Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the real minister in charge, the hon. Prime 
Minister, have consistently ignored, sidestepped or made light of 
very serious questions and accusations.  Actual answers to the 
questions have been at a premium.  The government—particularly 
these two individuals—believes that it can simply throw Canadian 
taxpayers' money into the wind and not have to be held to 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe that Canadians do care how their hard-earned 
tax dollars are being spent.  I firmly believe that the 
government has the duty to tell them.  The government's smoke and 
mirror answers will eventually catch up to it and it will be held 
accountable for its actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons and the upper chamber are filled with 
tradition.  One of these traditions is that we respect each 
other's role in confederation and do not go about telling one 
side or the other how to run its business.  In short, each House 
governs its own processes within our bicameral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I remember correctly, another longstanding tradition in 
government has been maintaining the contents of the government's 
budget secret.  Think about it.  We have a budget coming down and 
the budget is secret.  Nobody knows what is in the budget.  Nobody 
has a clue what the finance minister is about to deliver to the 
House of Commons and, therefore, through the House of Commons to 
the people of Canada.  Nobody has any idea what is in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is necessarily correct.  I think we do have 
some idea.  Has it not become a joke the way the finance 
department has been leaking contents of the budget to the media 
in recent weeks?  It is a wonder if anything will be left to 
announce come budget day.  It will just be another day in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no surprise that Canadians have been made privy to some of 
the details of the finance minister's budget.  The government has 
been desperately trying to deflect attention away from the 
embattled Minister of Human Resources Development.  The 
government hopes that by spreading a little good news here and a 
little good news there that the Canadian taxpayer will somehow 
overlook a $1 billion discrepancy.  The sheer amount of leaked 
information coming out of the finance department simply 
highlights the extent to which the Liberal government is 
concerned about the damage it has done by the HRDC fiasco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few other issues I want to raise.  There are other 
important issues that we should be debating in the House of 
Commons. 
One of them is the HRDC debacle.  The other one is the September 
17 Donald Marshall Jr. decision made by the Supreme Court of 
Canada and the way the government has handled that decision.  It 
is deplorable.

I fail to see the relevance of what the member is saying.  We are 
here to debate Motion No. 98, having to do with the televising of 
debates in the Senate.  Is what he is saying relevant to the 
debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I have been 
following the member's remarks.  From time to time it has been a 
stretch.  There are other issues which, in the opinion of the 
member, are points of debate which he feels could be more 
relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are many relevant 
items that need to be debated.  There is the Atlantic fishery. 
There are serious problems in our farming communities.  Sixty 
thousand farmers in western Canada are facing bankruptcy.  High 
diesel prices are forcing our truckers off the market and out of 
business, which will raise the cost of living and the cost of 
doing business in Canada.  We have a 15% tax on diesel fuel.  The 
government brings in nearly $4 billion a year and spends $150 
million of that $4 billion on highways.  Where has the rest of it 
gone?  Who is it benefiting?  Why do we have truckers going 
bankrupt in Canada?  We cannot move goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of issues which need to be debated in the 
House.  There are a a number of issues which need to be brought 
to parliament to be debated by all parties, by all members, but 
this is not one of them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank everyone who has spoken, even the member from the 
fifth party, who, in my opinion, gave a very spirited speech 
which displayed why he is a member of the fifth party.  He has 
made a very convincing argument about why this is the last place 
we can argue about the relevance of parliament.  That is a very 
interesting perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also interesting that a party which some would suggest 
has had chemical traces in the public opinion polls would want to 
defend that 45% of the Senate of Canada which it holds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the speaker from the fifth party for convincing 
me, and I hope others watching, that the fifth party does not get 
enough floor time to speak in this place and that it has shown 
very clearly why its members are having problems following the 
national agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the point of order made by the parliamentary 
secretary because there is something called relevance in this 
place.  Indeed, there is something called relevance in politics. 
That party has clearly shown tonight why it might be deemed to be 
irrelevant at the ballot box. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from a book written by a former occupant of the 
other place, Phillipe Gigantes.  He wrote a book called <I>Thin 
Book:  Reforming the Senate</I>.  In his opinion “The evolution 
of the Senate as a more effective institution will be slow and 
will require changes in attitude from current senators and the 
House of Commons”—and I am sorry to reveal that to the fifth 
party—“but will be worth it.  If we do not attempt to reform 
the Senate it will be abolished.  If we persist in failing to 
address the shortcomings of the Senate there will come a time 
when it becomes impossible to justify its existence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a former occupant of the other place who said, 
notwithstanding what the fifth party says, that it must be done 
from within the House of Commons and the other place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never pretended to advocate anything but the abolition of 
the Senate.  However, on the issue of Senate TV, I think that 
former Senator Gigantes and other like-minded occupants and 
former occupants of the other place can make common cause with me 
in the effort to have the other place televised. With this in 
mind the televised broadcasting of all Senate proceedings could 
accomplish the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could give Canadians the opportunity to judge for themselves 
whether they are getting their money's worth.  They pay about $60 
million to shore up the other place and keep it going.  Are they 
getting their money's worth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The occupants of the other place would no longer work in 
relative obscurity such as those members in this place who are in 
parties which do not get a lot of time to speak.  In fact, I 
would be very surprised if the average Canadian could identify 
one occupant of the other place. If Senate proceedings were open 
to television cameras, a consensus might finally emerge on the 
issue of the Senate itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the year 2000 the occupants of the other place can no longer 
hide behind the curtains and maintain the quality of their 
debates is higher.  They say that the quality of their debates is 
higher in the absence of television coverage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am absolutely shocked that members of the fifth party in this 
place would use the House of Commons to defend the approximately 
48 members in the other place who are there, who are not 
accountable and some of whom were given 35 years of uninterrupted 
service to this country by their former leader.  I find it 
shocking that they would try to defend that in this place.  This 
is a place of debate and they do not want to debate it and that 
is that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The new millennium offered Canada an opportunity to start a new 
approach to resource development across this great country. We 
have a responsibility to learn from the mistakes in the last 
century so we do not repeat them in the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a duty to involve and respect the people's views and 
recommendations to resource management issues.  This includes the 
extraction of resources and the crown's responsibility under the

</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians it is our duty to represent the best 
interests of Canadians and to ensure that our decisions today do 
not harm the generations that will follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to the attention of the House that there are serious 
problems associated with the proposed Diavik diamond mine in the 
Northwest Territories.  A multibillion dollar fiasco is unfolding 
in Canada's north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Diavik project is an important step toward providing jobs 
and self-sufficiency for northerners.  Northwest Territories 
proponents stated in an open letter to the Prime Minister that 
the 20 year project could create $1 billion in federal corporate 
taxes, $600 million in federal royalties and $500 million in 
territorial corporate taxes. This $2.1 billion is in addition to 
the $1.3 billion construction investment.  The total is $4.3 
billion and most important, 400 permanent jobs will be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal government mismanagement and a disregard for a proper 
environmental assessment process have placed this project and the 
crown's integrity at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1999 the environment minister was presented with 
serious concerns from the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact 
Review Board.  The highlights included: abandonment and 
restoration of the Diavik diamonds project was not considered in 
the comprehensive study report; the environmental impact of loss 
of wilderness as a social value was not assessed; the cumulative 
effects of nearby mine operations were not addressed, a specific 
promise made by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment minister decided to ignore the first major 
challenge by the Mackenzie Valley board to ensure proper resource 
procedures were followed. 
His decision placed little assurance on future northern 
development and community concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also chose to make his announcement while out of 
the country and not subject to direct questions or accountability 
for his actions.  Thankfully the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development showed courage and called for specific 
recommendations to be met before land use permits would be 
issued, thankfully because a dramatic demonstration in federation 
incompetence soon followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territories Water Board discovered during routine 
proceedings that the tailings liners, a plastic and cement 
material crucial for protecting the environment, did not work in 
cold conditions.  How could a federal environment minister 
approve a project when key project components failed?  More 
remarkable, CBC North footage which aired on February 11 showed 
that work had begun on the site without permits.  Shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars 
in northern mine site cleanups, and with northern regions of 
Canada pleading for sustainable development that does not destroy 
the land and traditional land use, when will the Liberal 
government put competence and respect ahead of arrogance and 
neglect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the parliamentary secretary's response, 
although I do not expect specific details as the Diavik project 
is under federal investigation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to questions by 
hon. colleagues from Churchill River and Yukon on the Diavik 
mines project, let me say that the government's actions are 
completely consistent with the commitments outlined in the Speech 
from the Throne.  We in the government continue to set tough 
environmental standards across Canada.  We are taking steps that 
will continue to protect the northern environment and safeguard 
the long term interest of Canadians who live in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comprehensive study process for the Diavik diamonds project 
was the most detailed comprehensive study review that has taken 
place under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act so far. The 
Government of Canada spent more than 18 months working on the 
assessment of this project.  Public consultation was extensive 
with more than 300 meetings, workshops and technical discussions 
conducted in affected communities throughout NWT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than three-quarters of a million dollars was provided to 
northern stakeholders to help them participate in the review 
process, a process that was open and inclusive and placed a high 
priority on public participation.  The minister heard from and 
took into account the concerns of aboriginal organizations, 
environmental groups, concerned citizens, as well as the 
Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comprehensive study report prepared by the departments of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Fisheries and Oceans, 
and Natural Resources reflects the tremendous amount of effort 
that has been invested in assessing the potential environmental 
impacts of this project.  The minister fully supports the 
conclusions of the comprehensive study prepared by these federal 
departments.  He is confident that with the implementation of the 
mitigation and monitoring measures set out in this report, the 
Diavik mines project is not likely to have significant adverse 
environmental affects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further demonstrate the government's resolve in protecting 
the northern environment, I draw my hon. colleague's attention to 
the additional commitments set out in the decision on this 
project.  These commitments include the implementation of a 
regional, cumulative effects management framework, establishing a 
monitoring program mechanism that will include aboriginal 
peoples, and the approval of a program to abandon and restore the 
mine site in a manner consistent with sustainable development. 
These commitments address concerns raised during the public 
consultation process, and they will contribute to further 
reducing the residual effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions demonstrate the government's environmental 
commitments, including the commitments set out in the Speech from

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
October I raised the issue of the terrible situation facing 
visible minorities in the federal public service.  I pointed out 
at the time that the Canadian Human Rights Commission noted that 
there was a decrease of 501 visible minorities in permanent 
public service jobs in 1998.  Of the 28 executive positions 
filled from outside the public service, a grand total of zero 
were visible minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responded by claiming that the government had been 
“working for years to increase the number of people of visible 
minorities working in the public service”.  It is now four 
months later, and we have still seen no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This month is Black History Month.  The Liberal government has 
taken no major concrete action this month or since its election 
to address the representation of blacks or other visible 
minorities within the federal public service. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In about one month from now I expect the task force on the 
participation of visible minorities in the federal public service 
to table its report with the President of the Treasury Board.  On 
behalf of all Canadians seeking fairness, justice and equity, I 
challenge the Liberal government to act quickly and with 
integrity when the report is tabled.  The report may very well 
call for specific quotas and targets to be met in the short and 
medium term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are legitimate concerns with quotas, I fear that the 
Liberal government has let racism and discrimination in the 
federal public service become so out of control that such short 
term measures are the only way to begin to address the extent of 
the crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appalled that the government has chosen to exclude those 
designated as permanent residents who are not Canadian citizens 
from the available rate established for visible minorities.  Our 
Canadian community includes visible minorities, many of whom are 
permanent residents but not yet Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is outrageous and inexcusable that the Liberal government 
treats these people as statistical pawns in an ill fated effort 
to make the numbers look better.  The Liberal government can also 
take action to improve the current accountability mechanisms used 
by departments with respect to staffing and equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Canadian Human Rights Commission does very good work, 
it should not fall upon it to undertake employment equity audits 
or complaints investigations.  Surely simple logic would suggest 
that the government has an obligation to people of colour and to 
all Canadians to ensure there is accountability that works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountability mechanisms must ensure that non-complying 
departments and agencies can be dealt with and forced to comply. 
Will the government also ensure that the increasing number of 
hirings done through acting appointments and secondments are 
subjected to the same scrutiny and considered part of the 
analysis of hiring shares which are used by the government to 
determine participation rates from various sectors of society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also encourage the Liberal government to no longer hide from 
the issue of the participation of visible minority women.  I 
challenge the government to develop concrete plans out in full 
view of the public to increase the participation of visible 
minority women in non-traditional occupations.  Is the government 
even aware that the proportion of visible minority members 
entering the female dominated administrative support category is 
at 40%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, should the Liberal government finally agree to meet 
the challenge posed by racism and discrimination in the public 
service by actually coming forward with a plan, I encourage the 
government to work closely with its elected employee 
representatives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in 
response to the question posed by the hon. member for Halifax 
West.  This is an issue that has been near and dear to my heart 
in all my life and in all my career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the President of the Treasury Board has already pointed out, 
the government is working to increase the number of people in a 
visible minority in the federal public service.  It is important 
to recognize that during fiscal year 1998—99 there were a total 
of 14,338 indeterminate departures from the federal public 
service, of which 3.7% were visible minority employees.  During 
the same period we recruited 2,533 new indeterminate employees, 
of which 6.9% were persons in a visible minority.  While we 
recognize that 6.9% does not meet the labour market availability 
of 8.7%, we are continuing to make progress toward a 
representative public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During fiscal year 1998—99, 38 executives were hired from 
outside the public service, of which 10.5% were persons in a 
visible minority.  We are demonstrating our commitment to 
increased representation of persons in a visible minority in the 
executive ranks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A task force on the participation of visible minorities in the 
federal public service was established in April last year, as the 
member opposite recognized.  The task force is examining the 
situation of visible minorities, building on previous studies and 
developing a government-wide action plan with concrete strategies 
to address the issues and improvement of the situation of visible 
minorities in the federal public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect the action plan, as the member recognized, to come in 
the coming months.  The government is committed to making the 
Public Service of Canada better reflect the diversity, the 
strength and the growth of the Canadian society.  I join the 
member opposite in encouraging the President of the Treasury 
Board and all hon. members, in making their suggestions for 
concrete action, to come forward and see that plan implemented. 
It is important for all Canadians.
