avoid unreasonable increases which affect the cost of living and 
depress business activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will facilitate reasonable consistency in prices from 
province to province, allowing for production and distribution 
costs.

pricing and will prevent dominant suppliers from setting 
unreasonable prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill links the issue of price control to competition.  Any 
investigation of an alleged offence under the Competition Act 
which is related to gasoline pricing will be remitted by the 
competition tribunal to the commission for investigation, and the 
commission will report to the tribunal before it makes a 
determination or order on the matter.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK14">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill C-36, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 24, 1998, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few 
moments to speak on behalf of the government in support of Bill 
C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation contains some very important provisions 
that will help build a strong economy and a strong society, goals 
which this government has pursued since coming to office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have pursued these goals first and foremost by getting our 
fiscal house in order.  The federal books will be balanced this 
year for the first time since 1970 and we will balance the budget 
next year and the year after that for the first time in almost 50 
years.  It will be the first time in almost 50 years that 
Canadians will see three consecutive balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitment to fiscal responsibility, to putting an end to 
credit card government, does not end there.  We will reduce 
Canada's debt burden through a two-front strategy of stronger 
economic growth and a concrete debt repayment plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we will do is take the same approach to the debt that we 
have successfully used against the deficit since 1993.  We took 
the deficit down step by step.  The same incremental approach 
will, year by year, steadily reduce the debt burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to keep the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward 
slide using a two-track strategy, a strategy of supporting 
economic growth and reducing the actual level of the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that we will continue to present fiscal plans based 
on prudent economic planning assumptions.  Let me say that most 
budgets fail because they are based on overly optimistic 
assumptions.  The consequence is severe.  It is lost credibility. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to prudent planning assumptions we will continue to 
build our plans on a substantial contingency reserve of $3 
billion a year.  This is designed to handle unexpected events and 
to provide greater certainty that we will meet our balanced 
budget targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the contingency reserve is not needed, and in fact 
it has not been needed in each of the past three years, it will 
go directly to paying down the overall stock of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do we expect this prudent approach to budget planning to 
take us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We project that by 1999-2000 the debt to GDP ratio, by our 
comprehensive Canadian measurements, will have fallen almost 10 
percentage points from its peak of almost 72% of GDP in 1995-96. 
If we use the measurement which most other countries use, that 
being the debt held by the public, Canadians' market debt to GDP 
ratio will fall from a peak of almost 59% in 1995-96 to 48.5% by 
the year 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development is forecasting that between 1997 and 1999 Canada will 
have the largest decline in debt burden among the G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we must ensure the continuing decline of the debt, we also 
recognize that the tax burden on Canadians is too high and has to 
be reduced.  That is why we have introduced targeted tax relief 
measures in each of our previous budgets.  For now these measures 
are modest because the so-called fiscal dividend that makes them 
possible is still modest.  But even so, 90% of all taxpayers will 
get some degree of personal income tax relief from our recent 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 400,000 low income Canadians will be taken off the tax 
rolls entirely.  As our financial resources permit we will 
broaden tax relief in future budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, some would argue that the dividends should go only to 
reducing debt and cutting taxes.  In my view this would be 
shortsighted and, quite frankly, bad economics.  We recognize 
that the private sector is the engine of job creation, but 
government too has a responsibility to provide leadership in the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet that responsibility we are putting the fiscal dividend 
to work by increasing our investments in access to education, in 
skills development, in low income families with children and in 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in last month's budget we unveiled the Canadian 
opportunities strategy.  It is a co-ordinated set of measures to 
provide Canadians with enhanced access to knowledge, knowledge 
and skills for jobs that can deliver a better standard of living 
for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Bill C-36 implements some very important elements of 
this strategy.  For example, it establishes the Canadian 
millennium scholarship foundation.  This arm's length foundation 
with an initial endowment of $2.5 billion will award more than 
100,000 scholarships each year over 10 years to full and part 
time students across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scholarships will increase access to post-secondary education 
for low and middle income Canadians to prepare them for the jobs 
and knowledge based economy of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister of finance said in the 1998 budget speech, 
“This investment in the future of our country is the result of 
our successful battle against the deficit.  It is an investment 
that will pay for itself over and over again in the years 
ahead”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada millennium scholarships are, in effect, the largest 
single investment ever made by a federal government to support 
access to post-secondary education for all Canadians.  They will 
be awarded to individuals who need help financing their studies 
and who demonstrate merit.  For full time student scholarships 
will average $3,000 a year.  Individuals will be able to receive 
up to $15,000 over a maximum of four academic years of 
undergraduate study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that a student receiving a $3,000 scholarship 
for four years will in fact see his or her student debt load cut 
by $12,000, about half of what it otherwise could have been.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These scholarships are not just for young Canadians at 
university.  Canadians of all ages studying full or part time in 
publicly funded universities, community colleges, vocational and 
technical institutes, and cégeps will be eligible. Awards will 
help recipients to study away from home, particularly outside 
their home province.  They will also support limited terms of 
studies in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Student debt has become a heavy burden for many Canadians.  In 
1990 a graduate completing four years of post-secondary education 
faced an average student debt load of about $13,000.  By next 
year the same graduate's average debt will almost double to 
$25,000. At the beginning of this decade less than 8% of student 
borrowers had debts larger than $15,000; now almost 40% do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December federal and provincial first ministers agreed that 
something must be done to reduce the financial burden on 
students.  They asked the federal government to take action in 
the 1998 budget and we have.  Bill C-36 will put in place a 
number of provisions that will help individuals manage their 
student debt loads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are increasing the income threshold used to qualify 
for interest relief on Canada student loans by 9%.  What that 
means is that more graduates will be eligible for interest 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we are introducing graduated interest relief which will 
extend assistance to more graduates further up the income scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, for individuals who have used 30 months of interest 
relief, we will ask the lending institutions to extend the loan 
repayment period to 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, if after extending the repayment period to 15 years a 
borrower remains in financial difficulty, there will be an 
extended interest relief period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, for the minority of graduates who still remain in 
financial difficulties after taking advantage of these relief 
measures, we will reduce their student loan principal by as much 
as half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together these new interest relief measures will help up to 
100,000 more borrowers.  Over 12,000 borrowers a year will 
benefit from the debt reduction when this measure is fully phased 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any long range plan to acquire knowledge and skills for the 21st 
century must look ahead to the students of tomorrow.  The best 
way to help to ensure children's futures is to save for education 
today.  We want to establish a new partnership to help parents 
save for their children's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 introduces the Canada education savings grant.  What 
it does is it makes registered education savings plans even more 
attractive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning January 1, 1998 we will provide a grant of 20% on the 
first $2,000 in annual RESP contributions for children up to age 
18.  That is $400 of grant money per child that would go directly 
into an RESP program. With the introduction of this new grant, 
RESPs will now be among the most attractive savings vehicles 
available to Canadians for their children's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 also contains measures for the Canadian opportunities 
strategy to help address the urgent problem of youth 
unemployment. In this bill we propose to provide employers with 
an employment insurance premium holiday for hiring additional 
young Canadians.  Canadian employers who hire young Canadians 
between the ages of 18 and 24 in 1999 and 2000 will be allowed to 
take advantage of a premium holiday in employment insurance. 
This will increase employment opportunities for youth and reduce 
payroll costs for employers by about $100 million over the next 
two years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the role of education is very important in ensuring 
equality of opportunity, the capacity to learn does not begin in 
school.  It begins at home and depends on the nurturing and 
caring provided to the smallest infant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why over the past year federal, provincial and 
territorial governments have begun to build a national child 
benefit system that will help fight child poverty so as to 
provide a good start in life for all Canadians. To build the 
system the 1997 federal budget allocated $850 million to create 
an enriched and simplified Canada child tax benefit.  Bill C-36 
implements this commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new benefit commences in July and provides $1,625 for the 
first child and $1,425 for all other children to all families 
with incomes up to $21,000.  In the future legislation will be 
brought forward to implement the commitment in the 1998 budget to 
further enrich the child tax benefit by an additional $850 
million.  The federal government will announce details of this 
enrichment after discussions with provincial and territorial 
partners and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy and the child tax benefit 
provide diverse and comprehensive assistance to Canadians. These 
initiatives will help Canadians acquire the knowledge and skills 
they need for better jobs and a better life in the 21st century. 
By expanding access to opportunity we are building a stronger 
economy and a more secure society.  I urge all members in this 
House to support Bill C-36 in moving us forward to implement key 
elements of our strategy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure today to rise and lay out why I and the Reform 
Party stand in opposition to Bill C-36, the budget implementation 
act. I will start by giving the House an overview of the three 
big reasons why Reformers stand opposed to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason is that there is simply no overarching plan 
that really defines the roles and limits of government in this 
bill or in fact in any of the previous legislation we have seen 
from the government and which really establishes what the 
relationship is between government and its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that there is simply no solid plan to pay 
down the debt in this bill.  Canadians have spoken with one voice 
from across the country and have said that paying down the debt 
is their number one priority.  We see nothing that addresses that 
need in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally there is no net tax relief in this legislation.  I ask 
my friends across the way to note that I used the word net. While 
government members would have Canadians across the country 
believe that they are going to be better off after this budget, 
Canadians will pay more in taxes this year than they paid last 
year as a result of Liberal government tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask people to consider those as the reasons for our opposition 
to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make my point by speaking in the form of a metaphor. 
Taxpayers are like the goose that laid the golden egg.  In fact 
you could say they are like the flock of geese which keep laying 
golden eggs.  Over the last many years we have seen Ottawa run 
around and scoop up those golden eggs as quickly as they are 
laid. In some cases the government uses them to run essential 
programs and we are grateful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Canada value some of the programs they get from 
government.  They want a strong health care system.  All members 
acknowledge that.  They want a system that ensures they can get a 
decent education. 
They want a system that will provide vital essential services 
like national defence, foreign affairs and criminal justice. 
People do not begrudge for a second having to see the golden eggs 
that they produce go toward those types of programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that much of what taxpayers produce in the form of 
revenue or golden eggs for the government is used for things that 
are simply not essential.  The best example of that is the 
interest we have to pay on our debt today as a result of previous 
governments that have lived far too high on the hog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers are producing these golden eggs to the tune of about 
$45 billion a year just to pay the interest on the debt. The way 
it works out is that the average taxpayer in Canada today pays 
over $21,000 in federal taxes.  Roughly a third of that, $6,000, 
goes to pay the interest on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that these geese are laying a lot of golden eggs 
currently and Ottawa is scooping up the huge majority of them. 
Ottawa scoops up at least half of all the income of the average 
Canadian today.  That is a tremendous amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we think that these geese who are laying these 
golden eggs are feeling more than a little bit abused.  They do 
not mind seeing the government take its fair share of these 
golden eggs, but they get a little incensed when they see the 
government eyeing their golden nest egg. That is exactly what is 
happening today in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact members should know that according to the 
Fraser Institute, since this government came to power in 1993 we 
have seen disposable incomes fall by $3,000 for the average 
family of four.  We know that in Canada today we have virtually a 
negative savings rate.  In other words people are having to dip 
into their savings to pay their taxes so that the government can 
spend more money on all kinds of inane things. Sadly that has 
been the case for a long, long time. When those sorts of things 
happen, there are real consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is that we see these Canadian taxpayers, these 
geese who are laying these golden eggs, looking to the south. 
They are starting to say “We are Canadian geese.  We do not want 
to go south, but unfortunately we are being forced to consider 
that option because we have mouths to feed”.  They have all 
these goslings that have to be looked after.  They have to feed 
the people they are responsible for.  They are starting to cast 
about for other alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We point to the Nesbitt Burns study which came out not long ago. 
It showed that many professionals are fleeing this country for 
better opportunities south of the border and in other parts of 
the world.  That study points out that although there are a few 
engineers coming in from other parts of the world, there are a 
whole lot more engineers disappearing from this country and going 
to places like the United States where they have a far better tax 
environment and more opportunity as well.  Taxes are lower and 
there are more jobs in their field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the same thing happening with people with skills in the 
high tech industries, computer scientists for instance.  We also 
see the same thing with respect to the medical profession with 
both doctors and nurses.  They are fleeing in droves.  I know 
that my friends in the House, especially those from smaller 
centres, will acknowledge that there is not a doctor in the 
country who does not regularly get offers from American 
hospitals.  Many of them ultimately end up going.  As a result 
this country has a shortage of physicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence the situation today is people are being 
educated in Canadian universities at a tremendous cost to the 
Canadian taxpayers.  Then we see them quickly leave to go to 
other jurisdictions around the world because there just is not 
the opportunity here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example is British Columbia.  British Columbia today 
has the highest taxes in all of North America.  We can thank the 
provincial NDP government for that, but all of the blame does not 
lie there. 
We also have to point a finger at the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today we have the highest personal income taxes of any 
country in the G-7, not by a little but by over 50%.  Our income 
taxes are 56% higher than the G-7 average.  Is it any wonder that 
British Columbia today is entering a recession?  It has gone from 
being the fastest growing economy in Canada to being 10th out of 
10 provinces and 2 territories.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way still continue to fire this tired 
rhetoric about the need to invest.  That is fine.  We understand 
the need to invest.  However, if one is investing in education 
only to see the people who benefit from that education flee the 
country in terror at the prospect of having to pay taxes that are 
staggering compared to anywhere else in the world, does it make 
any sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about a balanced approach.  Let us have a 
balanced approach but let it be an approach where we see taxes 
starting to fall in a meaningful way so that we can remain 
competitive with people in the United States, the U.K, Japan and 
other countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I pointed out to the House that we have members in 
this place who have seen family members leave for other countries 
to make a living.  When I talk about this I should also point out 
that it is not necessarily just for lower taxes that they leave. 
An added incentive is that lower taxes create more jobs and 
better paying jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the United States which has 4.8% unemployment does not 
have to worry about three people chasing every one job.  Three 
jobs are chasing every one person.  It is the complete reverse to 
Canada.  As a result, wages are much higher, so people can go 
down to the United States and essentially command whatever price 
they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently read in the newspapers the story of Waterloo 
university.  A third of the graduating class disappeared to the 
United States because Microsoft made them an offer they could not 
refuse.  I was talking to a gentleman who is on the board of 
directors of Waterloo university.  He raised this issue with me 
as a serious consideration.  The budget has done nothing to 
address that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friends across the way will talk about the tax relief 
in the budget.  In fact, an hon. member at the beginning of my 
speech yelled across the way what about the tax relief in the 
budget.   It is fair he raised that, but I think it is also fair 
for me to point out that Canadians have come out behind as a 
result of the government's actions since the beginning of the 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain.  It is true that the government will lay out 
about $7 billion in tax reductions over the next three years. 
However, what my friend across the way would have us forget is 
that on January 1 the government produced the biggest tax hike in 
Canadian history, a tax hike that will see CPP premiums rise by 
73%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my friend across the way would also have us forget is that 
every year as a result of deindexation of the income tax system 
we now have an automatic tax increase called bracket creep that 
pushes different people in different income groups into higher 
tax brackets as a result of the impact of inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in this current year alone the impact of bracket 
creep will bring in just over $1 billion in new revenues for the 
government, wiping out the $880 million the government is to give 
people in tax relief.  People are behind. My friends may call 
that progress but it is a perverted view of progress.  We are 
going backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder we have colleagues in this place who have 
children fleeing Canada as economic refugees and going to other 
parts of the world.  Yesterday I referred to the member for Red 
Deer who has three children all living in different parts of the 
world because they went where the opportunities were best.  What 
can they do?  Are they to work in some minimum wage job simply so 
they can remain in Canada?  They cannot do that.  They need to 
pursue opportunity wherever it is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Red Deer has a son who is now teaching at 
Princeton.  He is a Rhodes scholar but he could not get a 
position at a Canadian university so he is teaching at Princeton. 
What is going on with this country?   He has two daughters.  One 
is in Norway and one is in the Netherlands.  They had to leave to 
pursue opportunity.  I point to my colleague from Calgary 
Southeast who has family members spread out all over the world 
because that is the only place they could find jobs to meet their 
skill levels.  We have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine for the finance minister to focus on education and 
for the parliamentary secretary to wax eloquent about what the 
government is doing for education.  On the other hand they do not 
talk about what people do after they get that education. The 
millennium scholarship fund will end up being a subsidy to 
Microsoft.  It will end up being a subsidy to big American 
corporations that scoop up those people who then go to the United 
States and other countries around the world.  What about the 
balanced approach?  Why has the government not addressed this 
problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking a minute ago about British Columbia and I want to 
continue down that same path.  As I mentioned, British Columbia 
is now in a recession.  The government was patting itself on the 
back during the Liberal convention on the weekend, just about 
dislocating its shoulders.  It was patting itself on the backs 
for the wonderful job it has done with the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals forget that big chunks of the country are in 
serious trouble.   Atlantic Canada is certainly in trouble with 
double digit unemployment.  The fishery is dead.  In many parts 
of the country there are no prospects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia both the NDP government at the provincial 
level and the federal government did what they could to kill the 
economy of one of the shining lights of the country.  I point to 
a specific example of how that impacts on people.  I could point 
to a number of examples from B.C. but I want to point to a recent 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just received a fax that was actually sent to another member 
of Parliament, the member for Edmonton North, by a lady from Port 
Moody, B.C.   Members may have heard that a byelection is being 
held in Port Moody—Coquitlam, so it is interesting we would get 
this fax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lady is complaining about the amount of tax she has to pay. 
She enclosed photocopies of two cheques she sent to the 
Receiver General for Canada.  At the bottom of the fax it says 
“taxes paid in instalments during the year, $46,000, which 
represented 23% of a $200,000 profit.  The above two cheques are 
for profit exceeding the small business tax credit of $200,000, 
i.e. these amounts represent 55% of the profit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total amount of these cheques would be somewhere in the 
range of $98,000 which they have had to pay in taxes to the 
federal government.  That is a staggering amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder the job creating engine of the economy, small 
business, is staggering to create the jobs that are necessary? We 
still have an unemployment rate of 8.6%.  I know my friends 
across the way think that is good, but it is almost double the 
unemployment rate in the United States.   We are nowhere near our 
job creating potential.  I encourage my friends across the way to 
consider that small businesses, the real creators of employment 
in Canada, are staggering with the tax levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way have received visits from members of 
the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, one of my 
favourite organizations.  These people stand up for small 
business owners.  They stand up for people who are doing all the 
things that annoy Liberals.  They are hardworking, honest and pay 
their taxes.  They are complaining bitterly about high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government understand that $7 billion in tax 
relief against probably a $15 billion tax increase means people 
are coming out behind?  We cannot continue down this road.  It is 
killing jobs.  It is killing opportunity and is driving people 
from the country. 
This has to come to an end.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by asking my friends to look up to the relief on 
the wall just above the gallery.  They will see a word carved on 
the top of it.  The word is “tax” carved in stone.  How 
appropriate that in the House of Commons in Canada we have a 
shrine to taxes, but that is indeed the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the word “tax” we see a family sitting on a bench.  It 
looks as though it is a very gloomy looking family.  There is a 
mother, a father and a child.  They are sitting on the bench 
probably in the ante-room of the minister of finance or perhaps 
in Revenue Canada, waiting to find out the verdict after they 
have submitted their income tax for the year.  I guarantee they 
will be sorely disappointed.  We know in Canada today they would 
find out they owe half their income to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The symbolism of having that relief on the wall is interesting. 
It is the only tax relief we have in Canada today.  There it sits 
almost directly over the head of the finance minister and almost 
in direct alignment with the finance minister.  That symbolism 
speaks volumes.  It speaks more eloquently to our situation than 
I ever could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of interesting symbols just below that 
family.  One of them very appropriately is a serpent, a snake. 
Somehow to me that symbolizes the government's approach to 
dealing with taxpayers.  At the very bottom we see a whale.  I 
think we should take that to represent government which has 
become huge and consumes about 46% of the wealth of the economy 
every year.  The final figure is the man with the briefcase just 
on the right hand side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  The taxman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  The taxman.  The member for Peace 
River has correctly identified the taxman.  We see his briefcase 
bulging with proceeds he has taken from individual taxpayers 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage people to reflect upon this tax relief, the only tax 
relief we have, sitting above the head of the finance minister, 
and to consider the symbolism of that piece of work above the 
public gallery.  It speaks volumes about where the country is and 
perhaps even speaks to a perversity the government has in 
honouring taxes that I do not think should be honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude with the following amendment.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK18">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That all the words after the word “that” be deleted and the 
following substituted therefor: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-36, an act 
to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 24, 1998, since the principle of the bill, 
while charging the consolidated revenue fund to establish and 
fund the Canadian millennium scholarship foundation, fails to 
guarantee that appropriate and objective accounting standards 
will be followed as advocated by the auditor general. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There seems to be a hue and cry for 
questions and comments.  I should advise the House that on 40 
minute speeches, as this one was, there are no questions or 
comments.  I know it was shorter than 40 minutes but the rule is 
the rule.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals are having fun and we are wondering why. They should be 
working at meeting the needs of the public instead of making 
jokes as they always, or almost always, do when we deliver 
speeches on the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us Bill C-36 to implement certain provisions of 
the last budget tabled by the Minister of Finance. 
I am pleased to speak on these provisions and I would like, for 
openers, to define what we expect from this budget and which 
expectations have not been met through Bill C-36 before us, which 
implements certain provisions of the budget for 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few months ago and during the election campaign as well, 
we asked the Minister of Finance to pay special attention to 
actions that adversely affect the provinces. Since he tabled his 
first budget in 1994, the Minister of Finance has made cut after 
cut after cut in transfer payments for social assistance, 
postsecondary education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has cut back so dramatically that 52% of the success achieved 
in terms of balancing the budget and restoring health to the 
public finances has in fact been achieved through the sacrifices 
the provinces have had to make because of the drastic cuts made 
by the Minister of Finance. 
This means that 52% or most of the sacrifices were made by the 
provinces, which are really the ones who restored the public 
finances to health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore ask that the government take a very simple measure, 
which was proposed last year by Quebec Premier Bouchard and 
approved by all the premiers across Canada. 
The government was asked to use, over the next two fiscal years, 
that is to say 1998-99 and 1999-2000, 50% of the forecast surplus 
in tax points—the real surplus, not the one given in the Minister 
of Finance's budget, with its rounded down and close to 
falsified figures—to counteract the harm done to Quebec and to the 
rest of Canada, in the health sector for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A transfer of just 50% of the surplus in tax points, in an area 
that would become wholly provincial in the coming years, would be 
sufficient to remedy the increasingly irremediable harm the 
Minister of Finance has done to health, social assistance and 
higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance refused to respond.  He even refused to 
acknowledge that the provinces had inherited the entire 
responsibility for putting federal public finances in order. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, as well as in the months following 
it, we also called repeatedly upon the Minister of Finance to 
change the way he was handling employment insurance and the EI 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed three changes which reflected a consensus not only 
among Quebeckers, but among all Canadians, about the program and 
the way the fund made up of employer and employee contributions 
was being managed.  Let us not forget that the federal government 
has not put a red cent into the fund for years.  The employers 
and employees are the ones who contribute year in and year out to 
the surpluses. Because of the high rates that have been set, 
they are contributing to the huge surpluses the fund has 
generated, to the tune of $6 billion yearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore called for three things relating to the employment 
insurance fund.  First, that the Minister of Finance stop using 
the surplus to put his financial books in order.  The employment 
insurance fund is in place for two reasons: to support those who 
are without work, and to attempt to help them back into the work 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the Minister of Finance has been shamelessly pocketing 
the surplus, and continues to do so.  He has not met the 
expectations of the Bloc Quebecois.  He is still pocketing this 
$6 billion annually in order to build up a spectacular surplus 
and make himself look good as Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we called for a substantial reduction in EI premiums in 
order to boost job creation. The surplus in the EI fund did not 
just miraculously fall down from heaven. 
If there are surpluses, it is as a result of the excessive 
contributions employers and employees have to make.  This limits 
our job creation capacity.  In Quebec, Ontario, the west, 
British Columbia and in the maritimes, employers and 
entrepreneurs are saying so, and even unions are saying so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the Minister of Finance not reduced contribution 
rates substantially, as we asked, but he has kept them at an 
even higher rate.  We talked about an overall drop in 
contribution rates of $3 billion, half of the surplus in the 
employment insurance fund. 
The Minister of Finance gave us a few tens of millions of 
dollars in reductions, which has no significant impact on job 
creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third change we sought, which was not in the budget speech 
and is not in Bill C-36, is the creation of an independent fund 
with the employment insurance fund, independent of the 
government's general balance sheet, so that we may follow the 
progress of contributions, the size of the fund and the 
contributions made by employers and employees, and ensure that 
the fund is really managed appropriately for the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has also asked for this and he has received 
no response from the Minister of Finance in the budget or in Bill 
C-36, which implements some of its provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We called for a significant reduction in people's taxes. 
Some 52% of the results obtained in the effort to improve public 
funds are due to the provinces' efforts.  Bernard Landry and 
Lucien Bouchard in Quebec did the work there, to the tune of 52%, 
and not the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers' share in improving public funds in the past four years 
amounts to 37% of the total effort.  In other words, since the 
Minister of Finance has been in his position, since he has become 
a part time shipowner—sometimes he is full time, it depends on 
the bills he introduces—Quebec and Canadian taxpayers have paid 
over $30 billion more in taxes than they should have, had the 
Minister of Finance indexed the tax tables and made a targeted 
reduction in individual and SMB taxes, as we asked him to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, however, he preferred to keep taxes high.  These levels, 
together with the lack of changes in tax rules, to indexing, for 
example, have resulted in taxpayers paying $30 billion more in 
taxes than they should have.

This means that 32% of the budgetary effort is not the result of 
his own efforts, of his department's efforts, or of his 
innovative spirit—I would rather not talk about the minister's 
innovative spirit—but of the efforts made by the provinces and 
the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister's estimates had been based on the proper data— 
and we will get back to this later on—if the minister had shown 
the true picture in terms of expenditures and revenues, in terms 
of the surpluses generated over the years, he could have made a 
substantial effort to reduce personal and even corporate taxes, 
but he did not, even though it would have been desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister could have done even more to alleviate the burden 
of taxpayers and businesses if he had listened to us. For four 
years now, we have been telling him—with the figures to support 
our claim—that it is possible to reform Canada's individual and 
corporate tax system and to get rid of all the obsolete 
provisions that no longer meet the needs of our businesses—in 
the context of globalization and competitiveness—and of our 
families, given the current socioeconomic reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question we asked the Minister of Finance when we got 
here was when would a true tax reform take place to improve our 
system and increase our ability to reduce taxes and better manage 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made us wait. We waited for the first two years, 
since his inaction left us with no choice. But in the second year 
we told ourselves that if the Minister of Finance could not take 
his responsibilities, if he was not innovative enough to come up 
with a new way to collect taxes—that is to say a more efficient 
and beneficial way for society as a whole, and not just for the 
federal government—we would propose ways to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wrote over 300 pages of suggestions to reform personal and 
corporate taxes. When we tabled our document, the Minister of 
Finance said we had done a great job, a job that required 
incredible dedication. 
It is no laughing matter trying to clean up the Canadian 
taxation system, which has remained basically unchanged since the 
Carter Commission in the later 1960s.  It is not easy to pick 
your way through it and identify those measures that still serve 
a purpose as opposed to those that no longer serve any purpose at 
all, but which are costing Revenue Canada a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers must not forget that every time some person or some 
business somewhere does not pay taxes or avoids paying part of 
the taxes they would normally have had to pay, had it not been 
for some outdated tax loophole, which does nothing for society or 
the economy, but which is there because it has been almost or 
completely forgotten, or because the Minister of Finance lacked 
the resolve to do anything about it, it is the average taxpayer 
who makes up for what the business or rich individual should have 
paid but did not because of this loophole.  We have to remember 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the Minister of Finance had four years to undertake a 
complete overhaul of the taxation system.  He did nothing, and 
we see the results.  Over the last four years, taxpayers have 
paid $30 billion more in taxes, and the much-heralded cuts over 
the next three years pale in comparison to what could have been 
achieved, and in comparison to what has disappeared from 
taxpayers' pockets through the inertia and ineptitude of the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also asked the Minister of Finance something else—and he did 
not listen to us—and that was not to create new programs. He he 
turned a deaf ear and did as he pleased. 
He acted as though nobody existed but himself and created new 
programs with the assistance of his Prime Minister, who delights 
in leaving his symbolic mark on Canadian political history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went ahead and created a new program, one we detest, called 
the millennium scholarship fund.

shamelessly to boot, into an area of jurisdiction which 
generations and generations of politicians, generations of 
premiers as well, starting back in the 1960s with Jean Lesage, 
have jealously guarded as exclusive to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to philosopher Jacques Danton, a people's first need, 
after bread, is education.  Education is the backbone of the 
survival and progress of every nation.  Education gives us 
everything we need to understand.  It tells us where we come 
from, who we are, who we want to become.  Education is the basis 
of any people's survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understood this in Quebec years ago, and being federalist or 
sovereignist does not change it in the least.  When it comes down 
to it, every Quebecker is a nationalist.  When it comes down to 
it, every Quebecker wants his people to continue to survive, to 
progress, to expand as an international presence, to endure for 
as long as it is possible to imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the cornerstones of our longevity as a people, one of the 
cornerstones of our strength as a people, our economic strength 
as well as our cultural strength, the strength to which we owe 
our existence, is education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time the federal government has lifted a finger to interfere 
in education, or a federal political party or its leader has 
talked of education, of Canada-wide standards, of making our 
children take tests, we in Quebec have risen up in opposition. 
Even some federalists have joined forces with the sovereignists 
to point out how deeply rooted our belief in education as our 
prerogative is rooted, so deeply rooted in our convictions that 
we rise up in aggressive opposition as soon as actions are taken, 
or words spoken, that point to the possibility of federal 
intrusion into education in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund, the millennium scholarships, which are 
without a doubt the Prime Minister's idea of the way he can 
leave his mark on the verge of the 21st century, are totally 
unacceptable to us.  This is something we will fight against 
until our last breath. 
It raises a hue and cry in Quebec and will continue to do so in 
the coming months and years.  We will never agree to their 
investing in this field.  We will not let them put their foot in 
the door in order to gain more entry and to take the education 
sector away from the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec and make it 
either shared or the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never let anyone tell us Quebeckers, francophones most of 
us, what our children will have to learn in school or what they 
will be tested on in exams at the end of the year.  No one but 
ourselves will test their skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will use every means we have to block the implementation of 
the millennium scholarship fund and to ensure that what the 
Quebec premier, Lucien Bouchard, and minister of education 
Pauline Marois have called for comes to pass. 
They are calling for the withdrawal of the millennium 
scholarships, with full compensation for Quebec, given Quebec's 
exclusive jurisdiction over education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will repeat this demand ad nauseam.  We will also denounce ad 
nauseam in this House and elsewhere the claims of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter really energizes my colleagues in the Bloc and 
myself, because it symbolizes perfectly what we have always 
opposed in the federal government and what the Prime Minister has 
always presented as the centralizing claim of the federal 
government.  We will put all our energy into it and get into the 
thick of it to make sure that this so thoroughly detested program 
never makes it to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the way this intrusion into Quebec's exclusive 
jurisdiction was forced on us, but also the way it was 
presented, that obliges us to reject it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the Minister of Finance's accounting practices. 
For four years now—members can check <I>Hansard</I>—there were always 
questions about the Minister of Finance's dubious public 
accounting practices.  I am not alone, nor is my party, in having 
raised this problem of borderline accounting practices.  Two or 
three times, to my knowledge, the auditor general singled out the 
Minister of Finance because of his less than orthodox approach to 
accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention the example of the millennium fund because it comes up 
in Bill C-36 before us this morning. 
In the case of the millennium fund, from which initial grants to 
so-called deserving students will not be made until the year 
2000, the full amount of $2.5 billion has been posted to this 
fiscal year, that is, 1998-99, when—and I would like to repeat 
this—the first millennium scholarships will not be handed out 
until the year 2000.  Immediately this year, they slap down the 
cost of a program that will not be implemented until the year 
2000.  This makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no accounting rule by which one may honestly attribute 
to the current budget expenditures that will be made only in two 
years' time.  Once again, the auditor general criticized the 
finance minister's approach.  On leaving the House and reading 
the budget, we also criticized his way of doing things. 
This is not the first time, and we will return to this a little 
later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This method of accounting produces the following sort of 
nonsense.  On page 12 of the 1998 budget plan “Building Canada 
for the 21st Century”, incomplete data are used to show that the 
government's budgetary balance, in other words the deficit or 
surplus, will be 0.0 in 1997-98, 0.0 in 1998-99 and 0.0 in 
1999-2000.  This is partly due to the fact that the $2.5 billion 
of the millennium fund has been posted under this fiscal year, 
when payments will not actually be made until the year 2000. An 
actual surplus of $2.5 billion that could have been generated 
this year has already been removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for reasons of prevention that this amount has been set 
aside, because it will be spent in any event on items other than 
the millennium fund.  What it boils down to is that the Minister 
of Finance has gotten us used to his fiddling with the numbers. 
He is literally cooking the books, and we are not the only ones 
to say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day after the budget was tabled, all serious financial 
analysts—whether they are federalists or sovereignists—said it 
did not make any sense. There is a budget plan, but we do not 
really know where we stand, because of things like the $2.5 
billion for the millennium scholarship foundation which the 
government has already posted to this fiscal year. It is becoming 
impossible to make proper estimates. We can no longer say whether 
the expenditures and revenues indicated are appropriate, because 
the figures were fixed. The government made sure that, for every 
year, its expenditures would be more or less equal to its 
revenues, so as to arrive at a balanced budget. It is a shame to 
present things in this fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> It is all done with smoke and mirrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Precisely. This is unacceptable. This is an 
outrageous approach. 
The public expects some openness on the part of the Minister of 
Finance, who should present the true figures, the true situation, 
the true expenditures for this year, for next year and for three 
years down the road. The minister should not include in the 1998 
budget expenditures that the government will only make in the 
year 2000, and make it look as if the money was going to be spent 
this year. These figures make no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are tired of the government's treating them like idiots 
who cannot understand balanced budgets and realistic estimates, 
as opposed to unrealistic, cooked up estimates such as those 
presented by the Minister of Finance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just six months after the Bloc Quebecois presented its deficit 
forecast for the year ending in April 1997, we anticipated the 
deficit would be approximately $10 million. With the meagre means 
available to us as an opposition party, we were nonetheless able 
take a pencil and paper—we also used a computer, which 
helped—to forecast what the deficit would be for the next six 
months. We also looked at the deficit forecasts for the previous 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the Minister of Finance whether it was true that, far 
from reaching about $19 billion or $20 billion, as mentioned in 
the last budget, the deficit for 1997-98 would actually be 
approximately $10 billion. 
The minister stood up angrily and almost threw his budget papers 
at us as he replied that this was nonsense and that we were just 
throwing out figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months later, in Vancouver, he confirmed that our figures 
were right. Six months later, he admitted his forecast was off 
by 63%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were able to make calculations with a pencil and a 
computer, it seems to me that, with the help of the hundreds of 
officials and experts at Finance Canada and Revenue Canada, he 
could have come up with figures that more accurately matched 
reality, but he never did. From the very first budget the 
minister brought down in 1994, we have been presented with 
nothing but hogwash, making it impossible to see where we are at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Minister of Finance is making himself look good because 
all that matters to him, the champion of surpluses, of 
jack-in-the-box budget surpluses, is the <I>Guinness Book of Records</I>. 
But that is not what the people want. What they want is honesty 
and openness from their Minister of Finance. 
They want to be given the straight goods, not the sort of 
nonsense we are being dished up, especially in the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the Minister of Finance pulled the same trick he is 
pulling now with the millennium fund.  He included in the 1996 
budget the $1 billion in compensation unfairly paid to the 
maritimes, when this compensation should have appeared after the 
maritime provinces harmonized their PST and GST, in other words 
this year, in 1998.  He put down $1 billion under fiscal 1996-97, 
two years in advance, when the actual expenditure came two years 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he is doing is not right, and he should look out, because we 
are getting a little tired of the way he presents things and 
takes us for something we are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance should look out, because of these 
examples and because of many others it would take too long to go 
into here.  For instance, why does the finance minister not 
create an independent EI fund?  The answer is that he likes to 
hide the truth.  He knows that he can easily help himself to $6 
billion annually from the EI fund.  This does not show up 
anywhere because there is no specific entry showing that the 
Minister of Finance is going to help himself to $6 billion from 
the EI fund.  He puts it under general revenue.  The Minister of 
Finance's refusal to create an independent fund strengthens our 
feeling that he has things to hide, that he is not telling us the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is really starting to get on our nerves. 
We began to doubt his integrity, especially when he introduced 
Bill C-28, which is 464 pages long and which contains two 
paragraphs on his international shipping companies, and did so 
without warning, on the sly.  When the opposition discovered 
these two paragraphs, which could mean tax benefits for him, he 
turned to his ethics counsellor, Howard Wilson, who is paid by 
the Prime Minister's office to save his neck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will realize one day, and I hope they will come to 
understand it from our arguments, that they have been had, that 
the Minister of Finance is playing tricks on them, that he did 
not tell them the truth, that he presented incorrect figures and 
that he asked them, in recent years, to make unprecedented 
sacrifices in terms of the excess taxes they have paid.  Thirty 
billion dollars in four years ain't peanuts. 
He also asked them to make unwarranted sacrifices in the area of 
social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked the provinces, in particular, and the poor as well, to 
make unwarranted sacrifices.  He also asked students to make 
extraordinary sacrifices and he is now asking the sick to make 
extraordinary sacrifices.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Injecting $1.5 billion a year over the next three years is not 
going to change anything.  People have to know that, in addition 
to cooking the figures, the Minister of Finance is cooking the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, he brought down a budget that had a domino effect.  He 
announced once in it—he did not dare say it a second time, 
because he was ashamed—that the social transfers to the 
provinces to help fund social assistance, higher education and 
health would be cut annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of cancelling the cuts, he announces millennium 
scholarships for some students, in the amount of $2.5 billion 
but only starting in the year 2000, as well as $1.5 billion more 
for the health care system for the next three years. Although the 
Minister of Finance does not put it that way—the way it is 
presented is very hypocritical—he is cutting $6 billion per 
year until the year 2003 from transfers to the provinces.  There 
are $30 billion in cuts still to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the government side, they are bursting with pride over this. 
Either out of ignorance or ill will, I do not know which, they 
are telling us “The government has heeded the people's cry of 
alarm, and will put $1.5 billion per year into health”. My foot 
they will!  They will cut $6 billion per year from health and 
social programs.  That is the reality. They will take $30 
billion dollars away from it between now and the year 2003. 
That figure is a very long way from the $1.5 billion they are 
putting back into health.  They have just made $30 billion in 
cuts, mostly from health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line, then, is that in his 1995 plan the Minister of 
Finance forecast cuts of $48 billion in health, transfer payments 
to the provinces to fund health care, higher education and 
welfare.  Now, he is all proud to announce that he will not be 
cutting $48 billion, but only $42 billion.  There is nothing in 
this government's measures, or the implementation of part of 
what was forecast in the latest budget via Bill C-36, to be proud 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget—and my hon. colleagues will have the opportunity to 
return to this point—contains other unacceptable measures which do 
not reflect what people wanted. 
For the most part, it contains some general measures which will 
not provide all those who have done the Minister of Finance's 
work for him, in other words getting public finances back on an 
even keel, with any reward for all their efforts over the past 
four years to achieve that result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very day of the budget speech, the public's reaction of those 
really responsible was obvious. People were angry with the 
Minister of Finance.  They felt it was ungrateful of him to make 
them do the work and then to boast about his wonderful 
accomplishments over the past four years.  Those who are really 
responsible, and who received nothing in return, will not forget 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance asks them to co-operate on 
federal-provincial programs, I doubt he will be successful, and I 
am not only referring to Quebec—because our province will not 
forget the millennium scholarship fund—but to the other 
provinces as well. When Mr. Romanow said he was speaking on 
behalf of the other premiers in Canada and felt like going after 
the Minister of Finance to get what he is owed, his statement may 
have signalled the beginning of more strained relations between 
the federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me the Minister of Finance had always told the 
provinces, directly or indirectly, that some day, when our 
fiscal house was in better shape, he would compensate them for 
some of the sacrifices they had made. That time has now come, 
with the last budget and with the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance never had a kind word for his provincial 
counterparts and for all those poor people who had to put up 
with his savage and drastic cuts. The minister will pay for this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>His integrity will also take a beating, because he has been 
hiding the real budget figures for the past four years. The 
result of hiding the real figures, of fixing them, of almost 
falsifying them—to the point where editorialist Alain Dubuc 
wrote in <I>La Presse</I> that the budget was almost misleading—is that 
the finance minister's integrity appears to be vulnerable. 
Moreover, the minister is sponsoring bills to benefit his own 
foreign shipping businesses in Liberia, Barbados, the Bahamas and 
elsewhere. That takes the cake, as far as I am concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the second reading of this bill, we will point out 
certain aspects of Bill C-36 relating to the budget, including 
those that I just mentioned. 
We are going to repeat them over and over again, and that is not 
all.  Outside the House, we are going to launch a real public 
information campaign so that people know what sort of 
government, what sort of finance minister, they are up against, 
who is really responsible for the problems in the health sector. 
The guilty party is not Mr. Rochon in Quebec City, but the 
Minister of Finance here in the House of Commons in Ottawa. These 
are things we are going to say and keep on saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not done with the business of the finance minister's 
ships.  If members opposite think we are going to work ourselves 
into a state over Bill C-28 and the finance minister's apparent 
conflict of interest while they look all innocent, they are 
mistaken.  We are not about to give up.  At the least, the 
minister appears to be in conflict of interest. 
He could be in total conflict of interest.  I am convinced that 
he made a mistake in introducing this bill and that he made a 
mistake in approving a bill that will favour his offshore 
shipping holding company and shelter it completely from Revenue 
Canada's reach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I turn the floor over to my other 
colleagues.  They will examine other very important aspects of 
the finance minister's last budget as they relate to Bill C-36.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
always an honour to stand in this House at any time but I am 
particularly pleased today to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-36, the budget implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his budget speech last month the finance minister 
congratulated himself and the government for balancing the budget 
after almost 30 years.  Bill C-36 which is before us today puts 
in place the mechanisms to carry out certain provisions outlined 
in that budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My adopted province is Saskatchewan.  Our party, which is now 
the New Democratic Party and before that the Co-operative 
Commonwealth Federation party, has been in government for most of 
the last 45 years in the province of Saskatchewan. We have had 
some financial messes to clean up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of our previous premiers, I think of Tommy Douglas who inherited 
an atrocious mess from the provincial Liberals back in 1944. As 
premier of the CCF and later the NDP government of the province 
he proceeded to balance the books for a full 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1970s the NDP government under Allan Blakeney, for whom I 
had the privilege to work for a time, guided the province of 
Saskatchewan for 11 years.  In every one of those years the 
Blakeney government delivered at least a balanced budget and in 
many of those years modest surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives came to power in 1982.  They virtually 
bankrupted the province of Saskatchewan.  They managed to run up 
huge deficits, basically $1 billion each and every year for the 
nine years.  It was clearly the worst government in the history 
of the province of Saskatchewan.  It probably can be fairly said 
it was the worst provincial or territorial government in the 
history of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Devine government was succeeded in 1991 by the Romanow 
administration which inherited this enormous mess.  Over the past 
seven years in the best traditions of social democratic fashion, 
the Romanow government has gone back to work and the results have 
been stunning. 
The Saskatchewan budget for 1998-99 was tabled last week.  For 
the fifth year in a row the Saskatchewan budget is balanced.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that there are great 
differences in how Saskatchewan and Ottawa have achieved the goal 
of balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year Saskatchewan was again able to balance its books as I 
have said, but at the same time it has increased spending on 
health care, education and on getting more children out of 
poverty.  There is more money for agriculture and highways. The 
provincial budget also includes increased investment in jobs and 
economic growth.  This is after totally eliminating the deficit. 
Saskatchewan continues to pay down the debt inherited from the 
Devine administration by an additional $500 million in this 
fiscal year.

backfilling every dime the federal government has taken out of 
medicare as a result of slashing transfer payments to the 
provinces in 1995 and the years thereafter.  To preserve and 
protect this country's health care system particularly in the 
province of Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan has put back in every 
dollar that the federal government has taken out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a stunning achievement.  As Saskatchewan finance 
minister Eric Cline indicated last week, the credit belongs to 
the people of that province.  As the minister said, those people 
are now seeing the benefits which flow from the sacrifices they 
had to endure in the past several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saskatchewan budget is one thing.  The federal Liberal 
budget is quite another.  In my humble opinion it is a cynical 
budget, a testament to the black art of accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance department always hires slick, highly paid media 
professionals to put a positive spin on the budgets.  In 1995 the 
government did its polling.  There were focus groups in advance 
of the tabling of the budget and it was found that Canadians 
would stomach no more tax increases. Therefore the finance 
department packaged a budget that contained few new tax 
increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the television news programs began that budget evening with 
the Peter Mansbridges and the Lloyd Robertsons saying “Budget 
'95, no new taxes”. Of course that was not the case.  What the 
1995 federal budget did contain was an unprecedented attack on 
health, education and social programs, on unemployment insurance 
and billions of dollars in cutbacks in transfers to the provinces 
as I indicated a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those same or similar spin doctors are at work once again.  This 
time they are patting themselves on the back by saying that they 
balanced the budget.  Don't worry, be happy.  Happy days are here 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance in the federal Chamber has to hope that 
Canadians have short memories about these billions of dollars 
that have been slashed from spending on education, health care, 
unemployment insurance and agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister now announces that he will not proceed with further 
cuts scheduled for this year on health care for example and then 
he portrays this somehow as new spending and new money.  Having 
mugged Canadians for five years, he now gives them 35 cents and 
urges them to go and purchase some coffee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look for a moment at what is missing from the budget, and 
therefore from Bill C-36.  There is nothing to put right the 
damage done by the minister's earlier budgets to medicare.  Not 
so very long ago, we heard on the news that Edmonton hospitals 
were having to send patients to Saskatoon because no beds were 
available.  This is what the Liberals have done for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else is missing from this budget, and therefore from Bill 
C-36? 
There is no new investment in jobs for young people, no 
objectives for reducing overall unemployment, no objectives for 
reducing child poverty, no drug plan, no home care.  The 
government may not have a deficit in 1998, but ordinary Canadians 
do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a social deficit.  Who is paying for this deficit?  It is 
children living in poverty, the unemployed, students abandoning 
their studies because they are too deep in debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the case of the really nice young man who worked in our 
office recently.  After finishing two years of university, he 
had to quit because he owed too much money.  The minister 
announces that Canada no longer has a deficit, but things are 
very different for this young man. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else is not in the budget?  The budget speech was entirely 
silent on agriculture.  The minister spoke in this House for 
almost 90 minutes and the word agriculture never passed his lips. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in a 275 page document which was tabled relating to 
the budget there were a mere 16 lines about rural Canada.  Most 
of that space was devoted to reminding us that the minister 
provided additional money to the Farm Credit Corporation last 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only current spending mentioned for agriculture is $20 
million spread over five years and throughout several government 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal government spending in support of agriculture and the 
agri-food sector has declined drastically throughout this decade. 
Spending has tumbled from $6 billion in 1991 to less than $2 
billion in 1997.  This year's budget confirms even further cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We submit that the Liberals are dismantling rural Canada piece 
by piece.  They are closing post offices and allowing the 
railways to double freight rates on grain and tear up 
branchlines.  They have totally forgotten rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might well ask where the agriculture minister is in all of 
this.  Where is the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat 
Board or the Minister of Transport?  What are they doing to 
represent the interests of rural Canadians at the cabinet table? 
The answer clearly is not much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers and other rural dwellers have sacrificed enormously in 
the fight against the federal deficit.  The finance minister now 
says that the battle has been won, but these same people could be 
well forgiven for asking if we are any better off than we were 
when the Liberals were re-elected five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn to post-secondary education and the millennium 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that this is a cynical budget and nowhere is that more 
clear than in its centrepiece, the millennium fund which has been 
much touted by Liberal members opposite.  Part I of Bill C-36 
deals with the fund's foundation and its board of directors. 
This scholarship fund is a clear example of the budget being used 
as a tool of ideology, as the speaker before me so well indicated 
and documented.  The Liberals have used the fight against the 
deficit as an excuse to pursue privatization throughout the 
economy.  Now they will use new spending to privatize education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is how it will work.  In 1995 and the years following, the 
federal government withheld billions of dollars in transfers to 
the provinces for education.  Universities and technical 
institutes have been starved for funds.  Their roofs leak and 
buildings threaten to collapse onto students.  The universities 
were desperate for money and raised tuition fees to the point 
where university graduates with a debt of only $25,000 should 
consider themselves fortunate.  After years of starving students 
the finance minister has announced this wonderful new scholarship 
fund which he says will be worth $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deconstruct this for a moment.  The millennium fund is 
announced with great fanfare in February 1998, although it does 
not actually begin until the year 2000.  Coincidentally, that 
will be when the Liberals begin their run-up for the next federal 
election, but I digress.  Tens of thousands of students will face 
another $10,000 of debt each before the scholarship fund ever 
kicks in.  All the analyses indicate that at best the fund will 
help only about 7%, perhaps less, of Canada's post-secondary 
students.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tells us that this fund will be established by a 
private foundation, and Bill C-36 provides for its establishment. 
This foundation will determine which students are worthy of 
receiving these scholarships.  The foundation then has an amazing 
amount of power to decide who is and who is not worthy of 
receiving a scholarship.  Indirectly the foundation's board, 
appointed by this government, will have great power to decide 
which educational programs are worthy of support.  Is there any 
chance, for example, that the foundation will reward those 
students enrolling in university courses which focus on programs 
that business has been demanding all along? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, we believe that this is the Liberal's 
first step in privatizing education, just as they have privatized 
so many other things.  Having starved our public system of 
education, they now establish a fund for those individuals whom 
someone else will decide are worthy enough to attend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about those who do not qualify for millennium fund 
scholarships?  As of this budget their parents are told that they 
can cash in their RRSPs to help pay for their children's tuition 
fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Canada are more insecure than ever.  Study after study 
shows that real wages and family incomes have been static or 
declining for years.  People are selling the family silver or, in 
this case, the family RRSPs to help pay for the education of 
their daughters and sons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the brave new world of the Liberals.  The deficit and 
now the surplus is being used to support a growing gap between 
those who are wealthy in our society and those who are poor or of 
modest means.  This growing inequality is continuing and I would 
like to elaborate on it by quoting a prominent citizen. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of society do we have, when we see these gigantic 
salaries up there and these huge amounts of poverty down here?  I 
think that we are reaching the point of absurdity, in terms of 
inequalities.  There is third world poverty in this country.  It 
is beyond belief. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any guesses as to who might have said this?  Would it have been 
the leader of our party, the member of Parliament for Halifax, or 
perhaps the head of the National Anti-Poverty Organization? The 
answer is no.  This is a quote from the federal Minister of 
Finance in an interview with the editorial board of the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I>.  Did he really mean it?  What was he up to? 
Perhaps he was casting himself for a part as a left Liberal, but 
he quickly decided that he did not want to be in that play after 
all.  It has been reported in the news media that finance 
department officials told their minister not to make that kind of 
statement again.  He certainly has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the Minister of Finance knows, however, that the chief 
executive officers of the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank 
have take-home pay in excess of $10 million a year when stock 
options are considered.  This is hundreds, even thousands of 
times what the average bank employee earns.  Matthew Barrett 
might make an argument for a salary which is 10 to 20 times 
higher than that of a bank teller, but it is simply unjust for 
him to take $10 million a year.  I very much like the suggestion 
made recently by the United Church of Canada that we do not only 
need a minimum wage in this country, we need a maximum wage as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, these millionaire CEOs want their banks to 
merge even though Canada already has the most concentrated 
banking sector in the G-7 group of countries.  Even the CEOs 
admit that the merger would result in the shredding of 10% of 
their workforce which amounts to about 10,000 people.  We believe 
that the job loss would be much higher than that, probably in the 
magnitude of 25% of the staff or more than 20,000 jobs in the 
banking industry overall.  The NDP is going to fight this merger 
every step of the way.  I believe that we will be the only party 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the finance minister's answer to this proposed merger 
and to the massive job losses that would occur?  We are waiting 
for it.  He has certainly looked uncomfortable when attempting to 
answer questions in question period on the topic.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the Liberals remain the champions of big 
business.  We see this in spades in their unqualified support for 
the MAI, which has been called a bill of rights for corporations 
and the NAFTA on steroids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest an hour or so ago when the member for 
Medicine Hat was talking about the number of Canadians who have 
to flee Canada or leave Canada.  Perhaps flee is too strong a 
word, but they choose to leave Canada because there are greater 
opportunities elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is another side to the story the member did not talk 
about, which deserves to be talked about, and that is the flight 
of capital from this country.  Successful entrepreneurs are 
making the decision that, having earned large sums of money here, 
they will now take their business and move it offshore where they 
can avoid paying taxes of any kind, or very modest taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess for me there is no greater example of that than the New 
Brunswick multi-billionaire, Mr. K.C. Irving, who left a will a 
few years ago for his sons, turning over all of the assets of his 
very successful business to the children on the condition that 
they could not live in Canada.  In other words, they had to go to 
a tax haven offshore, the Cayman Islands or perhaps the Bahamas, 
where they would pay no taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of things that all freely elected 
governments will have to deal with in the years to come.  I would 
suggest that it is far more important that countries like those 
in the OECD deal with these kinds of issues rather than the 
multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long the Conservative, Reform and Liberal parties have 
had it their way.  They have convinced many people that there was 
no alternative to the attacks on our communities, our public 
institutions and our families.  I submit that is changing.  I 
think, for example, of the broadly based coalition working for 
fair trade and against the MAI.  I think of our party's work in 
the alternative budget coalition with other social movements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together we believe we can provide economic alternatives that 
once again will put people first.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in listening to the hon. 
member's speech, I would ask if rural Canadians will not benefit 
from reduced taxes.  Will the children from rural Canada not be 
able to attend higher universities, educational institutions, and 
have access to the millennium fund and the Canadian opportunities 
strategy in order to further their education and be able to 
compete? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget allows farmers and other self-employed business 
people to deduct premiums for health care.  This would put them 
in line with other businesses.  Do they not benefit from this 
type of initiative? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind the member of the elimination of the surtax on 
incomes below $50,000.  Does that not benefit Canadian farmers 
and rural Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about rural Canada as though it were not a part 
of Canada, as though it were not benefiting from the initiatives 
in this budget.  I want the hon. member to answer to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students from rural Canada who are dealing with student debt 
will benefit from this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention that in my riding of Stoney Creek we have 
a substantial amount of grape growing and winemaking.  Brock 
University put in place a university course for winemaking. 
Students in the rural part of my riding will be able to access, 
through the Canada millennium scholarship fund, education courses 
at Brock University.  Do they not benefit from these types of 
initiatives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural Canadians benefit from a balanced budget.  Rural Canadians 
benefit from low inflation and low interest rates.  The hon. 
member must stand in his place and admit that rural Canada will 
benefit from the achievements of this government. 
He may not agree with everything that we are doing but I cannot 
possibly accept the fact that he says this government has done 
absolutely nothing for rural Canada.

will benefit from having a balanced budget, and some very minor 
nod on reduced taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point in the references to agriculture was primarily how 
much has been slashed from the agriculture and agri-food budget 
by this government over the past number of years.  It had gone 
from $6 billion in the early 1990s to $2 billion today for a drop 
of $4 billion.  I contrast that in terms of the farming 
community, especially grain farmers in western Canada who have 
played an enormous role in helping this government balance its 
books by exports of grain and oilseeds. They have been rewarded 
by seeing their grain transportation rates doubling and in some 
cases even tripling as a result. They are now faced with low 
commodity prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I attempted to make is this government has retrenched 
in terms of its commitment to agriculture and the result has been 
much lower expectations in the agricultural community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for everything he said.  I totally 
agree with what he said.  I would like his opinion on a few 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in the budget for regions that have very high 
unemployment rates and for the regions that are running out of 
unemployment because the UI program has been totally dismantled? 
What is in the budget to help somebody on a waiting list for 
months for heart surgery?  What is in the budget to help a 
student who has a $50,000 loan?  What is in the budget to help 
the people who are now paying 15% of the BST we have in New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia that we now pay 15% on heating fuel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in the budget to help the people who now have to pay on 
the toll highways in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia?  What is in 
the budget for the people who have all these additional burdens 
and still have absolutely no jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague help Canadians across this country figure out 
what is in the budget to help all these people who are suffering 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate remains very disturbing, as has been 
mentioned by a number of other speakers in this debate today. 
There is absolutely nothing that we can point to specially in the 
budget that will have any impact on reducing that. In this 
country in recent years we have gone from an unemployment 
insurance system that basically paid claims in the area of 85% to 
90% to well under 50% of claimants receiving any kind of 
employment insurance when they present themselves to the 
officials.  This is as a result of the changes from unemployment 
insurance to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of waiting lists in hospitals and other medical 
facilities around the country, it is not a very encouraging 
sight.  The lists are growing.  We read about it every day. There 
is no new money in this budget.  They are just taking less away 
from us to help the provinces alleviate that condition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I touched on student loans in my remarks.  I think the 
scholarship millennium fund will, as I indicated, help less than 
7% of students.  A number of students have debtloads in the range 
of American universities now.  When I was a university student 
many decades ago, we had a very low rate of tuition fees.  It was 
possible to graduate from university with a modest debt, as was 
my case, and to get it paid off. Students today are looking at 
$30,000 to $35,000 worth of debt. It is a horrendous figure with 
virtually no way out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member.  Did the NDP in 
the last election not call for a student assistance program that 
would give qualified students access to post-secondary education? 
Have not we, the Liberals, actually delivered on that NDP plan in 
our millennium fund?  Should we not be applauded for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the NDP not call for increased capital and research funding 
to restore and renew post-secondary facilities?  Have not we, the 
Liberals, in the last two budgets increased funding to research 
granting councils?  In this last budget and in the prior budget 
did we not provide $800 million to create the Canada foundation 
for innovation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the NDP not also ask for investing in families with measures 
such as access to high quality child care and support for 
parents?  Does not the increase in the child care tax deduction 
by $2,000 partially deliver on that promise?  Should we not be 
applauded for that as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, in view of the lack of 
time, I will confine my remarks to the first point raised by the 
hon. member concerning education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that this party, given the 
opportunity, would never have introduced a scholarship millennium 
fund similar to the one we are debating here and now.  The 
problem for us is that the transfer money should go back to the 
provinces and the territories and not in the way that it is being 
done here where it is being handed out in some sort of way yet to 
be determined for individual students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has cut back significantly on post-secondary 
education and on the facilities.  It would have been much better 
if the money had been put back into those facilities so that 
tuition fees could be reduced and programs could be enhanced. For 
political reasons the Liberals have chosen to go at it another 
way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to speak on Bill C-36.  It has 
been nearly a month since the Minister of Finance marvelled to all 
who would listen to the upside of his balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message today for those who find their conscience in favour 
of this bill is to reflect on the tired but relevant cliche, that 
this budget is only as strong as its weakest link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not fool ourselves by standing here in the House and 
declaring this country has a cause to rejoice.  Let us examine 
some of the weakest links of this so-called balanced budget, 
which even the auditor general cannot endorse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of this day, Canadians are still the highest taxed 
individuals in the G-7.  While Canadians' personal disposable 
income decreased, the incomes of our G-7 neighbour to the south 
increased.  The Canadian standard of living is 25% lower than 
that of the United States and this gap continues to expand. 
Youth unemployment figures are staggering yet the government 
continues to lack a plan to address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week the CIBC reported that some 200,000 unemployed 
youth do not appear on the government's books.  All the wonderful 
news of 85,000 new full time jobs being created did nothing to 
help young Canadians support themselves.  Our current statistics 
show that our youth unemployment rate is twice that of the United 
States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These points tell me the minister has become obsessed with this 
new agenda and sweeps the issues of the individual under the 
carpet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the budget do for tax relief in this country?  We see 
the 3% deficit surtax being slowly eliminated.  Leading Canadian 
economists agree that tax relief is essential to job creation and 
prosperity. In fact, the Minister of Finance has said so on 
different occasions himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Catherine Swift from the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business, who shares a key factor of the Progressive Conservative 
platform, stated that further tax cuts would help business create 
jobs, something the government should listen to: “We are still 
not seeing a major job creation agenda here and from a small 
business job creator's standpoint, that really should be the 
prime target”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government lacks transparency in the area of employment 
insurance.  The auditor general criticized it for using 
employment insurance to reduce the deficit when the system was 
not set up for this purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget the government boasted of reducing all taxes by $7 
billion over three years.  Yet the same government is taking $6 
billion annually out of taxpayer pockets.  To my knowledge this 
is the only government to establish an unemployment plan for 
Canadians.  It creates more unemployment, raises taxes and taxes 
employment insurance.  That is what its policy is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals are asked to reduce contributions they say no, 
that does not work, it will not create real employment. Yet in 
the budget they are doing just that for people between the ages 
of 18 and 24 for two years only.  When they are asked why, it is 
to create employment.  If it works for young people aged 18 to 
24, will it not work for people aged 45 to 55?  Unemployment is 
too high in Canada? No, they believe only in minor measures and 
always to save face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had an opportunity to follow his own wisdom and 
make substantial cuts to the surplus, cuts that would have given 
every wage earner in the country more disposable income and 
therefore given businesses the cashflow essential to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more shocking, if the Minister of Finance had consulted his 
own cabinet colleagues he would have found the industry minister 
agrees with the PC Party that tax cuts in Ontario have increased 
job creation and spurred economic growth.  Instead of aiding 
Canadians directly with significant payroll tax relief, he elects 
only to respond to their needs by phasing out the 3% deficit 
surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians do not know yet is that the Liberal government 
will soon be introducing the single largest tax hike in Canadian 
history by increasing Canada pension plan premiums.  What has 
taken place here is that we see the 3% surtax totalling $1.6 
billion phased out and replaced with a tax hike that dwarfs all 
its predecessors, bringing it to $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as though we are at a carnival.  While Canadians guess 
which cup the peanut is under the minister continues to shuffle 
and dazzle the crowd.  In the last election we saw the carnival 
booted out of Atlantic and western Canada. 
Ontario and Quebec are his last stage because sooner or later 
people will see the costs of the minister's games.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at another weak link in the budget, the great 
Canadian brain drain.  Provincial premiers made it clear they 
wanted from the budget a return of the billions in cuts from 
transfer payments that devastated health care, social programs 
and education programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years now education has been a responsibility of the 
provinces.  At a time when we have another potential national 
crisis on the horizon, the Liberal government elects to drive a 
wedge into interprovincial relations by creating the millennium 
fund.  It has set aside for the fortunate class of 2000 and 
beyond $2.5 billion to assist some 7% of all students to further 
their education.  In my mind it is a modern day Avro Arrow 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If substantial tax cuts are not made to create jobs, we place 
graduates on graduation day in Seattle. Someone should point out 
to the Minister of Finance that “sleepless in Seattle” was just 
a figure of speech in a movie.  At the present time Bill Gates at 
Microsoft has extended a standing offer to all Waterloo computer 
science graduates and the result is that over 80% of them are 
going to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My home province of New Brunswick, which has invested 
significant dollars into information technology training schools, 
cannot retain the graduates it produces because it is not able to 
compete with the U.S. market.  We see the same exodus across the 
country.  It is disturbing to think that a large portion of the 
$2.5 billion will benefit the U.S. economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why go to the U.S. one may ask.  For one the jobs are there. 
Wages are higher and taxes are lower.  Yet other students were 
forgotten.  What about the students of today and next year?  They 
were simply forgotten, not to mention the 97% who will not 
benefit from the millennium fund in the next century.  They will 
not forget on graduation day as they watch Canada customs in 
their rear view mirror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the comments of Sherry Cooper, chief economist 
at Nesbitt Burns, who said broad based tax relief was crucial to 
our economic future.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pouring all this money into education and scholarships, 
and then the better and brighter will go straight to the United 
States where taxes are massively lower. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have feed the brain drain from this country. 
Instead of taking measures to be at the forefront of an emerging 
information technology industry, they have decided to finance 
another country's efforts.  When one steps back and examines the 
links in this chain, one comes to a quick realization that the 
government has abandoned our social policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our society expects government to take care of the elderly, 
young people, workers and other individuals facing personal 
crises and in need of a helping hand.  These values are not to be 
sacrificed.  Canadians will not allow what makes the country so 
unique to be altered, yet they know these values come at a price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal for any government is to balance values against fiscal 
responsibility.  Some may think this is blatantly obvious, but as 
I read the budget I realize these fundamental principles or links 
in the chain were well worth repeating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has ignored these concepts and values.  It claims 
to be sympathetic, yet it threatens seniors with a hidden project 
it never unveiled as part of its platform.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian seniors rely on three basic sources of income.  The 
government has systematically attacked the retirement savings 
systems since it has taken office.  It has done so in piecemeal 
fashion with the bottom line as its consideration.  It has not 
addressed the fundamental questions of what kind of retirement 
assistance Canadians need and want or what are the best ways for 
government to ensure Canadians are secure in their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would ask why the seniors benefit is an issue.  Let us 
state the obvious.  It certainly was not an issue in the budget. 
In fact, the government has gone back to the drawing board 
because of the flaws my party exposed in the seniors benefit. 
The Liberals proposed to eliminate the OAS, the pension income 
tax credit, the age credit and the GIS.  To date they have 
refused to provide a full and proper analysis of how these 
measures would affect retired Canadians in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is committed to 
forcing the government to disclose fully to Canadians the 
financial impact of the proposed seniors benefit.  Canadians of 
all ages must understand its consequences.  The Liberal 
government must not be allowed to destroy the foundation of our 
national pension system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims to be concerned about workers, but the 
budget has nothing to do with the famous Liberal election battle 
cry.  Not so long ago a chant fell on Canadians' ears shouted by 
the Prime Minister proclaiming jobs, jobs and more jobs.  In the 
budget it resembles less than a flattering wailing of a trombone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle and lower income Canadians needed to hear from the budget 
a trumpet of hope, for hope is what keeps the disparaged 
committed to protecting the values of our society.  When hope is 
lost so are our motivations, our strength and our willingness to 
endure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we share with the Prime Minister of Canada and so 
too taxpayers that the budget was one trick pony where even the 
word balanced could not be endorsed by the auditor general. The 
minister may feel that his spread sheet's bottom line is 
balanced, but his trust to serve and protect the values of the 
people have been wrapped in chains with many weak links.  Once 
broken they will break free and bring true balance to our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party believes that it is time for Canada to have a strong 
plan for growth in our economy.  We need to get our foot off the 
brake.  For us this means lowering taxes by reducing EI premiums 
by about one-third to create jobs and lowering taxes by 
increasing the basic exemption for Canadians to $10,000 to allow 
lower income Canadians to earn more and buy more of the essential 
goods they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government which has a great opportunity to launch us 
on a new path, to close the chapter of deficits, and to start us 
on a new path.  It should set a target for debt reduction so that 
we are able to measure our performance and to live in a political 
environment where we can go to our neighbours and say that 
together we need to limit spending to keep it under control.  If 
we do, we will meet a specific target.  When we get there we will 
be able to reduce taxes further.

increase our chances of succeeding.  Those should have been 
lessons learned in the budget.  Our party firmly believes that we 
need a plan for economic growth.  The budget is more than just 
about numbers.  It is about values.  It is about the choices we 
make.  It is not good enough to shift numbers around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some parties would say they would put more money into education 
but then they would cut equalization.  The position we have taken 
is that there would be more money put into education by building 
a new deal with provincial governments.  Then there would be a 
health care guarantee for all Canadians and we could leave 
provincial governments alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in a plan for stronger economic growth.  We can 
reallocate priorities.  We can put the emphasis on education, 
health and guaranteed services to Canadians.  It requires the 
political will, the vision and the foresight to make it happen. I 
am sorry to say this is something that was not part of the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and I cannot and 
will not support Bill C-36 because it was merely a numbers game 
that has left our country and our people suffering today with 
little hope.

weakest link or by the missing links of the Minister of Finance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, when my hon. colleague first began his speech he 
quoted Catherine Swift, president of CFIB, and made a statement 
regarding her reaction to the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from Catherine Swift as reported on 
February 25 in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest thing in there for small business was income tax 
reduction.  Putting more money into people's hands is good for 
the economy.  From a political standpoint it was a good budget. 
There was a little something for everyone and a huge amount of 
wiggle room which would allow the debt to be paid down faster. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding his quotation of Catherine Swift and whether she had 
more time to digest the good budget the hon. minister brought 
down, how could he say that it was negative?  The day after the 
budget she indicated that she was quite in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
giving me a chance to get back up to speak on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One good thing about the budget is that it is balanced.  Why is 
the budget balanced?  Is it because of Liberal government 
procedures?  I do not think so and people know that is not what 
it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about measures, sacrifices made by Canadians.  We are 
talking about free trade, which they voted against.  We are 
talking about GST, which was unpopular.  They also voted against 
that.  We are talking about surtaxes, where the money comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say that the government has not done anything.  I will 
be honest.  I could not say that.  I would be lying and I do not 
like to lie.  I am not a liar.  The government has done 
something.  It has cut transfer payments to provinces which 
affect social programs, education and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody knows more than Canadians the effect of these slashes. 
People are looking for beds in hospitals throughout Canada and 
cannot find them.  Students are trying to obtain post-secondary 
education to compete in the global market and are unable to 
finance it.  This is what the government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social programs in regions in great need of social programs have 
been slashed. 
People are starving.  People are suffering.  To say that you have 
done nothing, I could not do that.  There is a lot that we can 
do.  I hope that we have the ability and the political will to do 
so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member raised the issue of hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to sincerely invite him to my riding of 
Elgin—Middlesex—London and show him a community that during the 
waning days of the last Tory government probably suffered through 
the worst recession in its history.  It had an unemployment rate 
of well over 16% or 17%.  Factories were moving out of our 
community en masse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would bring him down to the community now and show him that 
our unemployment rate has roughly been cut in half, if not 
better.  We have investments from companies all over the world. 
If he wants to see a more hopeful, optimistic community, have him 
come to Elgin—Middlesex—London. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to suggest that the story in my riding is not 
unique.  It is being repeated all across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point about Canadians having the highest income taxes in the 
industrialized world is something we hear from the Conservatives. 
It is something we hear from their kissing cousins the Reform 
Party.  The fact of the matter is that a truer picture of tax 
fairness includes all taxes.   The opposition repeatedly distorts 
the facts by focusing on selected tax measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Total tax revenue for all levels of governments stood at 36.1% 
of GDP in 1994.  This puts Canada in the middle of the G-7 
countries.  Canada relies more than most countries on income tax 
and less on payroll and sales taxes which increases tax fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main point is that in October 1997 a study conducted by KPMG, 
an international consulting firm, concluded that Canada has lower 
overall business costs than the United States and Europe, 
including the lowest overall tax burden of the seven nations 
studied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you 
again for giving me another opportunity to get up and speak on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question of the hon. member.  What planet 
is he on?  We all know that we are the highest taxed country in 
the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also mentioned that I should visit his riding.  I would like 
to bring to his attention my riding, the people I represent. He 
mentioned 19.5% or something like that.  I will give him the 
number from my riding.  How does 50% unemployment sound?  It does 
not sound very good. I hear comments of bravo from the other 
side, but I would not say that to the people of New Brunswick, 
the people of Madawaska—Restigouche who are suffering today 
because of the cuts in transfer payments that the government has 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts to the EI, the reform of the Employment Insurance Act 
have put these people against the wall.  I invite him to come to 
my riding and see these people, maybe consult with them.  I 
invite the government to come to my riding and consult with these 
people and maybe find solutions to this chronic problem.  It is 
not more EI.  It is to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleagues next to me would do away with EI and do 
away with Atlantic Canada.  That is what they would do.  It would 
start in Ontario.  We know what they think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility to all Canadians.  We have to study 
what has been going on in different parts of the country.  It is 
not just to throw money at the regions with the highest levels of 
unemployment.  It is to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member to my riding as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member 
would tell us how he would allocate the fiscal dividend.  On 
$100, how much would he put to the debt, how much to investments 
in education and health and how much to tax reduction?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that we have to 
attack the debt.  We have said this all along. We need to have a 
balance.  We need to balance debt reduction with our social 
responsibilities.  If we can do that, we will find a way to 
please all Canadians, including those in central Canada and all 
the people in need.  There is a balance to be found and we should 
look for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the remarks made by the 
hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche, the riding next to mine in 
New Brunswick. I agree with him that we would indeed have 
expected a bill like this one to put back a much more substantial 
amount into transfer payments so that the provinces will have 
enough money to provide health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and its supporters claim, on the one 
hand, that health should be a priority and at the same time 
drastically cut transfer payments, starving the provinces as the 
result, and on the other hand, they say “We are going to develop 
a home care system”. Imagine the federal government involved in 
home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Human Resources Development, who stated this 
morning that the whole employment insurance issue was not an 
urgent matter? He said that we could take our time, that there 
was no rush to take action on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche, whose riding, 
like mine, is struggling with high unemployment and the problems 
associated with seasonal industries, comment on this position, 
which should have been reflected in the bill before us? Does this 
not go to show how insensitive the Liberals can be not only for 
eastern Quebec but also for all the maritime provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.  I agree with him entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he knows, at my first committee meeting, I moved that we study 
the impact of the employment insurance reform, because I come 
from a region that is hard hit by unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed by the committee's decision this morning, 
because this matter warrants study urgently, in fact more than 
study, because the employment insurance reforms have already 
been studied.  The study did not reveal much.  What needs to be 
done is for us to visit the regions, like those of my colleague 
and myself, to see what the employment insurance reforms have 
meant for the people.  That would be much better for everyone.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK33">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-36, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 24, 1998; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from 
Elgin—Middlesex—London. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to speak in full and complete support of the 
government's budgetary measures.  On behalf of my constituents I 
am also pleased to express their points of view on the budget. I 
have heard from many local residents in the month since the 
budget was first delivered on February 24 by the hon. Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, families in rural Canada are the biggest winners in this 
budget, with $7 billion in tax cuts, $13 billion in debt 
reduction already this year and appropriate investments in health 
care and education. These are some of the items that my 
constituents have mentioned to me. I believe we are on the right 
track and must continue this course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a balance between new spending and tax or debt 
reduction.  The Minister of Finance has clearly accomplished 
that.  For example, the elimination of the 3% income surtax for 
people earning under $50,000 and increasing the basic personal 
exemption are two measures that will reduce taxes for 90% of 
Canadians, especially low and middle income earners who form the 
vast majority of constituents in my riding of 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is an assortment of small towns, villages and hamlets, 
with the two largest centres having populations of approximately 
12,000.  I was delighted to declare that rural and small town 
families are getting relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the first balanced budget in 28 years and two more 
predicted to the year 2000, the Liberal government has targeted 
its efforts on the economic and social priorities that are 
important in my riding.  These are items such as support for 
families with children, support for looking after ailing family 
members, increased access to knowledge and skills with more money 
for rural Internet access, help for small business owners to hire 
young people, and to enable them to deduct their own dental and 
health insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister have stated, 
Canada has cut up its credit card.  The era of overspending is 
behind us forever.  I know that my constituents are breathing a 
sigh of relief.  They want their hard-earned tax dollars to be 
spent wisely and prudently.  People should expect nothing less 
from their government.  We are delivering and will continue to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, our goal is to put the horrendous national debt on a 
permanent downward track.  Last year it dropped for the first 
time in a generation with more reductions to come to preserve our 
financial future as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More help for families came in the form of an enriched child tax 
benefit.  The 1997 budget allocated $850 million to the benefit. 
This year we will increase that by another $850 million over the 
next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help working Canadians with children, we will increase the 
child care deduction limit from $5,000 to $7,000 for children 
under the age of seven, and from $3,000 to $4,000 for children 
between the ages of seven and sixteen.  This will assist about 
65,000 Canadian families with children.  It is yet another piece 
of good news from the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business is the backbone of my riding.  Entrepreneurs, 
service providers, corner stores, farm implements dealers and the 
farmers are all involved in our communities and make a positive 
economic impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a small business hires someone between the ages of 18 and 24 
in 1999 or 2000, their employment insurance premiums will be 
reduced to zero for those new hires.  This will reduce payroll 
costs for the employers by $100 million a year.  This is on top 
of the EI rate reductions announced in January.  Both these 
actions could reduce payroll costs by $1.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To improve equity in the tax treatment of self-employed 
Canadians, all owner operators of businesses will be able to 
deduct premiums for health and dental insurance against their 
business incomes. 
This is certainly an excellent step forward.  In addition, the 
federal government will benefit the nearly 500 volunteer 
firefighters in Lambton county and the many more in Kent and 
Middlesex which are in my riding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax free allowance has been doubled from $500 to $1,000. Mr. 
Don Crocker, Moore township's fire chief and Lambton county's 
fire co-ordinator, says: “It is a big deal for them, a big 
impact for the volunteers, manning the county's 20 primary rural 
Lambton stations.  It is a big plus for volunteers.  They are 
spending an awful lot of time and getting very little for it.  I 
think it is wonderful”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are nearly 22,000 volunteer firefighters in the province 
of Ontario, so we can plainly see this budget is positive for 
rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Camalachie fire chief Gerry Dochstader can attest to the low 
wages paid to volunteers.  Some are paid on a points system, 
others get compensation from their municipality. The extra tax 
deduction will help, he says, in a February 26 article in the 
Sarnia <I>Observer</I>: “It is like compensation for the wear and 
tear of your car, tearing down to the fire station at 3 o'clock 
in the morning, whipping out on Sunday calls while still in your 
good clothes.  For what we ask the rural firefighters they are 
given very, very little in return”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax allowance covers the cost of clothes damaged in fires, 
special equipment, steel toed boots and other expenses they incur 
as volunteer emergency workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of Canada's important industries such as agriculture are 
based in rural communities. These primary industries account for 
almost half of Canada's exports.  My riding includes some of the 
best dairy farmers in Ontario.  Kent County is the number one 
corn growing region in the country and Middlesex is home to 
chicken, egg, beef and pork producers.  Agriculture is the 
lifeblood of my riding and of southwestern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget confirms the four year $20 million Canadian 
rural partnership initiative.  This will support innovative 
programs to help rural Canadians find community solutions to 
challenges such as maintaining good soil and water and charting a 
successful course in a rapidly changing economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, $30 million over three years has been provided to 
an expanded community access program.  This excellent program 
will provide an Internet connection for virtually every community 
with 400 or more residents by the end of the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to recently announce on behalf of the Minister of 
Industry up to $15,000 in Internet funding for several libraries 
in my riding.  I am confident that all of them will be hooked up 
to the information highway very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children and adults alike are using the services provided and I 
have heard nothing but great reviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural communities will also benefit from the $50 million capital 
injection in the Farm Credit Corporation announced in the 1997 
budget.  These additional funds will be used to encourage 
economic growth and diversification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With fiscal discipline, targeted tax reductions and strategic 
investments, the 1998 budget is working for rural Canadians and 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget marks a significant accomplishment for Canada. Tough 
fiscal control has gotten us this far, and we are not about to 
let up.  Spending must continue to be constrained and federal 
spending has dropped to its lowest level in 50 years relative to 
the GDP.  For the first time in half a century the Minister of 
Finance will be produce three consecutive balanced budgets, a 
remarkable symbol of financial stability on the world markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a part of the building of Canada and 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex for the 21st century.  We will lead all 
industrialized nations in economic growth this year and next.  We

ask her to comment on the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget set out a number of issues but the one I was most 
pleased with was tax relief for low and middle income Canadians. 
Beginning July 1, 1998 the basic personal exemption will 
increase, meaning 400,000 low income Canadians will no longer pay 
any federal income tax.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning July 1 the 3% general surtax will be eliminated for 
Canadians with incomes up to about $50,000 and reduced for those 
with incomes up to $65,000.  These two measures alone will yield 
close to $1.4 billion in tax relief for 14 million low and middle 
income Canadians by 1999 and the year 2000 90% of all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member whether this focused targeted tax relief 
for those who need it most is being well received in her riding 
or perhaps she could give what comments on the tax relief she is 
getting in her own community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague from Elgin—Middlesex—London for the question.  I can 
certainly attest as to the calls that have been coming into my 
riding office.  With the budgets that this government has 
produced over the last four plus years we have never really had 
many negative calls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were always positive, that the finance minister was 
certainly addressing the deficit. Many of the calls I received 
complimented the minister for exceeding his targets, which has 
not happened in several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive element within my community is the same for this 
budget as it has been in previous budgets the minister has 
delivered. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
represent and was born in a rural riding.  I do not know what 
planet my distinguished colleague from the government party 
comes from.  In my riding, however, I have heard but one piece of 
praise for the February 24 budget, and that was for the two years 
of  employment insurance premium exemptions for employers hiring 
workers between the ages of 18 and 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, however, heard plenty of criticism about the lack of 
anything to do with job creation. Nothing has been done to 
reduce the poverty rate in Canada and to close the widening gap 
between rich and poor. 
Dr. Wagner of St. Hyacinthe even asked the leader of the Liberal 
Party to backtrack on the cuts, particularly those to health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my hon. colleague from the government side a 
question.  Is there in her riding anything like the AFEAS of 
Thetford, which is in my riding, a group of women who have 
flooded their MP with letters asking him or her to call upon the 
government, more specifically the minister of finance, to 
backtrack on the issue of calculating family income when women 
begin to collect the old age pension at 65? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is common knowledge that women are, unfortunately, the ones 
who will be penalized when the time comes for them to collect 
their old age pensions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for his question.  I am pleased to say that I am on the 
same planet he is in this wonderfully great country called 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate his question.  I have not received any negative 
comments from any women's groups or old age pensioners.  The old 
age pensioners in the riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex are 
fully aware of the fact that the minister is reviewing the old 
age pension, the GIS and so on. There has not been any indication 
in this budget regarding that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On health care, which is brought up continuously in this House, 
the federal government's cutting transfer payments to the 
provinces, I will relate specifically to my province of Ontario. 
When Mr. Harris ran in the last election he promised a $4.5 
billion tax cut.  Unfortunately the federal government has 
allocated dollars now and the provinces choose to divide it up. 
Wherever provinces decide to divide it, it is up to each province 
to decide whether to put it in health care or social programs. 
Unfortunately it is reaping a negative impact in Ontario under 
the circumstances with the massive tax cuts the premier wishes to 
do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on the implementation bill 
and add my comments to the budget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members have stated, this budget is very historic.  I 
think all our Liberal budgets have been somewhat historic but 
this budget is historic because it can bring in renewed optimism 
and renewed hope.  We are now embarking on an age when we will no 
longer say that with reliance on federal government support 
things are going to get worse.  We can now begin to say that we 
have reached the bottom and things can get better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More needs to be done. Many people in this country are hurting 
and many people are not sharing in the prosperity that is 
generally around the land. I will return to that point toward the 
end of my speech. Let me highlight what I think are the major 
accomplishments in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Against the backdrop of unemployment dropping very rapidly in my 
own community, as I mentioned in one of my comments earlier, 
since 1993 or thereabouts the unemployment rate has dropped 
probably from around 16% to about 8%.  We are seeing a gradual 
but steady month over month decline of the unemployment rate 
which is fundamentally the most important statistic that we can 
talk about.  It is more important than the balanced budget.  It 
is more important than tax relief.  Jobs are the real issue in 
this country.  When people have the dignity of work they are more 
hopeful for their existence and more hopeful as a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, however, we cannot underestimate how important 
balancing the budget is.  Not until we balance the budget can we 
start to deal with the major issue of the debt.  By  balancing 
the budget we know that as the economy grows both in real terms 
and in inflationary terms and as we pay down the debt the 
proportion of the debt as a percentage of our economy is going to 
get smaller very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have approximately 2% growth on an annual basis combined 
with approximately 2% inflation we can expect that the debt as a 
percentage of the economy will be cut in half in merely 10 years 
or thereabouts.  That is a tremendous achievement.  It is all 
based on having a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In promising a balanced budget this year, next year and the year 
after, the finance minister has put us on the road to solid 
recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at how things have changed in my own community since 
we took office in 1993, I see a change from a community which 
suffered a terrible recession in the late 1980s and early 1990s 
to one where the prosperity level is very high.  I see examples 
of this where the Magna automobile corporation is making a huge 
investment in my riding.  Approximately 1,000 jobs will be 
created in a new plant Magna is putting in.  Freightliner is 
making a major investment to build highway trucks in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate has been cut in half over the past five 
years.  Farm incomes are up.  By and large things are clearly 
better off now than they were in 1993.  People expect them to be 
even better over the next five years.  The message of this budget 
really is that things are going to get better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highlight of this budget is balance.  Not only is it 
balanced this year, it will be balanced for the next two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the opposition like to talk about how many times the 
government raises tax and they bring out numbers, 37 times.  Why 
do they not congratulate us for the tax relief in this budget? 
It is not enough.  We need to lower taxes even more. It is a step 
in the right direction.  I believe quite firmly it is a trend. 
Because of the changes announced in the budget, 400,000 Canadians 
will no longer be paying any federal tax at all.  That represents 
approximately 1,200 people in my own community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget sets priorities, investing in education with the 
millennium scholarship fund, investing in children with the 
announcement of a second $850 million for the child tax benefit 
of which I am very proud.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about what opposition members said previously and 
ask them why they are not applauding the budget.  The Reform 
Party stated in its campaign that a Reform government would 
balance the federal budget by March 31, 1999.  The leader of the 
Reform Party promised that in 1996 in Fresh Start.  Lo and behold 
we balanced the budget a full year earlier than the Leader of the 
Opposition promised to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition also said in Fresh Start that after 
a Reform government balanced the budget annual surpluses would be 
used to reinvest in the Canadian economy through lower taxes, to 
increase spending on health and education, and begin to reduce 
the debt.  That sounds very much like Liberal policy.  Perhaps 
the Leader of the Opposition is really a Liberal, but I do not 
think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's suggestion for tax relief calls for measures found in 
the 1998 budget.  The basic personal amount would be increased 
from $6,456 to $7,900.  At least we went one-third of the way, 
albeit means tested.  The 3% and 5% surtaxes of the Tories would 
be eliminated.  We went part of the way and I am hopeful we will 
go the rest of the way.  Students would be allowed to claim a tax 
deduction for interest payments on student loans.  Lo and behold 
the Liberal government adopted just such a policy.  Do we hear 
the Reform Party applauding us?  No.  Job killing payroll taxes 
paid by employers would be reduced.  We reduced the EI premiums 
again, effective in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn my attention to the Bloc for a moment.  The BQ urged 
the federal government to use the $3 billion it saves annually as 
a result of this review to encourage small and medium size 
business as well as very small businesses to create jobs.  This 
reduction in tax burden for businesses could take the form of tax 
holidays linked to business performance with respect to creating 
jobs and helping youth enter the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget delivers.  To encourage employers to hire young 
Canadians, the budget proposes to give employers an EI holiday 
per additional young Canadian between the ages of 18 and 24 hired 
between 1999 and 2000.   Should the Bloc Quebecois not be 
applauding us for this measure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the new hires program in operation in 1997 and 1998, 
employers will be allowed to stop paying premiums when they reach 
the 1998 level of payroll or they can claim a rebate when filing 
their tax forms.  This will reduce payroll costs for employers by 
about $100 million a year for 1999 and 2000.  Is that enough?  Do 
EI premiums need to come down even more?  They certainly do but 
at least it is the start of a trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party called for an increase in capital and 
research funding to restore and renew post-secondary facilities. 
The Liberal budget increases funding to research granting 
councils.  Our budget of last year provided $800 million to 
create the Canada Foundation for Innovation.  Should the NDP not 
be applauding these measures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP also asked for investment in families with measures such 
as access to high quality child care and support for parents. Our 
budget increased the child care deduction by $2,000 per child.  I 
have three children who attend day care.  That will amount to 
$6,000, a significant amount, and the government should be 
applauded for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn last to the Progressive Conservatives.  The leader 
of the Tory party promised a balanced budget by the year 2000. 
That was in its 1997 election platform, “Let the Future Begin”. 
Only two years later we delivered a zero deficit.  Should the 
Tories not be saying the Liberals brought in a balanced budget 
two full years before they could do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Tories said repeatedly that we must reduce EI 
taxes when over their nine years in office the Tories increased 
EI premiums four times from $2 to $3.  The Liberal government has 
reduced EI premium rates each year since 1994 from $3.07 that 
year to $2.70 this year, and hopefully they will go down even 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tory's 1997 platform promised to start a $100 million 
Canadian merit scholarship program.  Our 1998 budget introduced a 
$2.5 billion millennium scholarship fund.  Surely the Tories can 
applaud us for investing in higher education.  The Tories 
promised to make CPP self-financing, which we did with Bill C-2, 
and called for the cash floor of the CHST to be raised to $12.5 
billion.  Lo and behold we have done just that and I would expect 
the Conservatives to applaud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tory plan for growth asked for the basic exemption to rise. 
It asked for the 3% surtax, the Tory gift to the taxpayers, to 
end and for a tax credit for interest on student loans.  All 
these measures are in our 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members of the House to support our budget because it 
is not only balanced from a fiscal point of view.  It is balanced 
in terms of providing tax relief, debt reduction and much needed 
reinvestment in social programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member across the way cites a number of positive highlights from 
the budget.  One of the things he concentrated on and pointed out 
was the fact that reducing EI premiums and the payroll burden 
would stimulate jobs, put people back to work and have long term 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the huge surplus that the EI program shows and the fact 
that less than 40% of unemployed workers now qualify for EI, I 
would suggest energy should have been directed toward increasing 
the eligibility or lowering the bar for eligibility so more 
unemployed workers qualify.  This would put more money into the 
system and have more unemployed people actually spending and 
thereby stimulating the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What empirical evidence could the member cite to illustrate that 
dropping the payroll burden by 20 cents per $100 from $2.90 per 
hundred to $2.70 would result in stimulating job growth or 
showing a lasting benefit, given the flip side of the coin?  With 
a $750 million per month surplus, we should be allowing more 
unemployed people to collect benefits rather than be cut off due 
to the stringent eligibility rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me address the preamble 
to the question.  I agree with the hon. member.  I think an 
unemployment system that covers only 42% is a real problem.  The 
government and all members of the House need to turn our 
attention in a creative way to making constructive suggestions on 
how to change the EI system so that it covers more Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think we should learn from the lessons of the past. 
Perhaps writing someone a cheque on a biweekly basis may or may 
not make them more job ready for the economy that is coming as we 
move into the next century.  We have to find ways to use the EI 
fund in a more creative manner.  We have to find ways to use it 
so that it supports appropriate training or retraining in the 
adult workforce and people can find meaningful long term jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By using the surplus in valid legitimate ways which will help 
people find lifelong jobs that pay decent wages is something we 
need to turn our minds to.  I agree with the hon. member on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument about whether to lower premiums or increase 
benefits to unemployed people is somewhat a phoney debate.  We 
can afford to do both.  Certainly we do not want to lower 
premiums to the point where we have to raise them again if the 
economy goes into a recession.  We have to be mindful that this 
is the worst time to be raising premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They ask for empirical evidence to show that when premiums are 
lowered jobs are increased.  We must remember that we compete at 
the level of the firm, a starting point in economics.  When the 
cost to firms of doing business is lowered it gives them the 
opportunity to make investments, to expand their production and 
to hire people.

a well known fact that the Minister of Finance is a cautious 
person. He underestimates his revenues and overestimates his 
expenditures, with the result that he has a margin of somewhere 
between 8% and 12%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is also applying a questionable budgeting technique 
by including in the current budget the $2.5 billion that will be 
used only in two or three years for the millennium scholarship 
fund. This, in my opinion, is a questionable technique.

The principle is, of course, to make taxpayers pay for the 
services to which they are entitled, but they should pay in the 
year that the expenditures are made, or in the year that it is 
decided to make such expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance will end up with a budget surplus in two

the numbers would look even better.  The surging rate of

the hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley.  That 
gives the folks over there a little less time to talk to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no longer enough for the government to table legislation 
in the House and then defend the legislation by talking about the 
opposition parties.  It is more appropriate to defend the 
legislation. I might add that the sooner some members realize 
this, the sooner they will become better debaters in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about values when it comes to the amendment 
to the motion which actually criticizes the government for 
failing to follow generally accepted accounting principles from 
which it declares deficits, surpluses or a zero balance as it is 
called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The values in that come from many places.  I remember some of 
the values my mother gave me.  They were such things as do not 
lie, pay as you go, and live within your means.  Those are values 
in my case that came from the maritimes.  Those are values that 
should exist throughout the House.  I find them sadly lacking 
when it comes to some of the submissions made by the other side, 
the Liberal government in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the values that come from Rotary International, 
of which I am a member.  Is it the truth?  Is it fair to all 
concerned?  There are other significant tests of values.  One has 
to wonder, when the government does what it did with this 
millennium fund, where those values come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout discussions about the budget in the House I go back 
to the people at home who have certain expectations. 
They have children in school, in post-secondary education, for 
which they are paying a considerable amount of money.  These 
young people are taking out student loans.  I have two children 
in post-secondary institutions, one with a significant student 
loan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at those kind of issues and the people back home, 
issues like getting jobs for these young people, we really have 
to wonder where this government comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the millennium fund.  I will describe some of the flaws 
in it in a moment, but I have to ask whether it was just one huge 
PR exercise or really an attempt to help the vast majority of 
students in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people who do not know, there is a difference in this 
land between a scholarship and a bursary.  I actually had the 
pleasure in my community of establishing a scholarship bursary 
foundation fund which carries in it well over a $1 million today. 
The difference is this.  A scholarship in this land is basically 
an award given to a young person on the basis of their GPA, their 
grade point average, or their academic credentials.  It has 
little regard for the financial need of the student.  Whereas a 
bursary is based on financial need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is about to award students with a scholarship 
based on their grade point average.  There is nothing wrong with 
that, in totality, at times.  However, the government has totally 
ignored the needs of financially impaired students.  I can assure 
members, having been in an educational organization at one time 
in my life, that those with the highest GPA in school districts 
end up getting awards, basically from their communities.  They do 
rather well at that.  It would have been much better if the 
government had helped the students who do not have the financial 
capability to even get into university, much less proceed through 
university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government announced that there was a $2 billion to $3 
billion scholarship millennium fund.  At the same time it 
suggested that it had balanced the books.  We are going to go 
through this academic exercise of balancing the books for the 
next three years.  The government will say “Look folks, we 
balanced the books”.  But there is a big difference that the 
folks back home do not seem to understand about this government. 
Balancing the books means zero.  If this government ends up 
toward the end of the year with a $3 billion, $5 billion or $7 
billion surplus, all it has to do is spend that $3 billion or $5 
billion or $7 billion on whatever exercise it wants and stand up 
at the end of the year and say “We balanced the books”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Get real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  A member over there, who obviously does 
not understand what I a talking about, says “Get real”.  The 
facts are this.  That is 100% accurate.  As an accountant I have 
seen it time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government is doing is saying “We will bring all this 
down to zero, but we are not going to tell you that we could have 
had a $10 billion or $15 billion surplus.  We are going to blow 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year it said that it would create a millennium fund, make 
the Liberals look real good, make the Prime Minister look real 
good, and at the same time stand up in the House of Commons and 
say “Look, we have balanced the books”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  What happens next year if we are headed for a 
$10 billion or $15 billion surplus?

this House and sanctimoniously talk about balancing the books? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in for a lot of discussion on this very issue.  It is 
fact, according to the generally accepted accounting principles, 
that the millennium fund should not have been charged to prior 
year accounting balance sheets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The auditor general agrees with you, 
Randy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  The auditor general, as my colleague 
says, agrees with me.  It is funny.  We accountants have a 
strange way of accounting.  If we spend it, it goes on the books 
in the year we spend it.  If we do not spend it, it does not go 
on the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government seems to think that it can announce something 
which it will spend in the future, which is considered a 
contingent liability, but charge it to last year's books to 
reduce the surplus.  That is exactly what it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the millennium fund for a moment.  It is a 
scholarship, like I said before.  It is given to those with the 
highest academic performance.  It is not given to those who have 
financial need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask any of these students who are sitting around in this place. 
They know what I am talking about.  There is not a student in a 
school district in this country with the very highest of GPA upon 
graduation who does not get a scholarship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question what this government is really looking for.  If this 
government is truly interested in helping young people, perhaps 
it should consider putting more money into the pockets of their 
parents who can then give it to their children, just like I would 
do and just like I have done.  It would be much more appreciated. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was interested in the member's comments about the accounting 
treatment of the millennium scholarship fund.  It certainly has 
been an issue which has captured the attention of the House, as 
well as the auditor general and the public accounts committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to me that there is a technical problem that is being 
addressed with regard to the proposed treatment of the millennium 
scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, as I understand it, if the government were to 
distribute the scholarships out of the innovation fund of the 
foundation, it could have, and still could today, disbursed the 
funds directly to the innovation foundation and charged them to 
the operations of the current fiscal year because the innovation 
foundation is a not for profit corporation, a separate legal 
entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I understand that the moneys have not been given to 
the millennium scholarship foundation, which is the proposal, is 
that the foundation cannot be legally established and 
incorporated until after the budget is passed by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member will probably also know, with regard to the 
auditor general, provided that an action is dealt with and passed 
in the budget prior to the closing of the books and the issuance 
of the statements, that will satisfy his requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that extra bit of information and the fact that if it were 
paid through the innovation foundation as opposed to the 
millennium scholarship foundation, would the member not agree 
that what we are really talking about is simply timing and has 
nothing to do with the substance of the legal liability which the 
government has declared in its budget?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess with accrual 
accounting or even cash based accounting timing is everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the fund should have been established would have been to 
take the money and declare it a surplus or take the money and 
identify it in a fund.  Yes, that could have been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I think the member is missing another point.  The point is 
that this government had a surplus of approximately $3 billion. 
I truly believe that this government made every attempt to bury 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is, as I have described it, what are we going to do 
next year?  If we know now that we do not have deficits to get 
rid of, then surely the surplus should be even more next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are my colleagues in the Reform Party going to have to sit here 
daily investigating the books, trying to find out where this 
government is burying funds or promoting their friends or 
providing patronage pots rather than at the year end declaring a 
surplus?  Once a surplus is declared, of course, then comes 
accountability time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is going to want to say “We don't think you should 
spend it this way or reserve it.  We think you should pay down 
the debt.  We think you should start giving tax breaks”.  These 
are the very issues that this government has a problem with. That 
is why the government is trying to use any kind of surplus 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is clear to me.  The appropriate accounting method, 
the morally appropriate method, to deal with this would have been 
to have declared a surplus and then manage and spend the money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the chance to 
comment on the budget and the supplementary estimates and to 
bring a dose of reality to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals deserve the credit for bringing in the first balanced 
budget in 30 years.  It just goes to show how incompetent the 
Mulroney Tories were when they failed to balance the budget in 
similar circumstances during the mid-1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reinforces the incompetence of both the former Liberal 
government and the Tory government when we have a national debt 
that is over $583 billion.  It is because of the incompetence and 
the negligence of these governments that we are in this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to continue the discussion which my colleague just ended 
on the surplus.  This budget should have shown a $3.2 billion 
surplus, but the Liberals chose to use it for new spending.  They 
chose to put $2.5 billion into the millennium fund.  While 
Canadians support funding of essential programs like health and 
education, the Liberals have used the millennium fund to hide 
their deviousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accounting has been brought into challenge by my colleague. 
I would suggest that it is very plainly a manipulation of 
taxpayers' money.  The government has taken $2.5 billion out of 
the current budget even though this money is designated to be 
spent two years down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has criticized this imaginative bookkeeping 
and the government has defended its action.  What a surprise.  If 
the government truly believes that this is good accounting 
practice, then I challenge it to allow all Canadians and Canadian 
businesses to use the same accounting practices in the real 
world, that is, to write off expenditures before they occur on 
their income taxes.  Regular Canadians would go to jail if they 
tried to do the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the amount of support the Liberals are talking 
about.  The millennium scholarship fund will offer up to 100,000 
post-secondary students grants averaging $3,000 a year.  I had 
not realized the difference between a scholarship and bursary and 
that causes even more concern because these grants were supposed 
to help low and middle income students. 
Now that is under question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one considers that there are 1.7 million full time or part 
time students in post-secondary education across the country, the 
millennium scholarship fund will only support 6%.  Does this 
government honestly feel that 94% of post-secondary students are 
in the high income bracket? When this system is implemented there 
will be a lot of disappointed and financially strapped students 
who were given the understanding that help would be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government choose this particular avenue?  Why did 
it choose to only help 6% of the students?  I can only imagine it 
is because if it transferred the money to the provinces under the 
Canada health and social transfer, the federal government would 
not really get any recognition.  I think the government was 
concerned over the photo op when handing out the cheques. If it 
transferred the money to the provincial governments to use for 
the benefit of all students, it would not get this photo-op. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major problem with this is the ego of the Prime 
Minister.  He wanted to have a legacy to leave behind.  This 
country cannot afford to pay for an individual's ego. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have with this budget is that it does not 
address the very serious problem of taxes and bracket creep. This 
is an area where the government continues to draw more and more 
dollars out of the taxpayers' pockets. Bracket creep occurs when 
an individual's pay rises to a point where it enters a higher tax 
bracket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While salaries have inched up over the past six years, tax 
brackets have not.  By law, tax brackets are only adjusted when 
the consumer price index rises by 3% or more in any given year. 
This has not happened for the past six years. Inflation has risen 
9% over the same period of time. Thus individuals whose salaries 
have just kept up with inflation often find themselves in a 
higher tax bracket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his budget speech the Minister of Finance made it clear that 
it is deliberate and that he intends to continue with this 
practice.  He stated “Upon coming into office, the government 
and the Bank of Canada agreed to hold inflation inside a range of 
1% to 3% to the end of 1998.  That policy has worked. That is why 
we are announcing today that we will extend the current agreement 
with the Bank of Canada for a further three years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has made it clear that it intends on screwing 
the Canadian taxpayer in this fashion.  If this is not the case 
then I once again challenge the Liberals to introduce legislation 
to eliminate the 3% threshold for indexing the tax brackets. We 
know they will not because they want the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me outline how much money we are talking about.  This year 
the Liberals will have collected an additional $800 million in 
taxes through bracket creep.  Next year it will be $1.5 billion. 
By fiscal year 2000-01 the amount will be $3.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians already pay enough taxes.  In British Columbia the 
average family income is $57,949.  The average tax bill in 
British Columbia is $28,461.  That is an awful lot of tax from 
one family. While all Canadians need tax relief, it is nowhere 
needed more than in British Columbia.  With the highest marginal 
tax rate in North America, it is driving business out of the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency sits on the American border. I cannot begin to 
count the number of businesses that have moved 20 or 30 
kilometres south because of taxation.  Thousands of jobs have 
been lost. Millions of dollars in tax revenues have been lost. It 
is this departure of capital and jobs that has led to British 
Columbia's woes.  Responsibility belongs to both the federal and 
the provincial governments which are taxing Canadians out of 
house and home.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is putting far too little back into that 
province. Last year, transfers from the federal government 
accounted for only 9.7% of provincial revenues, the lowest in the 
country. Other provinces received much higher amounts from the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty-three per cent of Newfoundland's provincial budget comes 
from the federal government.  For New Brunswick that figure is 
45.5%.  For Quebec, 17.6% comes from federal coffers and 31.8% of 
Manitoba's provincial budget comes from federal revenue.  The 
Canadian average is 16.9%.  British Columbia's is 9.7%.  I 
suggest that British Columbia is getting shafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic provinces received an average of $2,000 per capita 
from the federal government. Quebec received $927 per citizen 
from the federal government.  British Columbia, lo and behold, 
received only $524 per citizen from the federal government. Now 
that British Columbia is entering a recession, it deserves to be 
recognized as being in a situation of need by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we get from the federal government?  “It is the 
provincial government's fault.  It is the fault of the Asian 
economy.  It is everybody's fault but ours.  And by the way, 
don't count on us for any support or help”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is so very quick to take responsibility 
for the economic upturn and to take credit for the boon in other 
parts of the country, but when it comes to accepting the blame 
when an area of the country enters a recession, the government 
runs a hundred miles.  Liberal hypocrisy in its purest form; they 
accept all the credit but they deny all the blame. The Liberals 
cannot have it both ways.  It will not bode well for the Canadian 
economy if this is going to be their approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown that it can cruise through economic 
good times, that it can garner a surplus and use it for new 
spending.  But when the economic cycle starts to go downhill, as 
it is doing in British Columbia, this government shows that it 
has no idea of how to handle it.  That is very scary for all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talked about the 
millennium fund.  It was announced in the Speech from the Throne, 
in the budget and it is in the legislation today.  It is part of 
the activities for 1997-98.  We made it quite clear that we pay 
for what we announce.  We pay our bills.  We tend to pay as we 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not really the accounting issue which the Reform Party has 
a problem with.  The real issue it has a problem with is that we 
are spending $2.5 billion to improve the lives of students.  The 
Reform Party has a problem with putting money in the hands of 
those students.  That is really the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the hon. member more of an accounting question.  The 
books close March 31.  Adjustments are essentially made in 
August.  At the request of the auditor general those adjustments 
are audited and scrutinized. Any surplus that comes over and 
above those adjustments goes directly to the debt, just as it has 
gone to the deficit year after year after year.  Does the hon. 
member know that?  She is arguing about the fact that we are not 
being transparent.  We cannot get more transparent.  If our 
transparency goes beyond the requirements of public accounting, 
so be it.  I will let Canadians judge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting how the 
Liberals can look at accounting in one way for themselves and in 
a different way for the average Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance.  If as a business person I decided to buy a 
building in three years and I wanted to earmark money I had 
earned for that building, would the government allow me to use 
that as an expenditure? 
I would think not.  I would think that would be part of my 
income, my profit as a company.  I would pay taxes on it.  Then I 
would report the spending of it in the year which I spent it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clear with this millennium fund.  If the government 
had not planned new spending on a new millennium fund there would 
have been a $3 billion surplus.  That is what this government 
does not want to address with the average Canadian, with the 
taxpayer.  This was not a balanced budget; this was a surplus 
budget.  This government chose to spend the surplus in a way it 
felt would get the government more brownie points with the 
Canadian taxpayers, the Canadian voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants transparency, it should talk with 
Canadians about a millennium fund and see if Canadians support a 
millennium fund over federal government dollars going into the 
provincial coffers for education.  Under the Constitution 
education is a mandate of the provinces.  If the federal 
government wants to transfer money to the provinces for 
education, then so be it.  But for the federal government to be 
spending surplus dollars and hiding it from the taxpayers, that 
is not right no matter how we cut it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given her concern about the provinces and their fiscal plight, I

I will not say that we have it because there is no affiliation 
between the federal and provincial parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it amazing that a member of the New Democratic Party 
would even stand up and comment on the economic situation in 
British Columbia.  The responsibility of that has to be shared

positive swing because of NAFTA and the free trade agreement. The 
reasons companies are going south, and I have talked to many of 
them and I have talked to many individuals who are taking their 
money south, are high taxes and the economic climate that has 
been created by an NDP government.  High taxes are driving our 
businesses and our jobs south of the border.  For individuals 
from the New Democratic Party to say it is free trade and NAFTA

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hear Bloc members continually spilling their venom and 
making all sorts of disparaging remarks about the government, 
especially by attacking the integrity of one of its most eminent 
members: the Minister of Finance. It would certainly be a good 
idea to attach one of these bags to each seat as a precaution, to 
be on the safe side. They may come handy every time Bloc members 
stand up to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is for sure, every time I hear— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Lévis, on a point of 
order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been listening 
to the member for Bourassa and I think he has gone too far. Props 
are not allowed on members' desks and he is talking about 
unparliamentary props. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member did refer to such things but 
did not use a prop in the House, which is against the rules, as 
the hon. member rightly pointed out. The member used unusual 
language, but I do not think his remarks were unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, sometimes the truth hurts. The 
member for Chambly said I had no manners whatsoever, so I say to 
him that I will save that.  I will not forget it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really upsets me is that each time the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot rises to speak, he speaks about members' 
lack of integrity.  He spoke of almost falsifying and almost 
lying.  Not only is he uttering nonsense, but he said that ethics 
counsellor Howard Wilson was being paid by the Prime Minister's 
office to save the Minister of Finance's neck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a mistake, because he should know he reports to the 
deputy minister for industry.  Those who have nothing to say 
keep attacking members' integrity.  He is undermining not only 
his own cause, but this institution as well. 
When it suits the members of the Bloc Quebecois, they pull out 
their hair and question this institution's integrity.  When it 
does not, they get upset and raise points of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to speak about the budget, unlike the members 
opposite.  There are some important things in the budget.  It is 
an excellent budget, as the member for Frontenac—Mégantic has 
said.  It is true.  Why?  Because it is historic.  We paid off 
the $42 billion in deficit that was there when we formed the 
government in 1993.  Canadians have made sacrifices.  The result 
is a zero deficit budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Delivered on the backs of the unemployed and the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, one thing is sure.  This is the 
start.  I was in France at the beginning of March.  What were 
they talking about there? 
The Canadian miracle. French senators and members of the 
Assemblée nationale asked us “But how did you achieve this?” 
People complimented us. They said “What a brilliant way to manage 
the budget”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Quebec government, the Bloc's head office, listened a 
little better and was on the same wavelength as the public—but 
things will soon improve, because Quebec will have a Liberal 
government after the upcoming provincial election—we would 
definitely not have any problems in the health and education 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike sovereignists, who hold referendums, who continually talk 
about the Constitution, and who say it is the federal 
government's fault, we have taken our responsibilities and we 
have the figures to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of fairness was raised, but it is a start. Nothing is 
perfect in this world. 
We had to pay $42 billion and find fair and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> At the expense of the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> —equitable solutions to achieve a zero 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we also did something that hurt sovereignists even more. We 
talked directly to young people. We decided to invest in 
knowledge and to make sure young people can reduce their debt 
load and also—thanks to this government's vision—have their 
place in the sun, like the baby boomers before them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course they are going to come up with examples.  They are 
always going to come up with an editorial.  They will tell us 
that the president of such and such a union opposed it.  But 
those of us from Quebec know how it works:  some plant, some 
little pequiste, some little separatist expresses his opinion. 
They are good at it.  There is no denying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we watched the news, what was the first thing we saw about 
the millennium fund?  Three students from no particular party 
were interviewed at random.  Members opposite will say that 
journalists are federalists.  The young people were asked  “What 
do you think of the millennium fund?”  What was their unanimous 
response? 
They replied “What we want is not to get involved in these 
squabbles.  The important thing is that, if we can benefit, 
then, yes, we will”.  The moral of the story is that the 
government has understood that sometimes it is preferable to 
speak directly to students, to speak directly to young people, 
because they understand how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite are also going to tell us we are interfering in 
education.  We are not.  Access to education and reducing student 
indebtedness are shared responsibilities.  I would like to remind 
the House that the loans and scholarships program was created 
with assistance from the federal government, and each year we pay 
a percentage.  They have decided to run things their way.  We 
have no objection to that.  We will sit down with them and use 
the same parameters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing—and I represent this generation—is that young 
people be given an opportunity to have access to education. 
When young people graduate from universities, CEGEPs and high 
schools, they are in debt. Young people want to enjoy equal 
opportunities and to be part of society. They want to join the 
workforce as soon as they graduate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt reduction strategy includes seven components. There 
are, of course, the Canadian scholarships. The millennium fund is 
great. About 100,000 young Canadians will receive scholarships. 
The government also wants to increase support for advanced 
research and for graduate students, by increasing the budget of 
the three granting councils. We will help graduate students to 
better manage their debt, through a tax break for the interest 
paid on student loans, and through improvements to the Canada 
Student Loans Program. How can anyone be opposed to these 
initiatives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard what the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot had to say. He 
said they had been energized. Does this mean they had no energy 
before? It is their problem. He said they had been energized, 
that they would keep a watchful eye and not let anything go 
through. The sovereignists can go ahead and tear their shirts. We 
can give them the addresses of some stores that sell shirts at a 
good price. Given the number of shirts they tear these days, it 
will still cost them a bundle, but it will probably benefit the 
shirt industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is certain is that young people will realize the importance 
of the government's action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also being accused of not caring about the elderly and 
the handicapped, and of not providing tax relief for the poor. 
What is extraordinary in this budget—and I will give you an 
example because they will surely have questions or criticisms for 
me—is that we are the first government to eliminate a tax. We 
said “We will remove the 3% surtax that was put in place by the 
Conservative government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is not a sign of credibility, a clear demonstration that 
this government is listening to the people, then I do not know 
what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rely on the public's judgment. Many of my constituents phoned 
me. I spend a great deal of time in my riding. 
My constituents did not criticize the budget. Quite the 
contrary. They said it was a good budget, a good start, and that 
the priority was to eliminate the deficit. Then, we should 
preserve and strengthen existing social benefits—which is what 
we did in this budget—and tackle the debt. The facts speak for 
themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That just does not take the cake as far as I am concerned but in 
today's <I>Quorum</I> we see that even the people, including some

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see where all the gravy is coming from that this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will tell my hon. colleague 
that this budget clearly contains tax relief measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are we investing in knowledge, but a decision has also 
been made to make a substantial increase in development, in 
research councils.  These are things that will have an impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also remind the House that lightening the debt load will 
also have a psychological effect on motivating young people.  It 
is hard for a young person not to be able to see the light at the 
end of the tunnel.  We have a saying in my part of the country 
“If you're not a revolutionary at 20, you'll end up a pastry

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are giving opportunities to young people.  I believe in 
dynamism.  The budget is not the only thing.  We have also 
introduced measures relating to small and medium size 
businesses, via my hon. colleague, the member for Outremont and 
Minister responsible for the Economic Development Agency of 
Canada, which in conjunction with this budget will enable us to 
create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my hon. colleague that this is working amazingly well, 
as close to one million jobs have been created in the past five 
years. These are facts that attest to good management.

actually ensuring that other individuals perhaps did not get up 
and ask any questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member if he can describe for us what the 
impact this is having in the province of Quebec. The Bloc is here 
and purports to represent the people from Quebec.  But let me ask 
the hon. member who is from Quebec and who so eloquently 
demonstrated in his speech the benefits of this budget if he 
could continue for a couple of minutes and speak to why this 
budget is receiving such support in the province of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> An excellent question, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof that truth hurts and that the budget has had an impact

constantly whining and making comments.  I understand how 
extraordinary a budget it was.

venom—it is clear it has a positive impact and represents a fine 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have to understand one thing.  Quebeckers look at the 
financial impact, the impact in terms of bursaries, for example.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the budget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let me congratulate the Prime Minister for his 
leadership on this issue and of course the finance minister for 
his fortitude and the vision he has shown toward leading us to a 
balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, I take this opportunity to congratulate and 
thank the Canadian people because this is indeed their budget, 
their reward.  All their hard work has paid off in a balanced 
budget; 1998 marks the first time in 30 years that a federal 
Government of Canada has journeyed into this area. Before we get 
to the facts and figures, I want for a moment to outline how we 
got to where we are today by taking us back to 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected in 1993 the deficit was $42 billion and 
the country's finances were in disarray.  This meant high 
interest rates and of course fewer jobs for all Canadians along 
with lower revenues overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to a very dismal economic situation.  Our future did 
not look good but the people in 1993 gave us a mandate because we 
gave a very clear message of what we wanted to do.  We also told 
them at that time that it was not going to be easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1994 we introduced a framework for a better 
economic policy, a guide that would dictate just what this 
government was going to do, how it was going to do it and what it 
was not going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 budget put that framework into action.  All of us took 
the plunge at that time.  The 1995 budget set the country on a 
course of fiscal responsibility and government renewal.  We all 
knew that these decisions were not going to be easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reduction in government spending was unprecedented in 
Canadian history.  The budget not only overhauled how government 
works but what government does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We reduced program spending from $120 billion to $108 billion. 
In short, the 1995 budget initiated that overall departmental 
spending be cut by 19% in three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 budget also made it clear that subsidies would decline 
by 60% in three years.  The government made the move to 
privatize, for example, commercialized government operations 
where it felt feasible and very appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated, we changed government operations as a business for 
future generations.  We responded to the need for more than an 
effective system of provincial transfers.  For example, the 
Canada social transfer made it possible for the provinces to be 
more flexible and respond to the needs of the people rather than 
the flexible rules that existed in the past. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each province has different needs.  However, the conditions of 
the Canada Health Act were and still are being maintained.  As 
the Prime Minister emphasized just the other day on television, 
health is one issue that we are adamant on maintaining for all 
Canadians.  For this government these conditions remain 
fundamental and non-negotiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also decided in 1995 to make some very different choices.  We 
chose to work in favour of a strong economy and a stronger 
country.  Many governments have known and talked about the need 
for reform and renewal.  Our government chose to stop talking and 
to start acting. It was very tough but we made it happen and here 
we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a moment let us fast forward to 1998, the first budget of 
the new mandate.  The economic recovery was indeed remarkable. In 
1993 the deficit was $42 billion.  Who would have believed we 
would be sitting here today talking about a zero deficit, a 
balanced budget?  We have been applauded not just within Canada 
but beyond our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the unemployment rate was 11.4% and growing.  Today, 
when we look at the more recent statistics, it is almost 8.5% to 
8.6%.  If we start breaking that down regionally, in the greater 
Toronto area it is even lower than 8.5%.  I believe it is just 
over 7%.  Calgary, for example, is looking for people to hire 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in 1993 interest rates were at an all time high.  They were 
definitely in the double digits.  They are now hovering around 
7%.  Not too long ago they were even as low as 6% to 6.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The burden of debt in 1993 was very unmanageable.  Now, with a 
zero deficit, we can start chipping away at the debt.  Anybody 
who can add one and one will know that we first had to address 
the deficit before we could start addressing the problem of the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget puts in place the debt repayment plan.  We have 
actually paid down $13 billion in market debt in the past year 
alone.  In the next three years we predict that we will be able 
to bring down the debt by an additional $9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy is now on the move upwards and growing.  On the 
average in 1997 the economy had an overall growth of 3.5%, the 
best pace since 1994.  In fact, our economy has managed to climb 
its way out from the financial basement of the G-7 to being 
number one and applauded worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job creation has rebounded very strongly since 1993.  More than 
one million jobs have been created since 1993.  This is not 
according to what we as politicians are saying or what people are 
saying.  This is according to what the statisticians are saying 
and the people who are working out there today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer confidence is back and strong.  Canadians are feeling 
very confident about their economy and about their country as a 
whole.  With this balanced budget we are finally able to 
introduce initiatives that will leave more money in the pockets 
of all Canadians who have worked so hard and have been so patient 
with us and this government.  That was reflected with the return 
mandate to continue the programs that were commenced in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has kept its promise to reduce taxes once the 
budget was balanced.  We know that in 1993 we inherited payroll 
contributions of $3.03.  Since then they have been going down 
steadily to about $2.70 where they stand today.  The 1998 budget 
has targeted tax relief to those who need it the most, low and 
middle income Canadians.  As I said, by July 1998, as the budget 
states, almost 400,000 low and middle income individuals will be 
removed from the tax rolls and an additional 4.6 million 
taxpayers will pay less income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me stress that in Ontario alone 91% of all taxpayers will 
benefit from tax relief.  Catherine Swift, president of the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said: “Putting more 
money into people's hands is good for the economy”.  That is 
what this budget has commenced doing.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very clearly there are modest tax reliefs right now but it is 
only the first step, as the finance minister and Prime Minister 
have stated, and as we all have been stating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our economy continues to improve taxes will be reduced even 
further.  This year's balanced budget alone means we can again 
start investing in our future, particularly in the areas that 
Canadians have told us are their priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 80% of all new spending will go to health and 
education through increased transfers to the provinces.  The 1995 
budget made some very difficult decisions with regard to health. 
We did not have many choices at that time.  Our backs were up 
against the wall.  In 1998 we had a choice and we chose to follow 
the recommendations of the national forum on health and increase 
the Canada health and social transfer cash floor from $11 billion 
to $12.5 billion, an additional $1.5 billion on the forum's 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure will provide the provinces with an additional $7 
billion in cash over the next six years to fund health care, 
education and social assistance.  It is now up to the provinces 
to make the choices of how they spend their moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will they continue to cut funds from health care in order to 
keep their election campaign promises of tax relief?  In Ontario 
alone the Tory tax cut agenda will reduce provincial revenues by 
$4.8 billion per year.  This is more than five times the $850 
million a year in federal transfer cuts to that province. 
Canadians should realize that the province's insistence of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a 
major element of the illicit narcotics trade and its partner, 
transnational crime, is the phenomenon of money laundering.  It 
has been estimated by the United Nations drug control program 
that the annual amount of money laundered as a result of narcotic 
drug trafficking alone is in the order of $400 billion U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering is a major international problem not only 
because of the magnitude of the sums involved but also because of 
the affect those sums have on the macro economy and on the 
financial sector, particularly financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a continuing concern that financial crimes and money 
laundering are occurring with varying degrees of regularity and 
that some affected or vulnerable governments have still not 
criminalized this illicit activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International standards against money laundering require 
comprehensive legislation, financial regulation and law 
enforcement mechanisms to combat the problem.  Experience shows 
that effective action can and must be taken now.

for Quebec's budget not being balanced yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Liberal Party of Quebec, which sat on its hands 
during the nine years it was in power in Quebec, is not to 
blame. The Liberal Party of Canada, which eliminated the federal 
deficit by shovelling 52% of its spending cuts into the backyards 
of the provinces, is not to blame either. No, the separatists are 
to blame, according to the minister. 
Go ahead, pin it on the sovereignists, we can take it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me however is that, to replace Daniel Johnson, 
whose party was responsible for the largest deficit ever in 
Quebec's history, the Liberals are set to crown the leader of the 
party responsible for the largest federal deficit in Canada's 
history, the leader of the Conservative Party. That is scary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federalists are the ones who have plunged Quebec and Canada

scientific advice on conservation, it failed repeatedly to deal 
with foreign overfishing, it has presided over the collapse of 
the east coast cod fishery and now it is failing the west coast 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is the Prime Minister going to ask to resign over these

both?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the report talks about the collapse of the fisheries in 
the Atlantic, for example, 12 years ago.  Members of the 
committee looked at the original decision. We were not in 
government at that time. We have put in place some programs to 
help the fishing community in eastern Canada and the Reform Party 
opposed the TAGS program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the fisheries minister was asked why so many of his bureaucrats 
work in Ottawa and so few close to the ocean.  He answered: 
“Ontario pays a substantial amount of the taxes in this country, 
and simply people moving away from Ottawa and moving jobs from 
one province to the other will not necessarily be an easy task”. 
This is a big fish story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the fisheries minister care so much about his own 
department and so little about fishermen's jobs in Vancouver or 
St. John's? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have always been in favour of transferring jobs.  In 
fact, when I was president of the Treasury Board I moved from 
Ottawa to Surrey, B.C. the taxation division of the department of 
revenue and almost 3,000 people working there.  We have done it 
on many occasions and I hope we will be able to do it in the 
future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in 1991 the Prime Minister told the House: “Every minister in 
the cabinet I preside over will have to take full responsibility 
for what is going on in his department.  If there is any bungling 
the minister will have to take full responsibility”.  The 
Liberal dominated fisheries committee has uncovered an ocean of 
bungling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Prime Minister demand that the fisheries minister

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the fisheries in the maritimes 11 years ago.  The minister was 
not there at that time.  He has now received a report which he 
will study.  We will all study the report and make changes as 
quickly as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the Reform Party that the problems 
occurred when there was not even one Reform Party member in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the weekend, Liberal supporters did their best to show 
openness toward Quebec by covering up plan B, but it took the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs less than a day to bring 
them back into line. The day after this four-day Liberal 
convention, he had already renounced the good intentions 
expressed during the weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that the real government spokesperson on 
the issue has indicated that the fun is over by making his

Are we to understand that the weekend party is over and that the

<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have been saying the same thing all along. We have always 
explained clearly the headway we were making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, like the other 
ministers, talks about the federal agenda globally. The Bloc 
Quebecois refuses to recognize that we have transferred manpower, 
that we have improved the situation on five, six or seven issues, 
that we have passed a resolution in the House of Commons 
recognizing the distinct character of Quebec, that we have passed 
a bill giving a veto to the five regions. Each time, the Bloc 
Quebecois voted no. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
beginning of the convention, the Prime Minister made a candid 
remark, stating that there was not plan B, that it did not 
exist, that it had been made up by the press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister stand behind this kind of statement 
when, as soon as the Liberal weekend party was over, the

take over all the functions currently available to all Canadians 
without the agreement of the federal government. I presented an 
argument to this effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition leader can see a flaw in my argument, he

Intergovernmental Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his role as adviser to the Prime Minister not so long ago, his 
theory was to make Quebec suffer.  Yesterday, the day after the 
Liberal show on the weekend, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs went back to his old line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that it is not the Prime Minister or the 
other ministers who set the tone in the government, but rather 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs?  Whose idea it is to 
punish Quebec and who gave us plan B.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, I ask you to be very careful in 
choosing your words. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs made the statement, in case he has 
forgotten, on March 15, 1995 in Toronto before a group of 
intellectuals.  He said “The more it hurts, the less support 
there will be for sovereignty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he now going to deny that his entire speech and the 
government's plan B are based on his long held belief?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I still believe the member to be an honest man and I 
will give him the opportunity to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two days later, a correction appeared in the same papers to the 
effect that I had never spoken these words ascribed to me at the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, on another matter, what I said yesterday I said because 
I am a Quebecker and because I do not want my society to find 
itself in a situation that flies in the face of democracy in 
which a government would be trying to grab all jurisdictions not 
its own in an unacceptable state of confusion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are approximately three ways of attacking the problem. 
First, Canada is working very actively to amend the optional

international covenant.  Second, through the work of CIDA and 
other organizations, we are developing programs to help end the 
use of child soldiers in many countries by enabling them to 
return to their communities to get an education.  Third, it is 
important that a number of private organizations and Parliament 
speak out against the vicious practice of using our young people 
in combat.  This is something that Canada can once again take a

Affairs could answer why the federal government is not prepared 
to set the ball rolling with respect to the abolition of the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that the House of Commons cannot do this on its 
own.  However, we do have an amending process.  We could begin 
with a resolution in this House to abolish the existing 
undemocratic Senate and put the provinces and other parties on 
the spot as to where they stand on the issue of abolishing the 
Senate.  We can always recreate it in a democratic forum if we 
want to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question, once again, is for the minister of fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that recommendation No. 2, as was stated by one of 
my colleagues, would cease giving permission to Canadian 
companies to hire foreign vessels and foreign crews to catch fish 
in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reply from the parliamentary secretary was:  Does the PC 
Party want to put people out of work in Nova Scotia?  What we 
want to do is put people to work in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick 
and across the whole of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the thousands of Atlantic Canadians who are 
unemployed, will the minister inform this House and Atlantic 
Canadians that he too agrees with recommendation No. 2? 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I clearly said 
earlier, the minister will respond to the specifics of the 
recommendations in this report at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I have to spell out to the member that there are certain 
international obligations.  If we kick out the foreign fleets we 
will lose the leverage to influence the decision to protect world 
fish stocks in a sustainable fashion.  There are, in fact, 
thousands of workers who depend on the fish that are caught by 
those foreign fleets for processing jobs in Canada.  We do not 
want to destroy those jobs.

justice minister has refused to inform this House when she will 
bring in amendments to the Young Offenders Act. I ask her again. 
When will she put public safety first and bring in amendments to 
the Young Offenders Act?  When will she do this?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>POINTS OF ORDER 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order with regard to a matter that occurred 
in the justice committee.  It is a matter that only this House 
can address and is a matter of interest to all members of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I recognize that committees are masters of their own 
proceedings, the justice committee has gone beyond its authority 
by ignoring an order of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 10, 1998 at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights the chair ruled that a motion passed by this House on 
October 30, 1997 did not bind the committee. This is confirmed in 
the letter sent from the chair of the justice committee to the 
sponsor of the motion, the member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley. In the letter the chair states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enclosed you will find a copy of the order of reference on 
impaired driving dated October 30, 1997.  As you can see, no time 
line was imposed on the justice committee. This project has been 
considered by both our steering committee and the full committee 
in planning our future business—we will not reach this project 
before June. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The order of reference given the committee was contained in two 
motions. The first motion which carried unanimously read as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call on the government to bring forward a motion 
pursuant to Standing Order 68(4)(a), to instruct the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights to prepare and bring in a 
bill to amend those sections of the Criminal Code which deal with 
impaired driving in order to (a) enhance deterrence; and (b) 
ensure that the penalties reflect the seriousness of the offence 
and that the said committee, when so instructed, submit its 
report to the House no later than May 15, 1998. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to the adoption of the supply motion, the committee 
was so instructed by a motion moved by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.  I was involved in the negotiations of 
that instruction, so I do know for a fact from where we come on 
this particular point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, a motion cannot direct or order the 
government to take action. That is why the supply motion called 
upon the government to act. The second part of the motion read 
“and that the said committee, when so instructed, submit its 
report to the House no later than May 15, 1998”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT62"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT62"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1505

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the motion dealt with the committee.  The 
motion directed the committee and as you know, Mr. Speaker, that 
is perfectly in order for any motion of this House whether it be 
a supply motion, a private member's motion, or a government 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Beauchesne's sixth edition citation 760(2), it states that 
“committees receive their authority from the House itself and 
the authority of the House overrides that of any committee”. 
Citation 831(2) points out that “a committee is bound by, and is 
not at liberty to depart from the order of reference” from the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last Parliament, the 35th Parliament, the Special 
Committee on Code of Conduct was given a reporting date by the 
House.  The committee could not and did not decide on its own 
when to report to the House.  When the committee found itself 
crunched for time it had to come back to the House and seek 
authority to extend its reporting date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in the last Parliament there were two important rulings 
regarding committees and orders given committees by the House. On 
June 20, 1994 and November 7, 1996 the Speaker ruled that “while 
it is a tradition of this House that committees are masters of 
their own proceedings, they cannot establish procedures which go 
beyond the powers conferred upon them by the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to address at this time the fact 
that there are two motions in play on this issue.  If you 
consider our practices regarding the management of our business, 
there is often more than one motion dictating the business of the 
House and its committees.  Superseding motions for example are 
always acceptable motions, such as motions to adjourn debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often pass motions that prescribe the way debate is 
conducted.  The actions in the motions are triggered by events 
that may happen during debate.  For example, during late night 
debates the words “when the last member rises” often trigger 
the question being deemed put and the vote deferred to a 
determined time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time allocation motions often address the report and third 
reading stages of a bill.  It presupposes that the report stage 
will carry and that the third reading debate will proceed and be 
guided by the time allocation motion.  Such an order waits until 
the business is called even though that business may never be 
called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is disturbing about this issue is that it is the justice 
committee of this House that is at the centre of controversy once 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the justice committee that refused to report a private 
member's bill to the House, which triggered a number of questions 
of privilege and resulted in a Speaker's ruling allowing a new 
procedure to deal with insubordinate committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the justice committee that restricted an opposition 
member's participation contrary to the rules of the House that 
led to the Speaker's intervention of November 7, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the justice committee that ignored an order of the House 
in regard to the drafting of a national victims bill of rights 
that we put forward in this House on April 26, 1996.  That has 
not been dealt with since in the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen:</B>  You should not have walked out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  I trust I did not hear “I just lied”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, seeking a solution to the problem of drinking and 
driving is supported by the public and was supported unanimously 
by this House.  Not only did all members speak in support of the 
motion introduced by the member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley, but all members unanimously supported an amendment moved 
by a Liberal member, the member for Abitibi, which inserted the 
reporting date which is the focus of my point of order today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree with the words of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who said during his presentation 
in debate “Members should come together without partisan 
politics and create new legislation that will contribute to the 
saving of lives”.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime 
Minister said “I support the intent and essence of this 
question.  When the protection of human life is involved we have 
to do everything we can”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice committee should take note of the sentiments 
expressed during that debate on October 30, 1997 and respect the 
decision of the majority by reporting to the House as ordered.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me sum up.  We the members of this House, in this House, all 
agreed that there would be a bill received in this House no later 
than May 15.  The question is how does this House become and stay 
relevant if a committee of the House arbitrarily makes a decision 
without coming back to this House on the very issue that we all 
supported, all members of this House from all parties? 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there are three things that are very important here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is that the justice committee, and in particular the chair 
of the justice committee to whom some of this seems to be 
addressed in the person of myself, has every intention of 
following the order of the House that we received in our 
committee through our clerk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number two, we take very seriously the issue of impaired driving 
in this country.  I have confirmed to at least one justice critic 
in the last 24 hours the significance of that review and the fact 
that I am looking forward to undertaking it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number three, had the Reform House leader referred to the 
proceedings of the committee in preparing for today, and he may 
have, I do not know, he would have found that we even talked at 
some point about how extensive this review would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, it is important for you to know 
that when we received the order of reference from Journals branch 
the order of reference was not time dated.  There was no 
reference in that order to May 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of that, apparently the member who is interested in 
this motion in the first place wrote to me.  We have heard part 
of the letter.  The rest of the letter indicates an undertaking, 
as I recall from writing the letter which I do not have here, 
that we would deal with this issue as soon as we possibly could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important however for the House to know that this schedule 
is not drawn up in a vacuum.  This schedule is drawn up after 
consultation not just with a steering committee but with all 
members of the committee who represent all parties.  I point out 
that the Reform Party has three members on that committee, none 
of whom has ever suggested that this is of the highest priority 
to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem here and that is assuming the order we 
received from the House was not time dated, and I believe that to 
be the case, then what do we put aside in order to accommodate 
the interest of a member of Parliament who is not a member of the 
committee and who does not attend our committee proceedings?  Do 
we tell victims of crime on whose work we are operating that 
their work is less important than the work of this member?  Do we 
tell persons with disabilities that we are sorry, we cannot work 
on the amendments to the human rights code right now because we 
have to do work that has come to us from outside our committee? 
Do we tell the victims of crime, the police community and others 
that we are sorry that we cannot do our work to establish a DNA 
data bank because one member of the Reform Party has another 
agenda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a terrible situation in which our committee is put.  I 
see you signalling me, Mr. Speaker, but there is a lot more at 
operation here than would be suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say this, Sir.  We have never sought to defy, directly or 
indirectly or inadvertently, an order of this House.  The order 
we have does not— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am trying to give as much latitude as I 
can but I think we are getting a bit into debate.  Before I go to 
your point of order may I ask the intervener, the opposition 
House leader, and I am going to have a look at all the papers, 
but is it your contention that both of these motions passed by 
the House were time dated?  I want to clear that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker.  As I said there were 
two motions involved.  The first motion was time dated with an 
amendment from the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to the approval that night, we did discuss the fact 
that it has to be a ministerial authority to give direction.  We 
arranged for that.  This is not something that only the Reform 
Party mandated.  All parties in this House agreed to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I guess what you are saying is that 
although it was not time dated on the paper, there was agreement 
in the House that this also be time dated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues, I think I have heard enough.  I will take the 
information under advisement and return to the House very soon. I 
will not wait long on this. I want to have a look at the 
documents.  I want to have a look at everything that has 
transpired.  I will come back with a decision on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have heard enough on this point of order unless there 
is something I have missed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
following the intervention by the chair of the justice committee, 
I want to make it clear that this is not the desire of only the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just a member's desire, although a member put 
forward the motion originally.  It is a decision of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the decision of the House that cannot be contravened, not 
just that of a single member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not want to get into debate.  I have 
already made a ruling about a House order and I will have that to 
guide me as we go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think on this point of order I am prepared to look at all the 
documentation and get back to the House with a decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this debate on the budget, the Liberal 
majority tends to forget that an important issue is at stake, 
namely that the Constitution has made education a provincial 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill contains a measure relating to the millennium 
scholarships, which will mean throwing over all the expertise, 
the entire student financial aid program that has been 
established in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member whether he might not find it 
more appropriate, rather than creating the millennium 
scholarships, to return the money to the provinces as transfer 
payments.  This would enable the provinces to administer their 
education system properly, as well as give them the necessary 
resources to provide everyone with a proper education, rather 
than targeting some people while leaving most students unable to 
take advantage of the new measure, which is more or less a Prime 
Ministerial whim. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question which I listened to very carefully.  He basically asked 
if we would turn over the funds in the millennium fund for the 
province to control.  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have jurisdiction over secondary and junior 
education, which is fine. But this post-secondary education 
program will have the rubber stamp of the federal Government of 
Canada whether it is the Liberals of today or whoever else it may 
be tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not targeting part of the clientele as the member 
quoted.  This is targeting Canada's future, Canada's youth to 
make sure that when they want to access funds, the funds will be 
there to allow them to get the education and the academic skills 
they will need. As we have said before, a good education is the 
best equalizer.

<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to 
speak to Bill C-36 with enthusiasm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand from the start that I oppose it and in 
particular the matter of the millennium scholarships.  I will 
support the Reform amendment, which provides that the budget 
does not meet the usual public accounting criteria, as very 
clearly indicated on many occasions by the auditor general, Denis 
Desautels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in fact very keen to speak to both the budget and Bill C-36, 
which serves to implement it.  I will first describe the context 
of the employment insurance fund surplus.  Then I will speak to 
the shameless waste—and I will say why—in the form of the 
millennium scholarship fund. 
Finally, I will ask that this money be returned to the provinces 
in education, to Quebec in particular, or to Quebec at least, if 
the other provinces are not interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget provides for a forecast employment insurance surplus 
of $6.7 billion.  Already there is an accumulation of $15 
billion, which means that the Minister of Finance could give a 
contribution holiday to all businesses and workers.  We could 
pay all benefits under the law and there would still be an 
accumulated $3 billion by the time of the next budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, the Minister of Finance is planning for an 
additional surplus of $6.7 billion.  This is scandalous.  Why? 
It is a scandal because workers pay the surpluses, especially 
those earning low or middle incomes, because if you earn over 
$39,000 you do not pay.  You pay up to $39,000, and the surplus 
is not taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essentially the SMBs that are affected, because the major 
companies pay salaries over $39,000 including overtime. 
Generally, the SMBs pay less than that, especially those hiring 
a lot, labour intensive businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is outrageous, because the workers and the businesses are 
the heart and soul of the economy. In a country with 1.4 million 
unemployed, we do not purposely try to make the economy 
unproductive. Some might say “Sure, but economic growth was 
almost 4%”. We have to be careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the documents from the Privy Council say that growth not 
accompanied by strong productivity will provide increased 
revenues to businesses and will result in a number of jobs being 
created, but it will not lead to an optimum increase in revenues 
and wealth. Increased productivity such as the one we have here 
in Canada, which is the lowest among the G-7 countries and OECD 
members, thus putting a burden on the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is urging businesses to promote innovation by 
investing in research and development, and also in labour and 
management, but it leaves taxes and employment insurance 
contributions at their current level, which is not good for the 
economy. The government could say “Okay, we will at least improve 
the employment insurance program for unemployed workers, so that 
they will have more money to spend in the economy”. But it is not 
doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the minister announced that contributions would 
be reduced to $2.70. But we also know that, given the huge 
surplus already accumulated, the program could operate with 
contributions of just $2. Bloc Quebecois members have been saying 
for quite some time that the extra 70 cents could be split in 
two, with one half being used to reduce contributions, and the 
other half to improve the program. We could do this without any 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is outrageous to have an accumulated surplus in the 
employment insurance fund, and to also have an anticipated 
surplus of $6.7 billion. It is outrageous and it primarily hurts 
small and medium size businesses, but also all the businesses 
that will contribute $3.9 billion to that $6.7 billion this year, 
even though they should not have to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1994 budget documents, the Minister of Finance said “We 
will not increase contributions from $3.07 to $3.30, as the 
previous government had planned. This will result in the creation 
of 40,000 jobs in 1996”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister's reasoning was good in 1994, it is still good 
today.  This means that by not reducing premiums by an amount 
greater than that of 1994, he is not creating over 40,000 jobs. 
And that is serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all I will speak about, because time is flying, but 
that is the basic point.  It makes no sense.  The public has 
heard about it and people know that it makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing with the surplus it has thus managed 
to create?  I could remind the House that another reason the 
government was able to generate this surplus was because there 
are ongoing, annual cuts in the Canada social transfer.  Cash 
transfers stood at $19 billion, at which point the government 
told us: “We are going to be good. 
We are going to hold it at $12.5 billion”.  The shortfall is the 
reason for the problems being experienced everywhere in 
emergency rooms, in health care, in education and in welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, pleased at having generated a surplus, what does 
the government do?  Does it decide to take $2.5 billion and put 
it to use right away in the education, health and welfare 
sectors?  No.  It decides to hand it over to a foundation that 
is not accountable, the foundation that will work on the 
millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say right away that, in addition to constituting 
interference in Quebec's traditional areas of jurisdiction—if the 
other provinces do not want to exercise their jurisdiction, that 
is their business, but we have always exercised it in Quebec—this 
foundation is utterly wasteful, and I am going to show why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government amended the Canada Student Loans and 
Scholarships Act.  I sat on the committee that studied this 
bill.  In this bill, it is the government that decides who, in 
each province, will decide which students are eligible and what 
criteria will be used.  It is the government that decides which 
institutions are eligible and that negotiates with banks, caisses 
populaires, etc. for loans and scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government itself controls its Student Loans and 
Scholarships Act.  Each province already has people familiar 
with the relative calibre of each institution, who know the 
requirements, who are able to judge and provide assistance.  One 
does not just throw together a foundation to hand out 100,000 
scholarships a year overnight, particularly as the wording of 
the bill is very disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5 of the bill reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5. (1) The objects and purposes of the Foundation are to grant 
scholarships to students who are in financial need and who 
demonstrate merit, in order to improve access to post-secondary 
education so that Canadians can acquire the knowledge and skills 
needed— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And here there is a big mistake in the French version. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to participate in a changing economy and society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of the blue, a foundation will set the terms for assessing 
applications received from students across Canada and decide, on 
the basis of merit and need, who should be granted a $3,000 
scholarship. How much will it cost to determine which student 
will receive a $3,000 scholarship? Unless no assessment is 
conducted, in which case this will be a patronage haven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What questions will the House be allowed to ask on this? Which 
politicians will be allowed to ask questions on this issue? And 
that is not all. The bill states that the foundation shall grand 
scholarships in a fair and equitable manner across Canada. It 
states further that the directors, who all have the power to 
hire, make expenditures, rent premises and what not, are drawn 
from the various regions of Canada, not the provinces. 
Quebec is part of the eastern region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are appointed to ensure that the board is knowledgeable 
about—listen to this—post-secondary education and learning in 
Canada and the needs of the Canadian economy. Do not come and 
tell me that this is not an intrusion in provincial 
jurisdictions. It means that, not satisfied with creating 
duplication by not making use of the existing structure to 
distribute the scholarships, the government has decided that 
these scholarships should be distributed based on the needs of 
the economy. While reference is made to a changing society in the 
objects and purposes of the foundation, the directors are 
expected to be knowledgeable about the needs of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a great deal of hogwash about the next millennium, 
the year 2000. Much has been said about the need for vision, but 
what do we end up with? There are quite a few problems in Quebec 
and Canada besides the Quebec-Canada problem. 
For our post-secondary systems to be of the required level, they 
must not be exclusively focused on the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the millennium scholarships are scholarships 
geared toward the economy. But what about culture and social 
studies? Granting council and humanities council representatives 
told the industry committee how essential research and studies in 
humanities were in this society of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a Privy Council document entitled “Human 
Development Expansion and Social Cohesion”, one of the major 
challenges facing Canada between now and the year 2005 is social 
cohesion and human development. With the millennium scholarships 
we hear so much about, as if they were the key to the future, 
care is taken to select directors who are knowledgeable about the 
needs of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government is concerned about the quality of 
education, it should not have cut social transfer as it did. 
Instead, it should have put money into education as soon as it 
became possible to do so, giving it directly to the provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would keep costs from rising so quickly.  It is not often 
that the <I>Gazette</I> and I agree, but one of its editorialists said 
“For heaven's sake.  The government has to give the money back, 
otherwise students will have bursaries, but there will be no 
institutions worthy of the name university”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask any rector—the president of the University of Toronto, the 
president of McGill, the president of the University of 
Vancouver. They are all concerned about the quality of 
education.  They are concerned, and, as we know, the situation is 
different in the United States.  We know that more money is being 
provided for research.  Graphs are easy to do.  In Canada, we are 
going one way, in the United States, they are going in the 
opposite direction. 
What we have done in Canada with research is to bring some of it 
back.  It is still very little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is serious.  When we congratulate ourselves because 
in 2000 we will start giving $3,000 on a merit basis to needy 
students across Canada through a foundation and solve all the 
problems, we are just fooling ourselves and that is dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Universities are not built in a year.  They are a bit like the 
country's demography.  The fact that we have reached a decision 
does not mean it will have an effect the following year.  At 
least 25 years are necessary.  Maybe it is not 25 years for the 
universities, but to ensure strong universities it takes teams 
with support, that succeed one another, and that are in contact 
with other universities in Canada, the United States and 
elsewhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes indeed, students need hope, but the possibility of a $3,000 
bursary, if you live in the country or anywhere, is not the 
solution.  In Quebec, the likelihood is greater because the 
system of loans and grants is more generous than elsewhere in 
Canada and the costs of education are half as high, which is the 
very reason we say we are prepared to negotiate with students 
from other provinces, but we want to keep education costs low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these circumstances, this system of millennium scholarships 
preventing Quebec from opting out to make the most effective use 
of its bursaries, is most unacceptable.  I repeat for those 
unmoved by these arguments, take a good look at the waste.  It is 
waste, because there already exists a structure under federal 
control to provide bursaries. 
There is no point creating another structure from scratch, 
without the House having any control over it, in order to meet 
the visibility and honourable retirement needs of a Prime 
Minister, whoever he may be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when the British North America Act was written and the 
Fathers of Confederation assigned management of education to the 
provinces, I do not think they envisaged anything other than that 
the provinces would treat all Canadian young people equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we heard today in question period—and we had an allusion to 
it in the member's speech—young people are not treated equally 
in Quebec.  The province of Quebec discriminates against young 
people from other parts of the country by charging them more for 
tuition.  It costs them more to go to university in Quebec.  I do 
not understand why more is not made of this because it is a clear 
case of discriminating against people simply based on where they 
live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has nothing to do with culture.  A francophone from northern 
Ontario who tries to go to school in Quebec will be charged more 
than a young person from Quebec.  Yet the Bloc Quebecois is 
asking for total control of the $2.5 billion in millennium 
scholarships planned by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we trust a provincial government that engages in 
discrimination against young people from other parts of the 
country who might want to be educated in Quebec?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we trust a province that engages in this kind of 
discrimination to handle the millennium fund, to share it equally 
with all young people in Canada who are in need?  In fact young 
people in Quebec have an advantage because they pay less.  Is it 
not far better to give it to a federal government which will 
treat all young Canadians equally? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my honourable 
colleague for his question.  It will give me the opportunity to 
clarify some things that were said during Oral Question Period 
which came very close to being something other than truthful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that tuition fees in Quebec are very close to half 
what they are in many other provinces, while Quebec is not the 
richest of the provinces.  Why is this so?  Because there is a 
political desire to foster accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when there was a wide gap between those who 
could afford to go to university and those who could not. 
My generation wanted everyone to be able to attend, which is why 
Quebec CEGEPs, which anyone can attend, are the equivalent of 
first year university in the other provinces. They are free of 
charge. University itself often costs half what it does 
elsewhere, because we want many people to be able to attend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a policy choice, and it seems to me that any 
discrimination there might be is not negative discrimination. 
It would be a kind of positive discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It costs a lot of money to train a physician.  If medical 
students choose to come to Quebec because they pay half as much, 
is it not normal that there be an attempt to negotiate a kind of 
equity with the government? If our students go to Ontario, they 
are going to pay twice what they would in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American medical students had been coming to Quebec for ages 
before people started to say “Just a minute now. 
They are coming to study here, costing us X thousand dollars a 
year, and then going back home”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is not a matter of being petty, but an approach based on 
looking at what things cost.  We are making a collective effort 
to encourage education.  We want Quebec to benefit from it as 
much as possible.  We have nothing against young people from 
elsewhere coming here to study, but there must be agreements with 
the governments on this.  That seems to me to be far from 
discriminatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the statement is made that these funds must be administered 
in the same way, that strikes me as common sense.  Where 
scholarships are concerned, a system is already in place.  It is 
so hard to be fair in this area, to decide whether this person or 
that person deserves a scholarship, so such a system cannot be 
left in the hands of just anybody. We know that universities are 
recognized as having different strengths in different 
disciplines. 
One cannot improvise with nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec loans and grants program meets students' needs. 
McGill University students are very happy with it and they do not 
want another program. The program is fair to all students. 
Negotiations can take place with students' associations. The 
program provides not only loans but also scholarships. And more 
and more scholarships become available as the education level 
gets higher, because costs also go up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want that money to go to the existing program, instead of 
being used to create another infrastructure, with administrators 
designing national application forms for all Canadian students 
and deciding who should be awarded the scholarships. If the 
scholarships are based on merit, then they are not awarded 
haphazardly, which implies that a real system is in place. 
Incidentally, what kind of control do we have over this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I am convincing people. The general idea may sound 
appealing, but if you take a closer look, it does not make 
sense. It is costly. It provides no guarantee whatsoever that 
young people are the ones who will benefit and, more importantly, 
that the process will be fair or efficient. It also requires that 
we put a lot of emphasis at first on the infrastructure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in the early part of her speech the member referred to the 
scandalous surplus the government was budgeting.  The member will 
well know that the commitment made to Canadians was to balance 
the budget in the current fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, and 
to balance it again next year and the year after.  This is the 
budget for the current year with a two year outlook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will also know that the budget includes a contingency 
of some $3 billion.  If the member looks closely she will also 
find very prudent assumptions with regard to the interest rate 
and growth estimates during the periods under which the estimates 
are being given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that if private sector estimates on interest 
rates and growth are achieved, which are much more positive than 
the government is assuming, surpluses will even be larger than 
projected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member must concede that if we are to pay down the debt, if 
we are to service the debt in an orderly way and get it down to 
sustainable levels, surpluses have to be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also knows that it is the intent of the government to 
use 50% of surpluses for important program spending like health, 
education and social programs.  The other 50% will be used for 
debt reduction and for income tax relief for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should temper the comments about scandalous surpluses 
in view of the fact that it is very important for us to have our 
debt being paid down so that we can continue to enjoy very 
competitive and lower interests rates which benefit all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for her has to do with the millennium scholarship 
fund.  She talked about the fund, as have many other members, as 
a subsidy for people already in the education system to lower 
tuition and to deal with student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has missed the point.  It is important for us to remember 
that accessibility to post-secondary education was one of the 
primary reasons for the development of the millennium scholarship 
initiative.  Many students would like to go on to post-secondary 
education but cannot afford to incur the costs of living and the 
costs of tuition.  They are not prepared to enter into that 
obligation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said that the millennium scholarship fund would only 
benefit 7% of students.  It could be zero per cent of existing 
students and another tranche of students who would not otherwise 
go to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that the issue of accessibility is 
much more important to Canadians than subsidy? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question in two parts. I must tell him that, if the government 
really wanted to increase accessibility, it would put money into 
the existing system that is under its control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a student loans and scholarships act. The structure is 
already in place, and the people responsible for that program in 
each province are appointed by the government. These people are 
much better prepared to give out more scholarships in each 
province than if the government creates a whole new structure. To 
me, that does not make any sense, and I would even say that it is 
outrageous.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The structure already exists, and accessibility would be 
increased to a much greater extent if we invested money in that 
structure. The fact that these people are not public servants 
does not mean that this structure is an infrastructure and a 
bureaucracy. And who will control all that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that our colleagues from the Reform Party should 
be concerned about that also. The structure exists. Let us put 
money into that structure. There is no reason other than 
visibility to create a different structure. There is absolutely 
no other reason. Accessibility will be greater if we invest in 
the existing structure, and the money will go directly to the 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance fund is at a level where I would dare 
to say we will never be able to use it up, even with the most 
serious crisis imaginable. 
Therefore, we must make plans to make everybody pay, and not 
only small businesses and workers. Why is deficit reduction 
costing more to those people making $39,000 or less? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposals have been made to improve our tax system, but in this 
case, it is always the same who end up paying.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
shall be splitting my time.  I rise today not in my parliamentary 
secretarial capacity but in my backbench enthusiastic capacity, 
if I can put it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our last budget was the first of the post-deficit era.  It had a 
format which I found quite compelling.  It was a format which 
basically dealt to some degree with debt reduction and to some 
degree with tax reduction.  Rather than distributing a series of 
investments and expenditures across the system it picked one 
major theme.  That theme, as we have been discussing, was the 
theme of access to higher education.  At the centre of that theme 
was the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other aspects and elements to this theme 
including the reduction of past student debt, the ability of 
mature students with children to get some help with child care, 
and the ability of people in the future to invest in the 
well-being of their children and their grandchildren.  We took a 
subject and we swarmed it.  We really spent a lot of time on the 
whole access issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the new format for doing budgets in the post-deficit 
era, what will be the major theme of next year's budget?  There 
are compelling alternatives.  There are many who would argue for 
a health care budget.  There are others who would argue for a 
global warming budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have to prepare now for next year, let me advance a 
third possibility which will feed in as well to a health budget. 
At the heart of next year's budget we should place young 
children, specifically children under the age of six.  We should 
attempt to use next year's budget to achieve part 1 of the 
national children's agenda which is high on the list of 
provincial and federal governments in order to ensure that all 
our children, wherever they live in the country, have access not 
to higher education but to kindergarten in the best state of 
readiness we can create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a theme or name for this project is needed, it could be 
called the success by six millennium project.  I see it as very 
much a continuation of this year's budget, a budget which focused 
on young Canadians as they left the formal school system and 
headed off toward post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time we are asking how we can make sure young Canadians as 
they enter the educational system, notably in kindergarten, are 
as ready and well prepared as we can make them.  These two form a 
complementarity, a pair of bookends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why pick this group of Canadians for next year's budget?  What 
is the compelling argument, need or urgency?  According to 
statistics it is estimated that up to 25% of all Canadian 
children live in poverty.  We have attempted to deal with that 
through the national child benefit system.  That is not all.  Our 
children have other problems.  It is estimated that about 20% of 
Canadian children between the ages of 4 and 11 have serious 
emotional and behavioural disorders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from question period the concern of many members of the 
House over what happens to those children when they become older, 
when they become potentially criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we have problems.  We know that 5.7% of the population 
of this country is born under an acceptable birth weight and 
because of that two-thirds of all infant mortalities occur in 
that group.  We have problems with not just the zero to six 
population, but the pre-zero, the pre-natal group as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to say what the mission statement, the central theme, 
of next year's budget should be, it would be simply to ensure 
that every child in Canada is ready to learn upon entrance to the 
formal school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge is huge because, as with all modern problems, they 
do not fall into old silos.  There are at least six federal 
departments which deal in one way or another with children, 
whether it is the Ministry of Health, Human Resources Development 
or the Solicitor General's department, which has to deal with the 
product of children who have not been made ready for school or 
for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister has to deal with crime prevention and 
appropriate behaviour can best be taught between the years of 
zero and six. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the department of Indian affairs.  We know that 
children among our aboriginal populations are severely at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally we have the Minister of Finance, who allows all of these 
potential reforms to go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to, within our own government, get our act together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also complicated because in our Constitution we do not say 
who is responsible for young children before they hit the school 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know intuitively that it is the primary responsibility of 
their families, but it is also the responsibility of communities 
and, in some cases, social agencies and not for profit 
organizations, along with municipalities, the provinces and the 
federal government itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot afford to wait until we delineate who is precisely in 
charge of what.  We just have to admit that it is a huge 
challenge for this country and we all have to work on it 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is to have the notion of projet de société, 
as we say in French, a national project, something which rallies 
us around a great cause that cannot otherwise be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about national projects.  We have done them in the past, 
whether it was building a railway or creating the health care 
system.  We understand that the outstanding characteristic is 
that this is a job which is so big there is not one part of 
society which can do this by itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the federal government is not to dictate what the 
answers are.  The role of the federal government is to bring us 
all together for the good of all to undertake a mighty task, 
which is to make sure that our children are ready for school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from literature the way in which children specifically, 
and human beings in general, develop.  The most crucial period 
for the development of the brain and social behavioural patterns 
is in the early years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know if children can be given coping skills that will be the 
greatest single denominator of adult health status of anything we 
can do.  We know it is linked to the health care system because 
it is linked to the prevention system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that crime finds its origin most clearly in things that 
go wrong before the age of six.  If we know that, why would we 
not do ourselves a collective favour by taking on this task, huge 
as it is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we start?  The way we start is by actually trying to keep 
score.  We do not know how our population is on a community 
basis.  I have tried to find out in my own part of Toronto, East 
York, east Toronto, what we are doing for children from zero to 
six. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the birth weight of all children is measured, which is 
taken at the hospital, there is no way of finding out much until 
they actually hit the school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they hit the school system there is no way of finding out 
just how well prepared they are.  We do not measure that.  Until 
we start keeping score, we are not going to be able to change the 
collective social institutions, whether it is child care, whether 
it is screening for risk, whether it is parenting courses, until 
we know how we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The readiness to learn measure has to be at the heart of our 
“success by six” program.  Without measurement, the rest is 
just guessing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measure not only passes a judgment on all of the social 
institutions in a community which have contributed to that 
child's state, but it also allows the school system to understand 
what deficiencies have to be attended to when the child enters 
school. 
If that is done the child will not be burdened with inabilities. 
If we attend to those soon, the child can get on with it and not 
fall further and further behind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a tremendous challenge.  We have already started to do 
something about it.  The federal government in North York, which 
is part of my community, has started to finance a research 
project on readiness to learn.  That research project involves 
all sorts of community institutions, including the health care 
system, schools and social agencies so that they are not simply 
measuring how children do when they enter kindergarten, they are 
actually going to start changing the way in which they interact 
with each other so that children will have a seamless web of 
services to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The readiness to learn project, which we promised in our second 
red book and which we promised as well in the Speech from the 
Throne, is only the beginning.  Coming out of that we can then 
work collectively.  I emphasize that this cannot be dictated by 
the federal government.  The federal government has to pull 
people together on a community basis to work with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting with that measure we will then be in a much stronger 
position to fill in the gaps at the community level and at the 
national level which impede the full human development of our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of measures are in place now, tools which we might want 
to make the equivalent of the millennium scholarship fund.  We 
have, for example, the community action program for children 
which is already in place.  That program is a platform, if you 
like, of 12 agreements between the provinces and the territories 
and the federal government.  It has 550 communities organizing 
themselves in a holistic fashion around the zero to six 
population, particularly children at risk.  It will allow for a 
measurement of success to take place which we might wish to 
convert to a readiness to learn measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we probably need is to multiply that example by about 
tenfold, but understanding— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to interrupt the hon. 
member, but his time has expired. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the government member. He started off by telling us about this 
budget that his party has balanced and about the debt and taxes 
in particular, which he would have liked to start reducing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But for the time being, the government will be focusing mainly 
on the millennium scholarships. The hon. member addressed great 
national projects in areas like rail transportation, although I 
personally do not think it was a good example, especially since 
the $580 billion debt was accumulated in the past because of 
these great national projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the millennium scholarships, we know full well that 
the cost of education is much lower in Quebec than in the rest of 
Canada, which means that the student debt level is much lower. 
Instead of trying to bring costs down outside Quebec, they are 
trying to implement a program that will just add to current 
government expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how the government will ever manage to bring the debt 
down, if it keeps creating new programs in areas that fall under 
provincial jurisdiction anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey:</B> Mr. Speaker, let us talk about the debt, 
because there are two kinds of debts. There is the tax liability, 
of course. But more importantly there is a human debt, the social 
debt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time now, we have watched our human capital deteriorate. 
This is now clearly evident in the province of Quebec, Montreal 
in particular.  When studies are done on the condition of 
children in Montreal, particularly in downtown Montreal, everyone 
acknowledges that there are problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way to deal with this human debt, which exists almost 
everywhere in the country, but particularly in economically 
deteriorated regions, is to work together, not to get embroiled 
in constitutional battles, but rather to set an objective that is 
valid for all, since we all value the place children hold in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that Quebec is often ahead of the rest of Canada as 
far as young children are concerned. 
Quebec has made enormous strides as far as daycare and other 
things are concerned.  To me, the strength of federation is 
precisely the ability to acknowledge avant-garde models, such as 
are seen in Quebec, and to follow their example, if I may put it 
that way, like we did 30 years ago in the health care field, when 
Saskatchewan played the lead role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is up to all of us as Canadians to join forces in 
nation-wide societal projects. We must begin with our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
know that the member mentioned a theme for this particular budget 
and I know he is also very interested in other areas.  I wonder 
if the member might like to suggest where we go from here with 
the millennium scholarship fund and the education plan.  Possibly 
he has some insight for us on how we can build on what we 
started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey:</B>  As I have said, Mr. Speaker, if we take 
next year's theme to be readiness to learn and use that to 
mobilize all of our resources, whether they are provincial, 
community based or whether they are with families, rather than 
simply imposing something—the federal government telling 
Canadians what to do—then we have a chance to change our 
thinking as a society about the crucial importance of the early 
years of development.  That is the way we are going to make 
social progress in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is with pleasure that I join the budget debate.  This 
debate comes at a very interesting time in our country's history, 
inasmuch as all of our citizens know we are approaching the end 
of a millennium and the beginning of a new one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is heartening for all of us, even for our friends across the 
way, to know that this government has been able to put the 
finances of the country on such a firm footing that we are now 
the envy of countries like Japan, who only wish they could find 
themselves in the situation we now find ourselves in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine having inherited an annual deficit of $42 billion.  In a 
short period of time, from 1993 to February 1998, this government 
has been able to balance the books, to eliminate the deficit and 
to give all Canadians, either as private citizens or as business 
people, a sense of renewed confidence, a renewed vision for all, 
as we end this millennium and prepare for a new one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just a word about my riding because it will help put into 
context some of my comments.  My riding of Algoma—Manitoulin, a 
northern Ontario riding, is roughly the size of New Brunswick. 
It contains a beautiful major part of the Boreal forest, sections 
of the Great Lakes of Huron and Superior, numerous First Nations 
communities and communities that were founded either as railway 
towns, forestry towns or mining towns which today have, for a 
number of reasons, evolved into renewed communities, communities 
that hope for great things for themselves and for young people. 
While I will acknowledge there are challenges ahead, there will 
always be challenges. It is incumbent on us as elected 
representatives and as a government to respond to our local 
leaders and our citizens with vigour, vision and energy.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I travelled throughout my large riding, I go into these 
communities with a sense of pride knowing this government has 
been a caring government.  This is a government which has 
listened to the voters and has, as its first priority, getting 
our finances in order.  We know that ensuring the sustainability 
of our social programs, our health care system, our pension 
system depends on having a strong financial base. To the credit 
of the Prime Minister and the finance minister this has been done 
in a very careful and caring way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the chairman of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
and Government Operations and it is our intention, as an all 
party committee, to pursue a study done in the last Parliament 
called think rural. It was very important in this last budget, as 
in previous budgets, that rural Canada receive the attention it 
deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal development agency in northern Ontario called FedNor 
was due to expire next March but has been renewed at an annual 
funding of $20 million a year indefinitely.  This program which 
is an important program for economic development in northern 
Ontario can now depend on long term funding. Its programs can now 
become more responsive to the needs of business and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Canadian rural partnership which is a $20 
million program will spend $5 million a year over the next few 
years.  It  will be designed to allow local non-profit groups, 
municipalities and their leaders to come up with new and 
innovative ways to make sure rural Canada has the best and every 
opportunity to stay up with our urban neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all too often the case but a fact of economics that with 
the recovery we are seeing in our economy it is natural that our 
urban areas feel it first.  We are seeing tremendous progress 
when it comes to job creation. The last report which indicated an 
8.6% unemployment rate is the lowest we have seen in decades. I 
will grant that it is not low enough but I believe we are going 
to see that rate of unemployment drop continually over the months 
and years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to speak with local leaders about the Canadian rural 
partnership initiative and that will give us an opportunity to 
pilot some projects in our rural areas which will help prepare 
our rural communities for the next millennium.  The economic 
growth we are seeing in our urban areas will also, as it should, 
include our rural areas. We are seeing that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much depends on initiatives taken at the local level, be it 
municipal leaders or business leaders.  It is incumbent on the 
government not to be out telling local communities what they 
should do but rather to listen to ideas and where appropriate 
help them get their ideas off the ground.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would argue that government has absolutely no place when it 
comes to being involved with either the private sector or local 
government but I disagree strongly.  The federal government with 
its national vision can and should certainly be there to partner 
with local communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for example the long term vision of this government for 
pharmacare or home care.  A budget of $150 million has been set 
aside for local areas to create and experiment with new ideas to 
deliver pharmacare or home care. This is part of a national 
evolution toward universal coverage of pharmacare and home care. 
This is very important to me.  It is one thing for a federal 
government to have a vision, but it has to be prepared to partner 
with communities and local leaders who must deliver that vision 
at the end of the day to the grassroots level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is wrong to think the federal government is limited 
to international and military affairs and so on.  We have a very 
important place at the local level, especially as we see the 
provinces moving away from engagement with local leaders and 
their communities.  We have seen this happen with Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to rural Canada, the government has committed to 
making sure through the Canada access program, CAP, and SchoolNet 
that all our communities, their schools and libraries are hooked 
up to cyberspace through the Internet.  In the very near term we 
will see that every community is hooked up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the specific initiatives for rural Canada such as 
FedNor, the Canadian rural partnership initiative, SchoolNet and 
CAP, a government that can keep interest rates and inflation 
down, that can keep our exchange rate with the U.S. in particular 
at a stable state is a government that is helping not only urban 
Canada but rural Canada.  A rising tide raises all boats.  It is 
unrealistic to expect that rural Canada can do well if our cities 
are not doing well or that our cities can do well if our rural 
areas are not doing well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all in this together. Whether it is improving the 
literacy rate of Canadians, whether it is ensuring that our 
pension programs are secure for the future, which we have done, 
whether it is providing important tax cuts to selected taxpayers 
at the low and middle incomes levels, whatever the initiative, I 
believe this government has put people first.  We are prepared to 
listen.  My constituents can count on me to listen to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened carefully to the speech by the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised at his support for the federal government's 
centralizing attitude.  In the last part of his speech, he said 
that the government must listen to municipalities, but must 
intervene.  It must listen to the private sector, but must 
intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also spoke of great national visions and of national 
criteria.  I wonder if he really believes in the federal system. 
Let us not forget that the federal government did not create the 
provinces.  It was the other way around.  In creating the federal 
government, the provinces delegated powers and jurisdictions. 
The federal government must honour its creators—the provinces, 
that is—and their requests for jurisdiction.  It must stay 
within the limits of the powers granted it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke of health and national standards, and I 
understand that he was speaking of them in terms of better 
service to the public or assistance to the disadvantaged.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand perfectly well that the federal government must help 
all Canadians to achieve a certain equality, a certain fairness 
in health care and education, but it could show respect for 
provincial jurisdictions in so doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could take the example of the millennium scholarships. 
According to the most recent surveys, 80% of the public in 
Quebec is against having these scholarships administered by the 
federal government.  All university presidents in Quebec are 
opposed to these scholarships.  The entire education system as 
well as the two main political parties, the Liberal Party of 
Quebec and the Parti Québécois, are against them.  And what does 
the federal government say?  It says it will go ahead anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it really wants to help the education sector, why— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member, but the hon. member for Algoma—Manitoulin now has the 
floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question from the member for Richelieu because it gives me an 
opportunity to clarify something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I said I believe strongly in the importance of the federal 
government, because of its national view, to be engaged with 
individual Canadians and their communities, this does not mean 
the provinces do not have a very strong and important place in 
that partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member suggested, it was an evolution of a federal 
government through the coming together of the provinces over the 
generations.  However, the federal government was created for a 
purpose.  The provinces clearly saw that it was important to have 
a national view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take issue with the millennium fund.  This fund is in no 
way interference with the provincial jurisdictions over 
education.  The millennium fund will put much needed money in the 
hands of students who will themselves choose to apply to a 
particular college or university for their— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, but we 
need to get one more question in on this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member talking about the balanced 
budget and taking accolades for the government on that score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the member that most of this budget was 
done on the backs of the taxpayers.  In the basic rural community 
that I come from, I have had a number of phone calls with regard 
to the high taxation level in Canada under both the provincial 
and federal governments.  As a matter of fact, B.C. is the 
highest taxed part of North America.  A large percentage of that 
is right from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member if he has had any phone calls or 
questions with regard to the high taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
member's question.  I have a high regard for his opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly over the period of 1993 until now I have had a couple 
of questions on taxation, no question about that. However, it 
certainly is not the issue that he thinks it is which is the one 
in his riding in B.C.  He may want to speak to the B.C. 
government about that because the rate of federal taxation in 
Ontario is the same as it is in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He suggests that our tax rates are the highest in the 
industrialized world or something along those lines.  I 
understand, when we factor in our universal medicare, payroll 
taxes, sales taxes and so on, we are in the middle of the pack 
when it comes to the industrialized nations.

to say a few words on the budget bill which is before the House. 
My comments will be fairly brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like every other Canadian, I am pleased that we now have the 
first budget in 29 years that is balanced from a fiscal point of 
view.  I do of course question some of the methods that were used 
to balance that budget.  I am sure the member who has just spoken 
is also concerned about the tremendous cutback in social programs 
to give but one example.  He comes from northern Ontario and I am 
sure that those cutbacks have hit very hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the transfers in education and health to the 
provinces, his good friend the premier of Ontario, Mike Harris, 
of course is cutting back radically and severely all throughout 
northern Ontario.  That affects the constituents of my friend 
from Algoma who has just taken his seat in the House. I am sure 
he too is concerned about some of the methods that are used to 
cut back on social programs in this country to achieve a fiscally 
balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about some of the other directions we are 
going in our society.  I want to say a few words about that. I 
remember growing up in this country and seeing the evolution of 
activism in terms of the government, when we had very activist 
governments at the provincial and the federal levels.  The 
Pearson days and the Trudeau days.  I can go on to more recent 
times and talk about provincial governments in Alberta under the 
premiership of Peter Lougheed.  That government was very activist 
in terms of programs for ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to have come to an end.  Activism for the welfare 
state and social programs seems to have come to an end.  We have 
been told by neoconservatives it is very passé and that there is 
not really a role for governments today. That type of activism is 
gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thinking about it more and more, there is a certain kind of 
government activism that is very much alive and kicking, not just 
in this country but around the world.  It is not an activism that 
creates a welfare state in terms of social programs and more 
equality for ordinary people. It is the kind of activism that 
creates a welfare state for the large multinational corporations 
and creates what might be called the corporate welfare bums of 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think here of the trade deals that governments have negotiated 
on behalf of capital.  The World Trade Organization, the WTO. The 
free trade agreement with the United States.  NAFTA which brings 
in Mexico.  I also think of the multilateral agreement on 
investment, the MAI.  All these things are charters.  I guess one 
could say they are charters for investment or charters for 
capital, or charters for business in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the activism of governments around the world that has 
provided this kind of strong governmental support for capital in 
the world.  We also see all kinds of other examples where there 
still is government activism for large corporations but not for 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment houses and bankers around the world are very much in 
favour of strong central banks that are regulated, that can set 
interest rates and make all kinds of monetary decisions that are 
extremely important.  They are very much in favour of these banks 
that are removed from political control, that are almost acting 
as independent agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new kind of government activism is not for ordinary people, 
it is for capital and it is much less democratic.  It is also 
international in nature.  That is the kind of evolution we have 
been seeing. The government is very much part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the campaign in 1993 when the now Prime Minister 
crossed the country saying “Elect me as Prime Minister and I 
will tear up NAFTA, I will negotiate NAFTA”.  He was saying the 
free trade agreement was not very good.  Back in 1988 the then 
leader of the Liberal Party was talking about tearing up the 
trade deal. What has happened to that Liberal Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Algoma was here in those days working as a 
valuable assistant to a friend of mine who was his predecessor. 
He was very involved in those days in fighting the NAFTA deal and 
fighting the free trade deal with the United States.  He was 
concerned about the giving up of our sovereignty.  But all of a 
sudden that short distance across the aisle which is two sword 
lengths away has completely changed the orientation of the 
Liberal Party. It has taken on the mantle of Brian Mulroney and 
the Conservative Party. 
That is what has happened to the Liberal Party across the way.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw Mulroney on television a few months ago.  He said he was 
quite pleased with the Liberal government across the way.  He 
said “After all, it has implemented and carried on with most of 
my policies”.  I know you agree with that, Mr. Speaker. The 
Liberals are sitting back there smiling.  They are in total 
agreement with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing wrong with the Liberals doing that if they had 
been honest with the electorate beforehand and told the people 
“We think Brian Mulroney is doing the right thing.  We think he 
is doing a courageous thing.  He is a fantastic prime minister in 
terms of his policies.  Elect us and we will do exactly the same 
thing and we will do it faster than the Brian Mulroney government 
can do it”.  That is exactly what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST is another policy.   I remember the Liberals talking 
about getting rid of the GST, killing the GST.  The now Minister 
of Canadian Heritage was jumping over desks in a committee room 
going after Conservative ministers for bringing in the terrible 
GST and talking about the trade deals, that it was a horrible 
thing that was happening in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are a few short years later.  These same Liberals who 
are now hanging their heads in shame across the way are those who 
are supporting these Mulroney policies and perpetrating those 
Mulroney policies on the people of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old saying is that the more things change, the more they 
remain the same.  All we have are different personalities and in 
many ways a government now that is more conservative than the 
Brian Mulroney government of 1984 to 1993.  Many of the things 
that the Liberals are now doing the Mulroney government could not 
have done politically.  The Liberals in opposition at that time 
would have risen in the House and organized an opposition that 
would have prevented the government from acting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of trend which is happening. We see this trend 
toward more and more government activism for the large 
corporations and large capital in this country at the expense of 
many small business people.  We see this trend toward activism 
for large corporations in the way they are starting to structure 
some of their programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example is the Foundation for Innovation. It is handing out 
some $800 million worth of grants to companies for research and 
development and for innovative projects. Again, who is doing 
that?  A board of unelected business people is making the 
determination as to who gets that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the millennium fund.  Again a board primarily of 
business people will be determining who gets the $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the changes to the Canada pension plan and the setting 
up of an independent investment arm of that pension plan that 
will soon have assets of over $100 million.  Guess who will be on 
the board?  Again, members of the big business community will 
make determinations about those investments. Once again it is 
activism on behalf of large corporations in this country and 
around the world.  That is what is happening in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not seeing that same kind of activism when it comes to 
ordinary people.  We have Liberals across the way who used to be 
progressive.  The member from Toronto used to be very progressive 
at one time.  But I do not see him up in the House talking about 
tax fairness for example and looking at a Tobin tax on 
international currency transactions.  Those are the things the 
Liberals used to talk about in their opposition days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tobin tax is named after James Tobin, an economist who won a 
Nobel prize.  He had an idea that we should have a small tax on 
international currency transactions.  This should be discussed 
among the leaders of the G-7 or the OECD.  Yet where is our 
Minister of Finance and where is our Prime Minister in terms of 
leadership, in terms of trying to bring about this kind of a 
financial transaction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing a real evolution in the world.  Maybe for the 
first time we can do some of these progressive things.  The 
Europeans have finally thrown off this yoke of conservatism, of 
Thatcherism and Reaganism.  They have elected social democratic 
governments, like Tony Blair in Great Britain and Lionel Jospin 
in France. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lionel Jospin is the long-time leader of the Socialist Party in 
France. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is not a liberal; he is a democratic socialist leader.  There 
is a social democratic alliance in Italy.  I predict in September 
of this year for the first time in 17 years that great friend of 
the Liberal Party, Chancellor Kohl in Germany is going to lose to 
a social democrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in European history there will be social 
democratic governments in the four largest countries in Europe, 
all of them with 60 million people or more.  Those progressive 
governments are being elected in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the government across the way, why does it not take the 
initiative now and start talking with our allies around the world 
about an international tax on currency speculation and currency 
transactions, the Tobin tax. 
That is a way of getting billions of dollars around the world to 
distribute to poor people, to create more equality, to look after 
disasters like the one in Chernobyl, or big floods, and to help 
take pressure off some of our social programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is something we can do, but we can only do that 
internationally.  There has been a great change in the world in 
the last 10 or 15 years.  The power of the nation state is 
diminishing very quickly.  In its place are international 
agreements which are basically there for capital and for large 
investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same kind of government activism and government intervention 
that is creating a haven or a charter for international capital 
should be done in terms of creating a covenant for people and a 
covenant for social programs that is international as well.  We 
can do that if we have the political will and the political 
determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do it in terms of a minimum standard for social programs 
around the world and in terms of labour standards and in terms of 
environmental standards.  We can do it on the revenue side by 
looking at the possibility of a Tobin tax which is a tax on 
international currency transactions. These are the kinds of 
things we could do if we had a more progressive government that 
was interested in intervention and activism and a positive role 
on behalf of ordinary people and not just on behalf of its 
friends like Conrad Black and the huge investors in the 
multinational corporations around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the main point I wanted to make.  We now have in our 
country a balanced budget.  We are now going to be turning 
another leaf.  We are now going to be opening another chapter of 
the book of Canadian history.  What we have had in the last few 
years is the transformation of the Liberal Party of Canada into 
the great Conservative Party of Canada in terms of the legacy of 
Brian Mulroney and his Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The books are now balanced.  There was a Liberal convention in 
the city just last weekend.  Rank and file Liberal delegates are 
concerned about the right wing conservative direction of the 
government across the way.  They want to make health care a 
priority.  They are concerned about the MAI.  They are concerned 
about the proposed merger of two of our three largest banks. They 
are concerned about this right wing drift of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there are Liberal backbenchers who feel the same way. 
Why do they not get up in this House and start talking about a 
progressive agenda for the people of the country?  An activist 
government once again that will be an activist government for 
ordinary people and not just an activist government for 
multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested to see whether or not Liberals across the way 
might have some comments or questions and whether or not they 
will have the courage to question the leadership of the Prime 
Minister who all of a sudden has changed from red to blue and is 
dressed in Conservative clothing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to my friend's comments.  I have a 
lot of time for the member but when it is all said and done he is 
still a member of the NDP which is no reflection on his character 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made mention of the Liberal convention this past 
weekend.  I was there as one would expect.  It was a wonderful 
convention, probably one of the best national conventions on 
record of any party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It clearly demonstrates again that the Liberal Party, unlike 
other parties represented in this House, takes policy initiatives 
seriously in co-operation with Liberal members from coast to 
coast.  It is a very positive creative process.  There is no 
question in my mind that the Prime Minister, the cabinet and the 
government do listen.  I am not sure if the hon. member was at 
our convention.  He may have been,  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  He says no.  If he had been there, 
he would have felt much different about it than his comments 
would indicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party because it represents the vast majority of 
Canadians in its thinking I suppose takes the best of socialist 
ideas and the best of conservative ideas and brings those better 
ideas together in a moderate balanced approach to governing this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take issue with the NDP attitude toward corporations.  I am in 
favour of fair and appropriate taxation for corporations, 
including banks.  But the NDP have this idea or socialists in 
general have this idea that corporations are people.  They are 
not people. 
Corporations are owned by shareholders. Those shareholders are 
average Canadians, their pension funds, and in many cases union 
pension funds.  Corporations are owned by people. Those same 
people are voters.  They are smart enough to know that if we tax 
a corporation to death, then of course the jobs will be lost that 
go with that corporation.  There has to be a balance.  We cannot 
have a taxation regime that moves jobs out of the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is all about creating jobs for our citizens I would put 
the record of this government in front of any person anywhere in 
the world with pride. We are not there yet.  I will concede that. 
But we are on a track in this country that is the envy of the 
world.  I would take our prospects over the prospects of any 
other nation for the months and years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  I am not sure what the question was, 
Mr. Speaker.  I was interested in whether the member might 
have a comment on the really radical change in terms of the 
conservative direction of this government.  Most commentators 
have said this government is continuing on with the policies of 
Brian Mulroney: GST, trade deals, deregulation, privatization and 
on and on. Those are many of things the Liberals campaigned 
against in 1993, campaigned against in 1988 and yet those 
policies are the continuity of Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw him, as I said, on television a while ago saying that he 
is very pleased that his policies have been endorsed by the 
present government. They have been carried on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying now is we have a balanced budget in this 
country.  It is time again to have a government that is more 
activist on behalf of ordinary people and more progressive on 
behalf of ordinary people.  The government has not hestitated to 
be activist on behalf of capital, in terms of the trade deals, in 
terms of the World Trade Organization, in terms of the banking 
system, the regulation of banks and so on in this country.  So 
why not be activist on behalf of ordinary people? 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member across the way 
keeps referring to the fact that we are following on with the 
Tory policies.  I just want to remind the member of the 1989 
budget and the fact that the Tories increased the manufacturers 
sales tax and excise taxes, increased surtaxes, increased high 
income surtaxes, brought in large corporation capital taxes. That 
is the Tory policy. That is not the Liberal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let me go on and address a couple of the points that the 
hon. member made when he talked about the millennium fund being 
stacked with CEOs and business people in this country.  If the 
hon. member checked there will be a student on that board.  There 
will also be university presidents.  I am sure he will find a few 
friends of the NDP from the university presidents.  If he cannot, 
I suggest that is his problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have struck a balance to ensure that those individuals who 
are going to partake in deciding where that $2.5 billion is spent 
are really a reflection of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the CPP as well, where the member talks about it being 
stacked by CEOs, every province of this country provided input 
into who would be part of that board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned Tony Blair.  How does he respond to Tony Blair when 
he said in his campaign that the Labour Party is committed to 
strict control of government borrowing and lives by the pledge 
that sound public finances are essential to long term stability?. 
He went on to say spending is not the solution to every problem. 
It is how the money is spent that counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we put that to the test this government has met the test and 
has certainly been a reflection of what Canadians have been 
telling us.  We have taken a balanced approach.  We will continue 
to take that balanced approach.  We continue to deal with the 
finances and we are now investing in Canadian priorities 
irrespective of what the hon. member says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if the 
member knows his political history very well, but I certainly 
would agree 100% with what Tony Blair has said.  That has been 
the whole legacy of the Government of Saskatchewan for example. 
If we go back to 1944 in Saskatchewan when Tommy Douglas was 
elected, Saskatchewan always had a balanced budget.  There was 
always a fiscal responsibility there.  It is the same thing in 
the 11 years of Allan Blakeney. With the current government of 
Roy Romanow Saskatchewan was the first province in modern times 
to balance its budget.  Saskatchewan also has the second lowest 
per capita spending in terms of government costs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come from a legacy in our party of being very 
responsible with taxpayer money.  It has been Conservatives over 
the years— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  The member from British Columbia 
laughs but the NDP governments, the CCF governments, going back 
to 1944 in Saskatchewan, have always balanced their budgets.  The 
member knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is his friends in the Conservative Party, the Grant Devine 
government, who ran up in nine short years the largest per capita 
debt in the country, even higher than Newfoundland. It is his 
friends.  They were the reformers of the day who ran up the 
debts.  It was the Brian Mulroney Conservatives who ran up the 
debts, the friends of the Reform Party, the fiscal conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to learn something about being responsible 
financially, look at the history of the CCF-NDP in Saskatchewan. 
It was always balancing budgets and at the same time had the most 
progressive social and economic legislation anywhere in North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a very quick comment 
to follow up on what the hon. member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His leader proposed the program in 1997 with tax increases 
amounting to $8 billion but spending increases of almost $20 
billion.  That leaves a shortfall of $12 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member just got up and said how his party is very 
concerned about finances and to ensure balance.  There is a $12 
billion difference and the NDP never did explain how or where it 
would find the $12 billion. I will give the hon. member a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is Liberal 
mathematics.  I do not think the Canadian people will believe him 
on that.  Once again I tell him about the fiscal record of the 
Saskatchewan government.  The experience speaks for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a government that was left with a humongous deficit, a 
humongous debt that was run up over nine short years by a very 
conservative government, very similar to some of the Reform Party 
folks today, similar to the Mulroney government the Liberal 
member opposite supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turned this around within two short years.  We are the first 
government in Canada provincially to balance the budget.  We have 
now had five successive balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can be fiscally responsible and progressive at the same 
time.  That is exactly what has happened in the Saskatchewan NDP 
governments, the CCF governments.  That is now what is going to 
happen in places like Great Britain with Tony Blair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was interested to hear the previous speaker not cite the 
example of Ontario under the NDP in his very eloquent defence of 
what one could only call a dramatic shift in the philosophy of 
this party at certain provincial levels dating back to the Tommy 
Douglas days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tommy Douglas was a great Canadian, I might add.  He contributed 
tremendous things to our country.  Regardless of political 
stripe, we have to be proud of the legacy of someone like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see what has happened in Saskatchewan.  The 
member does not mention the hospital closings, the privatization 
and the shift in the burden, the changes.  The reality that Mr. 
Romanow faced when he took office was that they were going to 
literally devalue the financial status of that province if he did 
not make some dramatic adjustments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sharing my time with the hon. member for Scarborough 
Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a look at the policies of Tony Blair and the Labour Party 
in England.  Mr. Blair is showing in my view the fact that there 
need to be adjustments from the extremes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting.  The Liberal Party has been in that position 
for years.  What does it say, we represent the radical centre 
and not the extreme of the left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The flushing middle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B> The flushing middle.  Let us leave that 
out of it.  Leave my personal descriptions out of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all seriousness, though, there is a recognition in economics 
that we simply have to change the way all governments of all 
stripes around this world have behaved over the past 50, 60 or 
100 years.  There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could all do our mea culpas if we want but the fact is to 
accuse this government of carrying of the mantle of Brian 
Mulroney is absolutely mind boggling.  What we inherited— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It does hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  It does not hurt, it is ridiculous. It 
is not true. 
The member opposite chirped and I will respond to him because I 
actually intended to raise the issue.  I am not afraid to talk 
about the GST brought in by Brian Mulroney.

all the changes.  “I have already converted all my cash

already have a system in place to handle the debits and the 
credits on the GST. I would not mind if you would lower the rate 
to make the cashflow a little easier but please do not go through 
another major overhaul”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have attempted to harmonize and we have successfully done so 
in eastern Canada.  The response in Ontario from the Chamber of 
Commerce, the retail associations and the consumer was do not do 
that, it will just to complicate business lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear members talk about great success in other parts of this 
country.  I spent five years suffering in opposition as I watched 
Bob Rae and Floyd Laughren attempt to spend their way to 
prosperity.  Imagine, they attempted to intentionally spend $10 
billion more than they were bringing in so they could run 
deficits and then increase the total debt of that province to the 
point where there was a very serious problem.  Now the other 
extreme has come in.  They can pretend to be Tories in there but 
the reality is they are closer to their Reform cousins.  It is 
only because they made a deal not to set up a Reform Party in 
Ontario that the Reform backed off, Harris was elected and now he 
has gone to the other extreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Are you still crying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  A little.  It hurt but I got over it. 
I would not be here if I did not get over it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we have done, what is in the budget and what we are 
talking about today.  We have said enough of the overspending. 
The $42 billion deficit is history but we are not going back to 
the days where we could spend on any kind of program, social or 
otherwise.  We have to live within the means of this country. 
Canadians understand that. I would have liked it if we could have 
given more in the form of tax decreases but I believe that is 
coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone seems to want to talk about the conference of this 
weekend which was a great success.  Imagine saying that 
backbenchers should have the courage to get up and criticize the 
Prime Minister.  He only got 90% voter approval from our party. I 
happen to be a proud member of the Liberal Party.  I think I was 
listening to the grassroots when 90.19% of the people at that 
convention gave a ringing endorsement to the Prime Minister, the 
leadership and the plans put in place by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Help me to understand what we in the backbench are supposed to 
criticize.  Members can be assured that we fight within caucus, 
we fight within committees for things we believe in but why would 
we criticize our Prime Minister for bringing in the Canada 
millennium scholarship fund? I guess members opposite do not want 
to support students.  We heard, we listened, we saw the 
demonstrations, we saw the students taking over the bank in 
downtown Toronto, we saw them marching on legislatures around the 
country saying give them an opportunity to survive while they 
learn.  They cannot be expected to come out of post-secondary 
education with debts of $30,000 and $40,000 and not give them 
some opportunity for relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we do?  We brought in some tax relief for students who 
graduate with debt.  We brought in interest relief.  We even went 
as far as to say that if the circumstances warrant, there is a 
process in place to forgive the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The socialist answer to post-secondary education is that it 
should be free.  There should be no obligation for any of the 
participants to pay for it at all.  It should become part of the 
social safety net.  Most Canadians, certainly those I represent, 
would totally reject that idea.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one takes a look at the cost of education in Canada, there is 
no question that it is a burden on students.  They do have to 
work hard to get through.  The tuition fees for a world class 
university in Ontario such as the University of Toronto, York 
University, Guelph, McMaster and Western in London are about 
$3,800 a year.  These are post-secondary education institutions 
which are second to none in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we were in a university in the beloved Reform 
Party's United States of America, we would be spending between 
$30,000 and $50,000 on tuition.  We do not have that situation in 
this country.  However, even though the students have to struggle 
and work at part time jobs, they wind up with a debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would hope that the debt would be manageable and 
the opportunity would be there for students to pay down their 
debt once they had jobs and became productive members of society 
by earning money and paying taxes.  That is what this government 
believes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has clearly shown that we believe in a balance that 
creates incentives and jobs for young Canadians.  We want to 
ensure that our young people have a chance to learn in order to 
earn money and pay back what they had to borrow while they 
learned.  That is not radical, centre, left, right or anything. 
It just makes darn good sense.  I know that Canadian youth will 
benefit from this millennium scholarship fund and from the 
financial leadership of the Minister of Finance and the Prime 
Minister of this government for many years to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, again we get into a balanced budget scenario here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we get into that, the member mentioned disagreeing with 
his leader, the Prime Minister.  Maybe he has learned to not 
disagree with the Prime Minister in the same way the hon. member 
from York South—Weston has learned.  He now sits over on this 
side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the member the same question I have asked other 
members on that side today.  I have had a number of phone calls 
from my constituency in regard to the high taxation levels in 
Canada.  I have only heard one member from over there say he has 
had two phone calls on it.  I would like to know if the member 
himself has had any phone calls on the high taxation levels that 
this government is imposing on honest, hard-working citizens in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to share 
the phone log of my office.  Of course I have had a few calls 
about that.  I had those calls when I was in the provincial 
legislature.  Who likes paying taxes?  We would all like to 
reduce taxes.  However, until we are able to get the books of 
this country balanced, which is what this government has been 
doing since 1993, how can we possibly talk about taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what happened in Ontario.  The Ontario 
government came in with a huge deficit and a huge debt and 
automatically reduced provincial income taxes by 30%.  Those 
taxes have come down by about 22%, with more still to come.  What 
is the outcome of that?  If we decrease taxes before we get rid 
of our deficit and start paying down the debt, then we have to 
take it from somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People can say that health care has not been cut in that great 
province, but it is nonsense.  If we talk to the people lying in 
beds and cots in emergency departments we will see exactly where 
the 30% tax cut has come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do it with a balance.  On the weekend, the Prime Minister 
said that one of the things we want to do, in addition to 
supporting health care, is to look at reducing taxes.  I am 
confident we will do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question for the member across the way concerns the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His solution now is to harmonize the GST.  We are going to have 
the polls closing in Nova Scotia in about 55 minutes and one of 
the issues down there was the harmonized GST.  I predict we are 
going to see the NDP rock and roll tonight and increase its seats 
massively in the province of Nova Scotia.  We will see that in 
about an hour and a half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member to answer very precisely a very precise 
question.  Was it a mistake on behalf of his party in 1993 to go 
across this country and promise to abolish the GST? 
We saw what the deputy Prime Minister did.  She resigned her seat 
and faced a byelection.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it a mistake?  Does he feel guilty about it?  Does he feel 
badly about the fact that they told the Canadian people one thing 
and are now doing something else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it a mistake to promise to abolish the GST and then to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel:</B>  We did not promise to abolish it.  What 
election were you in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  I heard the Prime Minister.  We can 
play clips of the Prime Minister on television where he said 
“Elect me and the GST will be gone”.  He was going to abolish 
the GST.  Liberal members have said that also.  I heard the 
platforms of Liberal candidates in 1993 who said they would 
abolish the GST.  That is exactly what they said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was that a mistake?  Please answer the question very honestly 
and very straightforwardly.  Was it a mistake? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want the member 
to put words in my mouth.  I did not say at any time that the 
solution to the GST issue is to harmonize.  What I said is, that 
is indeed what happened in some parts of this country, 
particularly on the east coast.  It is something that has been 
rejected in the province of Ontario, which is the largest 
province.  It does a tremendous amount of business.  That is 
because the business community has said “Don't make more changes 
to the tax system which are going to drive up our costs so we 
will have to try to keep up with you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that if we could lower the rate of the GST, businesses 
would like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that this government did make a 
promise and that promise was to eliminate the $42 billion 
deficit.  We have done that.  We have balanced the books.  We 
have started to pay down the debt and we will start to relieve 
the tax burden on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Canadian people who have paid the price, who have 
suffered and who have worked with this government to abolish the 
deficit and start paying down the debt. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a delight to be able to stand and offer my few 
comments on Bill C-36, the budget implementation act.  I support 
the budget and therefore I am quite pleased to support any 
legislation to implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to describe the budget and the budget implementation act 
by using one word, credibility.  I want to do so by looking at 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was first elected by the people of the then riding of 
Scarborough West to come to this place in 1988.  In 1988 we were 
in opposition.  We listened very carefully to the government of 
the day, the Conservative government.  I am addressing now 
historical fact which can easily be checked by examining the 
records and by examining <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Wilson was the finance minister.  At that time, in 1988 
and early 1989, there were no Reform members in the House.  There 
were no Bloc members in the House.  Michael Wilson, year after 
year, stood and made promises.  Year after year those promises 
were broken.  Year after year he blamed the previous government. 
Year after year the debt and the deficit kept growing.  What did 
the Conservative government do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 the general surtax was brought in.  What for?  To pay 
down the deficit and to pay down the debt.  Were they successful? 
No they were not.  The debt and the deficit kept increasing, yet 
every year Michael Wilson would stand in his place as finance 
minister, except for the year the budget was leaked, and remind 
everyone that this year his promises would come true.  It was 
like shooting fish in a barrel to be in opposition. We knew he 
would not fulfil his promises.  He had no track record.  He had 
no credibility.  Everything he said did not come to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative government implemented the general surtax in 
1986, which was followed by the GST.  Hon. members will remember 
that the debate was centred around modernizing the tax system, 
getting rid of the old tax.  Sure there would be more money 
coming in, but what would they do?  It would be revenue neutral. 
They would only charge sufficient GST to bring in the same amount 
of revenue as the old manufacturers' sales tax.  If they were 
wrong in their calculations—and remember, Mr. Wilson was always 
wrong in his calculations—if there was an excess, they would 
apply it to reducing the deficit and the debt.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a huge excess in the GST coffers.  An election was 
coming so what did the Progressive Conservatives do?  They gave 
GST rebates and GST refunds instead of applying that money to the 
debt. It was great for the people who got the cheques, but it did 
not help reduce the debt.  What happened to the debt?  It kept 
rising.  What happened to the deficit?  It kept rising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We campaigned on a number of things in 1993, including getting a 
handle on the debt and the deficit.  We promised that we would 
eliminate the deficit and we were elected.  We were given a 
mandate to do that, among other things.  Lo and behold we had the 
Reform Party here.  It was not the official opposition, but it 
was here.  When our finance minister stood and delivered his 
first budget he pointed out that he was going to do two-year 
rolling targets.  He did not want to say things on which he would 
be unable to deliver.  He only predicted two years into the 
future, using very conservative business estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the Reform Party's mantra?  Of course they have 
forgotten about it now.  It was very simple.  It was “Oh, these 
are Liberals.  They will never do that.  All Liberals ever do is 
spend.  You cannot believe the Liberals.  They will never pay 
down the deficit, never mind make inroads on the debt, because 
they are Liberals”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day in question period on the first budget the Reform 
Party stood and said “This government has no credibility. They 
are Liberals.  We do not care who the finance minister is. We do 
not care who the Prime Minister is.  This government has no 
credibility.  They are Liberals and they are going to spend us 
into bankruptcy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  In each budget the finance minister was more 
than right.  That makes it difficult for members of the 
opposition, I admit.  It is sure nice to be on this side where 
the finance minister says he is going to deliver and he delivers. 
In each budget he has delivered he has neither overestimated nor 
overspent.  He has been measured in his responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservatives cannot say this because they can hardly throw 
stones at their own glass house, but the Reform Party, not having 
been in government and not having understood how things worked 
realized “Hey, we have been yelling at the Liberals now for 
three years saying they are not going to pay down the deficit. 
Guess what?  They are going to pay down the deficit, so we had 
better change tactics.  We thought they were going to do things 
differently, but maybe they are doing things differently because 
now they have changed tactics.  What are their tactics now? Their 
tactics are to cut taxes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party was not telling us to cut taxes when we were 
cutting the deficit.  They were making fun of us that we would 
never cut the deficit.  This budget shows us that the deficit is 
gone.  It is gone for good.  It was the Liberal Party which got 
rid of it and a Liberal finance minister who delivered on 
everything he said in the budgets.  That is credibility and that 
is what we start with in a budget.  We start by saying that we 
are going to do something and we do it.  Then we go beyond that 
and do a little more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the Bloc doing throughout all this?  Quebec does not 
have enough.  We can listen to parrots for only so long.  The 
fact is, we run a country.  There are 10 provinces and two 
territories, soon to be three territories.  We have to divide 
everything.  We have to run this country equally to make sure 
that all Canadians from all provinces and all regions are looked 
after as best we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have this budget which, like all the other budgets 
before it, will come true.  Why?  Because all the other budgets 
have come true and the finance minister has the rolling targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going to come true?  One, no more deficit.  What happens 
when there is no more deficit?  We still have a big debt.  Like 
everybody who has a big debt we want to pay it down.  We are 
going to pay it down.  How do we know that?  Because we have said 
we are going to pay it down and each and every one of the 
predictions that the finance minister has made in the time he has 
been finance minister have come true and these will come true as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Liberal way.  It is not about slashing to reduce 
things.  We have to do things in a measured, orderly way to 
reduce the deficit to zero, which has been done, to start 
reducing the debt, which is a legitimate goal, as well as to help 
ordinary Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes we agree we should cut taxes.  I pay too many taxes in my 
opinion.  Ordinary Canadians want to pay less in taxes.  It would 
be wonderful if we could cut taxes across the board. What have we 
done?  We have at least started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1986 general surtax that was brought in by the previous 
government has been eliminated for the vast majority of 
Canadians.  We have come up with some innovations with respect to 
helping low and middle income Canadians.  We have to start 
somewhere.  We are not going to start at the top like the Tories 
and help the rich first and work down.  We are going to start by 
helping low and middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we do?  Beginning in July of this year the basic 
personal exemption will increase.  What does that mean? That 
means 400,000 low income Canadians will no longer pay any federal 
income tax.  If some province wants to try and go in there and 
pick up the slack and steal some money from these folks they will 
have to deal with it at the ballot box. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 3% general surtax will be eliminated for people with an 
income of up to $50,000 and reduced for those with incomes up to 
$65,000.  What is that going to mean?  That is going to mean $1.4 
billion dollars in tax relief for 14 million low and middle 
income Canadians by the year 1999-2000, 90% of all taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are doing this we are paying down the debt.  The 
deficit is gone.  We are paying down the debt.  We are doing what 
the Reform Party wants and what most Canadians who have any 
common sense when running their own families do, and that is 
starting to pay down the debt.  But we are also starting to give 
tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this budget has credibility and because the finance 
minister has credibility, I know that in budgets to come there 
will be more tax relief and greater debt payment.  That is why I 
am pleased to support this budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
I appreciate the summary of the financial history of Canada. 
However, I think the hon. member went back too far. Going back to 
1984 would have been sufficient. We would have heard of a former 
Prime Minister, namely Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who led a Liberal 
government for twenty years or so. We are too young to go back as 
far as the member did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, the Canadian debt—and that was before the 
Conservatives took office—was $187 billion. The Liberals are 
ones who had been in power. They were originally responsible for 
the Canadian debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals took over from the Conservatives in 1993, the 
debt was $500 billion. Today, the accumulated debt has reached 
$585 billion. This means that, between 1993 and 1997, the Liberal 
government has let the debt grow, just from accrued interests of 
course, because it  is not doing anything any more. If the debt 
continues to grow when there is no spending, it has to be from 
accrued interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on this. When the 
Liberal Party was in the opposition, it voted against the GST and 
free trade. If it had not made cuts in transfer payments to the 
provinces and in employment insurance, if it had acted on the 
auditor general's recommendations, I think it would have achieved 
a zero deficit just the same. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only had 10 minutes so I could only go back to 1988.  If I 
have the consent of the House I could go back to 1867 if hon. 
members would like to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in opposition I did not vote for the GST.  The 
Liberal Party fought the GST every step of the way. I was the 
revenue critic for the Liberal Party at that time. I went across 
the country advising businesses not to pay the GST until the law 
was actually passed.  You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that the 
Conservative government was trying to collect the tax months 
before the legislation went through the Senate and indeed 
received royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk common sense.  Of course the accumulated debt 
increased from $500 million to $585 million during the three 
years that we were in our original mandate. Why? Because we were 
still paying down the deficit.  We cannot pay down the debt until 
we get rid of the deficit.  We have gotten rid of the deficit. 
Now we will see the figures go down.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to stand here and do exactly what the hon. member asked us to do, 
which is to congratulate him.  I am going to congratulate him and 
the Minister of Finance.  Why am I doing that?  Because they 
finally opened their ears and heard the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that if he were truly honest he would exclude the 
Reform Party's influence in this.  We are the ones who came here 
and for the first time in over 30 years it became respectable to 
talk about governments becoming smaller, spending less and 
getting the fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing I take exception to is that the Liberals try to pass 
it off as if we are already out of the woods.  The fact of the 
matter is, now that we are in tax time, for every $1,000 
taxpayers send to Ottawa, $300 is for interest.  There is a lot 
of urgency to reducing and paying off the debt so that we can 
start cutting those interest payments, so that we can reduce 
taxes and have money to spend on the programs we value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister keeps setting these loosey goosey targets. 
The present target is to pay off the debt in 200 years.  That is 
$600 billion at the present target of $3 billion a year and 200 
years is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I always listen carefully to 
the member for Elk Island but he lost me in that last comment. We 
will pay the debt down as fast as we possibly can in a measured 
way. It may take time.  It took time to accumulate. We cannot do 
it overnight but it is going to be paid down. It is going to be 
paid down over successive governments with successive finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the member's honesty in congratulating us. 
Obviously we listen to Canadians but I can tell the hon. member 
that when there was only one Reform member, the hon. member from 
Beaver River, even before that we were already talking about this 
in caucus. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on February 24 
this year the finance minister brought in the first deficit free 
federal budget in 28 years.  It is a budget balanced on the backs 
of taxpayers, the unemployed and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has been able to sell itself to Canadians 
on this balanced budget yet it is due to the efforts of all 
levels of government and individual Canadians over the last 15 
years that this has finally happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister should have sent a message of growth for 
the economy and hope for Canadians by delivering broad based tax 
cuts.  We know now about his priorities.  Broad based tax relief 
is off the table and massive Liberal spending is back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has once again broken its promise. During 
the election it campaigned on the promise that the surplus would 
be spent in two parts, 50% to new spending and the other 50% to 
debt and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget had no economic plan, no plan for growth, no 
targets for employment, no targets for job creation, no targets 
for tax reductions and no targets for debt reductions.  The only 
visible target the government has put forward is that of 
spending.  This is a budget from a government that has lost sight 
of the real needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month's budget made one thing very obvious.  The Liberal 
government is trying desperately to correct the problems it has 
created by past policies.  An example would be the Minister of 
Finance's sudden attention to and concern for students. Suddenly 
the Minister of Finance has a plan to help students, a plan 
designed to offset the effects of his cuts to the provinces, a 
plan that causes tuition fees to rise too high in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian millennium scholarship fund, the pet project of the 
Prime Minister, is getting a lot of attention.  It sounds 
wonderful but consider just how wonderful it really is.  Here are 
the specifics.  The fund is $2.5 billion.  There are 100,000 
scholarships.  Students can receive an average of $3,000 each 
year with a cap of $15,000 over four years.  The only stipulation 
is that the students will have to wait for two more years before 
they will see any of the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government realize that the students face debt 
problems today?  Dangling a carrot in front of them and then 
saying wait until the year 2000 just does not cut it. A student 
who appeared on the CBC national news in February put it best. 
This particular student was quoted as saying “Of course they 
balanced the budget and that is why I have a debt of $30,000”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of student debt should be one of utmost importance to 
all Canadians.  Student debt does not just affect all students. 
It is an impediment to sustained economic growth in our country. 
Canada simply cannot afford to have a sufficient portion of its 
young people so heavily burdened by debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts by the Minister of Finance to transfer payments for 
post-secondary education have forced provincial governments to 
cut funding to colleges and universities.  In turn these 
institutions have no alternative but to raise tuition fees on the 
backs of students. As a consequence student debt has risen 
dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the average student graduated with a debt load of 
$9,000.  Today a student graduates with a debt of $25,000 to 
$30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government thinks that by involving its millennium 
scholarship endowment fund it is solving the student debt 
problem.  While it may put some additional funds in the pockets 
of some students, on the whole it is not the answer to this 
crisis. Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scholarship only helps a very small limited number of 
students, approximately 3% to 4% of those going to universities 
and colleges.  The scholarship does not address the structural 
problems such as cuts to transfers and the cost of obtaining an 
education.  These are the root causes.  These are the issues that 
need to be directly addressed by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Canadians want to work. They want to work in Canada.  The 
challenge for this government is to create employment 
opportunities.  This is done by giving them a fair start in life. 
This means making education affordable, implementing responsible 
fiscal policies, offering a competitive tax system that will 
allow Canadians to spend and save. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that transfers to the provinces 
increased by $6 billion under the previous Progressive 
Conservative government.  Since the Liberal government took power 
in 1993, the transfers to the provinces have decreased by $6 
billion.  We now see the repercussions of these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been advocating tax cuts for Canadians as a primary task 
for government.  Recently Canadians were hit with increases to 
the Canada pension plan with still no substantial offsetting 
relief in the EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to collect $6 billion annually from 
excessively high unemployment insurance premiums.  May I remind 
the House that the current EI premiums are at $2.70 and it is 
recommended that at $2 this program could be sustainable even in 
a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure the budget was balanced. The important part is how.  I have 
answered that.  On the backs of each other. Many Canadians have 
faced higher taxes and have lost their jobs. Businesses are 
closing due to the economic environment. Canadians have 
experienced the effects of cuts to our health and education 
system and have been offered no reasonable relief. Working 
Canadians have seen their personal disposable income decline by 
1.3% since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall we just need to look to our neighbours to the south to 
see the incredible difference in tax levels, unemployment figures 
and job opportunities.  Brain drain, high taxes, high student 
debt, high unemployment, lack of job opportunities all go hand in 
hand.  One feeds on the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget the basic personal tax credit was raised by only 
$500 to $6,956.  The PC government would have taken advantage of 
this balanced budget opportunity to give every Canadian a 
significant tax break by raising this credit to $10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are pleased that the government decided to cut the 3% 
general surtax for low and middle income Canadians, unfortunately 
the Liberals missed the opportunity to make this tax relief broad 
based.  Again we must keep young Canadians in Canada and give 
them the opportunity their parents had.  It is crucial that we 
solve the alarming trend that we know as brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important issue the government did not address in this 
budget is the year 2000.  We just heard in the industry committee 
that as high as 30% of the industries in Canada could go bankrupt 
or out of business in the year 2000.  I have been quoting—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in 
the opinion of this House, the government should consider 
implementing a tax credit or tax rebate that would 
compensate parents for the substantial costs of enrolling 
their children in youth activities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, my private member's motion which we are 
debating reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider implementing a tax credit or tax rebate that would 
compensate parents for the substantial costs of enrolling their 
children in youth activities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this motion is to provide a tax credit or rebate 
to parents to help defray the costs of a variety of programs such 
as recreational and academic; summer camps; sports teams; fees 
for hockey, soccer, baseball, et cetera; music or band programs, 
theatre or artist programs; camping and outdoor clubs; scouts, 
girl guides, et cetera.  Obviously it is only a motion.  It is 
not a bill.  Any particular tax rebate program like this might 
have to be more specific as to what was included and what was 
excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making through the motion is that parents are 
under increasing pressure to be able to fund and to pay for the 
many programs they would like to have their children enrolled in. 
They are being hit from all sides in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents face new and growing costs to keep their kids in school 
and in community club youth programs.  If we talk to people who 
have children, they say that one of the features of parental life 
these days is fundraising.  Parents always have chocolate bars on 
the dining room table.  Their relatives are afraid to come over 
because they do not know what they are trying to sell them next, 
whether it is chocolate bars or this, that or the other to fund 
various programs at school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kids are marketing things at the door such as Christmas cards 
and various other things in order to get extra resources to buy 
things that I frankly think should be paid for by the school 
through the public treasury and the funding of our public 
education system through the tax system.  That is happening less 
and less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents are being asked, either by the school or by the various 
other programs their children are enrolled in, to engage more and 
more in either the payment of extra fees or the raising of extra 
money through fundraising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schools are feeling the broad range of cuts by federal and 
provincial governments with respect to education and youth 
programs.  There has been a lot of downloading from the federal 
government to provincial governments, to school boards and to 
municipalities.  We see the elimination or the reduction of a lot 
of youth programming.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a problem that would be addressed in particular by 
what I am speaking about tonight.  For instance, I have learned 
that in my own community the city of Winnipeg wants the community 
clubs to take over wading pools.  The community clubs are already 
volunteer organizations.  They are already stretched, yet this 
level of government expects volunteers to take over a program 
that is very important to a lot of children during our hot 
summers.  Even though it gets cold in Winnipeg, it gets hot in 
the summer and wading pools are very important.  That is another 
matter which has to do with the reduction of program funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the problem of extra fees which the motion 
addresses in particular that are more and more expected of 
parents.  They are required to pay extra amounts to provide their 
children with these positive experiences.  The government should 
look at a way to recognize the value of children being enrolled 
in these kinds of programs.  We should not have a society in 
which any child is prevented from being enrolled in these 
programs by virtue of the fact that parents feel they cannot 
afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to encourage youth to engage in these kinds of positive 
activities.  In parliament quite appropriately we spend an awful 
lot of time talking about the Young Offenders Act and the more 
punitive dimension of how to deal with youth crime.  We also need 
to spend more time talking about the other half of the equation, 
which is making sure that we provide opportunities for positive 
learning activities that play a preventive role in dealing with 
the root problems of youth crime, or at least dealing with 
elements of the root problems of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience of many people over the years has been that 
involvement in an organization which demands of a young person a 
great deal of time, energy and commitment keeps them from having 
time on their hands.  It keeps them from the temptation to become 
involved in other things that are less wholesome.  Much is to be 
said for youth being involved in these kinds of programs and 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is merit in the government looking at ways in which it 
might extend more support in this regard than it does now.  We 
need to break the cycle of youth crime, and I believe that 
healthy youth programs contribute to the maintenance and 
development of cohesive and safe communities.  The evidence on 
that is pretty convincing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion will not pass because it is not a votable motion, but 
I hope the government would consider what members of Parliament 
have to say and will look to incorporating some of the 
suggestions made today, not just by me but perhaps by others, 
into any kind of comprehensive strategy for youth in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were to implement such a policy, it might want 
to look at how the tax rebate could be designed to give a bigger 
break to middle and low income Canadians who need it more than 
others.  There might be some kind of ceiling on it.  It does not 
necessarily have to be available to everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such programs have been instituted in other jurisdictions. In 
Minnesota, for instance, an educational tax credit and deduction 
was brought in to assist parents in this way.  It is not 
identical to what I have in mind, but I am just saying there are 
examples of how this can be done.  I recommend that the 
government have a look at that.  It may see elements of a 
solution in what has been done in that state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for all levels of government to look at how we can 
begin to rebuild our educational and recreational programming 
because they have taken a beating over the last 10 years or so. 
We need to begin to invest in our children's future again. 
I think this is one of the ways we can do it.  We could recognize 
the expense many families have in order to provide these kinds of 
experiences for their children.  This measure would go a long way 
toward doing that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few other points I would like to put on the record.  I 
have been very disturbed, for instance, in my own riding by the 
way the community clubs have been treated by Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A community club in my riding was audited, assessed and told 
that there had been certain hockey fees on which it was supposed 
to be charging GST.  The club did not know it was supposed to be 
charging GST in this category of program.  The next thing we 
know, it is told that it owed Revenue Canada something in the 
neighbourhood of $10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a community club run by volunteers.  I do not know how 
many other community clubs across the country have been affected 
in this way.  It seems to me that if Revenue Canada wants to 
instruct the club by telling it that it has been doing this wrong 
and from here on it it needs to charge GST, that is fair enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for Revenue Canada to tell the club, a volunteer 
organization where people are working nights and weekends to help 
make that club a success, that it owes $10,000 and interest is 
not a very wise policy when at the same time we are talking about 
the Young Offenders Act and what we can do about youth crime. 
Here we have a community club that is doing its best to keep as 
many kids active in sports and on the ice instead of on the 
street, and it is being told it made a mistake and it has to pay 
through the nose.  I think that should have been waived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had some success in waiving the interest but personally 
I think the whole thing should have been waived.  I believe we 
need to look for other ways to encourage community clubs and 
other groups involved in youth programming rather than make them 
vulnerable to the kind of situation Park City West Community 
Centre in Transcona found itself in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the comments of other members on my 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  This will be good. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member across 
the way for saying “this will be good”.  I hope he appreciates 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to this private member's motion.  It 
certainly reflects a concern for children and families, which is 
commendable and which the government fully shares.  That 
philosophy was reaffirmed in last fall's Speech from the Throne 
which stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our objectives as a country should be to ensure that all 
Canadian children have the best possible opportunity to develop 
their full potential. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That objective may appear in harmony with today's motion which 
suggests that government consider providing tax relief for 
parents who enrol their children in youth activities.  While the 
intent is admirable, I am afraid the motion fails some important 
tests both in terms of priority and practicality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To explain, I want to begin by reminding the House that the 
federal tax system already provides significant assistance to low 
and middle income families with children through the Canada child 
tax benefit.  It represents an investment of over $5 billion a 
year and is growing dramatically.  In the last two budgets the 
government dramatically increased the annual assistance provided 
to low and middle income families through the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since July 1997 over 720,000 low income working families have 
received increased benefits as a result of restructuring and 
enriching the working income supplement.  Overall benefits have 
increased by $850 million over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as announced in the 1998 budget, the government will add 
a further $425 million in July 1999 and another $425 million in 
July 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to step back to Motion No. 306 and the issue of 
priorities.  First, the government's dramatic fiscal progress and 
our capacity for new investment are still quite limited.  We must 
make sure that investments including tax cuts meet the key 
priority of doing the most good for those with the greatest need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit does this by targeting aid to low and 
middle income families.  However, today's motion would represent 
a new and costly tax break and one that could provide the 
greatest share of the benefit to affluent families, in fact those 
who need it least. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the cost of this motion would depend on the parameters 
applied such as the level of credit or the number of children for 
which it could be claimed.  However, let me give a mid-case 
scenario as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us assume for the moment a thousand dollar tax credit at a 
rate of 17%.  In other words, a tax benefit of $170 for each 
eligible child is in place.  If this was claimed by the parents 
of just half of all Canadian children, the cost would be about 
$570 million a year.  That is a substantial amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A practical problem with this motion is the following.  How 
should we define appropriate youth activities?  Should the 
government be subsidizing golf or tennis lessons?  Where do we 
draw the line between personal development and leisure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember, parents of modest means can use the child tax benefit 
to help their children undertake youth activities if they feel 
that this is a good use of their family resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reflects an important aspect of our tax policy and operating 
philosophy.  We feel it is parents who are best placed to decide 
how the financial resources of their family should be allocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating a special tax break just for youth activities, it is 
the government that is determining family priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me step back to the issue of what would qualify as an 
appropriate youth activity.  Consider the administrative problems 
and costs of determining eligible activities requiring parents to 
provide receipts, and then processing these claims, all on top of 
a tax system which I am sure the hon. member opposite would agree 
most people already find quite complex and time consuming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of what would be an eligible youth activity, there 
is a final point that I would like to make.  The government 
already provides real tax assistance to many activities that 
would clearly qualify under the hon. member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Boy Scouts and Girl Guides, for example, are done through the 
tax exempt status of charitable or non-profit organizations. 
Because they are income tax exempt, they are able to offer their 
programs to members at a lower cost, making them accessible to 
the widest range of Canadians.  It appears to me that this is an 
efficient, effective and fair method of meeting the same 
fundamental goal in today's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it should be clear why this House cannot endorse 
today's motion.  First, it would be a very costly addition to our 
already expanding program of tax assistance to families with 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, it would provide assistance to many families that need it 
least without giving real aid to Canadian children and families 
in real jeopardy.  Then it would be costly and difficult to 
administer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the motion ignores the fact that there is a form of tax 
assistance, exemption for charitable and non-profit 
organizations, that already helps many youth activities and the 
involvement of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering this, we should have no hesitation in rejecting 
today's well intentioned but flawed motion.  As I pointed out, 
government provides over $5 billion of assistance to families 
with children and is enriching that assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a better way to help children than that proposed in this 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in debate on Motion No. 306.  I want to 
commend the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona for what is a well 
intentioned and commendable effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His objective clearly is to provide some form of tax relief for 
families in need to assist them in making choices for their 
families with respect to youth activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I see several technical flaws with the motion. For 
instance, the motion fails to define what constitutes youth 
activities, fails to define youth.  There is no standard 
definition of youth in any of the tax statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of this tax expenditure is nowhere defined in the 
motion.  Therefore while I think it is well intentioned, the 
motion itself has not been well thought out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My principal objection is that the motion seeks to make choices 
for parents by defining exactly what kind of activities they can 
use to reduce their taxes payable.  I think this is entirely the 
wrong approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has touched on a very real problem.  Families 
with children have experienced a shrinking disposable income now 
for over 15 years in this country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year after year they find there is less money at the end of the 
day in their bank accounts, in their wallets and in their cheque 
books to fund the kinds of important activities for their 
children and families, activities that supplement the basic 
education of children in the school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right in pointing out the plethora of fundraising 
activities which families find themselves participating in to 
finance recreational programs and other educational athletic 
programs and so forth.  But the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona suggested during his remarks that instead of 
Girl Guides and minor hockey teams going out and raising these 
moneys by selling chocolate bars and cookies, the funding for 
these programs should come from the public treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect to the hon. member, there actually is some 
value in young people learning that there is no such thing as a 
free lunch.  To suggest that Girl Guides should apply to the 
federal government for a grant as opposed to going out and trying 
to sell their wares, to learn about the free enterprise system, 
to learn about charity and learn about the reliance on other 
people's good will is misguided indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My principal objection is that the motion seeks to apply a 
band-aid where radical surgery is needed with respect to the 
taxation faced by Canadian families.  Canadian families on 
average now spend more on taxation than they do on food, shelter 
and clothing combined.  As I have said in this place many times, 
I think quite frankly such a tax burden is morally questionable, 
a burden that consumes more than the basic necessities of an 
average family.  The family tax index which calculates the total 
burden of all direct and indirect taxes on average families 
suggests that the average Canadian family spends over 40% of its 
annual income on taxation to the three levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week the C.D. Howe Institute released a new study which 
suggested that the average marginal tax rate faced by Canadian 
families was over 53%.  Essentially what we have done in this 
Parliament and in this country is create a situation where 
families are working harder and harder.  We have more two income 
families leaving children at home alone in the young formative 
years in order to go out into the workforce to pay for the taxes 
that have been levied on them by politicians in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution to that problem, the solution to the frustration 
faced by so many families in financing the basic needs of their 
children is not to use the tax code as an instrument of social 
engineering.  It is not for politicians in this legislature or 
any other legislative assembly to pick and choose which 
activities are more deserving of exemption from taxation than 
others.  Picking and choosing certain activities is a form of 
social engineering.  What we ought to strive to do in this 
Parliament is to let families make the choices that they need to 
make according to their own priorities.  It is the principle of 
choice, it is the principle of freedom which ought to animate all 
the decisions we make in this place, particularly with respect to 
the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Income Tax Act was introduced in this place as a temporary 
war tax act in 1917 to finance the needs of the then Dominion of 
Canada during the great war.  It was a temporary act which 
totalled 12 pages.  It read 12 pages in length.  Today's Income 
Tax Act now numbers over 1,300 pages and includes several hundred 
more pages of associated regulations which deal with the 
application of this hugely complicated tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now employ over 43,000 bureaucrats in the Department of 
National Revenue to administer that 13,000 page tax code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took 43,000 bureaucrats to administer a tax code so complex 
and so lengthy that no person in this country understands it. I 
dare say those of us here who write those tax laws have never 
read a substantial portion let along the entire Income Tax Act. I 
suggest that even the most expert tax authorities in this country 
do not have a comprehensive understanding of the behemoth, the 
monster we have created in the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this tax code grows and grows is well intentioned but 
ultimately shortsighted efforts like the motion before us today. 
Parliamentarians and governments have sought to use the tax code 
as an instrument of social engineering, placing level on level 
and layer on layer of complexity to create innumerable 
deductions, exemptions, credits, write-offs and loopholes in the 
system.  Each one of these creates new complexities within the 
legislation which requires more bureaucrats to administer it. 
This creates a greater need for private sector tax practitioners 
to interpret it and apply it. Meanwhile the poor bedraggled 
taxpayer at the end of the year is faced with an incomprehensible 
requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we are discussing this as we approach the 
end of the tax year.  Millions of Canadian families are going to 
be sitting around their kitchen tables late at night with their 
pocket calculators, pencils and their reams of paper trying to 
understand this byzantine, incomprehensible, opaque tax code we 
have imposed on them because of the innumerable regulations, 
exemptions, deductions and credits which have been inspired by 
motions like the one before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my colleagues and I in the Reform caucus propose to do is 
rather than carving out little loopholes in the tax code, as the 
hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona proposes, we propose to 
deliver general tax relief to all Canadian families.  This will 
enable them to make choices about how to dispose of their scarce 
income.  We would do this by raising the basic personal exemption 
to $7,900 not for some families like this government has proposed 
but for all families.  We would raise the spousal amount to 
$7,900. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would convert the current child care tax deduction which 
discriminates against traditional families to a refundable credit 
available to all families.  In sum, we would deliver $2,000 of 
tax relief for the average Canadian family.  This would be 
appreciably greater for low income families with children at 
home.  Let families make the decisions by allowing them to keep 
more of the money they have earned rather than taking it from 
them and using the tax code to engineer social outcomes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today to the motion 
brought forward by the member for Winnipeg Transcona. I will 
repeat it so it is fresh in our minds: “That, in the opinion of 
this House, the government should consider implementing a tax 
credit or tax rebate that would compensate parents for the 
substantial costs of enrolling their children in youth 
activities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think an element is missing from our tax system, from our 
wealth distribution system, that could be useful to our society 
in that it could prevent certain tragic situations. Let me 
explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about youth activities. We can think of anything 
that can complement family education: piano lessons, violin 
lessons, participation in sports like judo, hockey, baseball, all 
those things that complement a child's education. The discipline 
that a child will acquire by taking piano lessons for many years, 
for example, the fact that he or she will learn that it takes a 
lot of work to become a good pianist and that results cannot be 
achieved without effort, all this will help that child through 
his or her whole life. I think the motion before us would help us 
reach that goal.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals tell me that we cannot afford that, I say that 
we have a tax system that provides credits for professional 
hockey teams, and as long as businesses can benefit from tax 
deductions for that kind of thing, we should provide a deduction 
for parents who have to pay for their kids to take piano lessons, 
to play hockey or to participate in other types of educational 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot, on the one hand, agree to deduct money 
for professional hockey teams and, on the other hand, claim that 
it is not possible to change our tax system to meet such needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other element is that these costs can sometimes be 
considerable. For example, a family with three children could 
spend several thousands of dollars per year on such courses. With 
a tax credit, the costs involved would be less for each family, 
and it could allow some children to take courses that their 
families would otherwise not be able to afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the Reform Party member mentioned that this is the time 
of the year when people prepare their tax return and that they do 
not want to be stuck with an additional credit. I happen to see 
things very differently. There are parents who have kept receipts 
for such costs, for youth activities that are not tax deductible. 
These people would be very happy if they could get a deduction 
for such costs. These are positive and useful activities that 
benefit children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important element is that it would promote volunteer 
work. In all these organizations, there are volunteers who put in 
several hours every week. In the municipality of La Pocatière, 
which is located in my riding, there is a judo club and some 
music schools where piano and violin teachers do a lot of 
volunteer work. If we could increase the number of students by 
reducing costs, it would promote and recognize the volunteer work 
done by these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also encourage new initiatives. 
Again, last year, a music teacher came to see me about starting 
a music class in a school in Saint-Alexandre-de-Kamouraska at the 
primary level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the cost evaluation.  Obviously this is not easy. 
Contributions must be sought from parents and from institutions. 
If there had been such a tax measure, it would have been an 
incentive for this new kind of initiative.  I think that this 
sort of effort would be beneficial, and an investment in society.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is very important.  We should be investing in these 
activities so that fewer young people get off on the wrong foot. 
The best way to prevent juvenile delinquency is to make 
activities available to young people that give them a chance to 
develop their potential so that they can decide what they want 
to do with their lives. 
If the traditional educational system does not give them this 
opportunity, this kind of activity can help them to discover 
interests and demonstrate their potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at it in terms of investment, it is no longer simply 
an expenditure, as the Liberal member was saying earlier.  I am 
extremely surprised, but this is becoming more and more of a 
reality:  the Liberal Party and the Reform Party have similar 
views on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Liberal and Reform members 
tell us this will be complicated.  They wonder how youth activity 
will be defined, and if it will not create additional 
bureaucracy.  I think this is hiding behind the principle itself. 
What they are actually saying is that they do not want 
equalizing measures in our society. 
They want everyone to have fewer and fewer equal opportunities, 
when the member's very motion says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the government should consider implementing a tax credit or tax 
rebate that would compensate parents for the substantial costs of 
enrolling their children in youth activities. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg—Transcona did not have to write today's 
Income Tax Act.  He is merely drawing the House's attention to 
the relevance of doing something along these lines.  I would have 
expected the government's attitude to be more one of being 
willing to consider this motion, to see what can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's society, what can we do to give everyone a more equal 
opportunity?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, for instance, will we ensure that the children of parents 
with low income will enjoy this sort of benefit?  This sort of 
consideration can be examined in committee.  Legislation may 
have to be amended as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have a tax credit for charitable donations.  I think 
we could quickly and precisely link the sort of tax credit sought 
in the member's motion to the existing tax credits for charities. 
This way parents could be strongly encouraged to ensure their 
children will participate in such activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents who, at supper time, are organizing the week's courses 
and setting their own schedules up accordingly, will not say, as 
the Reform member did earlier, that this is not a matter for the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under such circumstances, parents who have an opportunity to give 
their children more training will do so.  They must also have 
equal opportunity, because in recent years there has been more 
pressure on taxpayers and particularly on parents in terms of 
family income.  Would this not be a way to distribute wealth 
better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Productivity in society has increased a lot in recent years. 
Banks for one are making huge profits.  We are looking for ways 
to redistribute this increased productivity in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be a drop in the bucket, but nevertheless 
significant and valid to say that one way the government could 
ensure gains in productivity are returned to the people would be 
through this tax credit or a remittance of taxes to parents 
wanting their children to fully benefit from activities for 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all Canadians—children, parents or the agencies 
providing the services—would find that this was a fair and 
important act.  I encourage the House to consider this sort of 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the motion is not votable, I hope the government, in 
response to the arguments raised here, will pay attention and 
include such action in the next budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part today in the debate on the motion by my colleague for 
Winnipeg—Transcona.  As my party's spokesperson on policies for 
children, I am greatly interested in everything relating to 
children's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must, however, admit that I am confused as to the content and 
scope of this motion.  First of all, I believe it is essential to 
know what age group is targeted.  Young children or adolescents? 
The answer to this will certainly have an impact on the extent 
of the activities addressed by the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder also about the activities eligible for the tax credit. 
Is the NDP member referring to hockey, ballet lessons, piano 
lessons?  I do not know the answer but I do feel more 
clarification is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the NDP member could inform us as to how the institutions 
or organizations providing these activities for youth would be 
accredited.  What, for example, are the criteria for determining 
that this or that body is accredited to issue tax receipts?  Is 
it limited to not-for-profit organizations?  Are private sector 
institutions included?  What are the criteria for obtaining the 
status of a tax receipt-issuing institution?  Once again, the 
answers will have a definite influence on the impact of the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think for a moment about the efforts and resources required 
to set up such an initiative.  Would the government structure be 
even more complex than at present? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the additional costs institutions will have to meet in 
preparing and issuing tax receipts will have a negative impact on 
the charge for activities.  Prices will go up, and fewer families 
will be able to take part. 
Is the primary objective of the motion not to encourage more 
parents to enrol their children in youth activities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the NDP, our party seeks solutions that will lighten the 
structure of government, and cut down on red tape.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party believes that the top 
priority is to implement an economic growth program. We also 
believe that tax relief should take the form of substantial 
personal income tax reductions. Taxes are too high in Canada. 
They kill initiative, they slow down and divert potential 
job-creating investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our priority is to put more money back into the pockets of 
taxpayers; they will know better than the government what it 
should be spent on, be it on registered education savings plans 
or what not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must also develop a job creation strategy, not a 
strategy to subsidize piano lessons. This is a matter of 
priority. 
Instead of the NDP government-pays-all approach, we are in favour 
of a co-operative approach with the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, sports teams could have corporate sponsors taking 
on the costs associated with buying equipment in exchange for 
displaying their corporate logo on the players' shirts. This kind 
of co-operative approach has proven successful so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a priority for the government to interfere in this 
area. Many others require attention. Eliminating child poverty 
and adequate funding for health care are priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public funding should indeed be restored to the level necessary 
to ensure health care. Other steps could be taken to alleviate 
the taxpayers' burden, including full indexation of the child 
benefit and personal income tax brackets as well as reducing 
employment insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as there are children living in poverty, sick people who 
are not receiving adequate treatment, needy seniors and 
unemployed workers, we in the PC caucus will be there to defend 
their interests.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to add my comments 
to the record regarding this very important motion by my 
colleague, the member for Winnipeg Transcona.  It was a privilege 
to second this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are often preoccupied in this House dealing with very serious 
problems in our society, the high unemployment of young people, 
the lack of opportunities for our youth to use their talents to 
their fullest, the burden on families, parents and communities to 
address the recreational needs of young people. Clearly if we in 
this House intend to find meaningful solutions to the problems of 
unemployment among young people, to the problems of a sense of 
feeling hopeless and helpless, to the problems of pursuing less 
than desirable activities in the areas of delinquency and crime 
and membership in gangs, we have to provide the services and 
recognize the needs that will deter young people from undesirable 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is probably no different from those of many in this 
House.  It is an area of very high unemployment, very high 
poverty, with a crying need from parents everywhere for 
governments to address those issues.  It is a cry for help, not 
for charity, not for handouts but a cry for parents to help 
themselves deal with the concerns they are facing on a daily 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My community is probably not unlike those of many others in this 
Chamber in terms of the lack of adequate recreational facilities 
and supports.  It is interesting on every turn that those 
community centres that were providing opportunities for young 
people to be involved are being shut down, inadequately 
resourced, without responsible action taken on the part of any 
level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My intention today in support of this motion is threefold. 
First, if we are serious about the issues that we grapple with on 
a daily basis then surely as members of the federal Parliament 
putting pressure on the government we can effect some changes at 
the fiscal level in our taxation system that will be a meaningful 
contribution to the debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second purpose is to say that the federal government also 
has a role to support community efforts through co-operative 
financial efforts, through provincial-municipal co-operation in 
terms of recreational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a centre sitting idle in my community.  It used to be 
the north YM-YWCA in Winnipeg.  That organization ran out of the 
funds it needed to stay open.  No level of government was 
prepared to fill the gap, to find a way to ensure that centre 
could be reopened.  It would have given young people a meaningful 
place to fulfil their need for leisure recreation and to apply 
their talents.  It was a project, an idea and a need that was not 
met by the federal-provincial infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House tend to raise our voices about problems with 
young people involved in crime and gangs.  Surely the federal 
government has a role to work, to listen and to address those 
needs.  It can work hand in hand with provincial and municipal 
governments to find ways to open facilities that mean something 
to young people, not to close them.  They can find ways to put 
programs in place which truly address the wishes and desires of 
our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hope today is for us to think in terms of the needs of 
families and parents who deal daily with the dilemma of trying to 
ensure their children are occupied and are busy enjoying life, 
that they are not lured on to streets into undesirable 
activities.  We in Parliament can play a real role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposed by the member for Winnipeg—Transcona is a 
very good place to start.  It will help to deal with the 
tremendous burden families have of trying to find the necessary 
funds for their kids to participate in often costly recreational 
activities.   Often the costs are beyond the reach of many 
parents.  Certainly many parents in my own constituency do not 
have the economic wherewithal to pay for hockey equipment, to pay 
the fees, to drive their kids to and from activities.  They must 
juggle their demands as workers with the need to be very caring 
and attentive parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tremendous need which needs to be addressed.  This is a 
good place to start.  I ask all members to give serious 
consideration to supporting this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to speak on this motion.  It is put forward by an NDP 
member, although I do not like to say that because this is 
private members' business and when we deal with private members' 
business we should take the political designations out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had occasion to get to know the member.  I am impressed 
with his sincerity and his genuine desire to help families and to 
help people who are facing tremendous financial stresses and 
pressures in our country nowadays.  I dislike having to say that 
I like this member, I like his ideas, I like his general 
principles and then immediately say that I am going to speak 
against his motion. I must do that for a very simple reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has proposed a motion that would selectively give 
assistance to families that are raising children.  The motion 
states that the House  “should consider implementing a tax 
credit or tax rebate that would compensate parents for the 
substantial costs of enrolling their children in youth 
activities”.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is such a wide range of activities that our children 
engage in.  Are we talking about summer camps?  Are we talking 
about sports and music lessons, which have already been 
mentioned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of where the costs are tremendous is in 
providing an education for our children and teenagers.  Are we 
going to extend a tax credit to people who choose to enroll their 
children in private schools, as my wife and I did?  We had 
specific reasons for that and it took a considerable sacrifice on 
our part to do it.  However, I do not regret it for a moment.  It 
was money that was very well invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that we paid for those tuition fees with after tax 
dollars because the income tax system does not permit a deduction 
of those fees.  If I were to speak in favour of this motion, then 
I would say that should also be included.  For example, to pay an 
annual tuition of $4,000 a year for my young boys to attend the 
school of their choice and our choice, that $4,000 tuition 
required that I earn about $8,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary mentioned that the marginal tax rate 
is over 50% in Canada.  This means I would have to earn over 
$8,000 in order to write a $4,000 cheque to the school.  This 
would be a tremendously high proportion of a family's income. 
That extends to every area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then think of my children as young people on their way to 
university and college.  It cost quite a bit of money to provide 
them with either transportation and room and board at home or 
with housing and tuition, the cost of books and cost of clothing, 
all of those costs, while they were students. According to our 
Income Tax Act, those costs were not deductible even though for 
us to help our guys, because they could not get a job or got a 
poorly paying job with few hours, we had to subsidize their 
education.  It was fairly costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to commend my children for working very hard 
and very long hours in order to earn as much as they could.  Here 
again, should that be with after tax dollars when we start paying 
$8,000 a year to educate a young person in college or university? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think that if we are going to provide deductions for 
hockey lessons and trombone lessons so that one day when they are 
prime minister they can provide some music, it should surely be 
acceptable to provide deductions to the parents or other 
relatives who are actually paying the fees to further the 
education of these young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to propose something which is actually much better. 
Instead of introducing into the Income Tax Act new provisions, 
new categories where the items can be either deducted from income 
or entered as a tax credit eligibility, it would be much superior 
for us to simply try to get rid of our debt so that we can stop 
charging 30 cents on every $1 for interest.  We thereby would 
provide tax relief to all Canadians at all levels with more 
disposable income.  We could all use it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would help our economy.  It would help our students and young 
people.  It would help all of the families if we had a reduced 
tax load. 
More of them would be able to have jobs. More of them would then 
add to the economy.  They would have a higher disposable income 
and more money in their pockets in order to provide for the needs 
of their families, whatever those needs are, the actual explicit 
expenditures they encounter or indirect ones.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many families nowadays are really struggling.  We have heard 
many times in this House that in order to have a balanced budget 
in the home both parents must work.  As a result we have the 
social needs of the children, their parenting needs and also the 
tax needs to provide for the ability to look for day care or 
whatever is needed for the children, many of these things.  The 
government should be out of the tax picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love it if in this country parents could have a free 
choice as to where they use their money for educating, training, 
or providing recreation for their children.  Certainly they 
should have the choice of whether or not they want to actually 
parent their children themselves or hire others to do it. There 
are too many people who because of our excessively high rate of 
taxation simply do not have that choice.  We are slaves to our 
tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg—Transcona mentioned in his speech, and 
I have had the same experience, that charitable organizations 
have to charge the GST on the different functions they do to try

I do not know how this government can do that and still have any 
collective conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister 
and all those individual Liberal members over there can sleep at 
night knowing that what they are doing is wrenching every dollar 
they can from Canadians in order to provide for the things that 
they value. It gives them such a sense of power to be able to tax 
Canadians and then decide where they will give it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have noticed lately that if these people are good Liberal 
members with a paid up membership they are more likely to be 
eligible to receive a government appointment and things like 
that.  It is unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever I think of voting for a bill that spends money or of 
approving an expenditure of a committee, I like to think in my 
mind of any family back in my riding whose whole annual tax bill 
in some cases will go to provide for that expenditure.  We need 
to become much more conscious here of the burden we are putting 
on people.

thank you for giving me these two minutes. This is a very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a single mother for a long time. My son played hockey and 
it was always an additional cost in my budget. I always had to 
find ways to pay for registration fees, equipment, etc. All these 
things cost money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion, but I am somewhat concerned by what the 
Reform Party member says about our taxes. It is true that 
Canadians pay a lot of taxes. 
We often hear that the government should reduce taxes, but the 
Reform Party never talks about the big corporations that do not 
pay their fair share. Reform always says that ordinary people pay 
too much taxes and it is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I was very concerned when I heard the hon. member say 
that the government should stop collecting taxes. This really 
concerns me. As we know, they want to give up our national 
programs, which are so important in this country, such as our 
health care program.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DISEASED SHEEP 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 20 in this House I asked a pertinent question of the 
Hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food concerning the sheep 
disease scrapie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding, I would like to reassure all of the members of 
this House that scrapie does not cause any human health problems. 
The problem that it does cause is for the farmer, as generally 
the whole flock has to be destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes available to me, I would like to touch on the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, on carcass disposal procedures, 
and on compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the new food inspection agency.  It must be kept in 
mind that this agency was created out of thin air by this 
government. Since it began operations on January 1, 1997, barely 
16 months ago—call it happenstance if you will—the number of flocks 
infected by scrapie has been rising to such an extent that one 
wonders whether the cuts affecting inspection do not bear a 
direct relationship to that increase.  The reason I say this is 
that, when the flock at the Lennoxville research station in the 
riding of Sherbrooke was dispersed, the government saw fit to 
release sheep infected with scrapie into circulation. 
That is serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency must now be asking serious questions as to how the 
carcasses were disposed of on February 16, five weeks ago.  An 
order was passed here in Ottawa to have the agency pay the costs 
of this disposal. I thought the carcasses were to be incinerated 
but I was wrong. Since the decision was made to pay, the 
carcasses are being collected by the thousands and deposited in 
regional landfill sites. Often this creates problems with runoff 
water, and our government tolerates or organizes this sort of 
animal disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, compensation falls far short.  The government must sit 
down with the sheep producers.  In this regard, I would like to 
pay tribute to the availability and especially the knowledge of 
three producers. 
They are Georges Pharand, Réjean Raymond and Giovanni Lebel, all 
from the lower St. Lawrence.  They met in camera with the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and were no doubt a valuable 
source of information for all committee members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am obviously impatient to hear the government's response to 
these three questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, scrapie is a 
naturally occurring disease that has been around for over 200 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present scrapie program in Canada is one of the best in the 
world.  It was launched in 1945.  There is no known link between 
scrapie and human diseases.  There is therefore no reason to 
alarm the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All animals that show clinical symptoms of scrapie or are felt to 
present a high risk of contracting the disease are ordered 
destroyed under the supervision of the Canada Food Inspection 
Agency.  The carcasses of such animals are incinerated or 
buried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are compensated for the animals ordered destroyed under 
the Health of Animals Act. 
In addition, recent amendments to the regulations now guarantee 
payment of compensation for the associated costs of disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compensation encourages owners to report diseases and to play an 
active role in the fight against them, as well as in the efforts 
to track down their origins.  Responsibility for maintaining 
consumer confidence in access to international markets rests 
with farmers, the industry and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's scrapie program is recognized as one of the most 
rigorous in the world.  We will continue to work closely with 
the industry to combat this disease.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to go into more 
detail about the question I raised in this House on March 10 
regarding home care.  I am hoping that this forum will finally 
result in some answers from the Liberals and some assurances that 
their government is standing up for medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clear sense of urgency about the issue of health care 
and about the need for home care.  There is not a Canadian 
anywhere who has not experienced personally and directly problems 
stemming from the inadequacies of our health care system or who 
does not know someone who has experienced some horrible situation 
in our health care system.  They know we have a health care 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want this government to provide more than words and more 
than election promises.  They are desperately looking for federal 
leadership, for a role by this government to preserve and 
strengthen medicare.  They do not want anything to do with the 
kind of leadership, if we can call it that, being offered by the 
Reform Party.  They reject totally the Reform policy, articulated 
so clearly yesterday, to establish a parallel private, for profit 
two tier health care system.  They reject absolutely that kind of 
system.  They want to see this government act now and act quickly 
to prevent that kind of idea from gaining any ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deeply care about medicare.  They want to see medicare 
preserved and strengthened.  They believe in a universally 
accessible, publicly administered, single payer health care 
system.  They know it requires certain things on the part of this 
government. It requires a reversal of the trend that we have seen 
over the last few years of government offloading and cutbacks. 
They know it requires a commitment to reinvest in health care, 
especially at a time of budgetary surplus.  They know it requires 
new and innovative directions to health care like home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to this government but specifically to the Minister of 
Health that his argument that we need more time to study home 
care before this government is prepared to act is completely 
misplaced and a fallacious argument.  We have no shortage of 
studies, experience and examples about home care, how it can work 
and the kind of benefits it will achieve. 
What we need is action now.  We need money on the table.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several reasons why home care is so critical right 
now. It will help to address the current crisis in our hospital 
system because if we do not have home care, people stay longer in 
hospitals.  We know it is a cost effective method.  We know that 
it is a responsible public policy responding to an aging 
population.  We know it will take pressure off the families and 
particularly women who are left with the primary care of parents 
and aging relatives.  We know it will stop the emergence of 
privatization in the home care field and we know that it will 
create jobs and create a boom for our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is absolutely clear that the best health 
system in the world did not just create itself.  It took 
leadership and vision.  We need that leadership and vision from 
the Liberal government now to preserve health care, to strengthen 
medicare and ensure that we have a national home care plan as 
soon as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
people are wondering why the government is not investing in home 
care today if it is so urgent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows full well that Canadians need help to 
provide care at home and in the community. That is why, in the 
last budget, it gave back $1.5 billion in transfer payments to 
the provinces for this year and that is also why, in the 1998 
budget, it increased tax relief for caregivers, as promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is why the government has invited Canadians as well 
as experts in home care from across Canada to meet in Halifax 
last week to discuss the measures that should be taken with 
regard to home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message from the national conference on home care was very 
clear. Delegates agreed that a national approach is required in 
the area of home care. Participants at the conference have asked 
us to find the best solutions, not only the quickest. They want 
us to do things right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government started to work on that last year in response to 
recommendations by the National Forum on Health. We responded 
immediately by creating, for a period of three years, the 
federal-provincial-territorial fund for health services 
adjustment. Home care is one of four priority areas for 
evaluation and innovative projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the provinces and territories provide home care 
services to their residents. However, we have a variety of 
standards, services, eligibility criterias, user fees and funding 
levels across the country. It is a complex situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot more work to be done. We have to form a 
partnership with the provinces, hold further consultations with 
Canadians, define priorities, develop a plan and make careful 
investments to reach our goal. We are planning to do that over 
the next 12 to 18 months. That is what we will do.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>APEC SUMMIT

<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the House for its indulgence in permitting me to 
speak while seated as a result of my recent injuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was on December 11, 1997, the day after international human 
rights day, that I posed a question to the Prime Minister 
concerning the role of the Prime Minister's office during the 
recent APEC summit in my home city of Vancouver, British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke of deep concerns about the events that took place in the 
time leading up to the summit as well of course as the events 
that took place during the summit itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the lead-up to the APEC leaders summit which was held in 
Vancouver at the end of November 1997 it was very clear that the 
Liberal government refused to put human rights on the agenda of 
the meeting despite pleas from my colleagues in the New 
Democratic Party and NGO delegates across Canada to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its lack of funding for the people's summit for NGO delegates to 
travel from Asia demonstrated that the government was determined 
to stifle any dissenting opinions about the role of APEC in 
promoting human rights, environmental, labour and social 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, rather than bar Indonesian dictator General Suharto 
as a war criminal under Canadian immigration law, the Liberal 
government arranged to meet with him in Indonesia prior to the 
summit and assure him that his security concerns would be 
addressed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1845"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw during the APEC summit exactly how that promise to 
General Suharto was kept.  Who could forget the images on 
television of peaceful protesters being pepper sprayed by the 
RCMP as the motorcades with Suharto and other known human rights 
abusers drove by? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the eye witness accounts from a UBC student, Darren Lund, 
said it all.  He said that it was blatant that excessive force 
was used against peaceful students.  He witnessed as police 
emptied over 20 large canisters of pepper spray indiscriminately 
into the crowd.  He thought it was a shameful way to show 
students how economic and corporate interest can supersede 
fundamental human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many other violations.  Protesters were detained 
without charge and forced to sign release conditions that 
abrogated their right to protest by saying they would not return 
to UBC during the APEC meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the case of Jaggi Singh, who was arrested while walking 
with his friends to the student union building at UBC.  He was 
forced to the ground by a plain clothes policeman, thrown into an 
unmarked car with tinted windows and driven away to a detention 
centre in the outskirts of the city.  It sounds more like 
Argentina in the 1970s than Canada in the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women protesters were being singled out for strip searches in 
prison.  Police forcibly removed the Tibetan flag that was flying 
at the graduate students' centre.  Aboriginal Musquem Chief Gail 
Sparrow was prevented from speaking on human rights, and law 
student Craig Jones was arrested for peacefully holding signs 
that read “free speech”, “democracy” and “human rights”, 
even though they were posted outside the APEC restricted security 
zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call today on our government to order an independent public 
inquiry into these very serious events.  An inquiry by the RCMP 
Public Complaints Commission is not enough.  Certainly it can 
look into the complaints against the RCMP, but we must look into 
the role that the Prime Minister's Office played, for example, in 
interfering directly in the agreement that was arrived at between 
the University of British Columbia and those who were involved in 
the RCMP in organizing this meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as former MP Marion Dewar said, in this, the 50th 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, pepper 
spraying protesters is no way for Canada to demonstrate 
leadership.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the 
hon. member's question I would like to essentially put things in 
the proper perspective first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The APEC conference and the security evolving around the APEC 
conference was one of the largest events in Canadian history.  It 
involved over 3,000 police officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As international law dictates, it also involved Canada having a 
responsibility to protect the 18 heads of state who were 
attending the conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, there were clearly defined zones for the 
demonstrators to freely demonstrate in public view of the 18 
heads of state who were attending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were numerous complaints received since that incident and 
those complaints have been addressed directly to the Public 
Complaints Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Public Complaints Commission, as we know, is an independent 
administrative tribunal.  It also has civilian members on it. 
They have the power to review all the complaints.  They have the 
power to even conduct investigations and hold hearings.  We look 
forward to those hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 3, the Chair, Shirley Heafey, began the 
investigation into the RCMP's actions.  On February 20, 1998, she 
also indicated that there would be a public interest hearing, 
which the member is calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hearings will start on April 14, 1998.  We have every 
confidence that the Public Complaints Commission will do its job, 
that it will investigate everything it feels is necessary to 
investigate.  We await the report.

Canada's waters from oil and chemical spills, the minister 
demonstrated to all Canadians why the problem associated with the

This is a minister whose discretionary powers are used to 
circumvent the protection of fish habitat and ignore Fisheries

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His decisions regarding the Cheviot mine and lack of action in 
the New Brunswick aquaculture are a testament to the minister's 
absolute disregard for environmental matters.  The bottom line is 
that he is ignoring a panel of inquiry by not implementing the 
panel's recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently the DFO is determining the bulk oil cargo fee, which 
is designed to extract funds from oil companies to clean up their 
spills.  A handful of major oil companies presently profit from 
the bulk oil cargo fee by laundering their fee through their own 
certified response organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the oiled wildlife response organizations 
subcontracted by the certified response organizations have no 
guaranteed funding to provide essential environmental and safety 
services, while the certified response organizations 
automatically receive the bulk oil cargo fee whether or not they 
perform the duties expected of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Coast Guard is unable or unwilling to monitor the 
establishment, collection and allocation of the fee on an 
equitable basis.  Furthermore, the DFO consistently refuses to 
publish reports on the fee structure and to consult the principal 
stakeholders involved in the bulk oil cargo fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is worse, the certified response organizations receive 
guaranteed funding and make a great profit from it without 
providing the service.  In some cases they state they can provide 
the service but end up utilizing expert organizations such as 
Maritime Atlantic Wildlife to carry out the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the certified response organizations claim that 
oiled wildlife response is not part of their mandate so they can 
pocket more money at the expense of both the environment and 
inevitably the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of such activities, I propose that the DFO take 
immediate action toward the following three points:  the creation 
of a non-profit, independent, national oil spill agency that 
would determine the fee structure, collect the fee, specify a 
fixed percentage for the other parties according to the need, 
such as oiled wildlife response organizations, and monitor the 
oil spill response organizations; forbid oil companies from 
owning any share in certified response organizations; and forbid 
non-Canadian owned response organizations from benefiting from 
the bulk oil cargo fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 31 months the fairness and equity of the bulk oil 
cargo fee have been well analysed.  The overwhelming view of both 
government and independent studies demonstrate there are serious 
legal and viability problems.  It is also the view of many 
including myself that it was the Tories who were responsible for 
creating this collusive, monopolistic practice by putting the 
interest of corporate greed ahead of fundamental principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I ask the Liberals to stop putting the interests of oil 
companies' pocketbooks ahead of the health of Canadians, our 
environment and our economic well-being.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the current 
oil spill preparedness and response regime was put in place by 
the previous government to supplement the Canadian Coast Guard's 
existing capacity to respond to a major oil spill anywhere in 
Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member can be assured that Canada's preparedness 
capacity has been significantly increased since the 
<I>Nestucca</I> and <I>Exxon Valdez</I> spills of 1989, with teams 
and equipment in place in all regions capable of responding to 
spills of up to 10,000 tonnes.  That is more than 10 times the 
size of the <I>Nestucca</I> spill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, in the event of a catastrophic spill, equipment and 
personnel would be moved in from other regions and from other 
countries to protect our marine environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government strongly supports the principle that the 
potential polluter pays the cost of the preparedness system. This 
means that those who transport oil in Canadian waters must pay a 
fee to cover the cost of equipment and infrastructure that stand 
ready to combat a spill should one occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After extensive consultation, industry stakeholders agreed on 
the basic structure of a business based regime that would ensure 
that all potential polluters shared these costs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some major oil companies then invested approximately $50 million 
in response organizations in order to put this preparedness

However, all potential polluters have an obligation to pay their 
share of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gold panel made a number of sweeping recommendations on the 
governance of the regime along with a different approach for 
deriving fees.  Taken as a whole these recommendations constitute 
a complete reworking of the existing regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister accepts the panel's concern but has an obligation 
to consult with the stakeholders who worked with the government 
in creating the regime rather than imposing the new system 
proposed by the panel.  A decision by the Ministry of Fisheries 
and Oceans on fees is now imminent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to create an integrated public and private sector
