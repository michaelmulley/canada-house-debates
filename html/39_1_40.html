His wife, Betty Aldridge, a constituent and local councillor in my riding of Simcoe--Grey, created the Dick Aldridge Pancreatic Cancer Foundation to further the awareness of funding for pancreatic cancer research. On July 25, Betty will host the second annual Dick Aldridge golf classic and hopes to surpass the $50,000 raised in last year's tournament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para24968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of death related to cancer, both for men and for women, in Canada and the U.S.A. The disease is not only common but extremely difficult to treat. For these and other reasons, cancer of the pancreas has been called the challenge of the 21st century.</div>
    </p><a name="Para24969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why it is important we raise awareness of this deadly disease. In commemoration of Dick Aldridge, I would like to designate the month of November as national pancreatic cancer awareness month. Through prevention and research, we will find a cure.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The federal government must correct its errors, especially since the local communities wish to take charge of sustainable development of the UNESCO world biosphere reserve.

It can come in the form of neglect and physical, sexual, psychological or financial abuse. It can take place at home, in an institutional setting or in the community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para24983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It affects our parents and grandparents, yet it often goes unreported. It is for this reason that awareness-raising is a crucial component of preventing the abuse and neglect of older persons. I contacted the Minister of Canadian Heritage asking her to support the commitment made under the United Nations international plan of action by proclaiming June 15 elder abuse awareness day here in Canada. She declined. I was absolutely shocked. </div>
    </p><a name="Para24984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last election, the Conservative Party promised to protect seniors against elder abuse in all of its forms. I had hoped the government would now walk the walk. </div>
    </p><a name="Para24985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other parts of the world, Elder Abuse Awareness Day is tomorrow. It is not too late for us to do the right thing here. I have placed the appropriate proclamation motion on the order paper. I would urge my colleagues on all sides of the House to put partisanship aside and join me in supporting this vital first step in protecting our seniors.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have implemented the deduction for depreciation applicable to renewable energy generation equipment or enhanced performance of fossil fuels. Guess where that came from. </div>
    </p><a name="Para24993"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have permitted the tax-free intergenerational rollover of fishing businesses: an excellent Liberal idea. </div>

    </p><a name="Para25029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1972, Mr. Saint-Jean learned that he suffered from this progressive genetic disorder. He created the Fondation Claude-Saint-Jean, which collected millions of dollars to fund scientific research and thus discover that there were different forms of ataxia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together, science and the tenacity of Claude Saint-Jean led to the discovery that ataxia is a symptom, and not a specific disease; it is characterized by impaired coordination among the parts of the human body. This physical condition progresses inexorably and cannot be arrested.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claude Saint-Jean put a face on Friedreich's ataxia. He exhibited uncommon courage and phenomenal perseverance in his efforts to relieve the suffering of people with ataxia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claude Saint-Jean is gone, but his work will continue. The Bloc Québécois offers its deepest condolences to his family and friends.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A motion agreed to by the majority at that particular committee meeting states, and I quote:</div>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para25252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, the rationale for this motion agreed to at committee was to draw attention to this question and to ensure that the House of Commons could make a decision regarding potential actions of the Conservative government. Let me explain. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learned a few weeks ago that the Government of Canada, through the Department of Public Works and Government Services, was seriously considering leasing the former JDS Uniphase complex at 3000 Merivale Road in Ottawa on a long-term basis to use as the headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that JDS Uniphase decided to sell this building a few years ago. The company had formerly been headquartered in Ottawa, but had decided to move its operations primarily to the United States. This property therefore became vacant. It was strongly recommended that JDS Uniphase sell this complex, and the market expected that it would. The company put the complex on the market for roughly $30 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that at the time, the Government of Canada was approached about purchasing the building without a public tendering process. It was even suggested that the building be used as the new headquarters of the Department of National Defence. However, the government at the time refused this transaction because it was unsolicited and a public tendering process had not been held.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time later, JDS Uniphase managed to sell this complex to Minto Developments for, we are told, about $30 million, the original asking price.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minto Developments subsequently made a proposal to the Government of Canada, again unsolicited and without a public tendering process, that the complex be used by one of its departments or agencies.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525">(1525)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This would have had to be a transaction without competitive bidding. It was not obviously a good transaction, financially healthy for the Government of Canada, especially because there was no public tendering. Other developers did not have an opportunity to submit competitive prices or propose other locations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been hearing for a few weeks that the Conservative government was holding discussions with Minto Developments. A lobbyist with close Conservative ties was even said to have taken part in these discussions in one way or another, directly or indirectly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the Conservative government supposedly decided to seriously consider the transaction. Rumours are that the government is very interested in this transaction, even though there is no public tendering. It is quite difficult, therefore, for the House of Commons and the people of Canada to ensure that this transaction is a good one financially for Canadian taxpayers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumours are that the transaction is worth more than $600,000, payable by the Government of Canada over 25 years. In other words, it is apparently a lease with an option to purchase upon expiry. The total cost for Canadian taxpayers is apparently over $600 million, even $625 million. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why we asked the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates to look into this matter was precisely because no one so far, especially among the opposition parties, is convinced that this is a good deal for providing space for about 10,000 public servants. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government seems to be clinging very stubbornly to this transaction. Members will recall the parliamentary secretary to the minister stating categorically in this House that there was no transaction and no agreement on the building. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the minister was saying in the other house that there had been negotiations and even a letter of understanding signed by the Government of Canada and Minto Developments. It is not right for us to discover that there were negotiations—and apparently still are—the minister knows about them, while in this House the parliamentary secretary is telling us—playing on words and not necessarily using the exact terms in the letters of agreement—that there is no transaction, we can sleep in peace, there is nothing to fear, we can merrily dream on, and all is well, thank you very much. But that is not the reality. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This leads me in the debate to speak about the details of a government policy that has been in effect for several years. Under this policy, employment with the Government of Canada is supposed to be spread across the greater national capital region. In fact, 75% of the jobs should be in Ontario and 25% in Quebec. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530">(1530)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This policy refers to jobs which are directly or indirectly related to the federal government. To give you an example of indirect jobs, the jobs at crown corporations such as the CBC or Canada Post are indirect Government of Canada jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Parliamentary Secretary was just recently given a candid and honest briefing by employees of the Department of Public Works. They presented him with statistics which clearly demonstrated that the current split was actually 77% or 78% on the Ontario side and 22% or 23% on the Quebec side. Those are not exactly the figures contained in this Government of Canada policy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all Government of Canada jobs, direct and indirect, were correctly compiled, I believe that the current split is around 82% on the Ontario side and 18% on the Quebec side. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the JDS Uniphase Minto Development transaction were to go through, it appears that this complex would be assigned to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. That would mean that all kinds of space on the Ontario side, now occupied by the RCMP, would become vacant. So there is reason to believe that the Government of Canada would prefer to fill up this free space on the Ontario side before creating space on the Quebec side. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that sort of situation, considering that the JDS Uniphase Minto Development complex could accommodate around 10,000 employees, the percentage or proportion becomes very different. For then, on the Quebec side, the number of jobs in the federal public service, in agencies and corporations related to the Government of Canada, would fall below 15%. So it would rise above 85% on the Ontario side. This is totally unacceptable and contrary to the Government of Canada policy which stipulates that the rates have to be 75% on the Ontario side and 25% on the Quebec side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long-time members of this House will surely recall a very similar situation which occurred mainly in the late 1980s and early 1990s. At that time, the Government of Canada had decided to install Transport Canada in a new complex, a new building. The Conservative government of the time issued a call for public tenders, and it was very clearly established that the three bids most favourable to the Government of Canada were for properties located on the Quebec side of the national capital region. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will recall that the Conservative government did not want Transport Canada to move to the Quebec side. The Prime Minister of the time, the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney, and his government therefore bypassed the bids that were made and the whole tendering system in place. I know of what I speak because I received confirmation of it: certain promoters and contractors spent over a million dollars to prepare those tenders. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535">(1535)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the winning bids, right? Wrong! The Conservative government of the day decided that it should not go to the Quebec side, but should stay in downtown Ottawa. So the government signed agreements to renovate Mr. Campeau's building, Place de Ville.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I see you are smiling. No doubt you remember because you were here at the time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada ended up spending more money retrofitting Place de Ville to bring it up to the federal government's standards than it would have spent to get a brand new complex on the Quebec side. The Conservative government of the day decided to keep it in downtown Ottawa. This time, the government did not issue a public tender. It did not invite developers and entrepreneurs in the region—neither in Quebec nor in Ontario, the entire national capital region—to submit bids. It took a shortcut. It is now in the process of deciding about buying Minto Developments' old JDS Uniphase campus. This is unacceptable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to distributing jobs on the Ontario and Quebec sides of the river, the minister and his parliamentary secretary—a tip of the hat to them—have acknowledged that the 75:25 policy exists and that at some as-yet-undetermined point in the future, the government will do its best to comply with it. The minister stated that reaching that goal would be costly because the government would have to lease or buy new buildings in Gatineau for new employees. I strongly believe that a strategy should be implemented immediately to fill this gap. It should come as no surprise to the members that I think this precludes buying or leasing the old JDS Uniphase building or campus from Minto Developments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, who is listening, will be tempted to say that the previous government, my government, did not manage to achieve the 75:25 ratio. He is right. However, our government made a very laudable effort. New buildings were leased on our side of the river, the Quebec side, in the former city of Gatineau, on boulevard de la Cité, and what used to be called Hull, at Crémazie and Montcalm streets. However, in recent years, jobs seem to have been moving to the Ontario side. The first example that comes to mind is Canada Revenue Agency, formerly located in the Fontaine building, in Gatineau, in the old Hull sector. More than 600 employees were moved from the Quebec side to the Ontario side, to Ottawa. Those people who live on the Quebec side of the National Capital Region—you are familiar with the city, Mr. Speaker, having lived here long enough—must now commute to Billings Bridge in Ottawa, or worse, to the west end. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Conservative government is not considering the intentions of the City of Ottawa, which seems to believe that there should be a greater balance between the east end and the west end of the city. Currently, the west end is favoured.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am being signalled that my time is nearly up, in conclusion, I would ask this House to approve the report tabled by the Chair of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates. The report clearly tells the government that it must use the public tender process before it enters into any purchase or lease contracts for major spaces.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former parliamentary secretary to the minister of public works and government services, I spent quite a bit of time looking at the realty issues. In one of the meetings I recall that Public Works and Government Services would often buy buildings on spec because they have come onto the marketplace. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who knows about the volatility of the departmental requirements, they may require an inventory of unoccupied space to be configured as changes occur. This is an example of where the issue of a competitive bid basis is not significantly applicable. The principle has always been in that particular department, the realty division of Public Works and Government Services, to look at all of the opportunities in the best interests of all Canadians. Certainly, the public bid basis is the international standard of openness and transparency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if the hon. member would care to advise the House about the experience and range of these kinds of investments that Public Works and Government Services must review and when public tenders normally have been exercised.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot ignore the economic and social importance of public service jobs in a region, whether in the national capital region or other urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Hamilton, London, Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton. You know what I mean. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locating and consolidating federal government jobs in the Outaouais, respecting the distribution of jobs on both sides of the river, is a major factor in our development. The hon. member for Mississauga South did not fail to mention that, for us, the economy of the Outaouais region is largely based on the presence of the Government of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously there are other government jobs at the provincial and municipal levels. Furthermore, for the past number of years, we have been enjoying the contributions of the high-tech industry. Another very significant domain for us is tourism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back to Government of Canada jobs. I should point out that this has been done. I introduced a motion during the 38th Parliament asking the Government of Canada to take the necessary steps to distribute federal jobs in the national capital region more equitably, as I was explaining earlier.<sup></sup></div>
    </p><a name="Para25289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This job distribution strategy must cover all federal departments and include all federal corporations. If you allow me to go into detail, I will let you do the math as to what this represents in terms of departments, agencies and jobs. The strategy must include all the federal public agencies identified in the Bank of Canada Act, the Broadcasting Act—the CBC and the Société Radio-Canada—the Canada Council Act, the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development Act, the International Development Research Centre Act, the National Defence Act, the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act and the Telefilm Canada Act. It must also include the institutions that are identified in a schedule to the Financial Administration Act or come under that act. I am thinking of Canada Post and even the House of Commons and the Senate. I am not saying that jobs should be moved to that side, but they should be included in the calculation.</div>

But after thinking about it, perhaps I am not surprised. This distribution of 25% and 75% was decided on in 1984 by a Liberal government. My colleague for Hull—Aylmer, who just spoke, was elected on November 15, 1999, and it was not until November 10, 2005, with things heating up and the elections coming, that he decided to start defending the Outaouais.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did it take him six years to realize that there was a problem? This is an extremely important factor in opening up the Outaouais, and ensuring that the Outaouais may be recognized as an integral part of Quebec. In Quebec we have always paid our taxes; we are entitled to our share of income, our share of jobs in the region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am stunned. He has not clearly shown that the objective of his efforts was to defend the Outaouais. The elections are behind his efforts because the Bloc Québécois is monitoring him closely. We will work on this issue. How can the member make such comments?</div>

In this case, out of respect, I will address my answer to you, although I understood that the question did not come from you. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it surprising that my colleague, the member for Gatineau, who represents the Bloc Québécois, would launch into a personal attack that contains as many falsehoods as can be spoken in 45 seconds. I will explain. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993, I agreed to work and collaborate with the team working for a minister from the Outaouais, the former member for Hull-Aylmer, the hon. Marcel Massé. Starting on November 4, 1993, the date when Mr. Massé was sworn in, our priority was to get jobs to come to the Outaouais, and to bring jobs there ourselves. It was an honour for me, and a privilege, to work with Mr. Massé in the government of that time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1999, when Mr. Massé retired, people from my riding persuaded me to stand for election to replace him. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since November 15, 1999, I have been elected, re-elected, re-elected and re-elected once again, because in six years and two months I have run in four elections. The big priority has been jobs in the Outaouais. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The member must have been distracted when I spoke earlier about the progress we have made in recent years in bringing new buildings to the Boulevard de la Cité in the riding of Gatineau. I am surprised that he is not aware of this, because it is his riding. So I have to wonder how well he knows his riding. We have also brought new buildings to the riding of Hull-Aylmer, on Crémazie Street and on Montcalm Boulevard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am surprised that a Bloc Québécois member would attack one of his colleagues who is trying to bring economic growth and jobs to the Quebec side of the Ottawa River. What he is doing, for his part, is trying to break up the country, to separate Quebec from Canada. That would stir things up on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the member should understand that once Quebec separated, if that were to happen, I do not believe that the Government of Canada would be preserving jobs in another country. To Canada, Quebec would be another country. In Quebec, the capital is not the Outaouais, but in fact Quebec City or, potentially, the city of Montreal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that the member for Gatineau should wake up and get his aim straight. </div>

    </p><a name="Para25304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to the point he just made, our government, like the Liberal government before it, recognizes the 75%:25% principle. When the federal government shows leadership, it shows Quebeckers that they should remain part of our country. When we share federal government responsibilities on both sides of the river, we will show Quebeckers in the hon. member’s riding of Gatineau that Quebec really has a place in our government and in our country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to show through buildings and responsibilities that Quebec has a place within our federal government. Through a 75%:25% sharing of the square footage and employees on the two sides of the river, we will show that we agree with this principle and that our government has embraced it. It is really a Canadian principle. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para25306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Hull—Aylmer raised three points which I would like to address. First, he discussed the issue of the JDS Uniphase building and its future. Second, he mentioned the 75%:25% issue on both sides of the river in usage of office space. Third, was the specific language of the motion and where we go from here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the JDS Uniphase agreement in principle that has been signed, as I have said a number of times in the House and as the Minister of Public Works has said a number of times, both in the Senate and in public, the deal has not been finalized. It has not received Treasury Board approval and has not been given the go ahead as of yet. Should it receive that status, we will have an opportunity to have a full and open debate on that project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of the 75%:25%, we are completely in favour of that as a principle of this government in sharing federal government responsibilities in the national capital region, 75% on the Ottawa side and 25% on the Quebec side. With regard to real estate going forward, there are real opportunities to re-balance this number. I believe the number currently is 78% on the Ottawa side, so we are pretty close to the 75% number. However, to actually get precisely to a 75%:25% Ottawa-Quebec ratio, it would require moving tens of thousands of jobs to the Quebec side. That is something that can be done in the future. It is not something to rush into and it is not something we would do just to say we have achieved the 75%:25% principle. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians, Quebeckers and Ontarians want us to achieve that ratio but they also want us to do it in a way that is fiscally responsible and prudent going forward. We believe in the principle. We take that into consideration with any potential leases or purchases of federal government office space going forward. We will adhere to that principle going forward but we will do so in a way that is fiscally responsible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and final aspect the member for Hull—Aylmer addressed in his comments was with regard to the specific line of the motion itself. In case anyone has forgotten what we are actually debating, we are debating a motion that came from the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates that reads as follows:</div>
    </p><a name="Para25311"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), your Committee has considered the matter of the acquisition of significant property by the Government of Canada. Your Committee recommends that acquisition, by purchase or lease, of any significant property, such as the former JDS Uniphase campus in Ottawa by the Government of Canada for use by its departments and agencies, be the result of a competitive public call for tenders process.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para25312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Conservative, I believe in competition, in free markets and in fair prices. The Speaker may roll his eyes at that but I certainly do believe in that, as does this government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, the motion makes a lot of sense. This is an approach the government should take. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with regard to the JDS Uniphase building and a number of other transactions that the federal government has taken over the years, if we were to limit ourselves to the public tendering process it potentially could hurt taxpayers and the federal government's options. This could result in some real missed opportunities for taxpayers and for the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again with regard to the JDS Uniphase proposal, this was an unsolicited proposal the government received from JDS Uniphase and the Minto group which is now investing in that property. The government, in this circumstance or any others, has an opportunity to look at the proposal, to consider it and to negotiate the best value for taxpayer dollars. If the proposal is good, then the process moves forward. If it is not, then the government can walk away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the JDS Uniphase building itself, as I have said a number of times, no deal has been finalized but we will do all of our due diligence to ensure taxpayer dollars are well spent, are appropriately allocated and that we are getting the best value for taxpayer dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support the motion would be a real mistake. In fact, it would go against what the Liberals did a number of times while they were in government. The former Liberal government considered and used unsolicited proposals all the time. In fact, the Department of Foreign Affairs has offices in office space that was through an unsolicited proposal. The Food Inspection Agency is in office space that was obtained through an unsolicited proposal, in the same way as the proposed JDS Uniphase building. That was done in a way that actually received good value for taxpayer dollars. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to remove options from the table in terms of real estate and asset allocation on behalf of the federal government would limit our opportunities, limit the choices for government and therefore for taxpayers and is not the best way to go forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion, which we did not support at committee stage, is a real mistake and we certainly would not support it again.</div>

On page 215 in chapter 7 on the acquisition of leased office space, she refers—the parliamentary secretary will surely remember—to the entire question of 800 Place Victoria in Montreal, where Public Works Canada did not issue a call for tenders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to its own guidelines, Public Works Canada directly negotiated a lease without a call for tenders. The results of this were bad—I will not go into the details because I think he knows very well, but I do want an answer from him—and cost taxpayers $4.6 million. That is not a detail, it is not trivial. We have this example and we have others. I think that this is one of the things—in a few minutes I will have an opportunity to speak—that leave a bad taste and one of the reasons why parliamentarians, as the citizens’ representatives, want to do introduce a rigorous competitive bidding process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the second part of my question: we agree entirely that the Outaouais is very dear to us. We want it to benefit economically from employment and the occupation of purchased or leased space. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point of my colleague refers to Place Victoria, in Montreal. Yes, chapter 7 of the document mentioned shows that what happened is awful. Indeed, there was no public tendering in regard to this space. Sometimes, there are really some disasters, but there are also opportunities, real opportunities to get good value for taxpayers. This is what we will do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not in favour of this motion, which would take away from the government a tool to manage taxpayers' money well in order to find spaces for the federal government in any part of the country. Sometimes, buildings are offered to the federal government. We can then negotiate a price that is reasonable to Canadian taxpayers. Sometimes, we get real value. Taking this tool away from the government is not in the interests of Quebeckers and Canadians. </div>

    </p><a name="Para25328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear discussions about the kinds of prices we are paying for buildings in the Ottawa region when we could get much better benefit for taxpayers. For example, in the town of Kirkland Lake where we have the veterans affairs building there is room for more government jobs. It is a hardrock mining town and federal jobs play an incredibly important role in that community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same in downtown Timmins where we fought to maintain a federal presence. It is not just a benefit to the taxpayers. It is a symbol. It is a commitment. It is saying that there is life outside of Babylon here on the Hill, that there is a country out there and that when we are making a commitment to move forward in planning for new federal expenditures, we should be looking at these regions. When the federal government has a presence in those regions, it creates stability and a workforce that is motivated. In my region there is a bilingual workforce. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would advise the government to sell the building and move workers to Kirkland Lake and Timmins. If it did that it would have a great deal.</div>

I did my undergraduate studies in Prince George, British Columbia, which is a little bigger than Timmins. With a population of about 85,000 or 90,000, the federal government's presence in Prince George was profound in terms of economic development. I therefore understand what he is saying with regard to his own constituency. However, when we talk about the 25%:75% role, we are specifically dealing with the national capital region. It is not a nationwide principle. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say to my colleague from Timmins--James Bay that the argument he just made about the impact the federal government's presence and its buildings can have on communities is an important one, which is why his party should be supporting this government's position and opposing the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion calls for the government to abandon the principle of unsolicited proposals. It is through unsolicited proposals from communities that allows the government the diversity to invest in the economic development of communities like his, which may need the support of the federal government and its presence to be an economic anchor. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member agrees with that principle, which I am sure he does as he is a well-spoken member who speaks forcefully and thoughtfully in this House, he should have a chat with his colleague from Parkdale--High Park who at the government operations committee voted against allowing unsolicited proposals which would have allowed the kind of economic development that he has described. The member for Parkdale-High Park voted for this motion which would take away the government's opportunity to purchase or lease buildings in different economic regions in order to get value for communities and for taxpayer dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he agrees with this principle, I encourage him to convince his party to support it because the member for Parkdale--High Park, the spokesperson of public works, does not agree with him.</div>

If the federal government is serious about moving assets and moving jobs into regions, it can call for tenders for facilities within those regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence of the member that the government has to do that because it was done by other governments in the past, is contrary to the Conservatives' assertions that they were elected for change and calling for transparency. This motion calls for public tenders for public assets. It seems to me that is transparency. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this unsolicited proposal to which he is referring is so good it would stand up to the scrutiny of a public tender and it would be the favoured tender. Perhaps there are other facilities out there that would have been a better value or would have better responded but if no search is done through pubic tenders, how are we ever to discover that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government is serious about decentralization, I would encourage the member to have those tenders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I want to say on transparency is that one of the reasons we need this type of a motion is because of the actions of the government. The minister responsible for this action, who said that this was the best deal possible, is not even allowed to take questions from the members in this chamber, to answer to the Canadian public for his actions and to answer on how he is expending the Canadian dollar. Is he getting value? He may be but I cannot ask him that question. Nobody can. He sits in another house. He was appointed off the campaign bus to the Senate and into cabinet and expends billions and billions of dollars. </div>

That is the natural and default position of any government that truly believes in getting value for taxpayer dollars</div>
    </p><a name="Para25343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Wascana, who is a former public works minister himself, understands that to eliminate the opportunity for people to come to the federal government with an unsolicited proposal for an asset that is unique and may suit the needs of the government in whatever capacity, is not an option that should be taken away from the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals did this, as I said, with regard to the Food Inspection Agency, the Department of Foreign Affairs and dozens of other buildings and it received value for taxpayer dollars. It would be a mistake to take that opportunity off the table. With regard to the member from Timmins, that is precisely what I am talking about. I am talking about having more options on the table and allowing the professionals at the Department of Public Works, through the minister, to do their jobs and to get value for taxpayer dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot do that if we eliminate their options. We need to expand the options, leave them on the table and at the end of the day everything is transparent and people can decide where we are going. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Minister Fortier, the Prime Minister made the determination after the election campaign that the city of Montreal, the second largest city in Canada, should have representation at the cabinet table. If the member opposite does not agree that Montreal should have representation, he should say so, but I do not think he will.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the determination was made, the Prime Minister felt that Mr. Fortier should be available for questions in the Senate. If the member does not think that the 70-plus Liberals sitting in the Senate can hold the Minister of Public Works accountable, then he should have said that this morning in their caucus meeting and told them all to resign.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Public Works is available every day for question period over at the Senate and is available for accountability. He is also available to the public. He has done more in his Department of Public Works in the four months that he has been there than the Liberals did in the past 13 years. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important to take the time to describe the context in which this motion was presented.

    </p><a name="Para25353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates had the opportunity to invite various witnesses to appear before it at its recent meetings concerning the study, by the committee, of the 2006 report of the Auditor General to the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention that we had the pleasure and the privilege to hear testimony from Mrs. Sheila Fraser on three occasions, as well as testimony from officials from various departments and agencies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee examined chapters 7, 4 and 1 of the report, which cover the acquisition of leased office space, the Canadian Firearms Program and managing government: financial information, respectively. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of these three chapters of the 2006 Report of the Auditor General brought to light real problems with the management of the public purse. I just mentioned one such problem when I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services a question a few minutes ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another disturbing problem revealed in chapter 7 relates to the fact that the government's funding mechanisms can significantly preclude selection of the most cost-effective option. For the people who are watching, it is amazing to think such a thing. What we are talking about is financial management of public assets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can and should the government do to manage taxpayers' money as effectively as possible? I am sure that, as parliamentarians, we are all driven by that desire.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can and should the government do to make the best possible use of every dollar that comes out of the pockets of the people to whom the government is accountable?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can and should the government be accountable for this use of public money and for the actions it takes and the choices it makes? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the government must have a method, a system of governance where best practices apply not only to the government's actions, but to its intent as well, the goal being to achieve the utmost transparency and probity. That is what is being referred to here when committee members ask that the acquisition by purchase or lease of property by the government be the result of a competitive public call for tenders process.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610">(1610)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is even more crucial because Public Works and Government Services manages over 6 million square metres of space, of which 52% belongs to the government, 41% is rented and 7% is lease-optioned. Second, this same department has fiduciary responsibility for $3 billion a year in real estate, and thirdly, it signs 500 leases a year. I would also point out that Public Works and Government Services manages offices in 1,900 buildings, of which only 250 belong to the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This represents a tremendous amount of spending power and, in my opinion, its duty of accountability is equally significant, which is why it is very important to be as transparent as humanly possible. Speaking of transparency, I would like to express regret for the absence of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services during such a debate, since he was not elected as a member of this House. I will say no more on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of responsibilities, the responsibility for ideal governance does not end there. There is also the issue of fairness. The tendering process allows potential bidders to be up to date and aware that the government happens to be looking for space. The process thus ensures that competitive offers are submitted so that, in the end, the best value is obtained—for whom? for taxpayers—in order for this reality to be considered and obtained.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tendering process must also avoid giving rise to or maintaining the perception of favouritism and privileges, even if unfounded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairness also means that the government must avoid giving the impression that it prefers one developer, one owner or one company over another. In the greater national capital region, fairness also means taking into consideration bids from both sides of the river so that the 25:75 rule—deemed by the secretary general to be accepted by the Conservative government —may be respected and in order to enable Quebec to receive, as does Ontario, its share of direct economic benefits arising from property leased, purchased or obtained through lease options, as well as jobs. My colleague from Gatineau will undoubtedly speak further about this in a few minutes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurs, developers, owners must be apprised of the government's realty needs. They must have information that is complete, accessible and open in order to bid.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc's goal and my goal as a member of a committee and as a parliamentarian is to ensure that situations where disturbing events appear to be developing are condemned. That was the case with the example we are discussing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I asked a question about 800 Place Victoria, where an additional $4.6 million was spent without a public tendering process, using the guideline Public Works Canada has. These are disturbing events that must be condemned. That is why most of the members of the committee supported this motion in committee. We are presenting it today in order to make it a recommendation so that the government will act on it. What we want is that, in future, there is never any risk of a lack of probity or transparency. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a government, everything is based of the tendering process. I have worked long enough in that kind of structure to know that, when there is no tendering for the big picture and for the smallest details of these projects, costs rise astronomically. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my colleague, I would like to look at the alternative to tendering. What would it be? Traditionally, it is always the tendering process that ensures that we can maintain our prices. What might happen in the case where there was no tendering? How could we control prices?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, this is done through systems on the Internet. We must absolutely avoid cases of cronyism. The risks are very harmful and the danger is great. As I said earlier, what is important to us is that we have economic benefits in our regions—and I am speaking for members of this House, but especially for people from Quebec—and that we have benefits in the national capital region, on both sides of the Ottawa River. We deserve no less. </div>

Once again, the government is trying to use taxpayers' money to reward friends of the new regime. After a few short months in power, good old Liberal habits seem to have won out over the accountability and transparency that the Conservative government wants to bring in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is getting ready to pay $224 million over the next 25 years to Minto Developments Inc. to lease office space in the JDS Uniphase building in Ottawa, without a public tendering process. Minto bought the building last June for $30 million. One day, perhaps, the Minister of Public Works and Government Services will explain to us what logic told him that this was a good deal, but as you know, the minister was not elected by the people and unfortunately does not sit in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that this government campaigned on a platform of accountability and transparency. When we look at the connection between Minto and Fred Doucet and the connection between Mr. Doucet and the current government, we can understand the transaction more easily. In 2003, Fred Doucet was a key member of the leadership campaign strategy committee of the current Minister of Foreign Affairs. Now things are making more sense. Let us not forget that this government campaigned on a platform of accountability and transparency. Mr. Doucet is the middleman between Minto and the government. I wonder what my Quebec colleagues who were elected under the Conservative banner think about this attitude.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the Minister of Transport think? These people promised major changes in how the country is governed. They promised accountability and transparency to the people of Quebec. Where are accountability and transparency when the government is going to spend more than $600 million on a building worth $30 million? Where is accountability when the government is going to pay $23 million a year in rent for a building worth $30 million?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try offering any Canadian the opportunity to rent a house for $75,000 per year instead of buying it for $100,000. What do you think the response would be? The Minister of Public Works and Government Services said, “I'll take it”. Why? We would have to be in the Senate to know the answer to that. We would have to be sitting in the Senate to ask that question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do Conservative members from Quebec—who stood to vote against their fellow citizens on the fuel price issue last week—think? Do they represent Quebec in the government, or do they represent the government in Quebec? They condemned Liberal cronyism, so how can they now accept the Conservative variety?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irony of ironies. Not so very long ago, the Liberals perfected the art of cronyism, and now they are condemning the Conservatives for practising it. Earlier on, the Liberal member for Hull—Aylmer condemned Conservative cronyism, never mind the fact that in his six years on the government bench, not once did he rise to condemn Liberal corruption and scandal. That is the kind of conduct that is giving cynicism license to run rampant among Quebeckers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saddest part of this story is their contempt for the Outaouais region. In 1984, the Liberals and the Conservatives promised to resolve the issue of locating 25% of public service jobs in the Outaouais and 75% in Ottawa. It is now 21 years later, and nothing has changed. During the last campaign, the Minister of Transport promised to use his position to help the region. Last week he backed away from the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology issue and tried to pretend he had never promised the people of the Outaouais anything. Still nothing has been done. This government has not proposed anything to rectify the job distribution situation. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630">(1630)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet we have a minister in the region. This should give the Outaouais some prestige, but there is still nothing. I invite the Minister of Transport to drop the fine speeches and deliver the goods to the Outaouais. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite ironic to see, again this time, our colleague from Hull—Aylmer huffing and puffing about the 25-75 distribution. He forgot to mention that during his six years in government he did nothing tangible about this except to put forward a single motion on November 10, 2005, some 18 days before the last federal election. It took him four elections and six years and seeing the Bloc Québécois in his rear view mirror to start getting interested in his riding and the Outaouais in this matter at the end of the Liberal cronyism mandate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was my colleague during the last election campaign, the night offices were being moved from the Hull sector in his riding of Hull—Aylmer to the Vanier sector in the City of Ottawa? You have to want to see this issue through to get anything done. The hon. member for Hull—Aylmer had six years to defend the Outaouais to his government. If he had done his job, like the public expected him to, he could not now denounce this situation because in speaking out against the 25-75 problem, he is speaking out against himself for not being equal to the task. Between 2000 and 2006, only 21.4% of the jobs in the national capital region were in the Outaouais. That is still far from 25%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the public expects better from a government that promised responsibility and transparency. The government has a chance to kill two birds with one stone by agreeing to take a step in the right direction in the matter of distributing public service jobs and showing true responsibility and true transparency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I invite the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Public Works and Government Services to ensure that the leasing of office space is always done through a public tender process. It is a basic rule of transparency. On this subject, I would ask the minister responsible for Quebec, who is from my region, to look closely, with his colleague from Treasury Board, at the issue of public service jobs on the Quebec side of the Ottawa river. Previous governments introduced a policy of equity between the two shores. But there is a serious shortfall on one side that must be corrected, and I invite the government to propose a plan to restore the proper balance. I am prepared to work in a constructive manner, putting all partisanship aside, to correct this situation once and for all. I will see to it that members from the Outaouais region work with the Bloc Québécois for this particular region of Quebec. </div>

We cannot make any kind of moves or any first nations development without tender process after tender process, capital study after capital study. It seems the federal government's main job in these communities is to block development, and it is always speaking of accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about a real estate deal of $30 million that might be flipped to $300 million or $600 million. My God, that money spent on first nations across Canada would turn some of these terrible sinkholes of human misery into livable places. Yet we are gong to spend that on one building. To even talk about the issue is scandalous. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came back from Kashechewan, just before the flood, for the funeral of four year old Trianna Martin who died in a house fire in a community for which the federal government will not pay any fire service, and it is its responsibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have this demand on all our isolated first nations for tendering processes for the smallest project and a project of this size can go through the system without any tendering at all?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am not mistaken, there are about 450,000 public servants across Canada and 110,000 here in the region. When we talk about the 25/75, it applies to these 110,000 public servants, and not to the other 340,000.</div>

The deal has not been done, although my understanding is that the deal will be done, possibly as of tomorrow, so it is important that we talk about this issue and try to shine some light on the facts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to stick to the facts as I know them and as they have been presented. Sadly, this issue has not been dealt with through transparency but through the opaqueness of the brown envelope I received, which I used to bring this issue to Parliament and to Canadians. That is not the way it should be done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have just come from the committee dealing with Bill C-2, the accountability act. One thing we have proposed for Bill C-2 is to deal with the disclosure of information on contracts to make sure that Canadians receive value for the money they are spending and investing. We want to hear more than “trust us, just wait, the deal isn't signed yet”. We want to hear more than “when the deal is signed you'll all be happy with it”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want the people they elected to represent them to be able to hold the government to account. Clearly this is not going happen when we are told time and time again when this subject is raised in the House, and I did raise it, that we should trust the government, that the deal has not been signed, and that when it is we will be happy with it. I am sorry, but I am from Missouri and I want to see the facts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard that the government is in talks or having discussions. I trust the member when he says the deal has not been signed, so we are in discussions, and what are the facts as we know them? </div>
    </p><a name="Para25425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fact is that JDS Uniphase, which was hit severely by the downturn in the high tech sector in the local Ottawa economy, had surplus land. JDS Uniphase had its surplus campus on Merivale Road. The company went to market to sell its property.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially, JDS Uniphase spoke with the former government and offered the property to the Department of National Defence. We believe the price tag was somewhere around $30 million. What we then found out was that the Department of National Defence said at the time that it was interested. There were some talks. In the end, the department turned down JDS. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What followed was that Minto Developments bought the land for $30 million, following which Minto entered into talks with the former Liberal government to sell the building to the government for what we now know turned out to be over $600 million over 25 years with a lease to buy. I will come back to that in a minute and will reference what the Auditor General thinks about those kinds of deals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are now with a new government that is continuing the talks and again says “just trust us”, that the government will tell us it is a good deal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my constituents and the 4,500 people on the waiting list for affordable housing, for instance, would love to see just a couple of million dollars invested in affordable housing. The NDP has been asking for affordable housing. My party did make some changes to the budget last spring to make sure that there would be investments in affordable housing in our communities, so that people could see money invested in their own communities. My colleague from northern Ontario spoke about the need for investments there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the fact that we have over $600 million to be spent over 25 years on a lease to buy needs a lot of examination and we need answers to a lot of questions that we have put forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the facts. That is the trajectory.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have to add, with respect, that the previous government and the present government have something in common when it comes to this deal. Not only are they both part and parcel on this deal, but they also managed to receive over $70,000 from Minto Developments. Did they break any rules? No. Is it against the law? No, but it gives one pause for cause.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Did the member for Eglinton--Lawrence get any of that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Dewar:</b> I am not sure if he was on the list, but perhaps. Maybe the kids at Minto.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at how much money this developer invested, we will say, in the political parties. Then we turn around and we have a developer pick up, scoop up, a property for $30 million and say, “Hi, would you like to buy it for $625 million over 25 years?” I have to say that I do not criticize Minto Developments for that. We have to give them credit. If they can make that kind of money, the shareholders and the family firm will be very happy. It will be a good year for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to examine it and make sure that it sees the light that Canadians want illuminating it. I am going to go over a couple of the questions that I put to the government. Perhaps it is <i>Waiting for Godot </i> on these answers, and we know what happens there, where Godot never comes, but I am optimistic that we will eventually hear. Here are the questions I put to the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What financial details have gone to Treasury Board to support the agreement in principle? It is a very straightforward question. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put a second question forward. Was the search for a lease agreement publicly tendered? I think we know the answer to that, but it is important to have it for the record.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the details of the tendering process for the relocation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police headquarters from 1200 Vanier Parkway?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, what are the details of the analysis for all of the options considered by public works prior to the agreement in principle with Minto Developments?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, was the City of Ottawa's 2001 policy of stimulating growth by encouraging the location of future federal workplaces near transitway stations, giving particular consideration to the east end of the city, considered in this decision? I have to say that this is not my riding. This is something I am putting forward because this was a consensus of smart growth that the City of Ottawa put forward to make sure that we would have some balance in our development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think those questions deserve answers. They deserve answers before the deal is announced. I think we need to have more transparency, particularly when we are talking about this amount of money. Part of the evidence that was brought forward to me was that there was to be a $5 million down payment to Minto Developments just to be able to discuss the deal. I am wondering if that money was exchanged. What happens if we do not have a deal? They keep the money, I presume.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this is a shady deal. I have spoken to members of the RCMP, as recently as last weekend. I was at a community event and had the opportunity to speak to some RCMP members. I asked them what they thought about this. They were not keen. I dare say that they have not been consulted about this. We are talking about a workplace that is fairly central to the east, in the riding of my colleague from Ottawa—Vanier. We are talking about moving it to the other side of the city.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is important these days when we are looking at planning and future proposals: we might want to consider talking to the men and women who work there. It means that we are talking about disruption of life. The fact is that their lives will be affected. Does it make sense for them, not just in the community but from a safety point of view? Does it make sense to consolidate all of those services in one area? I do not know. Maybe it does and maybe it does not, but that kind of thought process has not been put into play here. That is an issue of safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that there is another issue when we look at how much land is available. Recently, Algonquin College by the Queensway, which my colleague from Ottawa—Vanier will know, is available. Was that a parcel of land that has been known as being available for quite a while? Was it considered? What is the inventory of all the public holdings? Let us have a full analysis of what the options are. Again, we do not know. Maybe that has been discussed, but it has been kept from members of Parliament and therefore kept from Canadians.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645">(1645)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General recently referenced the fact that there have been some rather ill-informed, and some would say dubious, kinds of arrangements made with a lease to buy. What happens in these arrangements is that when one actually buys a piece of property it is possible to put off the books the money one would normally spend at the front end. It is possible to string it out over a period of time, much like what is done by many of the P3 operations we are seeing. What happens is that we pay for the building four or five times when we could have bought it once.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This arrangement is similar to that. In other words, would we rather own a home or rent? I know that most people would love to own their own homes. What the government is deciding to do is rent, the landlord in this case being Minto Developments, and we will pay for the building hundreds of times over before we own it. It does not make sense. The men and women who do their accounting at the kitchen table would not sign off on a deal like this. They would be very disgusted that this kind of financing is going on in this government or any other government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, what we need to do is make sure this does not happen again. We need to make sure there is some transparency, understanding that when there are competitive bids that process can be honoured, so there is no tipping, so to speak, of one company over another. It is done all the time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have competitive bidding. We need to make sure that we do not get into lease to buy arrangements. We need to make sure that we take out of the arrangement those who have given to political parties, particularly as we have found out that more than $70,000 was given to both the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party by the developer. We need to make sure that the government is taking into account all of its holdings. We need to make sure the government is looking at the local municipality, in this case Ottawa, and is looking at its designs, its plans and its future. That is not being done here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must say that if this is the first test of the government for transparency and accountability, as a former teacher I have to say that it would get an F.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I would like him to comment on the following: we are still talking about calls for tender, but I think there is a word missing. The important word being left out is “public”. We are talking about calls for public tender: these words go together. When a government, a public agency, goes to tender it is a call for public tenders. This means that documents are made available and that anyone can consult them and submit an offer, provided they include the required fee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member is absolutely right about everything he said. Nonetheless, in his view, can the current process lead to a call for public tenders?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like him to comment on what the governing party is saying. Earlier, we heard the excuse that things could not be discussed in public, because they were working on an agreement. Since they were working on an agreement, they could not discuss it publicly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That strikes me as wrong. When there is a call for public tenders, documents are made available and things are prepared well in advance. I totally agree with that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like my colleague to address the preliminary steps: establish the need, which is public; establish who will be the key players; establish who will do what. Every aspect—the key players, the engineers, those who will build the building or renovate it if it already exists—requires a call for tenders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could my colleague comment on this?</div>

I will read from our own NDP proposal, “The head of a government institution” or an agent of the government “shall not...refuse to disclose a record or a part thereof if that record or part contains...details of a contract or a bid for a contract with a government institution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the member talks about a public tender, he is quite right. The criteria need to be public so that people can see what it is about and make sure it is not a backroom deal.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say, though, that the other part of this equation that is missing is the minister responsible. That has been more than frustrating. He has been a phantom minister. When we ask a question, there is no one there. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do we have a process that does not allow us to have a window in with regard to the public disclosure piece or the fact that this should be a public tendering, we cannot even ask the minister the question because he is down the hall. That door, as they say in Spanish, is <i>cerrado</i>. It is closed. We are not allowed in.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is someone who is making decisions who is unelected and unaccountable. When he was asked prior to the election if he would consider putting his name forward to represent the people of this country, he said he was too busy. That man was too busy to run for office, but he was not too busy to take the free cash for life lottery from the Prime Minister of Canada to sit in that other chamber.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the day of accountable electoral reform will come and all of the friends of the two main parties in the Senate will be tossed out with their desks after them. Then we will be able to put something a little more accountable in place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a major issue here for Parliament. When a minister who has control over such important decisions in terms of public spending is unaccountable to Parliament, it raises serious questions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the fact that there is a minister who is unelected and unaccountable and does not feel the need to show his face anywhere, if we could get all-party consensus, perhaps we could get a large cardboard cut-out of him and wheel it into the House so that we could ask it questions. We would probably get about the same level of answers that we are getting from his lessers right now. If we had a cardboard cut-out of the minister, at least we would know who he is. We would at least be able to put a face to the backroom deals that he is making.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would my hon. colleague support me in bringing forward a motion to have a cardboard cut-out brought into the House each day for question period?</div>

    </p><a name="Para25472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take great pleasure in participating in this debate. I will share my time with my colleague, the member for Mississauga—Erindale.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three or four items of importance to keep in mind in this matter. I want to briefly touch on each. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been reference to the 75-25 split of the federal public service in the national capital region.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para25475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always supported this fair distribution of employees of the public service of Canada in the national capital region, between the Ontario side and the Quebec side of the national capital.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always worked toward this objective and I have always supported initiatives on this. Until very recently, we were getting close to the 75/25 objective, but for some time, it seems that we are moving away from it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first objection to the unsolicited proposal of Minto Development for the Government of Canada to acquire JDS Uniphase is due to the impact that this acquisition might have on achieving the 75/25 distribution objective. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about one million square feet, about 100,000 square metres on the Ontario side. This is a huge deal. It would cause a real setback in achieving this 75/25 objective. Before these additional 100,000 square metres are occupied and the space that is left vacant is filled, we will have a major setback in achieving this objective. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first objection is that this acquisition would move us away from the objective and the Department of Public Works and Government Services never put forward a plan to counter this impact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern stems from the fact that the Canadian government, as the largest employer in the National Capital Region, has an obligation to be a good employer. It is also obligated to be aware of the impact of its decisions on the local economy and population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, there is a disparity between the number of jobs in the east end—of the City of Ottawa—and in the west end. For example, according to the person-year data, in terms of employment on the Ontario side of the National Capital Region, there is a marked disparity between east and west, in favour of the west end, where there are far more jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquiring a million square feet in the west end of Ottawa will only exacerbate an existing problem. The Canadian government, as a good employer, as a so-called good citizen, must carefully consider the repercussions of its decisions on the local economy and population. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of local infrastructure, it must be recognized that this disparity, putting the east end at a disadvantage, is very clear. If the Canadian government, for whatever reason, were to acquire a million square feet in the west end, it would have to come up with a plan to correct that disparity, just as we need to see a plan to correct the 75/25 disparity for the Ontario and Quebec sides of the National Capital Region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are two major concerns, and I would like to add a third. The government is dealing with an unsolicited proposal.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700">(1700)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para25485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the government acquires a huge amount of space such as this one, a million square feet, 100,000 square metres, it is not a small amount of space and it has an impact on the local economy. To acquire that on an unsolicited proposal is a mistake. I believe the government has a duty to respect its own commitment of transparency and go through a public tender process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments offered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works that the government could lose this do not hold water. If it comes back that the best deal is indeed the one that Minto is putting forward on an unsolicited basis currently, then so be it. I will still say, as I have in the past consistently, and Mr. Greenberg of Minto Developments, whom I have met on this on occasion, will confirm that I have always said that it should not be an unsolicited proposal. If the Government of Canada acquires that space, it should be as a result of a public call for proposals. I know there are others in the area, both in Quebec and Ontario, who would like to bid on this. There are some in the east in Orléans, so I imagine that the member for Ottawa—Orléans would be quite interested in knowing that the government would not want to proceed with a proposal call. I believe there may even be some from Glengarry—Prescott—Russell who might have some land holdings and would be interested in bidding. I know there are some from Gatineau, Aylmer and Hull sectors who might be interested. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There would be a great advantage for the government to know what proposals are out there and let the developers sharpen their pencils and put the best deal forward. If Minto still provides the best deal in response to the needs of the government, then proceed with the proviso that public works has a duty at the same time to come up with a plan that will make sure that the long-standing objective of a 75-25 split of federal public service employees in the national capital region, 75% on the Ontario side and 25% on the Quebec side, is met. Also as a good employer, as a model citizen in this community, it should address the current imbalance between the east and the west. These are the conditions that I have always said should be met in dealing with this kind of proposal from Minto. </div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para25488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to take a minute to comment on what the member for Gatineau said about my colleague from Hull—Aylmer. I was elected to this place before the member for Hull—Aylmer and immediately got to work with him in his capacity as executive assistant to the regional minister. I can assure the House that, even in those days, he made sure that issues pertaining to the Outaouais region were looked after. When he was elected member of Parliament for Hull—Aylmer, he joined the government caucus for the national capital region. We would meet every week. Ministers dealing with issues important to our region were invited to attend these meetings, so that we could express our views. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, and all the people of Hull—Aylmer that the hon. member for Hull—Aylmer did not miss a chance to make demands, as appropriate, for the riding and the people he represents. So, what our colleague from Gatineau said has to be taken with a grain of salt, because it does not hold up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wanted to take this opportunity to stress that one wonders who would go there. I must admit that, as the member of Parliament for Ottawa—Vanier, the riding which is currently home to the RCMP headquarters, I am somewhat concerned. The commissioner of the RCMP may correct me publicly if I am wrong, but I was told that he, the commissioner of the RCMP, was the one pushing for this deal to be closed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal is all but closed. A letter of intention has been sent. In fact, the parliamentary secretary said so himself. From the moment that a letter of intention is sent, the rest, including the Treasury Board process, is a mere formality. I may be wrong. Still, the government should take the will of this House into account and wait for a vote to be taken on this proposal. I support the motion to concur in the second report of the committee, requesting that, when making or planning to make acquisitions as major as this. the government go through an open tendering process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude on this note. Should the government go ahead with this acquisition, it would be required to indicate how it plans to achieve the 75-25 split, and to mitigate the current east-west imbalance on the Ottawa side of the national capital region instead of making it worse.</div>

As an experienced member for the region, certainly on this file, his thoughts certainly are welcome. However, I do find it curious that now that the Liberals are in opposition, they find sin in things in which they found virtue when they were in government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about a motion which deals with unsolicited proposals to the government. As I said, of course we believe in open tendering, transparency and competition for taxpayers' dollars and contracting. There is no question about that</div>
    </p><a name="Para25494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member should know that the former Ottawa city hall building at 111 Sussex Drive, which is in the member's district, was appraised at $85 million and purchased by the government for $60 million, 30% below market value. Tenants there currently include: the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Canada School of Public Service, Public Works and Government Services Canada, and the City of Ottawa. This was done through an unsolicited proposal, the very process that would terminate if we took the very approach that he has spoken about in his speech.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said to the member and I said in this House, whenever I met with Mr. Greenberg of Minto on this file, when I was in government, the conditions that I have just enumerated of a public tender process were required in order for Public Works to reach the 75-25 objective. This was to ensure that we did not exacerbate the current east-west balance but redressed it, and it would also accompany the acquisition. That is what I said then and that is what I say now, so for the member to say that I have changed my tune because I am in opposition now is totally inaccurate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the acquisition of the old city hall of Ottawa was something that the government wanted. It wanted it because it happens to be on Sussex Drive which is next to Foreign Affairs. Buying a public property from a government to a government is a totally different process, as the hon. member will know. When the Government of Canada disposes of property, it first goes to other departments, then to provinces and then to municipalities, and the reverse process occurs out of courtesy and respect from other governments. </div>

    </p><a name="Para25501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Prime Minister's words were, when he was in the official opposition and the member for Kings--Hants crossed, that anyone going over for 30 pieces of silver leads to the corruption of government, and the first thing the Conservatives did was accept the floor-crosser from Vancouver Kingsway without asking him to go back to his constituents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They then appointed an unelected, unaccountable, Conservative friend from Quebec, who by the way could not be bothered to run because he was too busy.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has received a proposal. That is legitimate. Whether the government decides to act on it is the question. I am sure the member for Abbotsford, as reasonable as he is, might even agree with me that whenever the government acquires a million square feet of space, it should do so through a public tender call process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may still acquire it after the public tender call process because it may be the better deal. I do not know that. I do not have the details of the deal, but in terms of the transparency aspirations of the government, which the Conservatives have touted as their number one priority, it stands to reason that the government should acquire that huge amount of space as a result of a public tender call process and not an unsolicited proposal.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians expect their government and parliamentarians to manage the matters of our great nation with a high sense of responsibility and diligence. The executive branch, the government, is expected to manage the day-to-day operations while Canadians, through their elected parliamentarians, act as a sounding board and a safety valve for the government's conduct. Our democracy thrives on this dynamic and the eventual beneficiary is Canada and its citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates, of which I am a proud member, parliamentarians have been working diligently to examine various procedures and practices to ensure that Canadians are served well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee had the pleasure of inviting and speaking with the Auditor General and Public Works and Government Services officials. The committee was interested in chapter 7 of her 2006 report, which dealt with acquisition of leased office spaces. The Auditor General and her team have done extensive and excellent work on this file over a number of years, and shared with the committee very insightful and informative findings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee, and any reader of that chapter, would find that there is room to improve the government's practices when it comes to acquiring office spaces. The committee was very interested in examining possible failures and identifying opportunities to enhance the expenditure of taxpayers' money when acquiring office spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee confirmed that the government is on the verge of acquiring large office space in the Ottawa region. The government has apparently signed a letter of intent to purchase the JDS Uniphase campus in Ottawa without conducting an open and transparent competitive bid process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the committee had just heard from the Auditor General about examples of mismanaged taxpayers' money, I proposed a motion that would call on the government to perform its due diligence before acquiring any significant real estate property, such as the JDS campus, and that any decisions be the result of a competitive public tender call process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased that the majority of the committee endorsed that motion, although I was somewhat bewildered to see my colleagues from the Conservative Party voting against accountability and transparency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion intends to encourage the wise expenditure of government funds, so all options are evaluated before a final decision is made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that there are occasions when certain situations may contain conditions and requirements that might appear unique. As someone who worked in the private sector for years, I have a great appreciation for following competitive processes when acquiring or purchasing significant products or projects. The apparent unique requirements, if they are essential to the property needed, can be described in the specifications of any tender.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be surprised how many creative and useful offers will be presented. As well, a competitive process would encourage all bidders, including the apparent favourite ones, to be aggressive in their pricing when they know that open and competitive bids are being sought.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that we are having this debate right now. Even though the government has signed a letter of intent, the building has not been purchased yet. Now is the right time to ensure that this decision is the right decision that offers the highest value to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party has repeatedly attempted to ask the Minister of Public Works about the government's intentions in regard to this transaction. Unfortunately, the minister does not sit in the House so he cannot answer those questions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion is asking a reasonable and logical request. It calls on the government to ensure transparency, accountability and openness. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It amuses me to see my Conservative colleagues oppose this motion. They are claiming to be the champions of accountability, but their position on this motion proves what the Liberals have been saying for a while. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are only promoting selective accountability. They appear to be only pursuing slogans and rhetoric, “Do as I say, but not as I do”. Accountability is good for them when it does not mean holding the government to account. When real accountability and prudent management of taxpayers' money is the real issue, the Conservatives appear to be waffling.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715">(1715)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony is that the Conservatives are accusing the previous Liberal government of forcing their hand to purchase this property. If that is the case, the Liberals are presenting them with a clear opportunity to enhance this transaction right now. If they truly believe that the Liberals have put them in this quandary or made errors, why do they not vote in support of this motion and blame the Liberals?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that my colleagues, members of the House, including the Conservatives, join together to endorse this simple and clear motion. The motion does not prevent the government from obtaining any property. In fact, it protects it from any future accusation of lack of transparency. It might delay the decision for a short while, but it would ensure that when a decision is made, that it is the right one for all Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to be diplomatic, but the best thing I can say is, that is a profoundly stupid idea. It is incredibly dumb. In fact, the member should know that a number of federal government buildings have been purchased or leased through this process and it has led to incredible value for taxpayers' dollars. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage the hon. member to talk to the member for Kings—Hants, the member for Sudbury, and the other former ministers of public works that are on the government side. I would be more than prepared to wager with him that virtually every single one of them will tell him that this is a profoundly stupid idea, because it is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already given examples before. I will give him one more. Just a couple of blocks away from Parliament Hill, 90 Sparks Street was purchased by the Crown for $60 million and it is now occupied by a dozen federal departments and agencies. Its appraised value at the time was $72 million. It was purchased for $60 million through an unsolicited process and it got value for taxpayers' dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of walking away from this whole approach to doing business is dumb. As I have said, we believe in competition. We believe in an open, transparent and effective tendering process. If he is condemning it in this one circumstance with regard to the former JDS building, it was his government that entered the process years ago and started negotiating on this back in 2004.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe in getting value for taxpayers' dollars. We do not believe in taking away options from the table for the government to get value. The member, with respect, really does not know what he is talking about here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having unsolicited proposals is an opportunity to get value for taxpayers if it is used in the correct manner. On a number of occasions in the past it has been and in the future it may well be, but for him to just carte blanche say it is a bad idea, is profoundly stupid.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are suggesting exactly the opposite. We are asking to confirm that any transactions, especially large transactions, conducted by the government, and regardless of who is in government, are done through an open and transparent process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, we may come across unsolicited bids, but by making sure that we confirm that those unsolicited bids are valid and valuable, we need to seek other bidders and other opportunities to ensure that the price we have in front of us is the right price that benefits all Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that most Canadians could be forgiven for assuming that this question of a deal with a particular property in mind, in the Ottawa area, is part of a pattern of conduct that the government has embraced very early on in its mandate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state something for the record clearly. I think all parliamentarians would join me in saying that we are trying to encourage and strengthen accountability. Most parliamentarians are working feverishly to see the accountability act pass with the right kinds of amendments. I still think Canadians could be forgiven for deducing that there is a pattern of conduct here, which is leading Canadians to ask some fundamental questions. Let me illustrate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the government is wreaking havoc, for example, in changes it is making to the sole source procurement system of our country, without notice and without consultation. Many of my constituents and thousands of companies are working now in concert with the federal government, and have been for years, only to find out one morning that the sole source system, which the government is forcing down their throats, is one about which they have not even been consulted. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has done away with the procurement strategy for aboriginal businesses. It has been silenced behind the scenes. This is again part of a pattern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons legal counsel has issued an opinion saying that the accountability bill is at least partly unconstitutional, but the government has not addressed the unconstitutionality of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of National Defence, leaving aside the optics of the fact that he was a former lobbyist for the defence industry, wanted to sole source and acquire $3.2 billion worth of airplanes without any kind of tendering process. He is now denying it and backtracking. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a real estate deal, a letter of intent, as acknowledged by the parliamentary secretary, and, on his behalf, the Minister of PWGSC has acknowledged it as well, but apparently there is no deal. The government is backtracking again. I think Canadians could be forgiven for deducing there is a pattern of conduct here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has not learned anything from the Nielsen report in the Mulroney years. At that time, Prime Minister Mulroney asked the former minister, the member for Yukon, Mr. Nielsen, to do a major analysis of property deals with respect to the federal government because of the trying circumstances around many of those deals. This ended up causing problems for the former prime minister and his Conservative government. I really do not think the present government has read that report or understood much from it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is reminiscent of the comments recently made by the Minister of Transport who, in a speech in Gatineau, said that he was prepared to move an $800 million museum from my riding in Ottawa South to his riding across the river because he would exercise his political influence. He said this even though a $1 million engineering and architectural design and analysis study was commissioned by the museum, which suggested that the site the minister was targeting was not even on the short list of five. Again, I would forgive Canadians for deducing a pattern of conduct here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Minister of Transport freelanced recently on a question on the National Capital Commission, an instrumental organization in the development of this region. He said that he questioned the very existence of the NCC. There was no notice given, no dialogue, no debate, no commentary and no input. Instead of pursuing constructive reform ideas, we get a pattern of conduct that seems to continue. It is a do as I say, not as I do pattern. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recently we heard about the Minister of Health owning 25% of a private health care company, which he now regulates as the Minister of Health. The government, while in opposition, savaged the Ethics Commissioner saying that he was not a real Ethics Commissioner. Now it hides behind his ruling. The Minister of Health did not place his stocks in a blind trust. On the contrary, he makes a very small statement that he has no intention of dealing with the matter while he is a minister of the Crown. Again, I would forgive Canadians for deducing there is a pattern of conduct here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the question of unsolicited proposals, allowing economic development versus value for taxpayer dollars, as the parliamentary secretary to the minister puts to the House, is frankly a mugs game. It makes no rational sense whatsoever. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public tendering is the central building block of any procurement regime. It is the central building block of any transparent procurement regime. For a government that rode into town high on its horse of accountability, it is bewildering for most Canadians to try to understand this pattern of conduct in the short 120-odd days since being elected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my estimation, the motion is a sound one. I would urge all parliamentarians to support it. It really does speak now to the question of our willingness as parliamentary colleagues to address the question of transparency and accountability in a serious way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very unfortunate for the government, in its unwise decision, to appoint an unelected individual, who refused to seek office in the last election, to the Senate so he could be responsible for managing billions of dollars of procurement and not be here to answer those questions.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said: Mr. Speaker, my private member's bill, Bill C-291, is meant to protect pregnant women from violence and to protect their unborn children in an attack against the mother. In current federal criminal law an unborn child is not recognized as a victim with respect to violent crimes. This gap in federal law gives rise to grave injustices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2005 Olivia Talbot of Edmonton, who was 27 weeks pregnant with her son Lane Jr., was shot twice in the head and three times in the abdomen by a long time friend. Because Canadian law offers no legal protection for the unborn child today, no charge could be laid in the death of Baby Lane.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pregnant Edmonton women, Liana White, was slain by her husband in the summer of 2005. Again, no charges could be laid in the death of her baby.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians are shocked to learn that, when an attacker kills a woman's pre-born child, no charge is laid in the death of that child, even when the attacker purposely intended to kill the child. Clearly, there are two victims in such cases, and the public recognizes this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Robbins SCE Research poll, conducted in December 2005, found that 78% of Canadians supported a separate homicide charge in the death of an unborn child in such cases. A <i>Calgary Herald</i> poll, conducted on November 30, 2005, showed 82% support. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grieving families, who have lost their loved ones in this type of crime, only too tragically recognize that there are two victims. Just ask Mary Talbot how many victims there were when her daughter Olivia and her grandson, Baby Lane, died in November of 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any pregnant woman who survives a violent attack, but loses her pre-born child, a child she wants and loves, will grieve for that child, and no one can say she grieves for that child any less simply because that child has not yet been born.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My private member's bill seeks to address this injustice by making it a separate offence to kill or injure a pre-born child during the commission of an offence against the child's mother. Let me explain how it would do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In current federal law a child becomes a human being only after it is born alive, and only then does it receive protection under the law. Because children before they are born are not considered human beings, in today's criminal law they receive no legal protection whatsoever. The amendment to the Criminal Code, which I am proposing with my private member's bill, would change this so legal protection would be given not only to human beings, as defined by the Criminal Code, but also to unborn children who were harmed or killed during the commission of an offence against their mothers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My private member's bill does not change the definition of a human being. What it does is offer protection to the unborn child, despite the definition of a human being. I believe this will also provide added protection for the pregnant woman.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that my bill specifically states that it applies only “while committing or attempting to commit an offence against the mother”. Why is this important? Because this terminology was used precisely so abortions would be excluded. As we have seen from reports by a few extreme media, this issue is being linked to abortion. The media seems to have more concern that it somehow is an attempt to restrict access to abortion than it does about protecting pregnant women and their unborn children. The bill has nothing to do with abortion. In fact, it is the very opposite of abortion. In the case of abortion, the woman chooses the procedure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is about protecting the children whose mothers have not chosen abortion, mothers who have chosen to carry their child to term. That is why those who truly are pro-choice will support the bill because it respects a woman's right to choose to bring her child to term in a safe environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have argued that the Supreme Court will not allow an unborn child to have legal protection under the law because the Supreme Court has said that a fetus is not a person. This is a false interpretation of the court's rulings. It is the existing law which offers no rights to the fetus and the courts have just been applying the existing law when they have made their rulings. However, the law can be changed and that is the responsibility of Parliament, not the courts, as the Supreme Court itself has said in a number of cases.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735">(1735)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the case of Winnipeg Child and Family Services v. DFG in 1997 involving a glue-sniffing pregnant woman, the issue at hand was whether child protective services could force the pregnant woman into custody in order to protect her unborn child. The Supreme Court said that according to existing law the unborn child has no rights and therefore the woman could not be forced into custody. The court stated, “The law of Canada does not recognize the unborn child as a legal person possessing rights”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court went on to ask, “At what stage would a fetus acquire rights?”</div>
    </p><a name="Para25579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court said that dealing with such “thorny moral and social issues” is “better dealt with by elected legislators than the courts”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court has clearly stated that the existing law does not offer legal protection for the fetus and that it is not up to the court to change the law in order to offer this protection. That is the job of Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My private member's bill addresses this issue in one very specific way, by extending protection to the unborn child who is harmed or injured when the mother is the victim of a violent crime, only in those very narrow circumstances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence against women is a serious problem in our society and studies have shown that pregnancy increases the risk that a woman will be abused. When a woman is pregnant she is especially vulnerable because she has not only herself to protect and defend, but also her unborn child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that physical abuse remains a frequently undetected risk factor in a large number of pregnancies and that violence begins or increases during pregnancy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian studies estimate that the prevalence of physical abuse during pregnancy is around 6%, which is extremely high, and that 64% of women abused during pregnancy reported increased abuse during pregnancy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System, women abused during pregnancy were four times as likely as other abused women to report having experienced very serious violence, including being beaten up, choked, threatened with a gun or knife, or sexually assaulted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Canadian study found that the most common area of a woman's body struck during pregnancy was the abdomen. The literature shows that “severe blunt trauma to a maternal abdomen has been shown to lead to spontaneous abortion, fetal death, placental abruption, preterm labour and delivery, and fetal injuries, such as skull fractures, intracranial hemorrhage and bone fractures”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very disturbing that when a women is at her most vulnerable she is at increased risk of attack. This bill would act as a strong deterrent to perpetrating violence against a pregnant woman. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In testimony at a subcommittee hearing on the U.S. unborn victims of violence act, Tracy Marciniak, who survived a violent attack by her husband who killed her unborn child, said the following, “Before his trial, my attacker said on TV that he would never have hit me if he had thought that he could be charged with the killing of his child”. She went on to say, “If an attacker of a pregnant woman knows that they can get prosecuted for harming or killing that woman's child, they are going to think twice before they do it”. This was said by the victim of a violent attack that killed her unborn child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What message are we sending to those who physically abuse pregnant women when we allow them to inflict such physical harm and even death on the woman's unborn child with no consequences whatsoever? The perpetrator will simply be charged with the assault on the woman, as if the child simply did not exist.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740">(1740)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What message are we sending to the mother of the child when we refuse to acknowledge that her offspring growing inside of her is worthy of protection? We give more protection to animals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before judging that statement as being over the top, I ask members to please consider this. If a person assaulted a woman who was carrying a pet cat or dog and intentionally injured or killed the pet, the person would receive the penalty for assault against the woman plus the penalty for the separate offence against the animal, which in itself could carry a prison sentence of up to six months and a fine of up to $2,000. Does anyone really believe that it is right and just that there should be a penalty for the injury or death of a pet but not for an unborn child?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of law that I am proposing in my private member's bill would not only act as a strong deterrent to violence, it would not only send a strong message to society that we will not condone this type of abuse on women when they are most vulnerable, but it would also bring a sense of closure to the surviving family members because it recognizes that there are two victims in such cases. Our current law, which fails to recognize a second victim in these violent attacks on pregnant women, amounts to telling Mary Talbot that she really did not lose a grandson the day that Olivia and baby Lane died. It means that we are saying to Lane Griffith, the father of the baby, that he did not really lose a son that day but baby Lane did exist. He had a name and he was loved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Edmonton Journal</i> reported that baby Lane's father talked to the belly of his pregnant fiancé every night that he could and told his unborn son how much daddy loved him. Lane Griffith and his mother, Kathy Scott, held the baby after he was removed from Olivia's womb and Kathy told the <i>Edmonton Journal</i> “The baby was perfect looking. He was just beautiful with nice dark hair”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a photograph with me here today and I challenge everyone to look at the photo and tell me how many victims they see. A beautiful young woman lies in the casket with her baby boy whose short life was ended before he ever saw the light of day, before he ever saw his mother smile and before he ever felt his father's hug.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our law in Canada today, which gives no recognition to the tragedy that befalls a family when they lose a beloved child prior to its birth, is outdated and heartless. Again, I refer to the testimony of Tracy Marciniak, who knows only too well what it is like to have one's pre-born child killed in a violent attack. This is what she said in her testimony at the subcommittee hearing:</div>

    </p><a name="Para25599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time I have been tested in nearly every conceivable manner. My perceptions and beliefs have been challenged and, in some instances, I have altered my positions in a manner that more accurately reflects evolving constituents' wishes and feedback or in a manner consistent with the ever-changing state of knowledge on a given subject.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That aside, my core beliefs or what I view to be absolute truths have stood the test of time and remain a constant factor in my voting record. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the latter in mind, I am on my feet this evening but this time I will frame my remarks within the specific context of Bill C-291.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many, Bill C-291 represents just another round in the age old abortion debate. It represents a nibbling away at the edges of the perceptions of the 1988 Supreme Court decision on the subject. I would reject any such notions and I challenge those people to lay solid evidence on the table here tonight defending that position, which I would believe to be rooted in specious logic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to be absolutely clear, Bill C-291 is not a bill about abortion. It is a bill about protecting women from violence. To be precise, Bill C-291 is about protecting the choice of a woman to carry a fetus to full term. Surely we can agree that a woman has every right to make that determination.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians do not understand that there are no protections in place for viable unborn children who, despite the mother's desire to carry to full term, are harmed or terminated at the hands of those seeking to perpetrate violent crimes. In some cases the said violence is committed in a manner specifically targeting the unborn child. This is astounding to me. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for nearly 13 years have listened to some of my colleagues speak on the merits of a woman's right to choose but now I learn that some of those same people will not vote to protect the woman's choice if it involves the choice to keep her baby.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the member of Parliament for Vegreville—Wainwright sought to defend this bill against irrational committee allegations that it was unconstitutional, he cited several instances to the committee where violent and criminal actions were perpetrated upon third party against prospective mothers who had chosen to carry to full term. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example that has already been cited this evening is the one about Olivia Talbot of Edmonton who was 27 weeks pregnant with her son Lane Jr. In November 2005, Olivia was shot three times in the abdomen and twice in the head. Because we offer no legal protection for unborn children today, no charge could be laid in the death of baby Lane. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pregnant Edmonton woman, Liana White, was slain by her husband in the summer of 2005. Again no charges could be laid in her baby's death.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my constituents and, indeed, many Canadians would be shocked to learn that when an attacker kills a woman's unborn child no charges are laid in the death of that child even when the attacker purposefully intended to kill the child. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use the words of the member for Vegreville—Wainwright, his bill seeks to address this injustice by making it a separate offence to kill or injure a pre-born child during the commission of an offence against the child's mother. That offence would be the offence of which the person would have been found guilty had the injury or death occurred to the mother. In other words, the unborn child would be treated as if it were a human being and the existing legal protection already defined for human beings in the Criminal Code would apply.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact offence depends on what existing sections of the Criminal Code would apply under a specified set of circumstances. Just to be clear, Bill C-291 is not seeking to invent new offences. In the same vein I should point out that Bill C-291 actually excludes abortion. The provisions of the legislative proposal would apply only while a perpetrator is committing or attempting to commit an offence against the mother.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Bill C-291 is not about limiting a choice but rather it is about instituting protections for women when they have decided that they wish to carry their child to term. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that some have objected to Bill C-291 because they have come to believe that the Supreme Court has determined that a fetus cannot be afforded the legal protections of a human being as defined by the Criminal Code. To that I would again say respectfully that notions to this effect would be inaccurate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, section 223(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada defines a human being as a child that has completely proceeded in a living state from the body of its mother. Furthermore, section 222(1) of Criminal Code of Canada defines a homicide as the act perpetrated by a person when directly or indirectly by any means causes the death of a human being. To me this seems simple enough.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750">(1750)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the Criminal Code of Canada does not consider a fetus to be a human being as defined by the code. This proposal would seek to extend certain legal protections to the fetus in instances when the mother was being victimized in a criminal manner. This would have no impact on other debates involving fetal rights, or the greater issue of abortion in general. It would simply seek to add certain protection to women who might fall victim to violent criminal activities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, while generally speaking I support a pro-life stance on the issue, in this instance I support freedom of choice, that is to say, the freedom to choose to conceive and deliver a child without threat of violence being perpetrated against prospective mothers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take a moment to address this notion of Bill C-291's constitutionality. I happen to believe that the committee is mistaken with respect to the state of the court's notions on the subject. Again while I do not believe that Bill C-291 is unconstitutional and I do not outright accept that it is about abortion, for the purpose of responding to claims to the contrary, I would offer the following.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Supreme Court has consistently ruled that it is incumbent upon Parliament to establish parameters under which an abortion could be permitted. For example, in The Queen v. Morgentaler, Smoling and Scott in 1988, when the Supreme Court struck down the abortion law, it was done for procedural and administrative reasons only. The court clearly did not find a charter right to abortion, but rather articulated that it was up to Parliament to determine what level of protection to afford the unborn child. It said it had to be done in such a way as to balance the rights of the woman with the rights of the fetus. In that instance Chief Justice Dickson said:</div>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>I agree that protection of foetal interests by Parliament Is also a valid governmental objective. It follows that balancing these interests, with the lives and health of women a major factor, is clearly an important governmental objective.</small></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para25620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice Beetz said:</div>

        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td><small>I am of the view that the protection of the foetus is and, as the Court of Appeal observed, always has been, a valid objective in Canadian criminal law...I think s. 1 of the Charter authorizes reasonable limits to be put on a woman's right having regard to the state interest in the protection of the foetus.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para25622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sentiments were echoed again in 1989 by the court in Jean-Guy Tremblay v. Chantale Daigle when the court stated:</div>
    </p><a name="Para25623"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Court is not required to enter the philosophical and theological debates about whether or not a foetus is a person, but, rather, to answer the legal question of whether the Quebec legislature has accorded the foetus personhood....Decisions based upon broad social, political, moral and economic choices are more appropriately left to the legislature.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para25624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was restated in 1997 in Winnipeg Child and Family Services v. G. (D.F.) In this case involving a glue-sniffing pregnant woman, the issue at hand was whether child protective services could force a pregnant woman into custody in order to protect the unborn child. As in the previous case cited, the Supreme Court said that according to the existing law, the unborn child had no rights and therefore the woman could not be forced into custody. The court stated:</div>
    </p><a name="Para25625"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The law of Canada does not recognize the unborn child as a legal person possessing rights.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para25626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court went on to ask at what stage would a fetus acquire rights. The court said that such thorny moral and social issues were better dealt with by elected legislators than the courts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to say is that the Supreme Court has consistently called upon Parliament to step up to the plate and to provide the courts with guidelines with respect to fetal rights. I respectfully submit that Bill C-291 was a genuine attempt at just that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would unreservedly underscore my support for Bill C-291 and renew my objection to the logic that has deemed the legislation to be unvotable. I firmly believe that the process was politicized in a manner that ignored legal precedent and continuing requests from the Supreme Court on the subject. I would like to compliment the member for Vegreville—Wainwright for putting this legislation forward in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully this debate will bring this matter to light in the future so that we can actually deal with the complexities of the issue rather than hide behind the politics of it.</div>

Regardless of whether one is for or against abortion, at the moment, that is the state of the law. The Supreme Court has handed down decisions and it is not possible—it is not within a parliamentarian's prerogative—to change that through a private member's bill. Of course, our colleague has the right to a debate on his bill, but we must nevertheless keep in mind that this bill is unconstitutional. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it unconstitutional? Because the state of the law indicates that the first rule in right-to-life issues is that a fetus is not a human being until it is out of the womb, has drawn its first breath, and is deemed living and viable. That is the legal situation; that is what the Supreme Court has said. And what the Court has said is in line with the definition in section 223 of the Criminal Code. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, we can review the history, recall the battles fought. Nevertheless—and I invite all parliamentarians to be seized of this reality—section 223 of the Criminal Code states and declares as follows:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the position of the law. It is not possible for a member of parliament, no matter what his or her beliefs, to table a bill that is not compatible with the provisions of the Criminal Code, which are based on a ruling made after the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was proclaimed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the history of abortion in Canada. In 1969, the provisions of the Criminal Code were slightly different in their approach. The 1969 provisions criminalized abortion, except in cases where approved by a therapeutic committee comprised of three doctors. There have been provisions dealing with abortion since 1777, even before the Criminal Code came into being. Since the 18th century, we have followed the practices of Great Britain and those found in common law. Since 1777, provisions have protected what we would call today the sacred nature of life. <sup></sup></div>
    </p><a name="Para25639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, a legislative decision has continued to prohibit abortion, which is punishable—</div>

First of all, his bill is unconstitutional. He should at the very least have the decency to listen to his fellow parliamentarians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there are similarities between the infraction he is proposing, which relates to killing an unborn child, and abortion. All the same, I think it is my prerogative in this House to express the point of view I wish to air on behalf of my party. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current state of the law, the fetus has no rights while in its mother's womb. That decision was handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada, is reflected in the Criminal Code, and is the state of the law. That means that a parliamentarian cannot question that definition through a private member's bill. I think it would have been interesting if our colleague had provided us with a legal opinion submitted by the Minister of Justice, who acknowledges that the bill is unconstitutional. It is worth noting that the minister has the same background as the member who introduced the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I do not wish to deny our colleague's right to draw the attention of this House to such a question. He is entitled to his point of view, and all of the members of this House have heard it. This is how things should be done in a Parliament like ours.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of rewriting history on the question of when life begins, with respect to the rights of the unborn and abortion rights, I was saying that, since 1777, there have been provisions that did not appear in the Criminal Code—since the Criminal Code did not exist until the end of the 19th century—but that protected the sanctity of human life. Later, certain changes were made. The most important change was made in 1969. At that time, we maintained criminal sanctions against abortion, except if a therapeutic committee, made up of three doctors, authorized an abortion for health reasons, linked to the mother's health. <sup></sup></div>
    </p><a name="Para25647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As several members have said so far, there were a number of court challenges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in 1969, Parliament made several important amendments to the Criminal Code, at the time referring to section 273, which specified the time when an abortion could legally be performed. Then it could be performed with the recommendation of a therapeutic committee made up of three doctors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section set out criminal sanctions for doctors who did not respect the strict rules that I outlined. These rules required authorization from a therapeutic abortion committee at an accredited or approved hospital and that the abortion had to be performed at an accredited or approved hospital.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The therapeutic abortion committees had to consist of at least three doctors, none of whom could be performing abortions. That very year, in 1969, Dr. Henry Morgentaler opened his first clinic in Montreal where he performed abortions without approval from a therapeutic abortion committee. As we all know, this resulted in a legal drama—probably the most famous controversy ever.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then 1982 saw the advent of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which included an article on the right to physical integrity, the right to life, liberty and, of course, security of the person. This is from article 7 of the charter, which talks about life, liberty and security of the person. This would be the legal recourse by which it would be decided, in a legal manner, that women must have control over their own bodies, and that it is not in keeping with the values in the charter to restrict the right to abortion, as the provisions in 1969 did. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why decisions have been handed down, which prompted the lawmaker to define what life is, when a fetus becomes a fetus, and at what point a fetus must be recognized as having rights.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will remind the hon. members that neither the Quebec civil code nor the major existing statutes respecting women's health recognize that, as long as it is in the mother's womb, the fetus is not considered a human being.

    </p><a name="Para25654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our colleague's bill was deemed unconstitutional because clause 2, as amended, states, “It is not a defence” to a person charged with an offence set out in the Criminal Code, namely causing the death or injuring the unborn child of a pregnant woman, “ that (<i>a</i>) the child is not a human being; (<i>b</i>) the accused did not know that the person was pregnant”.</div>

        <div><b><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78675,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78675&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mrs. Irene Mathyssen (London—Fanshawe, NDP)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, after all this time, and all the debates about a woman's right to choose, and the securing of those rights under the law, here we are again talking about this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-291 proposes changes to the Criminal Code that are unnecessary and will potentially jeopardize a woman's right to choose. The proposed amendment would have two charges laid against a person who kills a pregnant woman. This would, in effect, give legal rights to a fetus and change the definition of when a fetus becomes a person under the law. Currently, a fetus is not considered a person or a human being until actual live birth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I will not argue that harming or murdering a pregnant woman is a particularly abhorrent crime, this bill will in the end do more harm than good for women's rights in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may contend that this bill has nothing to do with abortion and is just about ensuring that someone who murders a pregnant woman will pay doubly for his or her crime. However, this bill is the thin edge of the wedge, as it will change the definition of when a fetus becomes a person. This change will have an effect on the legal status of abortions in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something that needs to be opened up for debate once again. Canadian women fought long and hard for the right to safe, legal abortions in Canada. Women have been forced to put their private lives under scrutiny in the courts in the fight for the right to choose. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take away that right, women in desperate situations will have to take desperate measures, such as a young woman in 1989. While the federal government debated making non-emergency abortions illegal, this young woman bled to death after attempting to perform an abortion on herself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to make abortions illegal in Canada. I am extremely disappointed that the Conservative government would use the tragic murders of young women to push its abortion agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill calls into question a judge's ability to take mitigating circumstances into account. Courts already take aggravating circumstances into account when deciding on sentences for crimes and would most likely consider injury to or death of an unborn child to be a serious aggravating circumstance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, two separate offences would not necessarily equal more jail time. In Canada, unlike the United States, multiple sentences are often served concurrently. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring up our neighbour to the south for a reason. As many of my colleagues well know, this type of bill has been passed in several states. This type of bill does have some impact there, as jail sentences are often served consecutively, increasing the time served.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to note that the United States is the same country where there is an active attempt to ban access to abortion for American women at both the state and the federal level. The supporters of this type of bill are the very same people actively working to ban abortions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence is clear. To date, the courts across Canada have blocked provincial attempts to substantially regulate the issue of abortion, finding that the pith and substance of such attempts is actually an attempt to recriminalize abortion through the back door.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And recriminalizing through the back door appears to be the intention of this bill. Bill C-291 puts the legal status of an unborn child into question. First, Bill C-291 does not refer to an unborn child in the same manner as other sections of the Criminal Code. Section 223 states that a child becomes a human being when it is born alive, and section 238 refers to “a child that has not become a human being”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, Bill C-291 refers to “a child before or during its birth”. Not only is this terminology generally inconsistent with the approach taken to the fetus in the Criminal Code as a whole, but it is also inconsistent with terminology used in section 238 itself, the provision it is amending.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-291 essentially represents an indirect recognition of an unborn child as a human being. Such an initiative could have significant ramifications in a number of different areas of law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognition of an unborn child as a human being indirectly leads to its recognition as a person with legal status. If an unborn child becomes defined as a person with rights, it opens a Pandora's box in the abortion debate.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810">(1810)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition of an unborn child as a person would also have a significant impact on tort law and other areas of the common law. Numerous cases have been commenced in the past on behalf of unborn children. They have not been successful because the law does not recognize the fetus as a person with legal status. Any change to this status in the criminal law could potentially have wide ranging implications in common law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendment will also have a significant impact on the mens rea or the intent of the accused. Mens rea includes issues such as the accused's perception of the risk or legal consequence of his or her actions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment states that it is not a defence that the unborn child is not a human being, that the accused did not know that the mother was pregnant, or that the accused did not mean to injure or cause the death of the unborn child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-291 essentially eliminates the intention requirement, and the lack of intention defence appears contrary to the fundamental elements of criminal law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a “thin skull rule” in criminal law which already states that a person who inflicts more than trivial bodily harm must take the victim as he or she found the victim; for example, with a medical condition that leads to more serious consequences to that bodily harm. In other words, judges already have the ability to consider a pregnancy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-291 goes beyond this to create an entirely separate offence that eliminates the lack of intention defence inherent to all criminal law. While it may be argued that intent to injure the mother fulfills the mens rea requirement for this separate offence, this is a potentially tenuous link that would likely be challenged in the courts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious why this bill was ruled non-votable. Not only is it a veiled attempted to make abortions illegal in Canada, but it would make a significant change to our legal system that is neither necessary nor welcome.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party continues to repeat that it is keeping its election promises, yet its members are bringing bills to the House that directly contradict that platform. I would like to quote directly from what the government has said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para25681"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>A Conservative government will not initiate or support any legislation to regulate abortion.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para25682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill does exactly that. It initiates legislation that will essentially regulate abortion in Canada by changing the definition of the legal status of a fetus. It opens the door to making abortion illegal in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman's right to choose was hard fought, and it would be detrimental to Canadian women and an international embarrassment to remove that right. The Conservatives are not standing up for Canadian women by tabling bills that will impact on a woman's right to choose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking away a woman's right to choose will not reduce violence and will not make this a better world. It will only remove her freedom. That simply is unacceptable.</div>

        <div><b><A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78963,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78963&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Mr. Rob Moore (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, CPC)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-291, a bill that proposes to amend the Criminal Code to create a new offence of injuring or killing a child before or during its birth while committing an offence against the pregnant mother.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, at its core, the bill is about ensuring that our criminal law strongly condemns and holds fully accountable those who commit violent acts against others, particularly against persons who are more vulnerable to violence. The evidence is clear that pregnant women are more likely to be victims of assault by their partners than other similarly situated women. These objectives are strongly supported by Canadians and, indeed, are reflected in the government's priority of getting tough on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I understand and support the message that Bill C-291 seeks to send to would-be offenders. If we are to achieve this important objective, we must seek to do so in a way that is consistent with fundamental principles of criminal law and that conforms with our constitutional law. If we do anything less, if we support legislative reform that does not follow the contours of our Constitution and its conventions, then we in fact fail to provide Canadians with the very protection against violence we seek to provide.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the government cannot support Bill C-291. Although it appreciates the its intent, we believe its proposed reforms are in fact unconstitutional and, as a result, cannot do what it purports to do. It cannot succeed in providing the additional protection against personal violence, which we all agree Canadians want and deserve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-291 proposes to create a new criminal offence. Under the bill, a person who injures or kills a child before or during its birth, while committing or attempting to commit an offence against the mother who is pregnant with that child, could be charged with the same offence against the child. Under Bill C-291, an accused could be charged with such an offence without knowledge that the mother was pregnant and without the accused intending to injure or kill the child. Therein lies the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-291 proposes to create a new offence that would apply even though an accused did not intend to commit a crime. One of the fundamental principles of criminal law is that persons are not punished simply because harm was done, but rather because they are morally culpable for causing that harm. Therefore, a criminal offence may only be committed where there is both a guilty act and a guilty mind. There must be an intention to commit the act, as well as the commission of the act itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An offence that does not require a guilty mind and that requires only a guilty act is called an “absolute liability offence”. The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly found criminal offences of such a nature to be unconstitutional. The effect of the proposed offence in Bill C-291 is also to clearly prevent an accused from invoking available legal defences. This too raises additional charter concerns under sections 7 and 11(d), namely, the right to a full answer and defence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Supreme Court of Canada has consistently held that such grounds of unconstitutionality cannot be saved under the charter. In other words, punishing people who cause harm but who are not morally culpable cannot be said to be “demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said at the outset, while I understand and appreciate the objective of Bill C-291, I believe the bill's proposed reforms are unconstitutional. As a result, the bill cannot achieve its objective of safeguarding Canadians against violence. This does not mean that Canadians are not protected by existing criminal law. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 238 of the Criminal Code makes it an indictable offence, with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, to cause the death of a child while it is being born. As well, section 223 provides that where a person causes injury to a child before or during its birth, as a result of which the child dies after its birth, that person commits the offence of homicide. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, where an accused kills another person, whether the victim is pregnant or not, the accused may be charged with first degree murder or second degree murder, both of which carry a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The criminal law ensures that the impact of violence perpetrated on victims is reflected by the sentence or penalty imposed in each case. In all cases, a sentencing court must consider aggravating as well as mitigating circumstances.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815">(1815)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para25697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific situation of the victim is always considered. For example, was the victim a victim of spousal abuse? If so, section 718.2 of the Criminal Code requires the sentencing court to consider this as an aggravating circumstance for sentencing purposes. Whether the victim was pregnant or the mother of one or more children will also be considered as an aggravating circumstance. Indeed, under section 722 of the Criminal Code, a sentencing court must consider a victim impact statement that has been prepared in a case that describes the harm done to, or the loss suffered by, the victim arising from the commission of the offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's commitment to Canadians does not end with merely supporting the existing criminal law. The Speech from the Throne underscores the government's commitment to get tough on crime, to tackle offenders, to bring in tougher sentences for violent and repeat offenders, particularly those involved in weapon-related crimes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment is directly relevant to Bill C-291, as I understand the bill was motivated by a case that is currently before the courts and which involved the use of a firearm. The government has already delivered on our Speech from the Throne commitment. On May 4, the Minister of Justice tabled Bill C-10, an act to amend the Criminal Code, minimum penalties for offences involving firearms, and to make a consequential amendment to another act. The reforms in Bill C-10 seek to ensure that the use of a firearm in the commission of a serious offence will be subject to a significant sentence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as the House knows, we brought in Bill C-9, which addresses the serious issue of conditional sentencing. The government is serious about getting tough on crime, about protecting victims and about ensuring that we have a criminal justice system that Canadians can have faith in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-291 speaks to the importance of protecting Canadians against violence. It speaks to the need to ensure that our criminal law adequately reflects the serious impact of violence on all of its victims. I believe all members of the House can support these objectives. That said, our duty as parliamentarians is to ensure that we enact legislation that respects fundamental principles of Canadian law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is committed to protecting Canadians and we have already taken strong measures to do so. </div>

    </p><a name="Para25704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the member for raising this issue, which deals with some fundamental values. It is important for Canadians to hear this discussion. It is a valid debate and I can see no better place than the Parliament of Canada for holding it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under the laws of Canada, the fetus has no rights. It is interesting to note that the U.S. secretary of health and human services amended the regulations, which he oversees, to amend the definition of child. Now the definition of a child is a person under 19 years of age, including the period from conception to birth. The United States did this for one reason. Medical science today is doing a lot of work in terms of rectifying problems detected in a fetus prior to birth. Insurance companies were not going to pay for this because a child was defined as someone who was born. The change in the regulations took into account the fact that real work was being done that should be covered by insurance companies, and the change in the regulations did just that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this is not an entirely irrelevant discussion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to domestic violence, members should know that the two most prevalent periods for domestic violence are after a breakup or during pregnancy. That is a fact. Bill C-291 would have been votable had it not asked for double jeopardy or two penalties. Had the bill been worded that if the mother were injured or died and the aggressor knew she was pregnant, this would have represented aggravating circumstances, and that would have warranted stiffer penalties than otherwise would have been prescribed under the law. This would have been appropriate here and we would have had a vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The member is not totally offside on this issue. However, under the circumstances, it is unfortunate that the House will not have an opportunity this time to talk about these issues. It is very clear that once conception occurs, there is a virtual certainty that a child will be born.</div>

His speech clearly was not relevant to the debate taking place here today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The member from the NDP tried to do that too, but at least she did bring in some honest debate on the issue. I did not agree with it, but that is fine. We carry on debates and we do not always agree with the positions taken.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month my bill was deemed non-votable because it was declared by a committee to be clearly unconstitutional. This is quite extraordinary since at least three lawyers, with experience in criminal law, have said that it is not clear at all that it violates the charter. They were quite surprised at the decision taken by the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the justice minister said in his opinion that it was unconstitutional, that standard is not good enough to deem a bill to be non-votable. That is an opinion from the justice minister. We see judges on both sides of a lot of issues with opinions. Therefore, clearly, the bill should not have been deemed non-votable, because it is not clearly unconstitutional. There is reason for debate on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Orders clearly state that in order to be deemed non-votable with respect to constitutionality, it must clearly violate the Constitution, including the charter. The committee provided no proof that my bill met that sense of certainty. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, what happened is the process was abused and the constitutional criteria was used simply as a convenient excuse when all opposition members collaborated to prevent my bill from coming to a democratic vote in the House. The reason I believe, although who can ever judge for sure, is that some people do not want to deal with this issue because they believe it is a thorny issue for some reason.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been through the process of having a private member's bill deemed non-votable for reasons that seem to be, to quote one lawyer's opinion on what happened, “disingenuous”, I am in a far better position than I otherwise would have been to comment on how manifestly unfair the current process is and to suggest possibilities for improvement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current process allows five members of the subcommittee on private members' business to decide on the votability of a private member's bill, in secret. They deemed that my bill was clearly unconstitutional without providing any information whatsoever on how the charter would supposedly be violated, nor what part of my bill was in violation. I had to guess. This is like taking someone to court and asking them to defend themselves without telling them with what they are being charged.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to the full committee and appealed, not knowing the reason and having no way to find out the reasons for my bill being rejected as a votable bill in the first place. How was I supposed to present any kind of a reasonable defence for what had happened?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even changing this is not likely sufficient to present the process from being abused, as we have seen happen with my bill. Because even after I had my chance to defend the bill to the main committee, albeit only in a generic way because I did not know exactly what the problems were supposed to be, the committee upheld the subcommittee decision. All opposition members voted against making my bill votable, in spite of the fact that it clearly was not unconstitutional. This was a sad political process to an end rather than respect the intent of private members' business, which is to have fair and honest debate on private members' bills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they had even said that they were unsure if it were unconstitutional, we could have debated it, voted on it and if the vote was passed, it would go to committee and amendments could be made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have changed the bill so that, when it comes to the House again by someone else at some time, there will be no constitutional issue whatsoever. I believe at that time it will be supported by most members in the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by saying to Mary Talbot, the grandmother of baby Lane, and to Lane Griffith, the father of baby Lane, that we will not forget him. If there is any good at all that can come from tragedy such as the one that befell Olivia and Lane and Liana and her baby, maybe it is this: that it will encourage all people of goodwill to mobilize together in an effort to bring an end to this abysmal lack of justice that exists in Canada today toward pregnant women and the children they love.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that I am out of time. I appreciate having had this time today. I look forward to a revised version of the bill coming before Parliament. It could happen at any time. Because it was deemed unvotable, it could come up again in this Parliament. I am looking forward to it and I will support the bill.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope a number of members will be offering their opinions on this issue, because the New Democrats have been extremely critical of the government's choice to cut the EnerGuide program. It is certainly not something the Conservatives talked about during the last campaign, unless one of the members here tonight will enlighten me as to why a party would make such a silly commitment during a campaign. Certainly it was not talked about prior to the cancellation of the program. There was no consultation with the key stakeholders. There was no engagement of Canadians in any sense of the word. It was simply a drastic cut to a program that by all measures was working very effectively for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two main components were in play. One was an EnerGuide program to help Canadians at large. It was a program that had been in place well before the turn of the millennium, but had increased exponentially once the government had started to make contributions to allow homeowners to engage in the process of lowering their energy costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of charts, and I will table them in the House, that show Canadians were engaging in the program in an exceptional way, a way in which we would hope Canadians would engage in other environment programs. This program was proving to be successful. It was making the investments that governments talk about but had finally begun to make. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-48, the so-called NDP budget, was a huge push forward in putting real dollars on the table so Canadians could actually lower their energy costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people will ask what the point of this was and did the program really meet the means and measures it was meant to. Certainly it did. The ratio was that for every dollar the government was putting in, Canadians, private individuals, were putting in a little more than $3.50 to make the adjustments and improvements to their homes that would lower their dependence on energy by almost 30% on average.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we told average homeowners in Canada that there was a program that would offer a 30% reduction in their home heating bills, a lot of Canadians would say it was an excellent thing and that finally after so many years the government was doing something real and tangible that their families could appreciate. They could spend the money they saved in other places and thereby improve the value of their homes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP supported this. We supported it so much that when we had the government to the wall, we insisted that these types of programs happen. This program lowered our energy dependency. It lowered greenhouse gas emissions across the nation. It leveraged funds. It resulted in almost four tonnes of greenhouse gas reductions per house per year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's response to the question was absolutely atrocious. Rather than take up the issue and debate the merits of the program as to whether or not it was good, the minister chose instead to make personal attacks. This is becoming the norm in this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister did not attend Bonn in a serious way, other than to say that Canada was backing out of Kyoto. She ducked out on the smog summit and attended a blue chip luncheon instead. She has not attended the committee at this point, but there is a standing invitation. She ducked out of a meeting of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, an opportunity to address Canadian mayors. They were so interested in this program that they passed a unanimous resolution at that forum calling on the government to reintroduce the program and for fundamentally not being responsible about climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are wondering when the minister will actually show up on this file, start to defend the interests that an environment minister is meant to do and bring this--</div>

I look forward to working with him to make sure that we have effective programs that help clean Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding his questions on the different programs, I believe that the Minister of Natural Resources has spoken about this issue on numerous occasions. It is hard to justify continuing programs that require that 50¢ out of every $1 go to administration costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we appreciate there are sound reasons for encouraging homeowners to take steps to improve the thermal efficiencies of their homes, we as a government are strongly committed to taxpayer value for money and effective program design and administration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing programs that require $2 of funding for every $1 of subsidy is just not acceptable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate the important role that energy efficiency can play. Energy efficiency can strengthen economic competitiveness. It can lower the cost of heating, cooling and other energy services, reduce investment in infrastructure supply and reduce emissions to the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward we are committed to developing an approach to clean air and greenhouse gas reductions that is effective and that produces real results. We need to see emission levels decline through the interventions that we as a government put into effect. That is the bottom line.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been little effect seen from the previous government's programs aimed at climate change or clean air. There has been no improvement in air quality and greenhouse gas emission reductions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is committed to delivering a made in Canada approach that sees real progress in cleaning up our environment and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We will do this in an open and transparent manner by setting realistic and achievable goals. We expect that the full scope of the government's made in Canada solution to clean air and climate change will be articulated in the months ahead.</div>

The Deputy Minister of Natural Resources has shown it to be otherwise. This 50¢ on the $1 in audits has been shown to be 12¢ in fact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a party and a government that is looking for accountability, what other way than to do a proper assessment and audit on the way the government is spending money than to audit the very improvements that Canadians are making to their homes, to audit the very decisions that Canadians are making in order to lower their energy costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of this program was delivered with the unanimous consent of the House. The parliamentary secretary was with me when that passed in the House not six months ago. To turn around less than two months after the election and cancel a program for the lowest income and most vulnerable Canadians, a program that had received all-party support is atrocious. I would like to ask him why the switch, why so quick, and to get the numbers right.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I raised this issue in the House two weeks ago, the Minister of Public Safety brushed off my concerns with yet another non-answer. Since the minister is so blasé about the issue and since his promised solutions have yet to materialize, I would like to take this opportunity to remind him of exactly what is at stake with this policy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 1, 2008, all Canadian and American residents will require a passport to cross the Canada-U.S. border. Such a rigid requirement will severely impede the flow of goods and people across the border. Even the Minister of Foreign Affairs concedes that it will likely cost the tourism industry more than $1 billion per year in revenue. Others estimate that the number is more like $2 billion in lost revenue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a riding like mine that depends on casual cross-border travel, this will have serious implications for the tourism industry. In my riding, when the weather heats up in the U.S., we get a flow of tourism. It is that volatile and that quick. If there is some special project or special package in the tourism industry, we get the flow from the U.S. It is not always planned tourism.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the western hemisphere travel initiative has important ramifications for other Canadians. For example, each year Quebec City hosts the largest peewee hockey tournament in the world. In 2008, American teams that have played in Quebec for years will find themselves turned away at their own border should they come into the country without passports.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also means that American families will have to spend more than $500 on passports to visit their relatives in the Maritimes. How many, I wonder, will simply choose not to visit us? </div>
    </p><a name="Para25756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the government assures us that the U.S. government is willing to consider an alternate secure travel document for Canadians travelling to the U.S. To date, however, there have been no firm decisions as to what would be required from such a document, and there are no guarantees that we will even reach an agreement on this matter. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, unless there is a cost effective and convenient alternative for American travellers, Canadian tourism will still be negatively impacted as Americans choose to stay at home rather than visit our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House of Commons, the Minister of Public Safety keeps repeating his mantra that his government has made this a priority. Unfortunately, no one told him that the Conservative government had only five priorities and that the western hemisphere travel initiative did not make the cut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Canadians are dependent on the U.S. senate and American governors to protect their interests on this issue. This is bush-league leadership and Canadians deserve better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister keeps repeating to us that the U.S. senate has passed a bill that will delay implementation. I would like to remind him that this development is meaningless unless the U.S. house of representatives also passes an identical piece of legislation, which is increasingly unlikely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more concerning are statements from the Secretary for Homeland Security saying that the Bush government does not support delaying implementation. If the congress does not want to introduce the necessary legislation and if the Prime Minister's ally in Washington wants these new regulations to be implemented without delay, how can the minister expect to satisfactorily resolve the matter?</div>
    </p><a name="Para25762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the minister again. Why is the government abandoning Canadian communities on this issue? Will the government stand up and represent us on this vital question or do we have to depend on the U.S. senate and governors to defend our interests?</div>

    </p><a name="Para25764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue demands that we work effectively with our partners and our stakeholders in furthering the best interests of Canadians, not in working to antagonize our international partners, which would clearly not be effective. We believe that a sound approach that focuses on both advocacy and action will resolve this matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the former, the Prime Minister has held open and frank discussions with President Bush in Cancun at the security and prosperity leaders' summit. They will meet again in July where the western hemisphere travel initiative will be a key item on the agenda. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also recently met with provincial premiers and senior U.S. officials in Gimli, Manitoba, and continued to press the message that implementing this initiative without properly evaluating all the implications and doing the necessary due diligence is not in the interest of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Public Safety and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have met with their counterparts in Washington and both meetings have achieved success, both in establishing flexibility for implementation and in ensuring that Canada will continue to play a key role in considering options.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are already seeing the results of this advocacy approach. Delay is increasingly being raised as a serious and recommended option in the U.S. That will allow time for the appropriate analysis to be done on technologies and infrastructure to ensure that it gets done right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased to see that it is not only the Government of Canada that is carrying this message. Industry associations representing tourism and trade are being heard and are providing evidence of economic impacts that will be experienced in their areas should this initiative be implemented as it stands. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's ambassador to the United States has been a strong advocate for additional economic impact analysis of the western hemisphere travel initiative and has made his case to Congress and a number of audiences both south of the border and here at home.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of high level meetings have been held with senior U.S. officials at both federal and state levels and I am pleased to report the Canadian government's position on this matter is held in high regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress is being made on several fronts, from the acknowledgement that alternative documents will be acceptable under this initiative to the increasing recognition that more needs to be done to properly evaluate new technologies and new infrastructure. This is both advocacy and action, but the government is doing even more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over $400 million in new funding was announced in budget 2006 for border security initiatives, including resources dedicated to ensuring that low risk travellers can cross the border quickly and securely using the latest biometric technologies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is moving forward on other security commitments, such as equipping our border professionals with the tools and infrastructure they need to do their jobs and protect the safety and security of Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of action is recognized in the United States and this government is doing its part to ensure the message is both clear and consistent. The Canadian border is open for legitimate trade and travel and closed to drug smugglers, organized crime and terrorists.</div>

They are good initiatives, do not get me wrong. They do speed up the flow but that is not what we are talking about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about ordinary people who travel across the border once in a while, maybe for tourism or for business. We can say that we will have special documents that will get recognition but we do not know what that means. We have not even developed the documents yet and this initiative is to be implemented in 18 months, What are the Americans going to implement? What will we implement? How much will they cost? Will they be as expensive as a passport or more expensive? Will they be as readily available or more readily available? We do not have any of that information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding depends greatly on the American tourist. We have a huge tourism industry in the Maritimes. It is the second or third largest industry in Nova Scotia. Because of market conditions that have been happening since September 11, 2001, we have seen a reduction in tourism. One ferry has completely closed. We have had Bay Ferries do a great initiative this year. We are seeing signs of improvement in the number of Americans who want to come into our country but we need to be welcoming. We need our government to be forcing the Americans to take our side.</div>

    </p><a name="Para25780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians expect that their government will not turn its back and hope for the best. They expect their elected representatives to use whatever resources and influence they have to promote their interests. This government has done just that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para25781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister made this issue a top priority with his announcement in Cancun and by tasking the Minister of Public Safety with moving this file forward in such a way that puts Canadian interests first. The Department of Public Safety is actively involved in this matter, as are the Canada Border Services Agency, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, the Privy Council Office, Foreign Affairs, Passport Canada, Industry Canada and others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para25782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full weight of this government's efforts has been brought to bear on this issue. Canadians expect their government to stand up for their interests and this Prime Minister and this government will continue to do that here at home and around the world.</div>
