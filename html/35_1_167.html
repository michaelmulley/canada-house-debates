	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is World Consumer Rights Day as declared by 
Consumers International, formerly known as the International 
Organization of Consumer Unions. Throughout the world, 
consumers are marking this event by taking part in activities 
stressing their contribution to the marketplace in our society.
<P>
	Consumers have a vital role to play in maintaining the wealth 
and competitiveness in this country. Indeed, over 60 per cent of 
Canada's GDP is attributed to consumer demand. Consumers' 
voices should be heard and their rights recognized.
<P>
	Consumers International has a membership of 185 
organizations from 80 nations whose fundamental concerns are 
to protect the rights of consumers and to promote social justice 
and fairness in the marketplace. The organization assists 
consumer groups in developing countries and initiates research 
action on issues such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, tobacco 
and baby foods. It facilitates comparative testing of consumer 
goods and services-

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
failing to announce measures to stimulate the mining sector, the 
latest budget brought down by the Minister of Finance is helping 
to marginalize an industry that generates major spinoffs for a 
number of regions in Quebec and Canada, for instance in my 
own riding and in the ridings of many of my colleagues on both 
sides of the House.
<P>
	Through its failure to act and its lack of commitment, the 
federal government is jeopardizing the operations of an industry 
that is already experiencing problems. In fact, the Mining 
Association of Canada refers to the budget measures as both 
harsh and ineffectual and as a threat to the future of the mining 
sector.
<P>
	According to the Association des prospecteurs du Québec, 
Quebec's mining industry may well consider whether its 
particular sector would not be better served by a legislative 
framework under which only the Government of Quebec would 
have the power to intervene.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Albertans are demonstrating that they are willing to support the 
arts without massive federal assistance. Yesterday the Toronto 
based Council for Business and the Arts in Canada announced 
the winners of the 17th annual Business in the Arts awards. I am 
so pleased to announce that Big Rock Breweries from my riding 
of Calgary Southeast has received the award for community 
support.
<P>
	The shrinking budgets in all areas of our economy demand we 
seek new, innovative and creative ways of accessing funds, 
including the cultural sector. Big Rock Breweries from Alberta 
is leading the way as a private sector supporter for the arts. Last 
year Big Rock provided over $100,000 to over 40 different arts 
groups. It views its cultural support as a wise business practice 
and not as a charitable donation.
<P>
	Thanks to the support of Big Rock Breweries, groups like the 
Alberta Theatre Project and the Muttard Public Art Gallery are 
thriving. Albertans indeed are leading the way in private sector 
support for the cultural sector. I applaud Big Rock Breweries.

<P>
	These 2-year old children arrived from Pakistan last 
November to have extremely delicate surgery. Since birth they 
had been joined at the head. On January 23, 1995 a 23-member 
team of surgeons at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children 
performed over 15 hours of surgery.
<P>
	There have been only 30 such operations performed 
worldwide and in 60 per cent of the operations only one of the 
children survives. Young Hira Jamel survived but her sister Nida 
did not. On behalf of the House, I wish to convey my 
condolences to the Jamel family. I am sure everyone is hoping 
for a full and complete recovery for young Hira Jamel.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
speech he made on June 3 at the annual meeting of the 
Association canadienne-française de l'Ontario, the leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois said, and I quote: ``The agenda proposed by the 
Bloc Quebecois for today and for the future includes the active 
solidarity of your communities with francophones in Quebec, 
within the space we share''.
<P>
	This statement was noteworthy for its understanding and 
openness, unlike the statement made yesterday by the Bloc's 
official critic in response to the position taken by the Fédération 
des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada. After 
accusing them of interfering, the Bloc member continued her 
attack with the following statement, and I quote: ``Our message 
to francophones outside Quebec is clear: Mind your own 
business''.
<P>
	Once again, the Bloc Quebecois has shown it is determined to 
muzzle anyone who would challenge its separatist plans.

	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, francophone and Acadian communities are unwavering 
in their belief in a united, progressive and dynamic Canada. I 
was very happy to hear that the Fédération des communautés 
francophones et acadienne du Canada had asked Quebecers to 
vote ``no'' in the referendum on separation.
<P>
	The members of the Bloc Quebecois are definitely misleading 
francophone and Acadian communities when they tell them that 
an independent Quebec would help the francophone community 
in Canada to better grow and develop.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore the statement by the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata suggesting that the federal 
government had bought the francophones and the Acadians is a 
further insult to our communities.
<P>
	I would invite the hon. member to publicly apologize for her 
insensitive remarks to Acadians and all francophones outside 
Quebec. Canada's francophones and Acadians have every right 
to speak on the future of our country.

	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was very pleased to hear that the Fédération des 
communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada 
unequivocally declared that it is in favour of Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
	The FCFA is the second organization of its kind to state that it 
supports the ``no'' side. Last February, the Société des 
Acadiennes et Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick publicly 
announced its position, and also begged Quebecers to vote no. 
These two organizations also believe in a dynamic and 
progressive Canada which is proud to promote both official 
languages. This outlook on Canada promotes the growth of the 
francophone culture as a whole.
<P>
	The fact that francophone establishments and organizations 
exist across Canada, be they educational, cultural or financial, 
proves that the French fact in Quebec and in all of the provinces 
has persevered and is alive.
<P>
	The federal government has supported the development and 
growth of the French language and culture in Canada at all 
times, not just during the referendum debate. It would be a hard 
blow to the francophone community elsewhere in Canada if 
Quebec were to leave the Canadian federation.
<P>
	Therefore, I hope the referendum will be held as soon as 
possible so that we can get on with solving the real problems.

	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
repeated attacks on the Immigration and Refugee Board over the 
last several years have regularly made the headlines. Since the 
Liberal government took office, these criticisms have become 
increasingly vitriolic, but the government remains strangely 
unperturbed.
<P>
	Again yesterday, two former IRB board members estimated 
that at least half of their former colleagues lacked the training 
and expertise necessary for the performance of their duties.

<HR>

<P>
They alleged, as have others before them, that patronage 
appointments are at the root of the board's problems.
<P>
	It is urgent that the government get to the bottom of the matter 
and hold a public inquiry into the Board's operations. The longer 
this government fails to take action, the more lasting the damage 
to the board's credibility is likely to be.

use his letter. He writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I appreciate your stand on gun control. I approve of reasonable methods of 
fighting crime and of taking guns from criminals. I will, I suppose, become a 
criminal when I refuse to register my hunting guns. Actually, I will probably 
never use my guns again; I am 75 years old and have a lung disorder which 
prevents me from doing very much of anything. I have never been charged with 
anything in my 75 years, it's too bad I have to start now. Thanks for your efforts.

on the honesty of any member of this House and to please finish 
his statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
withdraw that final sentence.
<P>
	Does the justice minister really think Mr. Parsons is a 
criminal? Does he think because a 75-year old man is going to 
knowingly fail to register his hunting rifles that he should go to 
jail for up to 10 years? Is the Liberal government going to build 
more jails to house the thousands of responsible firearms 
owners like Mr. Parsons? Or is it going to continue to let the real 
criminals out on the street to make room for those who fail to 
register their firearms?

Quebecers to vote ``no'' in the upcoming referendum.
<P>

if receiving federal subsidies did not help the federation take a 
federalist stance.
<P>
	If francophones outside Quebec have survived for centuries, 
taking their place at every level and in every sphere of activity in 
Canada, and if there is such a thing as cultural duality in Canada

	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
object to the remarks made by Bloc Quebecois members to the 
effect that for francophones outside Quebec to oppose Quebec's 
separation constitutes interference. Such remarks clearly show 
the Bloc's policy of discouraging debate and silencing any 
opposition to separation. But the Bloc is ignoring an inescapable 
fact: you cannot silence a majority.
<P>
	Francophones from across Canada-Quebecers, Acadians, 
Franco-Saskatchewanians and Franco-Ontarians-have always 
actively promoted and preserved their language and culture on 
this continent where we form a very small minority.
<P>
	Our efforts have paid off and will continue to pay off because 
federalism and our political system are responsive and 
encourage the development of francophone communities. A 
majority of French Canadians recognize the Canadian federal 
system as a flexible system that promotes our development.

Mr. Speaker, the sheep industry in Canada and Quebec was

1910. Against all expectations, the federal government is

	These cuts are totally inconsistent with the red book 
commitments on research and development and defeat the

the member representing the federal riding of St. Boniface, as a 
French-speaking resident of a province and a region outside 
Quebec, and as a Canadian of French-speaking origin born in St. 
Boniface, Manitoba, I am pleased that the Fédération des 
communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada gave its 
unequivocal support to Canadian federalism.
<P>
	The federation, like myself, believes in a dynamic and 
progressive Canada which is proud to promote its linguistic 
duality and whose government actively supports the French fact 
throughout the country. We hope that the referendum will be 
held as soon as possible, so that all of us, including Quebecers of

Canada.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canada has just proceeded to release the Spanish 
trawler <I>Estai</I>, after its owners agreed to post a bond of $500,000. 
As you know, the European Union had made the release of the 
trawler a condition for resuming negotiations with Canada.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans indicate whether 
in exchange for the release of the Spanish trawler, European 
trawlers agreed to a 60-day moratorium on fishing for turbot, as 
requested by Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his 
question.
<P>
	I want to report to him that this morning the master, or the 
owner, of the <I>Estai</I> posted bond in the order of $500,000 against 
his vessel. This is in addition to the $8,000 bail posted against 
the captain of the vessel a day or two before.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10511"> 10511 </A></B>
<P>
	This is in keeping with the procedures of the Canadian 
judicial system, procedures that have been followed in similar 
circumstances with other vessels of similar size, shape and 
value.
<P>
	We are very pleased to see that a bond has been posted. As a 
result the vessel and crew are free to leave at any time.
<P>
	In addition to the bond being posted, some 130 tonnes of 
product have been removed from the vessel and is being held by 
the crown as evidence. It will be held in a storage facility and 
will be disposed of by the court at the end of the judicial 
proceedings.
<P>
	There has been no negotiation, nor should there be in terms of 
the judicial proceedings themselves. I know the hon. Leader of 
the Opposition would agree with this. The proceedings have 
been conducted as they ought to be by the court in the normal 
manner.
<P>
	Now that both a bond has been posted and there is no fishing 
on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks, this may well be an 
opportunity for talks. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Prime Minister have given instructions to a negotiating team in 
Brussels. We shall see.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask the minister whether in connection 
with the release of the trawler <I>Estai</I>, Canada tried to obtain, or 
possibly obtained, guarantees from the European Union or Spain 
that their trawlers will not fish for turbot throughout the 
forthcoming negotiations with Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a good question. Canada has made it 
clear since the beginning of this difficulty between Canada and 
the EU that we will not negotiate while fish are being caught.
<P>
	I was pleased to note yesterday we had four or five days in a 
row of no fishing on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks. For a 
few hours last night one vessel did cross over into the area of the 
nose but I can report that this morning it had pulled back again.
<P>
	For the moment, as we speak here in this Chamber, there are 
no vessels on the nose and tail. Bond has been posted on this 
particular fishing vessel. It will sail out of harbour. I should 
point out it will sail out without a net, without the ability to fish. 
The net was cut.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	I can also report, and I know the Leader of the Opposition will 
be happy to hear this, that Canadian technology in global 
positioning systems-I am advertising now to the planet-were 
successful in allowing us to find and to retrieve today the net 
from the <I>Estai</I>.
<P>
	The net that has been retrieved bears manufacturer markings 
identical to that on part of the equipment still left on the <I>Estai</I>. 
The fish that were pulled out of the water-we videotaped 
this-were still kicking. They were alive. This is the net 
recently cut. The net had a 115 millimetre mesh, which is 
smaller than the 130 millimetre required by NAFO. In addition, 
the net in question had an 80 millimetre liner in the net.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame, shame.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether formal negotiations are now 
taking place between Canadian diplomats and their European 
counterparts, but I hope so. However, I would like to ask the 
minister whether Canada has initiated certain discussions so 
that formal negotiations can begin as soon as possible between 
its representatives and those representing Spain and the 
European Union?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that the team 
headed by the Canadian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs is 
now in Brussels to start negotiations with representatives of the 
European Union. We are ready and willing, and we want to settle 
this in a diplomatic way.
<P>
	There are two things we want to accomplish. First, ensure that 
the conservation measures we support will be respected, and we 
therefore hope to reach an agreement with our friends in the 
European Union on setting up an effective mechanism for 
surveillance and monitoring. I also want to take this opportunity 
to say that in a spirit of co-operation, we are prepared to review 
with European Union representatives the quota share we 
obtained as a result of the last negotiations.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Solicitor General. In a report made public 
yesterday, the inspector general of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service, better known as CSIS, notes serious 
irregularities in the use of informants on university campuses 
and in political parties during elections.
<P>
	How does the Solicitor General explain his statements that 
CSIS did not spy on or infiltrate political parties, when the 
inspector general of CSIS criticizes his failure to issue any sort 
of guideline on dealing with these political party informants 
during electoral campaigns?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the report is for a period of more than two years before 
this government took office. Since that time work has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10512"> 10512 </A></B>
<P>
ongoing to deal with the  problems and concerns raised in it. 
This is something to which we are paying close attention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no need to go back two years. In December, Michel 
Robert, the chair of the CSIS review committee, stated that 
Canadian political parties had not been investigated, and, a 
month later, the CSIS review committee was forced to 
contradict him, saying that there had in fact been a file entitled 
``Preston Manning'' on the Reform Party.
<P>
	I would therefore ask the Solicitor General how he can play 
down the scope of the report by the inspector general of CSIS, 
which concludes that there is no justification for the use of 
informants on university campuses and during electoral 
campaigns.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my understanding that the overall conclusion of 
the inspector general at that time, some two years ago, was that 
the use of informants by CSIS was professional, of an 
appropriate professional level.
<P>
	As I have said, work is ongoing to deal with the concerns 
raised by the inspector general at that time.
<P>
	Finally, I remind my hon. friend that he has once again stated 
something that is not correct. The file referred to by the acting 
chair of the security intelligence review committee was not 
about an investigation of a political party but rather about the 
possibility that a foreign government had made contributions in 
a way that was not appropriate.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I hope my hon. friend, if he raises the subject 
again, will describe the matter correctly. It is about time he did 
so.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
over a month ago the Minister of National Defence claimed to 
have been ill-informed by the military chain of command 
specifically concerning information regarding the airborne 
videos.
<P>
	Has the minister satisfied himself that these concerns with 
information from the chain of command have been addressed? 
What specifically has he done about them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
was a particular incident to which the hon. member refers and 
that concerns the misinformation in a report on the videos. That 
matter was dealt with by the chief of defence staff who relieved a 
general officer of his post as a result of not providing both the 
CDS and myself with the details.
<P>
	I have full confidence in the chief of defence staff and the 
military command who work pretty hard at their jobs, as I have 
confidence in all of the men and women who serve Canada 
proudly in the armed forces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have obtained a leaked report written by Brigadier-General 
Jeffries and submitted to land force command headquarters.
<P>
	According to General Jeffries, the troops believe that, quote: 
``Political agendas and careerism have replaced leadership in 
the defence hierarchy and, furthermore, that the loyalty and 
focus of senior military leaders is directed upwards and not 
down''. This is a very serious evaluation of the state of affairs.
<P>
	Is the Minister of National Defence aware of this report? How 
does he plan to deal with the leadership crisis in his department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
privy to all communications that are made between the chain of 
command throughout the country.
<P>
	If the hon. member has such a document that he describes, I 
will certainly raise the matter with the chief of defence staff to 
see if the concerns allegedly addressed by Brigadier-General 
Jeffries have been brought to his attention. Then we will decide 
how to proceed from that point forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is not the first time that an internal report has pointed out 
leadership problems in the Canadian military. To date, however, 
the Minister of National Defence has promised only cosmetic 
changes and has put off major decisions with the promise of 
future inquiries.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to address these failings in the 
leadership and elsewhere in the military or do we have to wait 
for more videos?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
just made the statement that the government and I have full 
confidence in the chief of defence staff and all those in 
command of the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	With respect to the renewal of any organization, there are 
changes made every year. I announced a couple of weeks ago we 
would be streamlining the general officer ranks by about 25 per 
cent. Some new people have been brought into key positions at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10513"> 10513 </A></B>

national defence  headquarters. I believe this will allay any 
concerns the hon. member has that we at national defence 
headquarters do not have dynamic, vibrant leadership.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The situation is very tense in Burundi since the murder, in 
October 1993, of the first democratically elected president of 
that republic. In recent months, some 50,000 people have died in 
the conflict between the two main ethnic groups, and there is 
every indication that another crisis is looming. The recent 
assassination of the minister of energy and mines has 
exacerbated the situation and there is a great deal of insecurity 
in the country.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us about the current situation in Burundi 
and the means being considered by the UN and Canada to 
prevent a crisis?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the concerns expressed by the hon. 
member are well founded. It is sad that the ethnic conflicts 
which occurred in Rwanda and ended in terrible bloodbaths 
could now surface in a neighbouring country and trigger a 
similar tragedy.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	This is why Canada has repeatedly asked the United Nations, 
and also the Organization of African Unity, to immediately get 
involved and try to find a solution to this increasingly menacing 
situation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, in committee, the minister informed us of the 
representations he made, among others, to the UN secretary, for 
sending additional troops to Rwanda in order to restore a 
balance in the region. As you know, the Security Council 
rejected Canada's request.
<P>
	My question to the minister is: Will he pledge to again ask the 
UN Security Council to quickly organize the multinational 
forces required to prevent a conflict?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes. In the event that the United 
Nations are not in a position to intervene, we also contacted the 
Organization of African Unity to see if a regional approach 
might be more appropriate. A number of countries concerned by 
the situation in Rwanda and in Burundi could intervene, with the 
support of the UN, but they would do so on a regional basis, 
rather than in the context of a global operation under the UN.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would have thought that with the contents of the 
report being so serious the minister might have had them before 
now.
<P>
	Further to my colleague's questions regarding leadership, 
General Jeffries' report says the troops believe: ``Senior leaders 
are seen to be unwilling or unable to speak to soldiers' needs on 
their soldiers' behalf. For example, the airborne trial by 
headlines left personnel feeling disillusioned and abandoned''.
<P>
	Has the minister yet realized how serious the leadership 
problem in his department is? If so, can he give the House some 
specifics as to how he intends to deal with it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
to realize the armed forces has been under considerable pressure 
for the last few years since the events in Somalia became public. 
This has posed a great problem and a strain.
<P>
	The armed forces has enjoyed an enviable reputation for many 
years. The work discharged by the armed forces is exemplary. 
The Canadian Armed Forces is universally respected.
<P>
	This week we are preparing to send the first of about a 470 
contingent to Haiti. These people are outstanding. They are well 
led. That does not mean to say that from time to time problems 
will crop up. Where specific examples of management or 
leadership are brought to the attention of the government, they 
are dealt with.
<P>
	With respect to the issue of Somalia, the whole chain of 
command and how the troops were deployed to Somalia will be 
the subject of an inquiry.
<P>
	For the Reform Party to make blanket accusations about the 
morale of the troops and about the high leadership of the armed 
forces is not borne out by the facts. There was considerable 
disappointment regarding airborne matters and may have been 
reflected in the alleged report.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask members once again to keep 
questions and answers short.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not the Reform Party that is accusing the minister 
of leadership problems.
<P>
	The report also says: ``Soldiers perceive their interests and 
welfare are being sacrificed so that senior leaders can be 
successful in delivering the same bang for much less buck. 
Unpalatable though it may be, we will have to cut our suit to fit 
the available cloth if we are to avoid a hollow army and burnt out 
soldiers''.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Considering the contents of this report, is the minister

cause and extent of the problem and propose remedial action to 
avoid a burnt out army?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it 
odd that the hon. member wishes me to institute an inquiry based 
on one memo.
<P>
	The hon. member was a member of the joint committee of the 
House and Senate that looked into all aspects and operations of 
the Canadian Armed Forces. He signed a report concluding that 
the leadership of the armed forces was top flight.
<P>
	Now he comes forward based on the contents of one memo, 
perhaps generated by the very emotional situation of the closing 
of the Canadian airborne, and wishes to reverse the assessment 
to which he subscribed less than three months ago. That is not 
logical.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment. In December 
1993, officials of the Department of the Environment gave their 
minister an internal document which seriously called into 
question the conclusions and quality of the study on which she 
based her decision to refloat the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	Was the Minister of the Environment aware of that document 
and will she tell us why she picked the most risky and 
controversial solution, which was to raise the <I>Irving Whale</I>, 
despite her officials' advice?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the only one who 
thinks this is a controversial issue is the company that did not 
land the contract. What is truly unfortunate for the hon. member 
opposite is that people called her leader regarding this issue 
when he was environment minister, and he held public hearings 
into the matter in Halifax, Dartmouth and on Prince Edward 
Island, yet took no action.
<P>
	As soon as we came to office, we acted and we hope to raise 
the <I>Irving Whale</I> this summer at the very latest.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
speaking to the Minister of the Environment who, at present, is 
the only one responsible for the Department of the Environment, 
and who is the one who must make the right decisions.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> How can the minister explain her steadfast 
refusal to have an electronic inspection of the barge's hull done 
before raising it, which the experts say is the very minimum 
which must be done to prevent a major  ecological catastrophe 
from occurring if the <I>Irving Whale</I> were to break up during the 
operation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member 
had read the documents I provided, all of the material in the 
public domain, including the 1990 report asking the former 
minister to take action, she would know that we did have an 
electronic inspection done last June.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What I find incredibly obscure about the logic of the hon. 
member is that a few months ago she stood in the House and said 
we should not wait until next spring. We have to lift the <I>Irving 
Whale</I> this year. Now that we are moving ahead and have gone to 
tender, she completely reverses the position she took only a few 
months ago.
<P>

<P>
	Yesterday, the UN Committee Against Torture ruled that 
Canada's treatment of Mr. Khan, a refugee claimant from 
Pakistan, violated the international convention against torture, 
to which Canada itself is a signatory.
<P>
	Since the decision concludes that this individual would be in 
danger of being subjected to torture if Canada sent him back to 
his native country, does the Canadian government undertake not 
to deport Mr. Khan?

decision.
<P>
	We have asked the UN committee to reconsider its position on 
the basis that this individual also had a criminal conviction in 
Canada in 1993. No longer is this simply a case of protection for 
an individual. There is also the claim that Canada has every right

binding on Canada. We have every right to uphold our laws and

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
confusion surrounding the Liberal position on the electronic 
transfer tax, otherwise known as the Tobin tax, which seeks to 
impede the flow of capital around the world.
<P>
	Last week in Copenhagen the human resources minister said 
that it was a good idea. He repeated it again in the House on 
Monday. The finance minister denounced it and now it has been

<P>
that we are making a major breakthrough by bringing to the 
agenda of the G-7 meeting the  question of the revision of the 
international financial institutions.
<P>
	During the course of discussions a number of alternatives will 
be discussed. The Tobin tax, which seems to be very interesting 
to the hon. member, is one of many subjects that will certainly 
be looked at and discussed at that meeting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
world today international money traders are looking at Canada. 
They want some kind of feeling of security on where the 
government is going.
<P>
	Why do 1970 ideas keep bubbling to the top whenever the 
Liberals get into their think mode? Do they support the Tobin 
tax? Yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, </B><B>Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are supporting a revision and an improvement 
of international financial institutions. We will be presenting 
recommendations in this regard at the time of the Halifax 
summit.
<P>
	We have asked a parliamentary committee to look at it. I 
remind the hon. member that his party is represented on the

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal. At a 
press conference in Quebec City yesterday, the vice-president 
of the Public Service Alliance of Canada revealed actual 
instances of public funds being squandered. Apparently, the 
federal government offered courses on stress management 
through humour, and defensive driving courses to civil servants 
who do not need to drive as part of their jobs. Talk about 
defensive!
<P>
	Will the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs admit that 
these glaring examples of squandering show that the 
government is unable to end the cycle of waste in the federal 
administration?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we do not subscribe to government waste. In terms of 
program review we have gone through in great detail all the 
programs and services provided by the government.
<P>
	In order to get our deficit down, in order to get our fiscal 
house in order, we have made the most major cuts that have been 
made in government expenditures since the end of the second 
world war. That will help to bring about a discipline and ensure 
more than ever before that we have the greatest efficiency and 
effectiveness in terms of the spending of public taxpayers 
dollars.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in light of the 
minister's answer, I believe he should have his eyes examined.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs turn a 
blind eye to the many instances of squandering brought to his 
attention by civil servants? Why does he not recognize that he 
should clean up his own backyard before hitting civil servants 
with massive layoffs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we do not close an eye to any matter brought to our 
attention whereby we can improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of government programs and services. Any that 
have been brought to my attention have been or are being 
examined very carefully.
<P>
	We do not take lightly the fact that part of our expenditure 
reduction program involves 45,000 people having to be removed 
from their positions in the public service. We intend to treat 
people fairly and equitably in carrying this out and ensuring that 
we get the fiscal house of the government in order.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday Mr. Bill Bauer and Mr. Gary Carson, both former 
members of the Immigration and Refugee Board, confirmed that 
half the IRB members may not be competent to hear refugee 
claims, that some cannot function adequately in either of 
Canada's official languages, and that members are being 
pressured to make positive decisions.
<P>
	Will the minister listen this time, dismantle the IRB and start 
over, or will he ignore Bauer like he ignored us and other 
Canadians and even his own employees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the matter should be put in its 
proper context.
<P>
	The government has not accepted the status quo with respect 
to the Immigration and Refugee Board. We have moved serious 
reforms both legislatively as well as administratively. Last week 
the chairman of the IRB responded very comprehensively and 
very effectively to the Hathaway report.
<P>
	No one is saying that institution or any institution of 
government is perfect. Equally so, we should not jump to the 
opposite extreme and say that everything the IRB does is wrong 
and every

<HR>
<B><A NAME="10517"> 10517 </A></B>
<P>
member of the IRB is incompetent, because that is simply not 
the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. Bauer made it clear yesterday that the minister's single 
member panels are a step backward and will worsen the current 
mess.
<P>
	Two former IRB members concluded that Canada accepts 
terrorists as refugees, that some lawyers are scripting refugee 
claims, and that in Bauer's opinion up to two-thirds of claimants 
are accepted under false pretences.
<P>
	Why does the minister continue to put the interests of bogus 
claimants, refugee lawyers and advocates ahead of the interests 
of Canadians who pay $1 billion a year for this disgrace?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member does not know 
what he is talking about. If competence for membership in the 
Chamber was any guideline he would not be here.
<P>
	Now he is talking about a $1 billion budget for the IRB. I ask 
the member to have the decency to put forward the facts, to put 
forward things that we can do better, things that we can do to 
build the institution, rather than reduce everything to rubble.

Congratulations to the minister and his department are in order.
<P>

<P>

significance of the net's mesh size and the accompanying liner 
in the matter at hand?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. The 
matter is important to Atlantic Canadians and obviously 
important to people right across the country, given the support 
the Reform Party has given to the government in pursuit of the 
conservation of the fishery.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	It is extraordinary to see the Reform Party, the New 
Democratic Party-and I should acknowledge the Conservative 
Party-and the Leader of the Official Opposition endorse 
unanimously the conservation measure in the House on behalf of 
Canadians everywhere. It is a great moment for Canada. I 
acknowledge the support of the parties opposite.
<P>
	However, let me in answering the question acknowledge the 
tremendous leadership of the greatest Prime Minister the 
country has ever had in standing up for the country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Mr. Speaker, you want me to come right to the 
point and I shall.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, I would like the minister to come precisely 
to the point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> The significance of the 80-millimetre mesh is 
that it is some 15 millimetres smaller than the official NAFO 
approved mesh size for this species. Therefore the animals being 
caught in the mesh are far smaller. They are juveniles. They are 
immature. They are far smaller than what should be caught if we 
are to have a sustainable fishery.

<P>
	In view of the profound concerns of the B.C. Coalition for

children?

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are very concerned that children be treated equally

<P>
	The budget did not dramatically cut CAPC. It reduced the

ENVIRONMENT-SALVAGING OF THE IRVING WHALE</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of the Environment stated 
in this House, when she answered a question on the refloating of 
the <I>Irving Whale</I>, and I quote: ``I just wanted to remind the hon. 
members that the first report proposing salvage measures was 
tabled in 1989 and rejected by the then Minister of the 
Environment''.
<P>
	Later on, she also said about the <I>Irving Whale</I>: ``six years 
after the first report was presented to the former environment 
minister-the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the fact is that I resigned as environment 
minister in May 1990 and that the report mentioned by the 
minister was tabled in September 1990. Her statement is 
therefore totally false and inaccurate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> But in any case, you did nothing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I hear other ministers say that she was right to 
lie to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> You did nothing when you were there.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I do not think I heard 
everything the hon. Leader of the Opposition said, but if the 
word ``lie'' was indeed used, I would urge the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition to reconsider the use of that word.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have reconsidered, and I gladly 
withdraw.
<P>
	I would ask that, in that same spirit, the transport minister 
withdraw his remarks that the environment minister was right 
yesterday to twist the truth around.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> You did nothing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> It is not over yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> That is for sure.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. Leader of the Opposition has 
the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, what happened yesterday is 
even more serious. It is so because I submit to the Chair that this 
inaccuracy was stated on purpose. The minister had the report in 
front of her at the time, and it indicates the date I just gave.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10519"> 10519 </A></B>
<P>
	Moreover, the question was asked by one of her Liberal 
colleagues, the hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi, who, as a 
courteous man, certainly served notice of his question to the 
minister. She knew what to expect and she was able to prepare an 
answer.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	A third point is even more serious than this. The minister 
altered the official report so that today, <I>Hansard</I> does not 
contain the words she used yesterday. According to Beauchesne, 
and more particularly citation 1117, no member is allowed to 
alter <I>Hansard</I> the way the minister did yesterday after the blues 
came out.
<P>
	If you compare the blues and <I>Hansard</I>, you will notice that 
two substantive corrections were made, so that the words which 
were so injurious to me yesterday as a member of this House in 
front of the TV cameras and everybody, while the minister 
scored political points by heaping ridicule on me and making me 
look like an irresponsible minister, no longer appear in Hansard 
today. Therefore, those injurious remarks made publicly 
yesterday in this House, in front of the TV cameras, must be 
corrected today in a immediate public statement including 
apologies by the minister.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the gravity of 
the accusations of the hon. member, I would have thought he 
would at least have had the courtesy of serving me notice. Had 
he served me notice, I would have advised him as I did 
yesterday, as I did several months ago when I actually gave a 
copy of that particular report to the House. Unfortunately, his 
caucus I suppose did not advise him of it.
<P>
	In fact, the Brander-Smith report to which I referred 
yesterday in the House was initiated by the Right Hon. Brian 
Mulroney when the hon. Leader of the Opposition was Minister 
of the Environment. There were several public hearings held 
while he was Minister of the Environment, including a public 
hearing that was held in Halifax, another public hearing that was 
held in Saint John and another public hearing held in Prince 
Edward Island, which specifically called on the Minister of the 
Environment in 1989 to act.
<P>
	In fact, the minister did not act. He did not act; his 
predecessors did not act; his successors did not act. We acted 
within 100 days of coming to government.
<P>
	I would have thought that rather than dragging out the issue-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-rather that resorting to petty politics, the Bloc Quebecois 
would have done better to recognize the fact that we have made a 
decision, a decision that neither the former environment 
minister, his predecessor, nor his successor made.
<P>
	I will repeat in French so that he understands clearly. When he 
was environment minister, in 1989, three public hearings were 
held at which the refloating of the <I>Irving Whale</I> was advocated, 
and he did not respond. That is what I said in the House 
yesterday.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will put my word on the line against his word any time.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, the Chair always takes very, 
very seriously any question of privilege which is raised by any 
and all hon. members in this House.
<P>
	We have heard allegations on one side and a rebuttal on the 
other. We are getting into debate, perhaps on a question of the 
interpretation of facts. With your permission, seeing that this 
has taken place over two days, I wonder if you will give me the 
time to review the blues as to what was said.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	I will come back to the House as soon as I can to give a 
decision as to whether indeed any hon. member's privileges 
have been breached in this case. With the time to think about it a 
bit, I will bring back a decision as soon as possible. For this 
question of privilege at least at this time, I would like to take the 
information I have and consider it for a while.

<P>
	It states that the concerned citizens of the province of

amendments to the firearms control legislation by the justice 
minister are unduly harsh and waste dwindling financial 
resources while attacking the rights of law-abiding citizens 
without affecting crime.

but not proceed with the proposed enhanced controls on legal 
ownership of firearms.

concerned about the negative impact of such a move on families

negative implications in society.

	They therefore pray that Parliament continue to reject 
euthanasia and physician assisted suicide; that it continue to 
enforce section 241 of the Criminal Code prohibiting the 
commission of assisting suicide; and that it consider expanding 
palliative care accessible to all dying persons knowing that such 
care is compassionate and therefore will result in the relief of

might provide some guidance to the House on this matter 
because the practice has been growing.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member raises a very valid point. As a

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was looking at Standing Order 53, the provision 
under which the motion was presented to the House. I believe 
the motion presented is actually in contradiction of the intention 
of Standing Order 53.
<P>
	Standing Order 53(3) says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Proceedings on any such motion shall be subject to the following conditions:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) The Speaker may permit debate thereon for a period not exceeding one 
hour;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The intention of Standing Order 53, when it was passed by the 
House was not to allow debate to exceed one hour. The minister 
and government have proposed we ignore the intent of this 
regulation and continue debate until such time as a minister of 
the crown deems the day is over.
<P>
	I believe this is specifically against the intention of the 
Standing Order. I would like the Chair to review this before we 
proceed any further along these lines.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I understand the provisions of Standing Order 53, 
this is a matter of a very urgent nature in which the normal rules 
of the House are suspended.
<P>
	In this instance clearly we are talking about overriding 
collective bargaining rights and moving directly to a bill. As I 
understand it, before the question is put on the motion, members 
of the House should at least be given an opportunity to be heard 
on whether this matter is of sufficient urgency to should proceed 
under the extraordinary provisions of Standing Order 53.
<P>
	This is a very serious matter. I spoke with the president of the 
Longshoremen's Union Local 514, Doug Sigurdson. He 
indicated they are currently in conciliation on this matter. The 
government wants to short circuit the collective bargaining 
process and move directly.
<P>
	If that is to happen, the Chair should allow members of this 
House the courtesy of being heard under the provisions of 
Standing Order 53. That was not done and I would appeal to the 
Speaker to reconsider his position and to give us an opportunity 
to be heard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with the greatest respect, what has happened is 
perfectly proper.
<P>
	On the motion the government introduced, there seem to be 
two points raised by the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway 
and the hon. member for Battlefords-Meadowlake. The points 
are separate and so I will try to deal with them separately.
<P>
	The first one is that somehow the motion proposed extends the 
debate on this motion which has been disposed of by the House 
for more than an hour. That is not correct. The debate is over. No 
one who rose to debate the motion when the motion was put to 
the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10525"> 10525 </A></B>
<P>
	The Chair put the motion to the House and everyone was 
sitting in their seats. I looked around to see if anyone was rising 
in debate and not a soul rose.
<P>
	The hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway was glued to his 
seat. He did not want to debate this matter. Then he suddenly 
realized he made a mistake by not getting up.
<P>
	The debate is over. The question has been put. There could 
have been a one-hour debate. The hon. member knows this. No 
member rose to speak. Therefore the question was put and 
disposed of by the House.
<P>
	The motion simply allowed the introduction of the bill which 
has now been introduced to the House. It has received first 
reading in the House. We have an additional order that says the 
House may continue to sit this evening past the ordinary hour of 
adjournment until a minister of the crown moves adjournment.
<P>
	That is all we have and that is the way the matter sits at the 
moment. Members should be content. We will see what develops 
in the course of the afternoon.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wish I could say I am completely blameless in 
all of this. When I put the motion, I paused after the word 
``and''. I did not see anyone rising in their place for debate.
<P>
	It could be said that I should have called for debate. I did not 
but I understood that if there was going to be debate, hon. 
members would have risen at that time. That is why I went on to 
the second part of the motion. I put before you that I am sort of 
caught in a bind here. Perhaps I should have said the word 
debate, but I thought I waited long enough.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	If an error has been made it surely has not been made by 
anyone but your Speaker. I do not know what the resolution of 
this should be. By the rules we have, the motion is deemed to 
have been adopted and carried and the matter cannot be 
reopened.
<P>
	I would hope hon. members would give enough leeway to the 
Chair. I wish I was blameless. I wish I had used the word debate. 
I understood that hon. members would rise if they wanted to 
debate, so in the absence of anyone rising I am going to rule in 
favour, that the motion is now carried. I am going to rule that the 
matter cannot be reopened. I am hoping for the understanding of 
hon. members. Perhaps you would give your Speaker a little 
leeway.
<P>
	I do not want to prolong this. If the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake has something to add, I know it is 
probably against the rules but I will hear him out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly understand the dilemma you are in 
because I face a similar dilemma at this end of the House. With 
all due respect, I believe you are aware that this is the first time 
in this Parliament the  government has seen fit to utilize this 
section of the Standing Orders.
<P>
	Therefore, when the minister rose to state that he was rising 
under section 53 of the Standing Orders, I immediately reached 
into my desk, pulled out the Standing Orders I have here, and 
was reading the Standing Orders as you were reading the 
motion.
<P>
	It took me a couple of moments to realize that there was a 
debate on the motion itself. I like many members of the House 
take some time to understand the full implications of every 
standing order. With respect, I think it would have been 
appropriate had the word debate been used to prompt individual 
members to their feet should they have wished to debate the 
issue.
<P>
	Having said that and understanding your position, Mr. 
Speaker, and given the nature of the debate, the fact that there is 
much information about the dispute the government is 
introducing legislation on, perhaps members may wish to reflect 
upon it.
<P>
	I would ask for unanimous consent of the House to allow for 
this hour of debate to carry forward and therefore allow some of 
this to be discussed prior to putting the motion itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B>

issue to determine whether or not this would be advisable. If and 
when the House decides to revert to that, this would be no 
reflection upon the excellent ruling of Mr. Speaker. It would 
only be because of unanimous consent of the House to revert to 
that, should the House decide to do so.
<P>
	While consultation is going on I reiterate for the Chair a 
further point. On reflection of the issue raised by the hon. 
member some moments ago, there seems to have been confusion 
about the fact that the motion as proposed by the minister 
discussed provision for the hour of adjournment tonight. That 
seems to have given way to some confusion between that and the 
one hour to debate the motion itself. I believe that was perhaps 
the cause of the confusion in the hon. member's mind.
<P>
	Nevertheless, consultation having been achieved, I am 
pleased to report that we are prepared to consider unanimous 
consent.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, on second reflection we will have 
to wait for that to happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, having done the negotiating, I think you would find, in 
light of what has happened, that we are quite prepared to ensure 
when the bill comes up for debate that time be permitted to the 
New 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10526"> 10526 </A></B>
<P>
Democratic Party to participate in the debate on the bill which 
otherwise might be jeopardized by some other arrangement.
<P>
	I undertake to ensure in all negotiations about the debate on 
the bill that time be permitted to the NDP to participate in the 
debate. I think that will solve the problem. We need not reopen 
the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, in light of what has taken place 
here, I think out of consideration we would accept the offer put 
forward by the hon. member.
<P>
	However I wish to stress that the point of the intervention was 
that the use of the standing order in this case was not introduced 
properly either by the government or in our understanding of the 
ability to debate early.
<P>
	We realize even in the event of the debate carrying on through 
the evening that New Democrats would likely have an 
opportunity to speak. However the problem that exists is that the 
legislation the government is bringing forward, which the 
government is scheduling to pass this evening, may not be 
necessary given what is happening on the west coast. Therefore 
we should debate that process prior to debating the motion itself.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The dilemma that we face in the House seems 
to have at least a reasonable chance to be resolved without 
reverting in any way.
<P>
	The hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake has 
made his point clear. I personally thank him for his 
understanding. I probably should have said the word debate. I 
assure him that the next time I will use the word debate.
<P>
	My ruling would be that the motion is carried. I want to put the 
matter to one side, understanding of course the agreement of the 
governing party that hon. members will have a chance to fully 
participate in the debate. It would seem that there is unanimous 
agreement. Is there unanimous agreement?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank hon. members for their help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my colleague, the hon. member for Wild Rose, 
requested that you consider an emergency debate tonight on the 
very issue that will be dealt with in the bill. That confirms the 
feelings of the hon. member that it is a very serious matter which 
needed to be discussed by the House.
<P>
	In light of recent developments the hon. member should 
withdraw the request. It seems redundant to ask for an 
emergency debate when we will actually be dealing with the 
legislation we called for yesterday in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. House leader of the Reform 
Party. I am sorry I will not be able to hear my hon. friend for 
Wild Rose. I was looking forward to hearing what he was going 
to say to the House.

	The House resumed from March 14 consideration of the 
motion that this House approves in general the budgetary policy 
of the government.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in the 
House to speak today on a matter of great importance to the 
economic and social future of the country, namely the budget 
presented by the Minister of Finance two weeks ago.
<P>
	In order to fully understand the measures taken by the 
Minister of Finance, it is useful to recall the fiscal and economic 
reality that confronted us upon taking power just 16 months ago. 
Unemployment and interest rates were high. Corporate 
profitability had plummeted. Business failures were at record 
levels. Many Canadians had quite literally lost hope. We were 
confronted with a huge national debt and growing deficit that 
threatened our economic and social futures.
<P>
	It was a daunting challenge. However we tackled it head on 
and made job creation, economic growth and fiscal 
responsibility our top priorities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, if you have some things to 
discuss, I would ask you to do it behind the curtains. I now give 
the floor back to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10527"> 10527 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> I thank hon. gentlemen on the other 
side for observing the decorum accorded each speaker on such 
an important issue as the budget debate. I hope I did not lose any 
time.
<P>
	We tackled the issues head on and made job creation, 
economic growth and fiscal responsibility our top priorities. 
The new budget is the latest step in our ongoing drive to restore 
Canada's fiscal health and reinforce investor confidence. When 
completed this drive will make Canada a magnet for investment, 
which will in turn encourage economic growth and create the 
jobs and training opportunities Canadians need to cope with the 
technological revolution under way.
<P>
	The measures announced by the government on budget day 
were more than a cost cutting exercise. They represent a major 
restructuring that will redefine the way government operates 
and what role government will play in people's daily lives. The 
budget represents a basic restructuring of Canadian society as a 
whole.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance stated in his budget speech, 
government must only do what it does best and leave the rest for 
those who can do it better. This presents Canadians with an 
incredible opportunity to step forward and have a direct impact 
on the way their lives are shaped and the way their communities 
develop.
<P>
	As we debate the merits of the budget today and the necessary 
actions the government must take to get its fiscal house in order, 
we must remember we are not in a unique position in Canada. 
Other countries have waited too long before taking adequate 
measures and have in a sense hit the wall, while others have 
taken strong and affirmative actions and as a result have 
positioned their economies to compete aggressively in the new 
global marketplace.
<P>
	We can learn a lot from those examples. New Zealand is a case 
in point of a country that found itself with debt and deficit that 
became too large for its economy to sustain. Over the course of 
the past eight years New Zealand has gone through a dramatic 
and painful restructuring that saw whole government programs 
cut, eliminated or commercialized, user fees introduced for 
many aspects of government services, and the introduction of 
new tax measures such as the GST.
<P>
	As a result of these measures New Zealand has drastically 
restructured its government and improved its fiscal health to the 
point where it posted a deficit of 1 per cent surplus of deficit to 
GDP ratio. However the painful lesson learned by New 
Zealanders and one we must not ignore is what happens when we 
wait too long to take these measures and what happens when we 
essentially hit the wall. When this happens countries quickly 
discover that decisions on social spending are no longer theirs to 
make but instead made for them by investors and international 
agencies.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Sweden, a country that has been long looked at as a successful 
model of society with a highly successful social safety net is on 
the verge of hitting the wall. In 1994 Sweden's debt to GDP ratio 
was an alarming 93 per cent while its deficit to GDP ratio was at 
11.2 per cent. The year before, Sweden's deficit to GDP ratio 
was at an all-time high of 13 per cent.
<P>
	The government there is facing enormous obstacles to 
overcome and put its fiscal house in order. Because Sweden has 
waited so long to restructure how its government operates, the 
very social programs that are the envy of the world are 
threatened simply because it has lost many of its options to 
manoeuvre.
<P>
	This is a situation we must avoid in Canada. On the other 
hand, there are shining examples of countries that have 
identified the need to reform before it is too late.
<P>
	Australia has taken a systematic and measured approach to 
restructuring how its government operates. It has been done in a 
way that not only brings down the expenses of government but 
also makes its programs more efficient, more effective and more 
relevant to the people who really need help and support. In 1994 
Australia posted a 34.4 per cent debt to GDP ratio and a deficit to 
GDP ratio of 4 per cent.
<P>
	That is why we have to act now. Our debt to GDP ratio has 
consistently been rising from 17 per cent in the mid-1970s to 
more than 71 per cent today. In order to ensure that we remain 
the masters of our own destiny, of our own ship, we must 
change. We must adapt.
<P>
	Last year the government spent nearly $58 billion on social 
programs. During that same period $38 billion went to pay for 
interest on the public debt. If we do not get our fiscal house in 
order now, these interest payments on the debt will be greater 
than what we spend on social programs. If unchecked, we as 
other countries have, will hit the wall.
<P>
	That is what this budget is all about. It is a major step in 
restructuring the government so that it can give us the kind of 
strong foundation we need upon which we can build strong 
social reforms which truly reflect and address the needs and 
priorities of Canadians in the 1990s.
<P>
	Initiatives contained in the budget actually support Canada's 
social policies by creating an economic and fiscal climate 
conducive to job creation. This budget reflects the sense of 
balance expressed by a man from the Northwest Territories who 
responded to the social security reform workbook. He said: 
``There must be a basic safety net for those who, for whatever 
reason, are unable to provide the encouragement and the 
opportunity for people to become self-sufficient''.
<P>
	Some people have been concerned about how the budget 
might affect Canada's social programs. This is not surprising 
given the vast amount of speculation and misinformation which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10528"> 10528 </A></B>
<P>
surfaced prior to the release of the  budget. No doubt most of this 
has now been laid to rest by the budget.
<P>
	For those who might still have some lingering doubts, the best 
evidence of the government's unwaivering commitment to 
protecting our social programs comes from the social security 
reform initiative currently under way.
<P>
	This initiative seeks to improve our current system by helping 
Canadians respond to technological and workplace change. It 
seeks to assure them of the jobs training and security they 
require. It does this by improving the efficiency of the system, 
thus guaranteeing its sustainability in the future.
<P>
	At the same time, our government has no intention of waiting 
for the benefits that will flow from this budget and social 
security reform. Instead, we are acting now to ensure that all 
Canadians have the job and training opportunities they need to 
enter the mainstream of this country.
<P>
	Here I think especially of those programs directed toward 
some of the neediest people in this country, the aboriginal 
people who have traditionally faced barriers to obtaining access 
to employment, training and promotions.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Pathways is a program designed for aboriginal people by 
aboriginal people in partnership with the Government of 
Canada. It is currently being reviewed to ensure it continues to 
reflect the needs of the aboriginal people in labour market 
training.
<P>
	In addition, the new Canada social transfer, CST, will not 
affect aboriginal peoples living on reserves since there is no 
relationship between the CST and funding arrangements for 
social assistance and services delivered on reserves. This is 
because the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development provides funding on reserves through 
arrangements that are separate from the current Canada 
assistance plan. These arrangements will continue to be separate 
from the CST.
<P>
	As well, the CST will not alter the existing responsibilities of 
the provinces for social assistance services to aboriginal peoples 
living off reserve. This goes for the government's program 
review as well.
<P>
	While the program review will affect all aspects of 
government operations, the government is committed to 
providing programs and services to aboriginal peoples. We will 
continue to live up to our commitments in such areas as human 
resources development, aboriginal strategic initiatives, First 
Nations and northern communities child care and the pathways 
strategy which I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	In preparing for the budget the government used a series of 
overarching principles to guide its course.
<P>
	First, it was critical that government get its own house in 
order. The budget must focus on cutting spending, not raising 
taxes.
<P>
	Second, every dollar counts. Governments do not have 
money. They are given money and with it they must act like 
every dollar counts because every dollar does count.
<P>
	Third, it had to be fair and equitable, fair among our regions 
and fair among individual Canadians. In this essence the north 
has not been spared in the budget, but has shared equally and 
responsibly its burden of fiscal restraint.
<P>
	As an example, the territorial formula financing payments to 
the Government of the Northwest Territories will be frozen in 
1995-96 and reduced by 5 per cent in 1996-97. This will result 
in $8 million less in the first year and $58 million less in the 
second year. It should be noted that the majority of the 
population of the north is aboriginal.
<P>
	Weather offices will close in Yellowknife and Inuvik, 
eliminating seven positions. There too, a bit of innovation and 
imagination is needed. It opens up an opportunity perhaps for 
the private sector to look at the possibility of offering this kind 
of service, maybe in partnership with learning institutions to 
train the individuals necessary to provide that service.
<P>
	The Geological Survey of Canada office in Yellowknife will 
close. Considering the amount of activity in that area with 
diamond exploration, gold and a whole array of mineral 
exploration going on, it has been difficult to do that, but I think 
there is a commitment from the industry itself to pursue 
interests in that area. It is something we are living with.
<P>
	The Canada-N.W.T. forestry co-operation agreement will not 
be renewed when it expires on March 31. The federal excise tax 
on gasoline and aviation gasoline increased by 1.5 cents, 
increasing the price of goods and travel in the north. We already 
have prohibitive costs since for the most part the first choice and 
option for travel is by air. We do not have a highway system. 
Most of the isolated communities are off the transportation grid.
<P>
	The tax on airline travel increased by $5 per flight from $50 to 
$55, increasing the cost of air travel which is so important to 
northerners. We do not have the luxury of just getting into our 
cars or vehicles and driving out onto the highway. The highways 
we do have are in need of repair and are being repaired 
constantly by the Government of the Northwest Territories with 
ever depleting resources.
<P>
	It shows, that every part of the country was affected, 
including that part of the country. It is the whole effort of getting 
back 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10529"> 10529 </A></B>
<P>
to basics. People are taking another look at how they do 
business, how government runs its administration, its 
bureaucracy and delivers services.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The elimination of the public utilities income tax transfer is 
not just a problem for Alberta or some of the other provinces. It 
is a problem for different communities in my area. It will mean 
the elimination of $700,000 in transfers to consumers of private 
utility companies.
<P>
	This is a very hard pill to swallow. In this country we have a 
partnership with individual Canadians to get our house in order 
and this is what this is all about.
<P>
	As difficult and painful as it is, cuts in budgets and programs 
to aboriginal friendship centres will affect how the friendship 
centres in the north operate and deliver their programs. 
However, northerners are resilient people. Like every Canadian, 
they recognize the importance of getting our fiscal house in 
order.
<P>
	Northerners also see opportunity in this budget. Occasions 
like this one when new arrangements are to be forged and new 
relationships to be established create positive opportunities for 
the territorial government to have greater flexibility and for 
northerners to have a greater say in developing and 
administering the programs and services which address their 
needs.
<P>
	This is an excellent opportunity to see the successful 
completion of the northern mineral accord. This can give the 
territorial government along with its other partners the 
aboriginal groups greater responsibility and autonomy over the 
economy and fiscal situation in the north. Greater autonomy 
also means greater flexibility over the programs and services 
required to meet the needs of northerners.
<P>
	Every part of this country wants to become self-sustaining 
and the Northwest Territories is no different with all of its 
complex diversity of cultures. Its population is not just one race 
or one group of people, but it is a whole mix of people. Greater 
autonomy also means there is greater opportunity for 
co-operation, for consensus building and a whole range of 
human dynamics that must be considered.
<P>
	Restructuring through program review, the territorial transfer 
or the CST also presents the opportunity for constructive 
dialogue in a process that is inclusive. It is a process which gives 
a greater voice to all stakeholders and not just government, 
including community leaders, activists, social workers, youth 
organizations. It is a comprehensive and inclusive process. It is 
an opportunity that can lead to greater independence from 
government, to become increasingly self-sufficient and 
self-empowering, to become masters of their own destiny and 
masters of their own ship.
<P>
	The fourth principle used by the Minister of Finance is that we 
must have priorities as a country that mirror our needs as a 
people. These priorities must be reflected in the way 
government defines its role. It is that principle I would like to 
expand on and what this will mean on how government will 
operate in the future, but more important, on what role 
government will play in the lives of people.
<P>
	In order to ensure that the needs of Canadians are met, to 
ensure that programs and services remain relevant and to ensure 
our continuing economic sovereignty, the budget measures also 
included a major restructuring of government through program 
review. Its main objective was to review all categories of federal 
government spending in order to bring about the most effective 
and cost efficient way of delivering programs and services to 
Canadians.
<P>
	The exercise of program review is not simply a way of 
bringing down how much government costs. It also makes 
government more competent and more relevant to the people 
who really need help and support.
<P>
	It is time for government to get back to the basics and to 
reflect the priorities of people. As the Minister of Finance stated 
in his budget address: ``We are acting on the new vision of the 
role of government in the economy and in society. In many cases 
that means smaller government. In all cases, it means smarter 
government''.
<P>
	This government restructuring will have implications on what 
role government will play in the daily lives of people. To a 
certain degree government restructuring also means a 
restructuring of society, and that is where the real opportunity 
lies in the budget. As government gets back to the basics there 
are opportunities for Canadians to step forward, to rethink and 
redefine their values and responsibilities to themselves, their 
families and their communities.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Governments do not have all the answers and solutions. In 
redefining its role in Canadian society, the government will 
need people to step forward and share the burden of 
responsibility. Where governments have failed in the past, 
individual Canadians will have to stand up, play positive roles 
and contribute not only their knowledge but local solutions to 
local problems and also their sweat equity, their sweat, blood, 
and tears, to ensure success.
<P>
	The government is calling on Canadians to participate and to 
be part of a process that is going to set the future straight for 
years and generations to come, to ensure a future for our 
children. This commitment will need to be ongoing even with 
restructuring; government can only go so far.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that in the end active participation is the 
ultimate challenge of the budget. It is a challenge and a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10530"> 10530 </A></B>
<P>
responsibility not only to members of the government and 
members of the House, but to every person in the country.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister stated, the key-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I have given the minister extra time 
already. I am sorry, her time has expired, unless there is 
unanimous consent that she be given more time.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened attentively to my colleague's speech. The problems 
she described in her region sound pretty similar to those in mine, 
except that the solutions she offers are almost unacceptable, and 
I will tell you why.
<P>
	If I understood correctly, she is telling the poor, people with 
major problems, the unemployed, people on UI and income 
security that they must show more imagination and initiative.
<P>
	I also heard the other day one of her colleagues on the other 
side of this House say that a former member of Parliament who 
has been without a job for eight years is having a very hard time 
finding work even though he is well-known. Yet, he is not 
lacking in either imagination or initiative.
<P>
	Whenever the poor-whether it is a single person, a couple or 
a family with a father, mother and four children-are 
unemployed, they are asked to show initiative and imagination. 
Yet, when a person whose salary was much higher has trouble 
finding another job, we commiserate.
<P>
	The budget may also hit seniors next year. In my region, 
farmers face cuts of 15 per cent this year and 15 per cent next 
year for a total of 30 per cent, which represents about $2,500 a 
year for the average farmer. This leads me to ask my colleague if 
we are looking for revenue in the right places or if we simply get 
the money from the pockets of the most disadvantaged and the 
poorest.
<P>
	My colleague did not say that these people were lazy, but she 
said that they should show more imagination and initiative. 
Seventy-five per cent of the time, they are full of imagination 
and initiative, but they are still without jobs. I would like her to 
explain this to me.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell my 
colleague that anything I said certainly was not prejudicial to the 
people who are poor or people in different wage categories. We 
understand we have equality of opportunity. Everyone has the 
opportunity to participate. Everyone has the opportunity of 
freedom of speech, to be mobile, to move, to look for the 
opportunities. Sometimes it is more difficult. I agree that can be 
a problem.
<P>
	When I talked about innovation I was not just talking about 
the consumers of government programs or people looking for 
jobs. I was talking about all sectors of society. It is a process 
where government will participate but sometimes people or 
organizations can do it better so we will defer to them because it 
will be more cost efficient and more effective.
<P>
	As for opportunities for people, we cannot step back and be 
ashamed of the fact that we have managed to create 400,000 
jobs. One hundred thousand of those were directly related to 
government initiatives. Many of those jobs were in Quebec. We 
are not ashamed of that. We are quite happy to recognize that and 
affirm that we have a commitment to continue helping people.
<P>
	It is not just government's responsibility. People want us to 
change the way in which government works so that they will 
have the opportunity to be active participants rather than to have 
a passive role. They are dying for the opportunities. We want to 
make those available to them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the remarks of the Secretary of State for 
Training and Youth she commented quite extensively about 
programs for aboriginal people and the ability of aboriginal 
people to participate in our economy as a result of budgetary 
measures.
<P>
	She mentioned a number of programs but I notice she did not 
mention the aboriginal economic development program, 
something that is absolutely essential to provide assistance to 
aboriginal people who have difficulty in achieving financial 
commitments from existing financial institutions to develop the 
economic means by which to create self-sufficiency within their 
own communities.
<P>
	The aboriginal economic development program, just when it 
is needed most, has received a more than unfair reduction in 
commitment from the federal government, a reduction of 
approximately 30 per cent as I understand it.
<P>
	I wonder if the secretary of state could comment on the need 
for the aboriginal business development program and what her 
thoughts are about this unfair cut or reduction in federal 
commitment to that program.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not speaking just 
to aboriginal issues. I was speaking to those within the 
department that I work in. I was not speaking to the ones in the 
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs or Industry. I am not 
ashamed to speak to those issues. I am not afraid and I am not 
reluctant. I just did not mention it.
<P>
	There was a 25 per cent cut. Part of the effort in the program 
review and looking at the way we deliver services to people is to 
make these programs more efficient, more effective, more 
directly related to delivering services to the individuals, to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10531"> 10531 </A></B>
<P>
people they serve rather than developing an administrative 
bureaucracy which would tend to serve the industry itself rather 
than its clients.
<P>
	Yes, we have made cuts. I just finished saying in my speech 
that every Canadian is going to share the responsibility in this 
exercise. I know. I am no stranger to the poverty of those people. 
Those are my people. I understand that.
<P>
	Every Canadian is going to share the responsibility. Let us 
weigh things fairly. The Department of Indian and Northern 
Affairs which serves aboriginal people was the only department 
that has an $8 billion budget that is going to have an increase of I 
believe 6 per cent when all other departments were cut.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	I acknowledge that there have been cuts to some aboriginal 
programs but there have been cuts to almost every program and 
service across the board in every department and crown 
corporation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
share my time with my Bloc colleague, the hon. member for 
Matapédia-Matane.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance tabled his budget on Monday, 
February 27. I rise today in this House to state my position, my 
concerns and my disappointment in reading this budget. I will 
also share with you my personal analysis of the negative impact 
this budget will have on the participation rate of Quebecers in 
the Department of National Defence. While this budget is well 
received by the business community in general, and foreign 
investors in particular, the fact remains that once again low and 
middle income taxpayers are the hardest hit.
<P>
	The government wants us to believe that Canadians from 
every walk of life, including the wealthiest, are affected by its 
budget cuts, but there is a world of difference between the 
finance minister's claims and actual fact. The fact of the matter 
is that the wealthy have until 1999 to convert their family trusts, 
to shield them from the minister's cuts and not pay any tax on 
their accumulated and future wealth. Also, the Liberal budget 
completely ignores the recommendations made by the Auditor 
General of Canada in his last report which made reference to 
$6.6 billion in unpaid taxes. The federal government does not 
propose anything to recover that money.
<P>
	How can the government pass up so much money without 
immediately taking the necessary measures? Is $6.6 billion not 
enough money to spur it to take concrete and effective action?
<P>
	Let me give you another example which illustrates the 
inconsistency of the budget and fiscal strategy announced at the 
end of February by the minister, and which shows that the 
minister's goal of tax fairness is merely an illusion. This 
example is also taken from the Auditor General's report: In 
Revenue Canada's opinion, 470 accounts of over $100,000 each, 
representing a total of $350 million, were at the collection letter 
stage, which  means that no collection officer was involved, 
except in terms of reviewing the risk of loss.
<P>
	By not taking action in this specific case, the Liberal 
government is sending the message that it is easier to get the 
money from low and middle income taxpayers, than from 
corporations or wealthy individuals who do not pay their fair 
share. This system is supposed to be fair, but who profits from 
it?
<P>
	In my opinion, the 1995-1996 budget plan includes other 
examples of unfairness. Take a look at the summary of the Main 
Estimates, by department and agencies. Two thirds of the 
departments and agencies will see their budget reduced, while 
the other third will be getting more money.
<P>
	Who will get an increase in 1995-96? The Senate, with a total 
budget of more than $42 million; the Governor General, with a 
budget of over $10 million; the Department of Indian Affairs, 
with an increase of $327 million; Treasury Board, an increase of 
$32 million; Finance, an increase of more than $9 billion, $9 
billion to service the debt; the Privy Council, which is 
responsible for defending the ``no'' side in the Quebec 
referendum, will have an increase of nearly $5 million; and the 
list goes on.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	And even worse, the federal government's total estimates will 
increase by more than $3.7 billion, which will bring total 
spending up to $164.8 billion. Incredible. With a deficit of $37.4 
billion for 1994-95 and a projected deficit of more than $32.7 
billion for 1995-96, we are sinking deeper and deeper into the 
hole.
<P>
	By the end of the current fiscal year, the net federal debt will 
be $578.8 billion. Incredible. The federal government's present 
financial situation is a reflection of what the future has in store. 
Furthermore, the budget brought down by the Minister of 
Finance contains no prospects for jobs in the short and medium 
term. Where are the jobs we were promised in the Liberal red 
book? Ask the federal public servants who believed those 
promises.
<P>
	The steps taken by the federal government to put this budget 
together fall far short of the expectations of taxpayers in Quebec 
and Canada. These measures are an outright breach of our social 
contract.
<P>
	Now for a few words about the Department of National 
Defence. The budget announced cuts totalling $1.6 billion over 
three years. The Bloc Quebecois, in the minority report of the 
Special Joint Committee on Canada's Defence Policy, insisted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10532"> 10532 </A></B>
<P>
on additional cuts of 15 per cent, which would put the National 
Defence budget at $10 billion as of the first year.
<P>
	I question the federal government's strategy, since additional 
cuts could have been made in certain budget items in the 
Department of National Defence, including capital 
expenditures, materiel and new equipment purchasing policy, 
the armed forces organization and, finally, program 
management.
<P>
	For the same three year period, the Bloc Quebecois proposed 
cuts of $4.8 billion-three times the government's figure. 
Unfortunately, the federal government preferred to slash 
transfer payments to the provinces and cut the federal public 
service this year.
<P>
	In this regard, I would like to recall the commitment the 
Liberal Party of Canada made in its famous red book, which it 
did not keep. It said that, once in power, it would set up a defence 
conversion program that would have attractive spinoffs for 
private enterprise. This was their promise.
<P>
	What did the budget say about defence industry conversion? 
Not one word-nothing. For the past 15 years, the federal 
government and the Department of National Defence have failed 
in their role of equitable allocators of military expenditures for 
Quebec.
<P>
	In a study for the École nationale d'administration publique, 
made public in February, the author revealed a shortfall of $650 
million a year for Quebec.
<P>
	The situation is very clear. Unfair treatment in the allocation 
of military expenditures has had disastrous consequences for a 
number of areas of economic activity in Quebec. Although 
Quebec contributes 25.4 per cent of the budget for national 
defence, it gets back a meagre 17 per cent in military spending. 
It has been the same old story for the last 15 years. This very 
unfavourable distribution continues to cost Quebec jobs and 
investment dollars.
<P>
	Quebec is even worse off when it comes to the funds that the 
Department of National Defence allocates for research and 
development.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In 1990-91, Quebec received only 12.45 per cent of this 
spending-12.45 compared with the 73 per cent that went to 
Ontario. The situation has not changed since then. In addition, 
francophones have great difficulty rising through the ranks of 
the Canadian armed forces. While francophones occupy 
between 22 and 29 per cent of the lower-ranking positions, they 
occupy only 10 to 13 per cent of the higher ranks, according to 
the latest statistics. It is not difficult for francophones to enlist 
in the forces, but it is very difficult for them to become generals. 
It always has been and still is.
<P>
	In 1994, the Minister of National Defence took away the 
country's only French-language military college, the military 
college in Saint-Jean. What a decision! Once again, the federal 
Minister of Finance is asking Quebec to do its share in his 
budget. The government is closing the military base at 
Saint-Hubert. Over 600 people will lose their jobs. It is cutting 
another 285 jobs on the Bagotville  base. Before the cuts, less 
than 15 per cent of all federal military facilities were located in 
Quebec. What is left? Not much.
<P>
	What should we tell taxpayers in Quebec who feel that the 
federal government costs them too much money for the return 
they get on their investment? If Quebec were to patriate the 
power to tax and to spend-about $30 billion is in question 
here-we would be able to set up a system which really is fair 
and we would make our own decisions. That is how Quebec will 
best be able to develop and grow.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks. They were 
spoken with such passion they left me almost breathless.
<P>
	I would like to put a question to my colleague which will take 
him a little beyond his remarks. It is probably well known to him 
as it is to many members in this House that I have an interest in 
special interest groups.
<P>
	The budget did introduce for the first time the concept that 
new guidelines would be brought in for the funding of these 
special interest groups which receive direct grants from 
government with very little accountability for what are often 
advocacy groups.
<P>
	Does he feel this is an area of reform for the government 
applicable to Quebec? Should groups which have these special 
agendas see their funding cut as we hope to see elsewhere in the 
country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my 
colleague for his question. All I can say is that if we look at the 
budget as a whole, the federal government faced a $37 billion or 
$38 billion deficit last year, compared with a $33 billion deficit 
forecast for this year. The government is saving money on the 
backs of the provinces. Since the provinces will have less 
money, they will have to cut spending for post-secondary 
education, health care and other services under provincial 
jurisdiction. That, in my opinion, is tragic.
<P>
	I would also like to go back to the closure of the military 
college in Saint-Jean. I think that this is an appalling decision. It 
is appalling for Canada, because Canada has always maintained 
that it is a bilingual country and tried to give that impression. 
However, by closing the military college in Saint-Jean-as we 
can see, enrolment is already way down, a drop of 40 to 60 per 
cent this year-the government is simply telling us that, at the 
end of the day, bilingualism is not important.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on February 27, the Minister of Finance tabled his budget in this 
House. This event extensively covered by the media was 
preceded by a fear-mongering effort to scare the public. They 
said the budget would hurt all taxpayers, but they did not tell us 
the most important part.
<P>
	And that is that the creditors to whom the Canadian debt is 
owed wanted to make sure Canada would be able to pay the 
interest on its debt in the years to come. That is what the problem 
was. It was also most important to let it be known that the federal 
government was waiting until after the Quebec referendum to 
make major cuts, once again deceiving the people.
<P>
	When I was first elected to this place by the residents of the 
riding of Matapédia-Matane, I was sure I was coming here to 
serve the interests of my region and that is what I have been 
doing ever since: serving the interests of my fellow citizens. But 
since February 27, I have had to admit that it is not really the 
hon. members and ministers opposite who run the country, but 
rather big financial players.
<P>
	What are the ministers and members across the way doing 
here if they let their Minister of Finance table a budget like this 
without saying a word? I must admit that certain members did 
stand up and denounce this budget and I am proud of them. I only 
wish others would follow suit.
<P>
	What power do these members and ministers have in this 
House? I hope they are not mere puppets. When the creditors of 
a country tell its finance minister what to do, it means that the 
country has lost its monetary and financial independence.
<P>
	Who has led us into that tunnel? None other than the Prime 
Minister, when he was the Minister of Finance. The process 
started with him. That farce shows a serious lack of respect for 
Canadian taxpayers, particularly those from Quebec, for whom 
the big cuts will come after the referendum.
<P>
	Why not tell the people the truth? Why not tell them now what 
they are in for? Stop hiding your despicable and partisan goals. 
The Minister of Finance's action lacks any consistency and is a 
monumental hoax. I can tell the minister that Quebecers will 
remember him and his party on referendum day. My constituents 
in the riding of Matapédia-Matane will not be fooled.
<P>
	The federal budget will hit them very hard. Let me give you a 
few examples. There will be cuts at the Maurice Lamontagne 
Institute, in Sainte-Flavie, in the Supply and Services division 
in Matane, and in the offices of the Department of Human 
Resources Development; fishermen will be hurt by the service 
charge in fishing ports and harbours; cuts will also affect 
farmers and milk producers; finally, there will be a gas tax 
increase, in a region where gas is already more expensive than 
elsewhere. Last year, Rimouski residents blocked a road  in an 
attempt to have the price of gas go down. It did go down one 
cent, but now it is going up one and a half cents.
<P>
	Since the budget was tabled, the only ones to speak in favour 
of the government's strategy were the creditors, and even they 
had mixed feelings about it.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	A few days later, we were again faced with rising interest rates 
and a falling dollar on financial markets, a quick response to the 
minister's budget.
<P>
	Blaming Quebec for this country's financial situation shows 
an unprecedented lack of logic. If Quebec were to blame, would 
members opposite not tell us to become sovereign as fast as 
possible?
<P>
	The impact of this budget will be shocking, and pretty soon 
the minister will tell this House he can no longer control the 
deficit or stop the growth of the debt.
<P>
	In the days following the budget, we saw that Canada's 
provinces, including Quebec, rejected the minister's vision, and 
today, everyone openly condemns that vision, especially 
Ontario.
<P>
	And now for a closer look at the disastrous impact this budget 
will have, starting with the catastrophic impact the spiralling 
federal debt will have on job creation and corporate investment.
<P>
	For people who do not have a job and those who will be 
affected by unemployment insurance cuts, the future is very 
bleak. Because of the poor economic climate, consumers will 
spend less, and businesses will postpone investment projects 
because of the high cost of borrowing.
<P>
	It is clear that this government, which promised hundreds of 
thousands of jobs, has missed its target by a mile. It misled 
everyone. I would say it practically lied to the entire population. 
It has turned its back on its commitments.
<P>
	In addition to letting the debt grow at an alarming 
rate-everyone is saying it will reach $603 billion in 1996-the 
government has just cut 45,000 jobs in the Canadian public 
service. This government is now producing unemployment 
instead of encouraging job creation. How many of these 
government employees will join the ranks of the unemployed? 
And there are hundreds of indirect jobs that will disappear in the 
process.
<P>
	In the outlying regions, these job losses will have a disastrous 
impact on an economy already weakened by a recession that is 
still smouldering.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10534"> 10534 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has just created a feeling of uncertainly, 
which will have very serious repercussions on the performance 
of the public service as a whole and on other related areas of 
activity.
<P>
	There is nothing in this budget for the 800,000 unemployed 
and people looking for work in Quebec. On the contrary. 
Fortunately, the Government of Quebec knows how to create 
jobs.
<P>
	The only good federal program is the infrastructure program, 
and it is being cut by $200 million.
<P>
	We are all aware that Canada's debt has mortgaged the 
country's future. Quebecers have made this point repeatedly. At 
the hearings on the future of Quebec, everyone where I come 
from fears the worst, because it is clear that the ship is leaking 
and the captain has abandoned his duties. The people of Quebec 
will give a clear response to this government in the upcoming 
referendum, and neither fear nor threats will change the course 
of history. After the victory of the ``yes'' votes, the other 
provinces will have to decide what sort of country they want. I 
am sure that others will want to follow the road the people of 
Quebec are preparing to take.
<P>
	In concluding, I would say: Long live Canada without 
Quebec, and long live Quebec without Canada.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It seems that I must split the time. 
First, the hon. member for Durham.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to my colleague's comments. Every time we get 
into this debate somehow Quebec seems to be a very interesting 
place with no debt problems but a simple examination of its 
financial record indicates quite the reverse. I believe the 
province of Quebec's deficit is currently about $70 billion. This 
was done in Quebec by Quebecers. It continues to expand and if 
my memory serves me correctly, it is probably expanding a lot 
faster than the federal government's deficit.
<P>
	While the leader of the Government of Quebec is out talking 
about sovereignty, he is not dealing with the very problems of 
his own province. It costs $5 million for a sovereignty debate 
that nobody wants. This is irresponsible. I do not believe the 
people of Quebec are going to be happy with this expenditure or 
with the continual pushing of Quebec into a deficit situation.
<P>
	Bonds are a big financer of government debt. Quebec 
government rated bonds continue to escalate their interest costs. 
Why? Because people have many misgivings about where this is 
going.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about job creation. Job creation and 
job losses are an absolute. They must be netted together. Sure, 
there will be job losses in the civil service. Everybody in 
Canada, including Quebecers, have said how necessary it is that 
governments downsize and become more efficient.
<P>
	I have heard my colleagues from the Bloc say those very 
things. Stop duplication. When the government stops 
duplication they say: ``You should not lay these people off''. 
The reality is that 433,000 new jobs were created in Canada last 
year, net job creation. That is positive and it includes Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, $78 billion of the federal government debt is held by 
Quebecers. They believe in Canada, but what is their future with 
this crazy concept they have? How are they going to get 
reimbursed in this strange emulation of a new country? There is 
$78 billion that Quebecers hold in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to have the hon. member answer those questions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question. You talk about duplication. I want to 
know what duplication has been eliminated over the past few 
years. None.
<P>
	Another point. I agree that Quebec has a high debt. However, 
for years and years, decades and decades, the federal 
government has been transferring money to Ontario and to other 
provinces for research and development, while the money it has 
been transferring to Quebec has been in the form of 
unemployment insurance benefits. One thing is sure: when one 
region is without work while research funds are sent to another, 
there is something wrong.
<P>
	Regarding sovereignty, I want to say that even though our 
debt is high, we can handle it, and that we are prepared to pay 
part of Canada's debt, because we are part of it and we have a 
moral obligation to do so. If I were on the other side of the 
House, a government member from Ontario, the maritimes or 
the west, do you know what I would say to the Bloc? I would say: 
``If you want to leave, go''.
<P>
	Why try holding us back? Why tire yourselves out in the 
effort? We are convinced, I am convinced that we are able to 
manage our debt intelligently and at the same time help to pay 
off yours.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Then what more do you want? I, myself, have never 
understood why the rest of Canada is saying: ``Why not you stay 
with us. This is terrible. It is going to cost you''. We are going to 
spend a few million dollars on the referendum. But how much 
are you going to spend? I rephrase my question. If we are so poor 
and have so many problems, why are you so desperate to keep us 
in the federation?

<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform 
the House that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member 
for Davenport.
<P>
	Many Canadians are concerned with Canada's future 
prosperity and with maintaining our quality of life. The finance 
minister's February 27 budget is a key element in maintaining 
prosperity and Canada's way of life.
<P>
	The budget is a plan that will bring this country into the 21st 
century. It demonstrates our commitment to reshaping 
government to meet the needs of Canadians and to deliver on our 
promise to get our fiscal house in order. It supports our primary 
economic objective to sustain growth and job creation by cutting 
our deficit. It demonstrates our commitment to fiscally 
responsible government.
<P>
	I will not make any bones about it; I believe that the budget is 
tough, very tough, but fair. The budget is tough but fair both in 
what it does but also in what it does not do.
<P>
	Like many members of Parliament, I took advantage of the 
finance minister's opening up of the budget process. The 
government held the widest and most open prebudget 
consultations ever held. To ensure that my constituents had their 
say, I held two prebudget meetings in my riding of 
Essex-Windsor. The actions of the finance minister proved that 
this was not a cynical exercise. My constituents and many 
Canadians asked the finance minister to tackle the deficit in real 
terms. That is what this budget does.
<P>
	This government is the first government in years to set deficit 
reduction targets and to meet those targets. Let me reassure the 
House that the deficit will be brought under control and our 
deficit targets will be met. The government has shown that it has 
the resolve and commitment to Canada's long term future to do 
what is necessary to meet our targets.
<P>
	By 1996-97 Canada's deficit will be at 3 per cent of gross 
domestic product. That is $24.3 billion. If the economy keeps 
growing, and it will, this figure may be even lower. The bottom 
line is close to a cut of $7 in spending for every dollar for new 
revenues over the next three years.
<P>
	To ensure fairness, both business and individuals are being 
asked to share the load. Recognizing that individuals' income 
taxes have increased over the last decade at a much faster rate 
than corporate taxes, the budget includes measures to address 
that inequity.
<P>
	The large corporation tax rate will rise from .2 per cent to .225 
per cent, an increase of 12.5 per cent. The corporate surtax, 
which is currently 3 per cent of the basic corporate tax rate, will 
increase to 4 per cent. There will also be changes made to 
strengthen Revenue Canada's ability to enforce the law and 
ensure that all Canadians pay their fair share of taxes and to 
reduce  unfair competition for businesses that do play above 
board, that play by the rules.
<P>
	Banks and trust companies are also being asked to contribute 
further toward deficit reduction during the next year and a half. 
They will contribute $100 million through a special tax on 
deposit taking institutions.
<P>
	Big business has often stated that it does not need or want the 
level of assistance it receives from the federal government. 
Accordingly, the government has listened and taken these 
claims at their word. We will reduce spending on subsidies for 
big business by close to 60 per cent over the next three years.
<P>
	However, the government, unlike the last one, realizes that a 
successful tackling of the deficit requires a two track approach, 
as was advocated in our red book. To eliminate the deficit, the 
government must also create a climate that creates jobs.
<P>
	This budget recognizes that small and medium sized 
businesses are the cornerstone of Canada's economy. They are 
the number one job creator. To further help small business we 
intend to work with Canada's banks and trust companies to 
establish clear rules so that small business loans are easier to 
get.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	In my prebudget consultations many of my constituents 
recommended Canada re-examine our commitment to foreign 
aid in view of needs in Canada. The government has done this 
and will reduce foreign aid by 20 per cent over the next three 
years for savings of over $500 million.
<P>
	Many of my constituents also questioned the need for so many 
agencies, boards and commissions. As a result of the 
government-wide review of these government bodies, decisions 
have been made affecting 120 of them: 73 of these will be 
closed, 47 will be streamlined and restructured. The result will 
be 665 fewer government in council positions, fewer ministerial 
appointments and savings of $10 million a year.
<P>
	In my prebudget consultations my constituents had many 
suggestions on what action the government should not take. Do 
not eliminate RRSPs, they said, and we did not. Do not increase 
personal income taxes. We did not. Do not introduce a health or 
dental tax benefit. We did not. Do not eliminate capital gains 
exemptions for farmers and small businesses. We did not. Do 
not introduce a tax on casino winnings. We did not.
<P>
	I have said that this budget is tough but fair. Many of the 
reviews have also been tough but fair. A Windsor <I>Star</I>, editorial 
of February 28 stated: ``What we can applaud in the budget is the 
vow to create a smaller and smarter government. The 14 per cent 
reduction in the civil service over the next three years combined 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10536"> 10536 </A></B>
<P>
with the $10 billion in cuts to departments will result in a 
fundamental reshaping of government''.
<P>
	The Windsor <I>Star</I> also reported that Windsor's business 
community was encouraged, shocked even, by the wide swing of 
the minister's budget axe.
<P>
	The Windsor Chamber of Commerce chair, Othmar Stein, was 
quoted in the <I>Star</I> as saying of the finance minister: ``He's got 
the message. A lot of this was overdue. A lot of the subsidies are 
gone, even for business''.
<P>
	Mr. Stein, a vice-president of Chrysler, concluded: ``Overall 
I'd say it's a very realistic budget, quite positive. It's one of the 
first budgets in a number of years that has not been smoke and 
mirrors.''
<P>
	Aron Gampel of the Bank of Nova Scotia says it is a strong 
fiscal statement that meets all the tests.
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reversed its editorial stance regarding 
Canada, summed up in its headline several weeks before the 
budget as ``Bankrupt Canada''. After the budget it proclaimed 
Canada made a right turn.
<P>
	The editorial commends the finance minister for showing the 
determination needed for Canada to claw its way out of the debt 
hole which decades of spendthrift policies landed it in.
<P>
	The budget charts a new course for agriculture. In agriculture 
the government has set a target to achieve by the turn of the 
century, annual food exports valued at over $20 billion. This is 
an increase of at least one-third over our record setting 
performance in 1994.
<P>
	To do this the government will be introducing a new export 
credits guarantee program to support grain and other agri-food 
export sales up to a value of $1 billion.
<P>
	Consistent with the red book, the government will implement 
a Canadian agri-food marketing council and Canadian 
agri-food marketing service to ensure enhanced market 
development and effective use of the global information 
highway.
<P>
	Our first fiscal year was not all doom and gloom. The 
Canadian economy is stronger than it has been in years. Real 
economic output grew at about 4.5 per cent in 1994, the fastest 
of the G-7. Over 433,000 jobs were created in the past year, 
almost all of them full time.
<P>
	The unemployment rate has fallen by 1.7 percentage points 
nationally. Manufacturing output is up over 9 percent in the past 
year. Improved cost performance has lead to record breaking 
exports, a growing trade surplus and a dramatic improvement in 
the current account.
<P>
	I assure my constituents the budget belongs to a Liberal 
government. A Liberal government brought in new and 
innovative programs in the sixties and seventies to meet the 
challenges and needs of those decades. The government is 
adapting all programs to meet the needs and challenges of the 
nineties and the 21st century.
<P>
	We understand change. We have always been at the forefront 
of change. The budget is change. The Liberal Party has been 
traditionally a pace setter. I know the budget sets the pace for the 
21st century.
<P>
	I will end with a comment one of my constituents sent me 
during the prebudget process. With reference to the difficult 
choices facing the Minister of Finance, he wished him resolve: 
``My two young children will thank you, as you will be 
remembered as the finance minister who saved Canada from 
bankruptcy''.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate. 
Canadians know very well that we have inherited an economic 
mess from the Conservatives and that steps must be taken to 
reduce the deficit and the debt. On that we all agree.
<P>
	The major preoccupation of this budget is to appease the 
marketplace, in particular rating agencies. Having done so this 
year one may expect Wall Street to demand more measures of 
the same kind in future budgets.
<P>
	To deal with this the Prime Minister is taking the issue of 
currency speculators and their impact on national economies to 
the next meeting in June of the G-7 nations, a very timely 
initiative for which he is to be congratulated.
<P>
	There are a few positive measures in the budget for which the 
Minister of Finance is to be congratulated. For instance, from 
the perspective of sustainable development one could highlight 
his decision to remove the 20 per cent limit of a donor's income 
when donations qualify as ecologically sensitive land. There is a 
commitment in the budget to study barriers or disincentives in 
the use of recycled materials over virgin materials.
<P>
	There is a promise to examine the tax system in search of 
disincentives to energy efficiency and renewable forms of 
energy. Subsidies were cut in the energy sector that encouraged 
uneconomic and unsustainable supply development. Much more 
needs to be done if we are serious about reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.
<P>
	This brings me to the end of the list of good news and back to 
the question of how to reduce the national debt and the deficit. It 
is a necessity on which we all agree.
<P>
	In the weeks and months preceding the budget several 
presentations were made repeatedly that social spending is not 
the cause of our economic ills and that our deficit problem, 
rather than through cuts in expenditures, ought to be resolved 
through increases in revenue by way of closing tax loopholes. 
Billions of dollars a year are forgone in revenue because of 
existing tax loopholes, including items such as lottery winnings, 
business meals and entertainment expenses and other existing 
items well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10537"> 10537 </A></B>
<P>
identified in a report by the Department of Finance dated 
January 1994.
<P>
	To his credit, the Minister of Finance closed a couple of 
loopholes but the tax system remains unprogressive as a result 
of nine years of Conservative government, Conservative budget 
making.
<P>
	It is time for a thorough review of our tax system as it stands 
now. This review is made even more urgent and necessary and 
relevant by the fact that the social envelope as announced in the 
budget is being reduced by $7 billion. Had more tax loopholes 
been closed, had the tax system been put under the microscope 
to the same extent that the social security system has been, it 
would have not been necessary to reduce the social envelope. 
We would have funds available to diminish the necessity of 
cutting expenditures. We would have funds for the creation of 
employment programs for youth desperately waiting for job 
opportunities which are now not materializing despite our 
vigorous economic growth.
<P>
	In other words, closing tax loopholes would provide the 
government with badly needed revenues to combat 
unemployment and to apply less severe cuts. Time does not 
permit to comment on the many cuts and I will therefore 
comment only on a couple which are particularly painful.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	One reduces the social housing budget by $270 million at a 
time when in Toronto alone an applicant has to wait over four 
years.
<P>
	Why reduce the protection of our natural resources by one 
third, the estimates of the environment department, and allocate 
to the department of defence almost 20 times as much, $9 
billion? What is more important?
<P>
	Why reduce international aid at a time when health and 
development projects are so badly needed for the stability of 
nations most in need?
<P>
	How can we implement our red book commitment to 
sustainable development with a 70 per cent cut in the federal 
allocation to the Canadian environment industry, while leaving 
the nuclear industry unscathed from any budget cuts?
<P>
	How can we maintain and strengthen the Canadian identity 
when the budget of the Canada Council is cut in half? How can 
we promote and sustain artistic talents without the support of the 
federal government?
<P>
	In a way it is too late to talk about the budget, but not too soon 
to talk about the next one. For 1996 we will keep on working so 
the budget will have a different orientation, an orientation to the 
promises made in the red book, an orientation to deal with 
unemployment, the protection of the weaker in society and the 
social needs of Canadians.
<P>
	Over the years Canadians have turned to the Liberals at 
election time because they trust us as the party that knows how 
to strengthen and intertwine social and economic policies. This 
principle is as valid today as it will be 20, 40 or 60 years from 
now. Hopefully the budget will have the desired effect and we 
Liberals will be able to turn our attention to the other half of the 
equation, developing strong social and job creation initiatives 
and policies in the second half of our mandate for the benefit of 
the total Canadian society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish I 
could say at the beginning that it is pleasure for me to speak on 
the budget. I cannot do that. My feeling is one of great 
disappointment. The government is still not facing the reality or 
the severity of the problem Canada is in today.
<P>
	The budget has given us minor cuts when major cuts are 
needed. It did include some hidden taxes where no tax increases 
were justified.
<P>
	We owe a debt of thanks to the thousands of citizens who 
wrote in and attended tax alerts to send the very strong message 
to the government that there was no room for tax increases and 
that the books had to be balanced and that balance had to be 
brought about by cuts or reductions in spending with no new or 
increased taxes. We did achieve that to some degree. However, 
there were some hidden taxes in the budget.
<P>
	This was a two stage budget. I will review the first budget and 
this budget. In the first budget it was interesting that the 
government said: ``Canada has a problem. It is not too serious. 
Do not get too excited about it. Take an aspirin and when you get 
up in the morning you will feel fine. Do not feel bad. Be happy''. 
It introduced a budget that actually aggravated Canada's 
condition because our debt over the year of that budget grew 
from $490 billion to $550 billion. Canada is in much more 
serious difficulty.
<P>
	We even thought in that first budget we could buy our way to 
prosperity. It included the $6 billion infrastructure program.
<P>
	Canada's problem has worsened. With the second budget the 
diagnosis is that Canada is gravely ill. We do have a very serious 
problem with the deficit and the debt and it must be attacked. 
However, the cure is $650 billion of debt, still overspending by 
$25 billion and $50 billion in interest payments. I hardly call 
this progress. I hardly call this a cure. Canada is going further 
and further into the hole.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The government has diagnosed that it understands the gravity 
of the situation. The government has moved over to our position. 
It has agreed that Canada is gravely ill. The only thing we 
disagree on now is the treatment to cure our problem. The 
deficit, if we agree, is life threatening. Then why if it is life 
threatening to our country would we vote for, or go for a slow, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10538"> 10538 </A></B>
<P>
hopeful,  drawn out recovery; we hope we will get the books in 
balance.
<P>
	Suppose someone were in a life threatening situation and the 
doctor said: ``We can give you pills for the next five years and 
you might recover but the alternative is major surgery and you 
can be restored to health very quickly and get on with the healing 
process''. Why would he take a chance?
<P>
	Why would we gamble our future on the uncertainties of the 
marketplace, of interest rates? We do not seem to have anything 
in this budget to prepare for the eventual downturn in the 
economy that will come. It is not a question of if it is going to 
come, it is going to come. It is a question of when it is going to 
come.
<P>
	There are some dark clouds on the horizon. Even south of the 
border, the situation in the United States could deteriorate and it 
would have a grave effect on the economy right here in Canada. 
We know that and we are not preparing for that in this budget. 
Time is running out. We do not have unlimited time. 
Unfortunately, that message is not getting through and has not 
been reflected by the government.
<P>
	I was interested in the remarks of the Secretary of State for 
Training and Youth. She spoke about the New Zealand 
experience, how New Zealand realized the magnitude of its 
problem and did something about it. New Zealand's debt was at 
50 per cent of its GDP when it realized its problem. Ours is 
currently about 70 or 71 per cent of GDP and we still are not 
facing the realities and doing the major surgery which needs to 
be done.
<P>
	The claim in the first budget was that the government did not 
have enough time, that it had just taken over. The present 
government had been in opposition for eight years. What was 
happening in those eight years? What was happening in those 
eight years is that those members were adding to the problem in 
opposing any attempts to bring the deficit and the debt under 
control. I very well recall the UI debate when there was an 
attempt to reduce costs. The protest came from the other side at 
the attempt to reduce spending.
<P>
	Here we have a budget. We had no plan to get us to zero or to 
balance the books in the first budget. We still do not have a plan 
with this budget. There is no fixed date to arrive at what we must 
arrive at, which is a balanced budget.
<P>
	We have lost our credibility with the markets in this budget 
because we did not do anything about the MP pension plan. We 
had to do something to restore our credibility because it is low. 
That would have said very loudly and very clearly to the markets 
and to the Canadian people that yes, the government is serious 
about the problem and it is showing leadership by example. It 
failed to do that. Canadians did not miss that message, nor in 
fact did our lenders. Our lenders have spotted the fact that we 
were not serious about the problem we face.
<P>
	There are three ways to get the books in balance. We can raise 
taxes. We can hope for growth in the economy. Or we can cut 
spending.
<P>
	Raising taxes, I would suggest, is no longer an option. The 
Canadian people have revolted and said that they are taxed to the 
limit. Raising taxes at this point becomes counterproductive 
because it fuels the underground economy that is there and is 
growing.
<P>
	We can hope for growth in the economy, but we do not control 
that. That has been the problem for the last 25 years. We 
projected growth in the economy and at the end of the year it was 
said: ``Oh gee, it is too bad it was not there. We are deeper in 
debt''. We do not control that.
<P>
	The one thing we do control, the one thing we can do to get our 
books in balance is to cut spending. We have absolute control 
there and it is where we should be targeting our efforts. This 
budget does not do that. It makes some scrapes when indeed it 
should be making cuts in spending.
<P>
	We have had 20 years of raising taxes. Those 20 years of 
raising taxes have achieved the exact opposite. The deficit has 
grown and the debt has grown. There is absolutely no 
justification for any tax increase. It does exactly the opposite to 
what it is hoped to achieve. It is a job killer. It kills the economy.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	That there can be no pain is not reality. When we have lived 
for so many years beyond our means, there has to be some pain. 
We cannot escape that. The Canadian people understand and are 
ready for that. The problem is many in this place do not 
understand that but the Canadian people are ready for it.
<P>
	We just have to look at the results of the surveys done since 
the budget came out. The Canadian people supported the move 
the government made but said they were looking for more. 
Those same surveys said there should be more cuts and those 
cuts should be made now because time is running out. We do not 
have unlimited time.
<P>
	The tough action we have been taking on the east coast with 
the fishing problem is interesting. Overfishing is just like 
overspending. Fish are limited and dollars are limited. There is a 
bottom to the barrel. We are getting tough on fishing but we have 
not yet got the message on spending. We still think we can keep 
on spending. We can kill an industry or we can kill a country. We 
can kill an industry by overfishing; we can kill a country by 
overspending.
<P>
	Moody's fired a shot across our bow and we missed the 
message. It fired a shot across our bow just as we did to that 
Spanish fishing vessel. The message Moody's shot across our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10539"> 10539 </A></B>
<P>
bow was that 3 per cent of GDP is too low a target and there is no 
plan to get to zero. The budget has failed on both counts.
<P>
	For anybody on the other side to assume that the markets have 
bought this budget, the verdict is not yet in. Moody's has not 
changed its position. The verdict is still pending on whether the 
budget was successful in convincing the money markets that 
Canada is a good place to invest.
<P>
	We shoot the messenger who is giving us good advice: ``You 
are in trouble. Get your books in balance or we are not going to 
buy your bonds''. As I say, we are still waiting for the 
background on that.
<P>
	There was nothing in this budget for small business. My 
background is in small business. That 1.5 cent increase in 
gasoline tax is to raise $500 million a year.
<P>
	In my riding a number of people commute to Toronto. They 
will have $250 per year in additional costs just to drive to their 
business. It is also going to increase the cost of doing business 
for example for those who use gas in delivery services.
<P>
	It is going to take about $3 million out of the economy of my 
riding. There goes the new stove, the education and the new car. 
It really was not necessary and it is not productive to creating the 
employment we need. There was no justification for any tax 
increase.
<P>
	We are indeed living in the greatest country in the world, but 
we are doing it on borrowed dollars and time is running out.
<P>
	I see we are making an attempt to get Canadians to invest in 
Canada by buying bonds and keeping the money in Canada. The 
answer to getting Canadians to invest in this country is for the 
government to show some responsibility that it understands the 
magnitude of the problem and it is going to cut its spending. 
Canadians will then stop sending their money out of the country 
and will spend and invest it right here.
<P>
	Canada is in a battle for its survival, make no mistake about it. 
I visited Dieppe just a year ago. It was a very moving experience 
to see the men who had the courage to go over there and give 
their lives. I am suggesting that it is going to take courage right 
now to tackle the very serious problem of overspending.
<P>
	I hear words about compassion, generosity and fairness. What 
about responsibility, accountability and fairness to the 
taxpayers who have been carrying the burden all these years? 
The Canadian taxpayers are demanding some responsibility, 
accountability and fairness. We owe it to them and we owe it to 
future generations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
found it interesting that the member would spend so much time 
during his speech defending the Brian Mulroney government 
saying that somehow the Liberal Party frustrated the prior 
government for nine years. He is nodding his head now, but I 
should remind him that the government of Brian Mulroney, 
which was turfed out, had a majority in both terms and had full 
control of  its actions. We cannot pass on that blame. The 
member is just making rhetoric. In fact the prior Conservative 
government got exactly what it deserved.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	I listened with interest to the medical analogy the member 
used when he talked about cuts, that we have only had scrapes 
and not deep cuts. The member tried to somehow imply there 
was a tax increase in this budget when he well knows there were 
$7 of cuts for every $1 of increased revenue and there were no 
increases in personal income tax. It was pure fabrication.
<P>
	I want to ask the member a question with regard to his strategy 
and the response that his own leader gave to this House. His 
leader stood in this House and attacked the government for cuts 
to social programs. Yet this member is saying that we should 
have more cuts than what has been proposed by our government. 
How does this member square his position with the position of 
his own leader?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to respond to the questions from the hon. member.
<P>
	I will deal first with the fact that the Liberals spent eight years 
in opposition and they could not do anything about the fact that 
the debt and deficit were increasing. I suggest to the member 
that they did nothing but encourage the deficit and debt to 
increase. They did not understand the magnitude of the problem 
then; they do not understand the magnitude of the problem now. 
Nothing has changed.
<P>
	The Conservative government was turfed out for not 
listening. I would suggest that three years down the road this 
government will be turfed out because it is still not listening to 
the Canadian people.
<P>
	Cuts of $7 for every $1 in increased revenue. There is no 
justification for any revenue increase. There is more than 
enough to balance the books in cuts. When there has been 
overspending for 20 years we cannot keep saying that we need 
more dollars, but a strong case can be made for saying: ``Yes, we 
have been going into your pockets deeper and deeper; we are 
going to start pulling back now''. Now is the time. If the Liberals 
have missed that message, they will go the same way the 
Conservatives did in just a few years.
<P>
	My leader has never said that social programs should not be 
touched. The books cannot be balanced without touching the 
social programs. That is the reality of the amount of money we 
spend in that area. The word is that they have been responsible 
for the problem. They have not been responsible for the 
problem. However, there have to be cuts in there. The books 
absolutely cannot be balanced without doing it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10540"> 10540 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague for Simcoe Centre made reference to the famous tax 
rallies which took place across the country. He will know the 
most notable one took place in my riding of Ontario. An 
estimated 3,500 people came out to protest against any notion of 
tax increases.
<P>
	Of the 3,500 people who attended that meeting not one has 
called to tell me this was a bad budget. We have had over 50 calls 
telling us it is a budget that hit the mark and that the government 
has definitely listened to the voices of Canadians.
<P>
	What was interesting about that evening was that it 
crystallized what these tax alerts were really all about. They 
were fronts for the Reform Party. That is very clear in the 
presentation I made a couple of weeks ago.
<P>
	It is more interesting that one of my hon. colleague's cohorts 
by the name of Diane Francis in her paper The Financial Post on 
the same day that tax rally took place mentioned Morgan Trust, a 
famous bank. It does a lot of business in Canada, and has made 
some $9.5 million in profits at the expense of the Canadian 
economy and has only paid 3 per cent in effective taxes.
<P>
	The hon. member says we do not need any new taxes in this 
country. He applauds the tax alerts that have taken place. But 
surely to goodness he is not saying that some people should be 
indulging themselves while advocating austerity for the others 
as the banks have done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
is talking about tax fairness. I did not get into the question of tax 
fairness. I will agree with him that the current tax system is 
unfair and we have to address that.
<P>
	I do come back to my point that we have a spending problem, 
not a revenue problem. The government can go after the 
loopholes and tax the rich but it will not come close to balancing 
the books. What will balance the books is to get our spending 
under control right now. That is something we have full control 
over. We need to do it right away. We cannot afford to delay.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are debating the budgetary policy put forward by this 
government that permits it to borrow more money using the 
fragile future of our country as collateral.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party appreciates the grave financial situation in 
which we find ourselves. In fact, it has been our dogged 
determination to address the issue of government accountability 
in the areas of spending and taxation that have dictated the 
course of the government's fiscal agenda.
<P>
	The Liberal budget took a very tentative first step in the 
direction of deficit reduction, but it did not go nearly far enough. 
Overall spending increased. Taxes increased. It failed to make 
the necessary changes to Canadian social programs. It failed to 
identify which programs are essential and which are not. It 
failed to explain where and how Canadians will find jobs. The 
Liberal budget did not lead by example. Cuts come from the 
bottom up it appears. Canadians are asked to tighten their belts 
while the Liberal fat-pack have secured their gold-plated 
pensions.
<P>
	There has been much talk about Liberal red book promises. 
Let us focus on some of the promises that are made in the 
budget.
<P>
	The Liberals are promising to borrow $29.8 billion this year 
because they cannot balance the budget. The Liberals are 
promising to add over $100 billion to the national debt in the 
next three years. This will drive the federal debt load well 
beyond $650 billion by fiscal 1997. This Liberal promise will 
jeopardize the long term viability of social programs.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development had a 
tremendous opportunity to make a positive contribution to 
changes in the delivery of social programs. Instead he dropped 
the ball and in fact has dropped out. What the Liberals are 
offering now is a block transfer of funds to the provinces. This 
Liberal approach simply downloads the federal debt, penalizing 
the provinces, especially provinces like mine, Alberta, which is 
working aggressively toward a balanced budget.
<P>
	The Liberals promised to increase funding to special interest 
groups. To pick one example, the status of women, after we 
factor in the new grants transferred from HRD, it still has an 
increase in its operating budget of approximately 20 per cent. 
How can this be justified when funding to provinces for health 
care and education has been reduced? Canadians will not 
tolerate such foolish inequity.
<P>
	The government has not been entirely open about its plans for 
balancing the budget. I am going to use the example of the 
Canadian heritage ministry to illustrate a wilful lack of 
disclosure regarding budget matters. If such dismal 
performance exists in one department, in one ministry, does it 
exist in others?
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage had plans for the future of 
the CBC which he did not include in the budget, but which he did 
provide to the president of the CBC. Let us look at the Liberals' 
promises regarding the CBC. On February 3, 1994 in a letter 
from the minister to Mr. Manera, the minister wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government considers that stable multi-year funding for the CBC is the 
most effective way of enabling the CBC to return to a healthy financial position. 
I am therefore pleased to confirm that the government is prepared to commit 
itself to a plan and to affirm that it does not intend to impose new reductions on 
the CBC over the next five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10541"> 10541 </A></B>
<P>
	However, in the budget the minister announced cuts of $44 
million to the CBC. It now appears that the minister plans to cut 
of over $350 million to the CBC. When I asked him a question 
about the plan in the House he denied the plan, suggesting that 
my allegations were pure invention and that Mr. Manera, who 
had subsequently resigned, had done so for personal reasons and 
that no more cuts were planned. It sounded like an incredible 
soap opera to me. That night, in an interview, Mr. Manera stated 
that he had resigned because of future cuts to the CBC and not 
for personal reasons. Only one of the two men could be telling 
the truth.
<P>
	The next day in the House I presented to the minister a copy of 
the secret document, which the minister's officials had given to 
Mr. Manera, which outlined three years of cuts to the CBC. This 
is how the minister interprets honest and open government. 
First, he purposely withheld this information from the budget 
figures. Second, he denied the document and the accompanying 
cuts even existed. Third, he now admits the document exists but 
that it means nothing and that the president of the CBC is 
misguided.
<P>
	This kind of pathetic performance eats away at the integrity of 
government. Canadians want to know how their money is being 
spent and that it is being spent wisely, based on a responsible 
plan for future spending. The Minister of Canadian Heritage has 
a different story every time he is asked a question. How can 
anyone take him seriously, especially organizations within the 
cultural community? His performance has left the CBC 
rudderless, without a chairman, without a president, at a time 
when it needs leadership the most, at a time when it needs to 
make the transition to the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Further, last year the CBC was given a special borrowing 
authority for $25 million. It turns out that this borrowing 
authority is $25 million into perpetuity. Last year, at the end of 
the fiscal year the CBC proved it could not meet its budget and 
came back, cap in hand to Parliament, and as stated in the 
supplementary estimates it received another $3 million. The 
CBC is just one example of gross financial mismanagement in 
the minister's portfolio.
<P>
	The finance minister alleged that the Liberal government met 
its financial targets last year. However that can only be Liberal 
math, for when we look at the Department of Canadian 
Heritage's supplementary estimates we see it is very much in the 
red, that none of the targets were met.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the government organizations which 
ran over budget: the Department of Canadian Heritage corporate 
services program, $1.1 million over budget; the Canadian 
identity program, $1.4 million over budget; the parks program, 
$3.5 million over budget; Advisory Council on the Status of 
Women, which thankfully is gone, $76,000 over budget; the 
CBC, $3 million over budget; the Museum of Nature, $82,000  
over budget; the National Archives, $561,000 over budget; the 
National Battlefields Commission, $125,000 over budget; the 
National Capital Commission, $12 million over budget; the 
National Gallery, $187,000 over budget; the Public Service 
Commission, $4.5 million over budget; and last, the Office of 
the Co-ordinator of the Status of Women, $162,000 over budget.
<P>
	Thirteen organizations under the control of the Canadian 
heritage ministry went over budget. Canadians expect and 
deserve more from government. When will the minister finally 
take responsibility for the complete disarray and overspending 
of his department?
<P>
	When governments continue to deficit finance they hurt 
Canada's future economic health. By failing to balance the 
budget, by failing even to announce when the budget will be 
balanced, the Liberals have shown they understand little about 
fiscal planning.
<P>
	The Liberal Party continues its tradition of being borrowers of 
both money and ideas. The continuing failure to bring in a 
single, new, original thought begs the question of whether it will 
be able to lead Canada to economic stability within the current 
mandate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for Calgary Southeast for her 
remarks but she left me wondering. In the early part of her 
discourse she reported a 20 per cent increase to the status of 
women.
<P>
	I do not know to what organization she refers. I would like 
very much if she could elaborate on that, what her information 
is, what details she has and what her sources are, if she would 
not mind.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. 
member will refer to the estimates he will see that with the 
inclusion of the Department of Human Resources Development, 
moneys were brought over from that department. 
Approximately $20 million is within the ministry of the status of 
women and represents the increase that I suggested.
<P>
	Further to this, now that we are on the whole approach of the 
change to the status of women, it represents a remarkable shift in 
the Liberal policy. We are seeing economic pragmatism 
overtake social liberalism, which is incredible.
<P>
	It is a shift into a Conservative-Reform territory which one 
would have never anticipated. The Liberals left their liberal 
ideology and embraced certainly Conservative ideology. The 
Reform Party has influenced dramatically this approach. We 
saw it in the budget and we are now seeing it in the downsizing 
and restructuring of bureaucratic departments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr.Speaker, I want to ask the hon. member a question. She seemed 
to get off on a bit of a tangent thinking that all these government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10542"> 10542 </A></B>
<P>
departments had overspent. If they  spend their budget, she 
thinks they have overspent. I recognize the trait.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	However, sometimes there are reallocations of priorities in 
the way governments spend their money. That sometimes 
happens. In this case, I think the government considered what it 
might do and reallocated some priorities and spent more in some 
departments that it did in others.
<P>
	Perhaps the member could answer a question about 
overspending. I believe her party ran into a lot of trouble with 
overspending. It was unable to organize its finances and I 
understand it is running a big deficit.
<P>
	Does the member not think that the same rules that ought to 
apply to government ought to apply to a party? Does the member 
not think that the party ought to get its own finances in order 
before it criticizes the Government of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is such a 
trivial question, it is not even worthy of a response. We are 
certainly in control of our spending.
<P>
	When we talk about reallocation of priorities, I am going to 
address that part of the hon. member's question. It is quite 
interesting that when we look at what happened in Alberta with 
the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. We are talking 
about reallocation of priorities all right.
<P>
	I have a letter from a small business person in my riding. This 
individual wrote talking about Albertans being prepared to 
make that kind of sacrifice when it comes to helping with the 
deficit reduction process. But when we see companies and I 
quote: ``such as ours that compete against companies based in 
other provinces on a national and an international basis, this 
change of the utilities tax has fundamentally altered the 
competitive landscape. Our cost of doing business, simply 
because we are located in Alberta, will go up as a result of this 
budgetary measure''.
<P>
	That message for the hon. member across the way speaks 
volumes to me about what the government intended to do with 
its reallocation of priorities with respect to Alberta.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this 
House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the hon. member for Gatineau-La 
Lièvre.
<P>
	Contrary to what we hear flowing back and forth across the 
floor, it is an honour for me to participate in the budget debate on 
behalf of my constituents in the riding of Hillsborough. I 
congratulate the Minister of Finance on such a finely crafted 
budget. In my years in this House and in my years in the house of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10543"> 10543 </A></B>
<P>
another jurisdiction I can honestly say that this is one of the best 
budgets I have witnessed.
<P>
	The budget is about commitments made and commitments 
kept. During the election we campaigned on a platform of 
creating opportunity. We asked Canadians to put their trust in us 
and we put our trust in them to get things moving in the right 
direction.
<P>
	We promised to create jobs for Canadians and we have. As has 
been talked about many times in the last number of weeks, in the 
past year over 400,000 jobs were created across the country. We 
promised stable inflation and we have the lowest inflation in the 
industrialized world. Our exports are at an all time high and the 
level of business confidence in the Canadian economy is at its 
highest point since 1979.
<P>
	The budget moved us further down the road to even more 
opportunity in the future. As the Minister of Finance has stated, 
the budget breaks the back of the deficit. The government will 
reach its deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP by the end of the next 
fiscal year. Once we have reached that point the government will 
move to reduce the deficit even further. We will accomplish our 
goals without punishing the vulnerable.
<P>
	Some people out there would say and have said that it is just a 
Tory budget tied up in red ribbons. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. We have gone about the budgeting process 
reasonably. Instead of across the board cuts as was the case with 
the previous government, we have examined every program and 
every activity of the federal government.
<P>
	Yes, we can do more. The Minister of Finance chose a scalpel 
over a meat cleaver in making the cuts. In departments such as in 
the Department of Transport where the need for their services 
have declined, the minister has made larger cuts. The 
commercialization of airports will create new opportunities in 
my area for businesses to export their goods and promote better 
tourism marketing.
<P>
	In the Department of Veterans Affairs the minister made 
considerably smaller cuts. I know that the Secretary of State for 
Veterans was keen in protecting services for veterans across the 
country. As a result few jobs will be lost at departmental 
headquarters in Charlottetown. This is also something the 
people of the riding of Hillsborough really appreciate.
<P>
	Seasonal workers will be happy to know that there will be no 
changes to the unemployment insurance system. There have 
been no changes to eligibility criteria or the length of time one 
can collect benefits. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development will continue to examine the operation of the 
program, to streamline the operations, and to find better ways to 
help recipients of unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The budget was also a fine example of sharing the burden of 
deficit control. For the second year in a row the government has 
refused to increase personal income taxes.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	Most Canadians have realized for quite some time that 
wealthy Canadians enjoy special treatment come tax time. On 
budget day the Minister of Finance moved a long way toward 
stopping special treatment by eliminating exemptions for 
family trusts.
<P>
	A couple of years ago the former government extended a tax 
holiday called the family trust exemption. Previously some of 
the wealthiest families in the country could hide their money 
away from the tax person by saying it was for their children and 
grandchildren. Because these family trusts have been exempted 
for so long it is difficult to estimate how much money is 
involved. Estimates have ranged from hundreds of millions to a 
couple of billion dollars that the tax people cannot reach. This 
special privilege was unacceptable and I am glad to see it gone.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance placed a special tax on banks that had 
record profits in the last year. As well the government will be 
leaning on banks to make sure more capital is available to small 
and medium size businesses. The government will hold banks 
accountable on their performance in helping the Canadian 
economy grow and provide more jobs.
<P>
	In the budget there is an increase in the taxes on large 
corporations. This was done because we realized that ordinary 
taxpayers were already paying their fair share. The budget 
spreads the burden more evenly.
<P>
	The government has taken the position that we cannot do it 
all. Nor should we. It is the job of government to ensure that 
there is a level playing field for all Canadians to prosper. It is not 
the duty of government to run businesses the private sector can 
run better. That is why we are selling, for instance, our 
remaining shares in Petro-Canada and selling Canadian 
National Railway. On the list being examined for sale is the 
Canada Communications Group that has come under fire from 
small businesses across the country.
<P>
	In the future we will be looking not only at what government 
does but why government does it. If we cannot find a legitimate 
answer then we should stop it. This is about more than smaller 
government even though government will be smaller. It is also 
about smarter government.
<P>
	We must remember the Liberals created Canada's social 
programs and safety net. While we will be funding those 
programs in different ways we will insist that certain national 
standards apply. All aspects of the Canada Health Act will 
continue to be enforced, especially universality and 
accessibility. Of that there can be no doubt in the minds of 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10544"> 10544 </A></B>
<P>
	We are well on our way to both fiscal sanity and healthy 
government. The naysayers and the special interest groups will 
try to convince Canadians that we have cut too much. Other 
people will say that we have not cut enough and that we should 
sacrifice our social programs in the interest of deficit 
elimination. Neither opinion reflects the needs and the desires 
of Canadians. The budget is about fairness, balance and a sense 
of the future.
<P>
	As I said earlier, there is more we can do. I have mentioned 
this at different meetings with the Minister of Finance. There are 
more ways to find waste and other excesses in government. 
Every stone must be turned to find waste. Public servants out 
there are willing to talk about it and to tell us but they must be 
protected.
<P>
	As Liberals we will continue on our course of creating 
opportunity for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I was listening to the member I could not help thinking the 
Liberal side of the House must have a special fund set aside for 
psychiatric help. I have never heard so much talk about how they 
proudly built the programs and now they are equally proud to 
dismantle them. I just do not know how they can say that.
<P>
	I would like the member to address several dilemmas that 
must go through the Liberal mind. I would not want to call them 
broken promises. How does he reconcile that the budget broke 
the workforce adjustment directive when a couple of months 
before they promised they would not break it?
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	How can he justify that when the government came into power 
it said that it would not sign the GATT without a strengthened 
article 11(2)(c) and then it signed it anyway? The government 
was not going to sign the NAFTA but it signed it immediately 
coming into power. The government promised to eliminate the 
GST but that has not been possible. The government said that it 
would reform the pension plan of MPs but it just does not have 
the guts to do it.
<P>
	Furthermore, things are coming down the road that Canadians 
know about. The Prime Minister muses that perhaps a 1 per cent 
or 2 per cent of GDP drop in health care funding is inevitable. 
That will amount to $10 billion or $15 billion. That is inevitable.
<P>
	The member proudly said that there were no changes in UI. 
Yet the minister in charge of that program travelled the country 
for six months to try to find ways to change it. The member is 
proud to say that it has not changed. It has to change.
<P>
	The last question I would like to ask the hon. member is: With 
respect to the pension plan of MPs, will he opt out or not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Mr. Speaker, to the last question first, my answer 
is definitely not. I will not opt out. I am not ashamed of the 
pension plan. We changed the pension plan as we said we would 
do. We even went further than that. I will defend our pension 
plan and salary as MPs anywhere in Canada. I am not afraid to do 
that.
<P>
	As far as justifying the workforce adjustment directive, the 
government negotiated with the unions and 15 of the 16 unions 
agreed to it. It came to a point where it had to be done and we 
took the attitude that we would do it. We did it and we are going 
to look after it in the most humane way possible.
<P>
	We built the social programs and we are not dismantling them. 
I have said it over and over again. The Prime Minister has said 
that the costs of health care can be cut. That is what I said in my 
speech. We have to do things smarter and we will do it. We built 
the social programs; we will maintain the social programs. The 
social programs will be as good in 10 years time as they were 10 
years ago as long as we form the government.
<P>
	I have no qualms about any of the questions the hon. member 
asked. We have lived up to our commitments. Commitments 
were made and commitments were kept and we will continue to 
do so.
<P>
	I have no problem in defending unemployment insurance. Not 
one change has occurred to the unemployment insurance system 
as yet. That is what I said. Nothing has changed. Some changes 
will be made. The minister has travelled the country.
<P>
	In my speech I was talking about seasonal workers. Seasonal 
workers are not the problem; it is seasonal work. When we reach 
the point where such people can work 12 months of the year we 
will not need unemployment insurance for them. Until that 
happens, with them in agriculture, fishery and tourism we need 
to have some kind of compensation for them. I will be the one to 
make sure, to the best of my ability, that it remains for them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in tabling the budget, our Minister of Finance has certainly 
shown a great deal of courage; it is definitely a first step towards 
the sound management of public funds.
<P>
	To have a good understanding of the current economic climate 
and take effective action, we must, first, identify the economic 
changes experienced in the last 20 years and, second, have a 
clear vision of the goals to be achieved and the concrete ways to 
achieve them.
<P>
	We are, of course, facing major economic changes. They have 
brought hardships and restrictions to all our fellow citizens. 
Their impact on disadvantaged groups is even stronger. Salaries 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10545"> 10545 </A></B>
<P>
have gone down. Jobs are getting scarcer and less stable. Access 
to social programs is increasingly restricted.
<P>
	In the next few minutes, I will review the changes and propose 
goals and ways to reconcile economic and human 
considerations.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Successful reconciliation of these considerations depends on 
our ability to strike a healthy balance between competition and 
individual achievement, on the one hand, and sharing and 
co-operation, on the other hand.
<P>
	In the last 20 years, our economy has been shaken by three 
major changes: the global economic slowdown which started in 
1973; two major anti-inflationary recessions in 1981 and 1990; 
and, in the last decade, the economic system's gradual rejection 
of people with little education.
<P>
	Before 1973, our average standard of living rose by 40 per 
cent every decade. All classes of society were reaping the fruits 
of this growth. Since then, the rate of economic development has 
barely exceeded 15 per cent per decade. Several groups, 
including less qualified workers, have even seen their standard 
of living drop in absolute terms. This long term economic 
slowdown is common to all industrialized countries.
<P>
	In the wake of the great depression and the second world war, 
all countries enjoyed enormous catch-up growth potential based 
on delayed technological development, cheap natural resources 
and an agricultural workforce ready to move to the cities. It took 
us a quarter of a century to use up this potential. Since then, all 
countries from Finland to Canada and from Italy to Australia 
have been having a hard time. Nothing is easy any more.
<P>
	We managed for a while to circumvent the new economic 
constraints. The declining birthrate, the generalization of 
female labour, the high prices obtained from the sale of our 
natural resources until 1981, the debt increase in the 1980s 
allowed us to constantly defer until later the painful adjustment 
in our material expectations. The strong decline in consumption 
during the current recession underlines our belated awareness 
that money no longer grows on trees. Members of the middle 
class have finally started to tighten their belts.
<P>
	But people are very nervous. Economic stagnation has 
resulted in both an increase in the need for social protection and 
a narrowing of the tax base financing our social safety net. 
Governments have managed to partly resolve this contradiction 
by raising taxes, which fuels the anger of taxpayers, already 
aroused by the state of the economy. This situation threatens our 
income security system, which is already starting to erode. 
Sharing does not come as easily when there is no growth.
<P>
	Most industrialized countries started off the 1980s with an 
inflation rate of 12 per cent and were blamed for it. At the 
instigation of central banks, governments then subjected their 
economies to two anti-inflationary recessions. In 1981, Canada 
suffered the most severe recession in the industrialized world 
and inflation was brought down from 12 per cent to five per cent. 
Later on, starting in 1988, the Government of Canada and the 
Bank of Canada undertook to finish the job and force the rate of 
inflation further down, from five to two per cent. This target was 
just met in 1992.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Once again, Canada stood out because, once again, it put itself 
through the worst recession in the industrialized world.
<P>
	These two recessions have led to a massive underutilization of 
our human and material resources in the past few decades. The 
resulting loss of income for Quebec is already to the tune of 
$100 billion. Obviously, this loss is on top of the general 
economic slowdown I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	The $100 billion swallowed up by the two recessions 
represents an astronomical and senseless waste. It is cruel, 
considering the hardship and countless psychological, family 
and social problems it caused. It is also fundamentally unfair. In 
addition, this loss of $100 billion so far is not distributed equally 
amongst all people. Small businesses and low income earners 
are being hit absolutely disproportionately. Yet, they are not 
responsible, in the first place for causing the inflation we are 
now trying to curb.
<P>
	Nowhere is growing chronic unemployment more obvious 
than among workers of all ages who did not finish high school. 
For the past decade, people in this category have slowly been 
sinking deeper and deeper. They are offered less and less money 
for jobs that are fewer and fewer and increasingly unstable; the 
rate of unemployment is increasingly higher than average. They 
have started to leave the labour force massively, generally 
ending up on the CSST or welfare rolls.
<P>
	One third of Quebecers between the ages of 20 and 64, three 
times as many as in Germany or Japan, do not have a high school 
diploma. Barely one third of them have jobs. They are in a 
desperate situation. Compared to this group, the Gaspesian 
Peninsula is a real employment paradise. School may get you 
nowhere, as the saying has it, but it sure seems that ignorance 
does not get you much further.
<P>
	Workers with little education were affected by the long term 
economic slowdown, like everyone else, and by the 1981 and 
1990 recessions, which have hit very hard, but they also seem to 
be gradually pushed aside.
<P>
	We have in Canada great economists and great minds. In 
Quebec, we have an economist of nationwide and even 
worldwide reputation. I have had the pleasure of meeting him on 
a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10546"> 10546 </A></B>
<P>
number of occasions and hearing him testify here, before the 
finance committee. I am referring  to Pierre Fortin, from the 
Université du Québec in Montreal.
<P>
	Mr. Fortin has shown a great deal of common sense in his 
approach to the economic situation. He came up with a 
three-part social and economic program. That is, first, given the 
vulnerability of people who never graduated from high school 
on the job market, he said that we need to create jobs as quickly 
as possible mostly for their benefit, second, to protect what has 
already been acquired, and third, to undertake a second 
educational revolution.
<P>
	I will now comment briefly on these points. It is very clear 
that large scale job creation will obviously reduce the amounts 
paid out in unemployment insurance benefits, social assistance 
and other benefits. It is also very clear that, by creating jobs, the 
federal government will generate more revenue for deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	Mr. Fortin does not suggest that the government increase 
spending but rather that it exert pressure to maintain our interest 
rates under or around the five per cent mark or thereabouts, like 
our American neighbours.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	If interest rates were at five per cent, many small and medium 
size businesses would have access to the funds needed to create 
enough jobs to put all of the unemployed back to work. I think 
that makes eminent sense.
<P>
	Secondly, we clearly do not want to be irresponsible and to 
spark another increase in inflation. On the contrary, job creation 
and increased profits will hedge against the likelihood of 
inflation becoming a problem. The danger of inflation flaring up 
over the next three to four months is very minimal.
<P>
	Thirdly, we must undertake a second educational revolution. 
Obviously, people between the ages of 20 and 64 who do not 
have a high school diploma need vocational training. We are not 
talking about university diplomas, we are talking about training 
spread over one or two years. That essentially is my conclusion.
<P>
	I would like to say to my colleagues that there are some good 
ideas out there and that it is high time that we in the House of 
Commons take heed of them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the member for Gatineau-La Lièvre. He made a nice speech, 
but forgot to mention that the Liberals were in office for a long 
time and that the deficit started growing back then.
<P>
	I am somewhat sceptical when I hear that restoring 
confidence in the economy will result in the money markets 
lowering interest rates which, in turn, will stimulate job 
creation. I am from the Gaspé Peninsula and I can tell you that 
fringe areas need catalysts. Unfortunately, that budget does not 
include any job creating initiatives. There is no catalyst to help 
people improve their lot.
<P>
	The government's proposed approach, which is to let the 
private sector act freely, presupposes that it expects the private 
sector to create jobs for people with low levels of education. 
However, these jobs will not be well-paid. I would like to know 
how the regions will be mobilized. All the nice rhetoric heard in 
this House is fine, but the regions expect positive measures and 
guidelines. Instead of that, the government is cutting the 
financial support available through the Federal Office of 
Regional Development. Where is the support? Instead of 
providing support, the government is withdrawing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assad:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will first answer the hon. member's 
second question. I said, as did Mr. Fortin to the Standing 
Committee on Finance, that we have to exert pressure to lower 
interest rates.
<P>
	Increasing the deficit will not solve the problem: it will only 
postpone it and make it worse. We have to find a way to lower 
interest rates, so that small and medium size businesses can get 
the money they need to expand. Let us not forget that there is a 
production capacity in our country.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned that the deficit started under the 
Liberals. That is true. However, when the Liberals left in 1984, 
the deficit stood at $160 billion, whereas when they came back 
last year, it had grown to $460 billion. Between 1984 and 1994, 
the deficit grew by 250 per cent, in spite of unprecedented levels 
of revenues.

	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-74, an act respecting the supervision of longshoring 
and related operations at west coast ports, be read the second 
time and, pursuant to order adopted earlier this day, referred to 
committee of the whole.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to introduce 
the West Coast Ports Operations Act, 1995, which provides for 
the supervision of longshoring and related operations at ports on 
the west coast of Canada. The labour dispute that led to the 
tabling of this bill is between the Waterfront Foremen 
Employers' Association and local 514 of the ship and dock 
foremen of the International Longshoremen's and 
Warehousemen's Union.
<P>
	The association has a membership of 16 companies that 
employ members of the union in longshoring operations in 
British Columbia. The union has about 500 members and 
represents all unionized foremen employed in freight handling 
operations in British Columbia. The collective agreement 
between the parties expired on December 31, 1992, and the 
labour dispute was caused by the inability of the parties to renew 
the agreement.
<P>
	After direct talks between the parties broke off, a conciliator 
from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service was 
appointed on August 5, 1993 to help the parties settle their 
differences. The conciliator met the parties during the period 
from September 1993 to March 1994, and as a result the parties 
resumed negotiations in March. Conciliation sessions started 
again in April 1994 and went on until August last year. On 
October 18, 1994, the parties were informed of the appointment 
of Mark Thompson as conciliation commissioner in this labour 
dispute.
<P>
	On February 10, 1995, after a series of meetings which took 
place over a period of four months, the conciliation 
commissioner transmitted his report to the parties. The 
employer indicated that, on the whole, he agreed with what the 
report contained. The union, however, rejected the report as a 
basis for a settlement. Following a meeting of both parties on 
March 10, union members went on strike on March 13. 
However, they indicated they were willing to allow the loading 
of grain shipments. The work stoppage occurred after the 
employer informed the union that it intended to impose the 
recommendations contained in the conciliation commissioner's 
report as of March 20, 1995.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	Following the walk-out by the union members, the employer 
imposed a lock-out in all ports on the west coast, at 1 a.m. on 
March 15, thus halting the movement of all goods, including 
grain.
<P>
	This report contains specific recommendations forming a 
solid base for settling these negotiations, but it also sheds light 
on the problem colouring labour-management relations in the 
port of Vancouver for years.
<P>
	In his report, Mr. Thompson indicates that repeated 
intervention by senior government officials in labour disputes in 
the port of Vancouver have made the parties less interested in 
reaching an agreement on their own. The commissioner also 
points out that since Parliament has not allowed work stoppages 
in the port of Vancouver to continue for more than a few days, 
the parties are tempted to hold off any agreement until an act is 
passed or some other form of intervention taken. Unfortunately, 
this is also what is happening in the present dispute.
<P>
	For years, the port of Vancouver has been dealing with 
disputes involving various occupational groups, including 
longshoremen, foremen, grain handlers and other workers. And 
all of us in this House know we have had to intervene. 
Unfortunately, I see the current situation requiring exactly the 
same type of measure.
<P>
	This subject would not have been my choice for my maiden 
speech in the House of Commons, but I have never backed away 
from problems, and I am not going to start now. My colleagues 
on both sides of the House are well aware that grain traffic is 
moving faster than ever before in the ports of Vancouver and 
Prince Rupert. I congratulate the Minister of Agriculture and the 
Minister of Transport on developing and implementing changes 
that have significantly improved the efficiency of the grain 
transportation network in the west.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10549"> 10549 </A></B>
<P>
	In the first half of the current crop year, that is, from August 
1994 to January 1995, grain exports through west coast ports 
increased by 45.6 per cent. Any prolonged work stoppage now 
could have a disastrous effect on the agricultural economy of the 
west, at a time when grain elevators are operating at full 
capacity. Given the intense competition Canadian grain 
producers face in international markets and the pressing need to 
maintain Canada's reputation with its major trading partners, it 
is essential that this bill be passed.
<P>
	Although I have primarily spoken about the movement of 
grain in west coast ports, my colleagues know very well that 
Vancouver is an important international port that receives a wide 
variety of bulk and containerized cargo, whose transportation 
depends on the presence of a stable and efficient workforce in 
the port. The rapid passage of the bill I have tabled is necessary 
to maintain the viability of this activity.
<P>
	As I have already said, the parties have already had the benefit 
in their negotiations of all the assistance possible from impartial 
third parties, measures which led to the report by the 
conciliation commissioner, Mr. Thompson.
<P>
	In his report, the commissioner indicated that ``there is a 
climate of hostility between the parties, at least as far as the 
Association and the Union are concerned''. He even added that 
``the members of the Association believe that the Union is 
refusing to adapt to the evolution of economic conditions in the 
industry, while the Union, for its part, is of the opinion that the 
employer is attempting to weaken its position in the collective 
agreement, particularly with respect to job opportunities''.
<P>
	Mr. Thompson summarized the situation as follows: ``There 
is nothing to indicate that the parties wish or are capable of 
working together creatively to resolve their problems''. Even 
though he has presented a rather sombre picture of negotiations 
to date, I should add that the conciliation commissioner pointed 
out that the parties demonstrated excellent co-operation in their 
dealings with him, and I take this opportunity to congratulate 
him on his detailed and thorough report on this situation.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	In his report, the commissioner made specific 
recommendations on all matters remaining in dispute, and as 
hon. members can see, I have no hesitation in using these 
recommendations to establish the dispute settlement 
mechanism described in the bill before the House today.
<P>
	Many points on which the parties agreed in the course of the 
negotiations were directly inspired by the existing collective 
agreement between the parties for persons employed in 
longshoring on the west coast. The conciliation commissioner 
made his recommendations so as to guarantee that the port of 
Vancouver remains competitive with other ports on the Pacific 
coast and with types of transportation elsewhere on the 
continent.  He also avoided any major changes in the structure of 
the collective agreement which he found was, on the whole, 
satisfactory.
<P>
	In his comments, the commissioner indicated that both parties 
would probably receive the report with mixed feelings but felt 
that it offered a firm basis for a settlement. It was this conviction 
which inspired the bill before the House today.
<P>
	The West Coast Ports Operations Act, 1995, provides for the 
immediate resumption of supervision of longshoring and related 
operations at ports on the west coast of Canada and for the 
appointment of a mediator-arbitrator to resolve matters 
remaining in dispute between the parties. As soon as this act 
comes into force, the employers will be required to continue or 
immediately resume, as the case may be, supervision of 
longshoring and related operations at all ports; employees will 
be obliged to continue or immediately resume, as the case may 
be, their employment when requested to do so. The term of the 
collective agreement is extended to include the period 
beginning on January 1, 1993 and ending on the date fixed by the 
mediator-arbitrator, which may not be earlier than December 
31, 1996. The act provides that as soon as he is appointed, the 
mediator-arbitrator shall endeavour to mediate the matters 
remaining in dispute and to bring about agreement between the 
parties on those matters.
<P>
	If he is unable to bring about agreement on a matter, the 
mediator-arbitrator will hear the parties on the matter and 
arbitrate the matter after taking cognizance of the report of the 
conciliation commissioner. All costs incurred in the 
appointment of the mediator-arbitrator and the exercise of his 
duties shall be paid equally by the parties. In addition, a series of 
fines is provided for, should the parties contravene the 
provisions of the act.
<P>
	Finally, this act shall come into force on the expiration of the 
twelfth hour after the royal sanction, which will allow the 
parties enough time to bring employees back to work and give 
sufficient time for the resumption of the employer's operations.
<P>
	The passing of this act will permit the resolution of the 
present dispute, but, in my opinion, we must find long term 
solutions to the problems that have been the source of labour 
disputes in Canadian ports for years. My colleagues are aware 
that an in-depth review of Part I of the Canada Labour Code is 
currently underway under the authority of the assistant deputy 
minister of the Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	However, in the case of the present labour dispute, this is the 
second time in a little over a year that Parliament has had to 
intervene in a dispute involving the west coast ports. This would 
seem to indicate that there is a basic problem in the structure of 
collective bargaining in B.C. ports.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10550"> 10550 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	For this reason, I intend to strike a board of inquiry on labour 
relations, whose mandate will be to report on the ways that 
parties involved in handling cargo in ports can avoid closing 
down ports in the future when they are in the process of 
resolving their labour conflicts, because closure compromises 
our competitiveness on the world market and our reputation as a 
trustworthy exporter, and forces Parliament to take rapid action.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, clearly, we must avoid a repeat of this situation 
in the years to come. And I have told my colleagues that I am 
personally committed to finding a long-term solution to these 
labour-relation problems which have become endemic to west 
coast ports. That is why I would like to ask the members of this 
House to support the bill before us-to ensure that we will be 
able to move goods destined for export markets through west 
coast ports in the near future as we did before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the official opposition agreed to today's emergency 
debate on this labour relations problem on the West Coast.
<P>
	However, we still have questions and-in light of the 
government's proposals-we will oppose the bill as drafted. We 
will propose a number of amendments in committee of the 
whole and if these amendments are approved by the 
government, we would then vote in favour of the bill.
<P>
	We have questions because this bill comes after a general 
strike was called at midnight last night. So a special bill was 
introduced less than 15 hours after the strike started. Logically, 
this amounts to calling into question the right to strike. Let us 
say so clearly. How can we talk about the right to strike when 
special back-to-work legislation is introduced after 15 hours? 
In fact, the potential right to strike cannot be exercised if a 
special bill is tabled less than 24 hours after a strike is called.
<P>
	Last year, it was the same problem at the same port but with a 
different group, the dockers. We then agreed that the thing to do 
was to launch a debate on the issue right away and put in place 
settlement mechanisms. In this regard, I commend the industrial 
inquiry commission initiative. However, last year, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development told us that, in actual fact, 
arbitration was futile, that we had to move on to the last offer 
mechanism-the last union proposal and the last offer from 
management.
<P>
	This year, we are rediscovering the advantages of arbitration. 
I think that this shows a kind of inconsistency. Let me say 
clearly that I favour neither approach. Nonetheless, I fail to see 
how you could be against arbitration last year and, this year, 
consider arbitration to resolve the dispute at the very same 
place, the same port, with more or less the same players.
<P>
	It seems to me that inasmuch as the right to strike is 
recognized, it is important to give both sides time to bargain not 
only before action is taken, but also while pressure is being 
exercised. Provided of course that negotiations can take place in 
acceptable and modern conditions.
<P>
	This brings me to the whole issue of the anti-strikebreaking 
legislation. Such an act exists in Quebec. In fact, it was enacted 
as early as 1977 if I am not mistaken. Ontario and British 
Columbia have since followed suit. This means that 70 per cent 
of the people of Canada are governed by such legislation.
<P>
	We are finding out that strikes tend to last much longer in 
areas under federal authority than in Quebec, Ontario and 
British Columbia, where anti-strikebreaking legislation is in 
force. I remember mail strikes. These were extremely violent 
strikes, but strikes are becoming much less violent in provinces 
with anti-strikebreaking legislation, and I think that the hon. 
minister is aware of this.
<P>
	In Quebec, the CPQ has made no demands denouncing the 
anti-strikebreaking legislation in recent years.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	It used to at first, but I think that based on the results, the 
benefits of such legislation, the council realized that it made for 
better labour relations, as negotiations were more meaningful in 
a way, disputes were fewer and more easily resolved, all because 
modern legislation was in place.
<P>
	When I hear that action is urgently required, I agree. But, as I 
said earlier, we plan to move amendments in committee of the 
whole. I wonder why it is not considered equally urgent to act to 
put an end to the strike at Ogilvie Flour in Montreal. That stike 
has not been going on for 15 hours, but nearly a year. One year, 
and no anti-scab legislation. Yet, if there is a company which 
does not care about its workers, it is Ogilvie.
<P>
	Let me give you some examples. The negotiations were 
conducted in English. The employer refused to negotiate in 
French in Quebec. This is illegal under the Quebec Labour Code. 
Indeed, since law 101 and the various related provisions were 
passed, negotiations must be conducted in French.
<P>
	The employer, AND, a company whose board of directors 
includes former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, refused to 
negotiate in French. How nice. So, no anti-scab legislation in 
the case of Ogilvie. Yet, it seems to me that there is some 
urgency to that conflict which, as I said, did not start 15 hours 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10551"> 10551 </A></B>
<P>
ago, but several months back. There is an urgency when profits 
or the economy are affected-and I agree that there are workers 
and farmers who are hurt by that strike-and we have to take 
action. However, when it comes to the economic well-being of 
workers, their families, their salaries and their health, there is no 
urgency. This looks like a double standard to me.
<P>
	You may remember that the Bloc Quebecois tabled an 
anti-scab bill, back in 1990. The Liberals, who were then sitting 
on this side, supported that legislation. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development made passionate speeches, saying that 
the time had come to pass such legislation. Nothing has been 
done since. Yet, the government could have taken action, 
especially in light of the fact that the strike at Ogilvie's has been 
going on for more than 15 hours. But there is no urgency in that 
case.
<P>
	However, -and I know that the federal Department of Labour 
is considering anti-scab legislation-documents from that 
department suggest that a majority vote of 60 per cent should 
apply. For the sake of democracy-and I know that a majority 
vote of 50 per cent plus one in the Quebec referendum is being 
challenged, but this is becoming a habit with the 
Liberals-when a strike vote is conducted under a collective 
agreement, it should also be subject to the 60 per cent rule. The 
same bill includes other provisions-even though we were told 
today that these were only ideas-but I wonder why these ideas 
are included in a departmental discussion paper.
<P>
	That document was circulated so as to inform and consult both 
the employers and the unions, and that is fine. It obviously 
circulated, because we had it. So, in this document, the door is 
opened to having replacement workers who are not members of 
the bargaining unit on strike, but who could belong to a 
bargaining unit other than the one on strike but with the same 
company, or who could be non-unionized workers.
<P>
	Seen one way, this is not anti-strikebreaker legislation, but 
rather legislation that, in fact, allows for strikebreakers. This is 
very different from legislation in Ontario, British Columbia or 
Quebec, which stipulates clearly that only managers, who were 
managers before the dispute began, may work. So, I hope that if 
indeed there is, at some point, an anti-strikebreaker bill here, 
that this notion of strikebreakers would not be made legal 
because management would be using people from the same 
company, but from another unit, or non-unionized workers as 
replacements for unionized workers.
<P>
	This is nothing more than a legal façade to avoid facing 
reality. As the minister just told us she was ready to face reality, 
I imagine she will discover the subterfuge of certain of her 
deputy ministers, who are circulating documents, which do not 
in any way, shape or form, resolve the issue of the presence of 
strikebreakers. I think that anti-strikebreaking legislation 
would allow us to humanize our labour relations, a far cry from 
what is happening in certain American states, for example, 
where shots are fired during disputes, and also far removed from 
what once happened in Quebec and in other Canadian provinces.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	I remember the Robin Hood strike, in 1977, or the postal 
workers' strike, where there was a lot of violence. At that time, 
scabs were even paid, with their hotel rooms and all, with 
federal funds. It was Canada Post that was paying their salaries, 
their food, and perhaps other things, I am not sure, but at least 
these things. And the Liberals, who were then in the official 
opposition, were denouncing that.
<P>
	Since we are reviewing the Labour Code, I would also like to 
point this out. We are currently talking about a particular 
dispute, but it is part of a much greater issue. Hence the need to 
hold a commission of inquiry on labour relations practices in the 
port of Vancouver. But I know that this issue is only a part of a 
broader one which opens the door to a review of the code.
<P>
	So, I hope that this will also open the door to giving Quebec 
female workers the same rights, whether they are under the 
federal code or the provincial code. I am alluding here to the 
preventative withdrawal of pregnant women. If you are a woman 
working in the communication or banking sector, depending on 
the federal system under which you work, you do not have the 
right to preventative withdrawal under the same conditions as a 
woman working in Quebec. When there were only eight 
members of the Bloc Quebecois in the House, we had proposed 
such an amendment and the Liberals had supported it. So, I hope 
that they will remember that when they review the code in its 
entirety.
<P>
	When we talk about this strike in Vancouver, we must also 
consider that there are other strikes going on. There is one in the 
railways and also one in the port of Montreal. It would be 
interesting if, before we resort to a special legislation to force 
employees back to work in the port of Montreal, we would 
choose the mediation process and name a mediator who would 
bring parties together, since they are already close to a 
settlement. They are negotiating in Montreal, not any more 
seriously than in Vancouver, but I think the chances of settling 
the dispute are better there than in Vancouver.
<P>
	I have participated in long negotiations and I know that it is 
often better not to go into a useless mediation right at the 
beginning of a conflict and do nothing afterwards. But when you 
are close to a settlement, when you can see that only a few 
elements still need to be ironed out, mediation can be a very 
important tool. I hope that, in the case of the port of Montreal, 
the minister will choose this solution and not a special 
legislation.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to announce that we will be voting 
against this bill at the second reading stage, because we feel it 
does not really allow for negotiations between the parties. I 
personally think that we are dealing with this situation very 
seriously, all the more so since we are working with the 
commission, and therefore I think we should be able to go into 
mediation without arbitration. First we should proceed only 
through  mediation and let the parties negotiate and the mediator 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10552"> 10552 </A></B>
<P>
should not become an arbitrator. How can the parties trust 
anyone who will make suggestions if they know that, in case of 
disagreement between them, that person will turn the 
suggestions into obligations?
<P>
	I think that instead of setting conditions, the mediator could 
report to the minister, who could in turn report to the Human 
Resources Committee-since there is no Labour Committee yet, 
but we will remedy that-or even to this House in order to 
discuss the issue with all members and parties concerned, rather 
than immediately determining the conditions after fifteen hours 
of strike, because that will be the case.
<P>
	For those who are familiar with labour relations, it is the same 
thing as for tripartite tribunals. One union representative, one 
employer representative and a so-called neutral arbitrator. As 
we know, the decision is always two against one. The arbitrator 
takes sides. Expenses can be reduced by naming only one 
instead of three since the result of the vote is already known, 
even if we do not know at the outset which party the arbitrator 
will support.
<P>
	Therefore, the Official opposition will vote against the bill at 
second reading and we will introduce a series of amendments in 
committee of the Whole House, hoping that the government will 
accept them and allow this House, as unanimously as possible, 
to encourage labour relations that are as fair, acceptable, normal 
and modern as possible in the port of Vancouver.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The agreement was that 
there could be twenty minutes for comments. Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	We now resume the debate with the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have been a member of this House for 15 or 16 
months now, and I would not have thought that we would have to 
pass two special pieces of legislation for the same port in such a 
short time. In little over a year, this is the second time we see 
that there is something wrong in this work environment.
<P>
	If I remember correctly, last year the minister in charge, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, possibly because 
of the scope of his duties or maybe because known facts were not 
taken into account, did not follow up on that special legislation 
and, now, we have to pass back to work legislation for another 
group of workers.
<P>
	Not only did we not learn anything from last year's 
experience, but we do not seem to be learning very much from 
the present situation either. I was watching the news on TV, 
tonight, and I noticed that the transportation sector is in turmoil 
over labour relations. There are potential labour disputes in the 
railway industry and in  ports all over Canada. The message this 
legislation sends will be important for future negotiations in 
these sectors.
<P>
	If the parties are not convinced of the importance of agreeing 
among themselves, if we give them the habit of waiting for a 
third party to settle their problems for them, we create the type 
of work relations which now prevail in the port of Vancouver. I 
think that an imposed solution is unacceptable and never brings 
about suitable results. Therefore, it is important that we send the 
message to other economic sectors that parties must pursue 
negotiations as far as the process allows.
<P>
	The official opposition felt that a debate on this legislation 
was urgently needed, but I think citizens have a right to know 
that this urgency is not the result of this one incident. It is the 
result of the government's lack of foresight, as it has known 
about the problems at the port of Vancouver for some time now.
<P>
	The government was aware of problems in this area but did 
nothing about them. And now, it steps in and says to the people 
involved, as if they were children, that because they could not 
work things out among themselves that it is going to have to do it 
for them. This only perpetuates the idea that they do not have to 
negotiate with each other to find durable and constructive ways 
to improve their working climate.
<P>
	The minister's announcement that an investigating committee 
will be struck is interesting, but we must ensure that the parties 
will participate and will find solutions. I think that even if we 
agree that a mediator must be named and that people must be 
legislated back to work, the current legislation should allow 
negotiations to carry on and should not impose an outside 
solution which, at any rate, will never satisfy anyone.
<P>
	I think that we will know we have succeeded in transforming 
labour relations at the port of Vancouver when a collective 
agreement is signed without third-party intervention and when 
all of the parties concerned have the impression that they signed 
an agreement which is to their advantage.
<P>
	When both parties are ready to be reasonable, they will realize 
that working conditions are better during a period covered by a 
collective agreement when it is signed and accepted by all 
parties involved. This is how we can break the vicious cycle that 
labour relations at the port of Vancouver have been stuck in.
<P>
	Hopefully, this will be the last time during this Parliament 
that we will have to bring in special legislation, because it is 
always a sign that the system is ineffective.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Wild Rose.
<P>
	For 11 days in 1994 shipping through the B.C. ports was 
paralyzed. The estimates of the losses to the Canadian grain 
industry ran in the hundreds of millions of dollars. We are 
talking about grain in that instance. There were also 
manufacturers who lost out in the strike in 1994.
<P>
	What did that strike cost them? It is difficult to measure that. 
Even more difficult to measure is the damage to our reputation 
as a reliable shipper. These were not the only losers in that 
strike. I believe everybody in a strike or a lockout situation is 
ultimately a loser. The workers on strike will probably never be 
able to make up for the wages they lost during that time.
<P>
	It is absolutely ludicrous that such losses should be allowed to 
occur over and over again. In doing a little research, I came upon 
some bills that were very similar in nature. Some of them would 
think we could dust off and they would be suitable for today.
<P>
	They are dated 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989 right up to 1994 
when we had to consider just such legislation in order to get the 
port of Vancouver working again. Déjà vu, here we are again. 
Sixty per cent of Canada's grain exports have been held in 
limbo. When one ties up that system, it has a domino effect. It 
backs up right to the farmers' gates. Nobody in a strike situation 
is in a winning position.
<P>
	My friend from Rivière-du-Loup pointed out that perhaps 
because this has happened so often, the collective bargaining 
process is failing. I could not agree with him more.
<P>
	Our minister has assured the House she would like to put 
something in place to ensure this does not happen again. I hear 
my friend from Rivière-du-Loup saying the same thing. He 
would like to make sure we do not have to go through this 
painful exercise, that perhaps when labour and management 
realize it is only a matter of time before the government steps in 
they maybe are not bargaining as closely and as honestly as they 
should.
<P>
	I would be delighted if the Minister of Labour would look 
closely at what the Reform Party has put forward. My colleague 
from Lethbridge has put forward Bill C-262, a final arbitration 
bill, which we hope would never have to be used. Just because it 
is there does not mean that it is something we are going to beat 
up either management or union with and make them settle.
<P>
	It is intended so both management and union know that if they 
cannot come to an agreement, they had better bargain hard and 
fast or this could be implemented.
<P>
	We also have to look at what kind of a situation we would be in 
if the strike and lockout situation at the port of Vancouver were 
settled tomorrow. That contract is only good until December 31, 
1995.
<P>
	Then negotiations will start all over again. Perhaps next year 
at this time we would be back in the House considering back to 
work legislation again. Today the Minister of Labour announced 
the establishment of a commission to study labour relations.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	I invite the Minister of Labour to read through our bill, to 
study our bill and to see the merit in it. If the minister is 
philosophically opposed to supporting a motion simply because 
it came from the Reform Party, then fine. Defeat that motion, but 
bring in another one that is very similar and will accomplish the 
same thing.
<P>
	In speaking to the port authority today in Vancouver, it was 
estimated that in the container business alone, some 7,000 
containers at about an average income of $1000 per container 
for handling has been lost in the little time this strike has been 
going on. This adds up to $7 million in lost revenue, not to say 
anything about the damage done to our reputation as a reliable 
supplier and what it has done to labour management relations.
<P>
	A chain reaction takes place whenever we have a situation of 
this type. We are in a situation in which some 405 people have 
managed to bring the entire west coast shipping to a halt. It 
completely grinds to a stop from the port right back to the gate of 
the farmers and the manufacturers.
<P>
	Is it not odd that these people at the port have never been 
designated as an essential service until they go on strike or are 
locked out? Suddenly they are essential. The fact we have to 
bring in legislation to put them back to work makes them 
essential in my books.
<P>
	Bill C-262 would not only be a very useful tool to labour and 
management, it would not only apply to the port of Vancouver, 
but also to the port of Montreal where we have a similar 
situation taking place.
<P>
	The port of Montreal is a very important east coast facility 
and we should be considering some intervention in that area. We 
have been reading in the paper where the port of authority there 
expects the government to take action, thereby strengthening 
our case that Bill C-262 would be required reading for the 
Minister of Labour.
<P>
	We are not trying to point the finger at anyone in particular. It 
takes two organizations to come up with a conflict and I am sure 
there are two sides to this conflict.
<P>
	Our final offer arbitration bill would be a very useful tool, one 
probably welcomed by both business and labour and I encourage 
the House to support that bill.
<P>

	The Reform Party will be supporting back to work legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for his fine words. I am pleased to support 
this move tonight.
<P>
	A number of things have crossed my mind since this affair 
began. I cannot help but remember the first two or three things 
that came to my understanding. We had some young families in 
Wild Rose that work for small businesses, exporters, mainly hay 
processors, that were laid off a week ago because the signs were 
coming that things were going wrong.
<P>
	These people were the ones making $9 or $10 an hour. They do 
not make car payments and they do not make house payments 
because they cannot do that on $9 or $10 an hour. They have 
young children and are trying to survive. It is a shame that 
hundreds of these individuals are trying to get into the work 
market, trying to make a go of things, trying to stay off of 
welfare and doing all the right things. Suddenly there is a move 
about somewhere and they are being held hostage. They cannot 
go to work. There is nothing to do because a few people 
somewhere are stopping the work or not allowing the procedure 
to take place.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	There is a discouraging part about it. I stood in this place less 
than 24 hours ago and asked if the House would consider giving 
unanimous consent to debate legislation requiring the workers 
to go back to work. The disappointing part was that right away 
we heard ``no, no way'' from the other side of the House. Good 
grief, here we are one night later doing exactly what I asked to 
do last night.
<P>
	What was so unusual about getting going last night? Is it a bad 
deal that it happened to come from this side of the House? Did 
we have to wait another few hours to make sure it came from that 
side of the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> It has to be a Liberal 
idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> It has to be a Liberal idea; it is no good 
otherwise. That is a shame. What did we hear? We heard: ``No 
way'', but here we are tonight debating something we all agree 
on.
<P>
	There was noise from the opposition as soon as I mentioned 
that we should debate legislation to get these people back to 
work. What else did I hear? I heard irresponsible from Bloc 
members. I will tell them what is irresponsible. It is 
irresponsible when 295 individuals sitting in the House 
continually let these kinds of things go on year after year.
<P>
	I admire and commend the Minister of Labour for her move. 
She said tonight that we must get something in place to make 
certain these kinds of things do not happen again. It is a good 
idea, even if it did come from the Liberal side. It is too bad they 
did not feel the same way last night. We could have got going a 
lot sooner, or  maybe last year instead of letting it go for 12 days. 
We are just asking people to wake up.
<P>
	A small business in my riding, Transfeeder, worked very hard 
this year to re-establish the business it lost last year. It does not 
employ a great number of people but it is doing its very best to 
help. It is part of a big picture. Last year it lost $500,000 in sales 
during a 12-day strike. Since then it has tried to calm the fears of 
Japanese businessmen and managed to get new orders.
<P>
	It is finally getting back on its feet and suddenly everything is 
in jeopardy because of a stoppage. This small business is really 
striving. Japanese businessmen are asking why Canada is 
allowing the stoppage to happen. They do not understand.
<P>
	Mr. Blair Wright, owner of that business in Olds, Alberta, 
could only answer like all Canadians by saying that he did not 
know. Is it not a shame when we in the House of Commons 
receive calls from our constituents saying that they have to lay 
people off, things are falling apart and perishable goods are 
perishing? They are being held hostage. Farmers cannot move 
their grain. Everything is looking grim. Yet we in the House hear 
nothing more than silly comments like irresponsible or no way 
when we try to do something about it.
<P>
	It is time we woke up, started to get more serious and change 
our attitudes in this place. Perhaps that would inspire some 
attitudes all over the country that might make a difference and 
keep the economy going the way we want to see it go.
<P>
	Unfortunately if we did not do something all Mr. Wright's 
work would be in vain. All he has done for a year to try to get 
going would be in vain. He worries about his staff. Most of them 
are young families trying to get a start somewhere. Most of them 
earn a little better than minimum wage. We do not even know 
what that is like any more, we are so accustomed to our big 
salaries.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And pensions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> And pensions. We have to start thinking a bit 
more about the little guys who are trying to get on their feet. 
When times are tough and we get things rolling right, let us 
remember that we are trying to provide services and goods that 
are much needed throughout the world.
<P>
	In case anyone has forgotten, the most important industry in 
the world is agriculture. We better not ever forget that. We have 
to keep our food supplies going where they are needed, keep 
people fed when we have the opportunity to do so, keep the jobs 
rolling and keep giving opportunities to young people who are 
saying that all they want is a chance to prove themselves. They 
are hard workers. They do not want welfare. They do not want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10555"> 10555 </A></B>
<P>
unemployment insurance. However we let these kinds of things 
go on year after year.
<P>
	Bless the minister for coming up with the idea to put through 
some legislation that will put an end to this situation at last. Let 
us hope it is truly meant and let us hope that irresponsible 
opposition parties will fall into line and support logical 
legislation of this nature.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise to indicate the opposition of the New Democratic 
Party to this back to work legislation. I suppose it will come as 
no surprise to those who are familiar with the stance that the 
NDP has taken in the past on back to work legislation.
<P>
	I was in the House on a number of occasions when we dealt 
with some of the back to work legislation members referred to 
earlier tonight. Unfortunately, I say to the member for Wild 
Rose, I have heard other ministers of labour say that they had to 
do something about bringing forward a system to ensure that 
they would not have to do this as often as they do.
<P>
	I have two things to say in that regard. I hope this time the 
government will try to bring in such a system. However we 
ought not to assume the system it brings forward is one we will 
automatically agree with. We may have problems with it but 
certainly the government ought to make an effort in that regard.
<P>
	It was interesting to listen to some of the remarks members of 
the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, made on this matter. 
Earlier they had an opportunity in the House to delay the 
legislation and they did not use it. When the government 
invoked the standing order that permitted it to proceed without 
unanimous consent, if 10 Bloc Quebecois members had risen at 
the appropriate time to object we would not be dealing with the 
legislation tonight. There seems to be a bit of a gap between 
rhetoric and reality when it comes to the attitude of the official 
opposition in this regard.
<P>
	With respect to the government and its sense of urgency which 
it did not display yesterday but which it has in abundance today, 
its sense of urgency is related to the movement of grain and the 
importance of agriculture. We all know how the argument goes.
<P>
	I wonder why the government always refuses to take seriously 
and hold up to public attention that in many of these cases, as 
was the case yesterday and today before the lockout, the workers 
were willing to continue moving grain. I know this does not help 
other shippers but grain is often held up as the reason for the 
urgency.
<P>
	In these situations I have seen workers and unions repeatedly 
offer to keep moving grain. It is the companies, the employers, 
that will not tolerate the situation because they want the 
government to step in. They rely on it. They know if grain were 
to keep moving the political pressure for government 
intervention would disappear. Therefore they lock out the 
employees to make sure the grain cannot keep moving to create 
the appropriate political scenario so the government then has in 
some sense a false sense of urgency. If the government really 
had a sense of urgency about moving grain, it  would respond to 
the offer of the employees in the situation and make sure it was 
accepted by the company. But the government never does that. It 
never ever does that. That is something I wanted to put on 
record.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	When I last checked about an hour ago bargaining was 
continuing between the union and management. It would 
certainly be ironic if by the time we finished tonight they had an 
agreement. Let us hope so. It is always better if something can 
be negotiated rather than brought to a conclusion by legislation.
<P>
	Again going back to the extent to which the government often 
bases its arguments about its concern about moving grain-and I 
know my Reform colleagues will not agree with me-this is the 
same government that announced in the budget the end of the 
Crow benefit. In the judgment of many, and not just the New 
Democratic Party, that had an extremely deleterious effect on 
western Canadian farmers.
<P>
	We are supposed to believe the crocodile tears that are being 
offered on the other side for western Canadian farmers when 
only a couple of weeks ago, in the their budget of February 27, 
the Liberals completed the job that they started in 1983 in the 
House when they were in government. It was the Liberal 
government of that day, I would remind western Canadian 
farmers who might be listening, that began the demise of the 
Crow rate.
<P>
	I was here then and part of that great parliamentary battle. 
That was before the Tory government changed all the rules so 
that opposition could not have great parliamentary battles any 
more. We cannot delay things. We cannot allow time for public 
opinion to develop. We cannot do all the things opposition 
parties used to be able to do to give public opinion time to 
mobilize on an issue. It does take time.
<P>
	It was the Liberals who started doing the job on the Crow rate 
then and they are finishing it now by getting rid of the Crow 
benefit. I do not swallow it when I hear Liberal cabinet ministers 
or Liberal members or anybody else getting up and giving me 
the old sob story about western Canadian grain farmers. From 
our point of view we believe the Liberals are doing far more 
harm to the agricultural community in western Canada by virtue 
of the policies announced in their budget than a strike on the 
west coast could ever do.
<P>
	I would like to pick up on something the Bloc Quebecois 
mentioned, that is the need for anti-scab legislation in the 
federal jurisdiction. There is a campaign on now. I am sure the 
minister, even though she is new in office, will have inherited a 
rather large file from her predecessor of letters from all across 
the country, from locals, regional and provincial federations of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10556"> 10556 </A></B>
<P>
labour and other labour leaders calling for anti-scab legislation 
in the federal arena.
<P>
	I would certainly like to add my voice as NDP labour critic to 
the call for that kind of legislation. I say that in an uncritical 
way. It may be that the government will bring forward a form of 
anti-scab legislation that will be unacceptable and will only, as 
the member said earlier, legalize a form of scab labour by 
sanctifying the movement of employees in a way that amounts to 
the same thing. We will wait to see exactly what the minister has 
in mind.
<P>
	We know that in those provinces where genuine anti-scab 
legislation has been brought forward there is a lot less 
labour-management strife. Management has to bargain. It is not 
that all management bargains in bad faith, but there are rotten 
apples. Sometimes they bargain in the knowledge that they can 
put people out on strike and hire scab labour. When that kind of 
legislation is in place they cannot do that and they have to 
bargain in good faith. I hope we will see very soon from the 
government legislation in that regard.
<P>
	In my riding a strike has been ongoing for two and a half 
years. I see the same guys walking back and forth in front of the 
Northern Blower plant in my riding. I believe this is their third 
winter. They are dealing with a company that has absentee 
ownership that does not care. It will not bargain. It has scab 
labour in there. These guys have been in this situation for a long 
time. If we had that kind of legislation in the provincial domain 
in Manitoba they would not be in that kind of situation. It is 
wrong for that to happen to people. I hope that we will see 
anti-scab legislation in those provinces which do not now have 
it and at the federal level.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	Just the other day I went to the shopping centre in my riding. 
A fellow stopped me as I came out. The projectionists at Famous 
Players theatres are on strike. They are being asked by a 
company that I understand is making good profits to take a 60 
per cent cut in wages.
<P>
	What is going on when companies can ask people to take this 
kind of beating in their standard of living, particularly when 
those companies are making money? The company has brought 
in other people to run the projectors. If it was not able to do that 
it would have to bargain more seriously with its workers and 
would not be able to demand these kinds of concessions from 
them.
<P>
	I have mentioned the situation of the lockout when it comes to 
the west coast. We have a similar thing happening at CP Rail 
right now. The brotherhood of maintenance workers decided to 
have a series of rotating or geographically isolated strikes, not 
to shut down the whole system, but to demonstrate anger at the 
situation without endangering the economy as a whole. What did 
the company do? The company locked the workers out. The 
company tries to create a crisis.
<P>
	Obviously we do not have the crisis yet that the company 
wants. I am sure it would like to see back to work legislation but 
I would try to counsel in the same vein as others counselled the 
minister yesterday. Why not try to do something now about the 
situation facing us with respect to the railways rather than 
waiting until the situation develops further?
<P>
	I am not talking about back to work legislation. I am talking 
about bringing the parties together and knocking some sense 
into the railways. They cannot expect railway workers to give up 
the kind of employment security benefits they negotiated. The 
workers gave up things for that security at the bargaining table 
years ago.
<P>
	The railways cannot have it both ways. They cannot have 
asked employees in the past to give up certain benefits in order 
to get employment security and then at some point down the 
road say: ``Do you know that employment security we gave you 
in return for all those things, well, we want it back. However we 
are not interested in giving back to you any of the things that you 
gave us in order to receive employment security''.
<P>
	I have a final comment. These debates always illustrate the 
kind of philosophical gap that exists between how we interpret 
the actions of working people and how we interpret the actions 
of people with money.
<P>
	I heard the member for Wild Rose talk about the young 
business couple in his riding being held hostage by, in this case I 
presume, the longshoremen. I heard somebody else talk about 
the fact that a small number of people can hold up the whole 
country in this way. I understand that argument.
<P>
	Why do we not have the same sense of offence when a small 
number of money speculators can hold the whole country 
hostage? Why do we not take the same offence at the small 
number of currency traders, the global casino operators? Why 
do we not take the same offence when they say: ``I am not 
getting a high enough interest rate out of you, Canada, so I am 
going to undermine your economy''.
<P>
	Why is their economic freedom and their self-interested 
economic judgment to be respected and appeased? Why do we 
listen for instance to members of the Reform Party get up in the 
House even today and say: ``We have to do what these money 
markets want us to do''. Why is their economic self-interest 
sacred and yet the economic self-interest of longshoremen is 
held in a different category, if not in contempt?
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	I say not just to the Reformers because I have seen this happen 
long before they arrived here but we make this distinction. 
When working people say: ``I will withdraw my labour because I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10557"> 10557 </A></B>
<P>
am not satisfied with the return I am getting on it,'' we say: 
``Don't be so unreasonable. Think of the entire economy. Think 
of the shippers, think of the small businessmen, think of the 
people you are hurting''.
<P>
	However, when a money speculator or a currency trader or an 
investor says: ``I withdraw my investment. I withdraw my 
money from this situation because I am not happy with what I 
am getting,'' we say: ``That is the way the world works, you had 
better get used to it''. This is a double standard that ought to be 
exposed.
<P>
	We must treat both arguments for economic self-interest 
equally. I would be quite prepared to live in a world where 
unions, like everyone else, were made accountable to the 
common good. But I am not prepared to live in a world where 
unions get the argument that they have to take everyone else's 
welfare into account while money speculators, investors and 
everyone else can just do whatever in hell they like and that is 
called reality. No way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, can I 
ask your advice? How much longer are we debating?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Until 8.07 p.m. We have 
80 minutes debate allocated. We have 17 minutes until 8.07.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> I am very pleased to be able to say a few words 
tonight because I believe we are going through a period of 
incredible transition in our country. We have seen the 
government having to do things that five years ago we never 
would have dreamed would have been necessary when we 
brought down the budget.
<P>
	Canadians realize that there is no longer that pot of gold out 
there or that our future is assured or guaranteed. People are 
uneasy because they know we are facing change. They also 
know that in Canada we have assets unparalleled in any other 
country in the world: natural resources and human resources to 
actually make the transition from a resource based economy to 
an economy dependent on human skills competing in the global 
economy.
<P>
	We can do this but it is going to require a lot of changed 
attitudes. I do not believe that in the future the concept of 
management on the one side; labour, be they unionized or not, 
on the other side, be it government or the public, are going to 
necessarily be the stakeholders in the way they have in the past.
<P>
	We have introduced in our country and throughout the western 
world, for very good reasons, the concept of collective 
bargaining, the concept that workers have the right to negotiate 
freely for their conditions and for their terms of employment. 
Management has the right to lock out workers if they do not 
accept the union offer. However, more and more we are going to 
have to realize that workers are citizens of the country, that 
managements are citizens of the country and that all of us have a 
stake in finding new ways to deal with labour disputes.
<P>
	Can we afford to go back to the era of 10 years ago when we 
had the worst labour-management record of any of the 
industrialized countries? We were doing it to ourselves. Of 
course we cannot because we are now competing in a global 
economy where other nations have learned to resolve their 
labour disputes in a civilized, non-confrontational, non 
self-inflicting damage manner. Anytime there is a strike or a 
lockout it is an admission of failure in the collective bargaining 
process. Let us recognize that.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	I am glad in the present circumstances that we let this thing go 
as long as we possibly could to see if a collective agreement 
could be arrived at by a negotiated solution. This is always best, 
rather than imposing conditions which may not be acceptable to 
either side.
<P>
	We had to act however. The member for Wild Rose puts it very 
forcefully. They went on strike this morning. That is why, with 
the consent of all members, we are sitting tonight to pass that 
legislation. Maybe some members, like the member for 
Winnipeg Transcona, do not necessarily agree with this. I 
understand some of his concerns for the working person. 
However we have to recognize that the moment we start using 
lockouts and strikes, we are denying our competitive ability 
vis-à-vis all of our neighbours in the global economy. How 
irrational can we be to allow these things to take place?
<P>
	Legislation preventing strikes in every circumstance is 
obviously not the solution. As people with a duty of public 
leadership in Parliament perhaps we have to work more closely 
with labour and management to see if we can settle these strikes 
before they become self-defeating for all of us. Maybe we are 
going to have to find ways to say: ``You just cannot strike in 
certain circumstances. You cannot lock out in certain 
circumstances because it is against the national interest''.
<P>
	Maybe we can look at new solutions such as final offer 
arbitration.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Maybe these are some of the approaches we 
can go into. However, we know the risk is always there if 
management and labour in a dispute know that government will 
step in and settle that dispute by legislation. Then they will not 
negotiate in good faith.
<P>
	Looking ahead, the solutions are not always that obvious to 
us. If they were, we would have found them a long time ago. No 
one in the House believes that strikes and lockouts are the 
solution. But I do believe that if we keep stressing that we are 
now in this together, it is not a question of adversaries and 
stakeholders fighting it out. We are all in the same boat. If we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10558"> 10558 </A></B>
<P>
fighting one another, we are drilling a hole in the bottom of our 
own boat. This has to be the attitude we bring to our future as 
management, as labour, as citizens and as government.
<P>
	With this approach we are going to be able to overcome a lot 
of the animosities of the past. In doing this, we will have to 
ensure that we do not allow the injustices to creep in which gave 
rise during the twenties and the dirty thirties to organized labour 
that had to strike. We are going to have to make sure that we do 
not have the rapacious management of the twenties and the 
thirties that was capable of dictating not only wages and hours, 
but conditions that were unsanitary, unhealthy and such things. 
That is not what we are asking for. We are enlightened.
<P>
	We know that a happy workforce is a productive workforce, is 
a competitive workforce. We know that a management team that 
works with labour and shares their problems, that brings them to 
the table, that opens the books to them, that says: ``We have a big 
problem, how do we fix it together,'' is the type of enlightened 
management that avoids problems and brings about the new 
routes to productivity being employed by many of our 
competitors around the globe.
<P>
	Let us not rejoice tonight in the fact that we have had to 
legislate an end to this work stoppage. Let us recognize that 
what has happened is a failure for every one of us. It is a failure 
for everyone in this House who did not use his or her collective 
strength and ability to say to labour and management, is there 
not a better way. It is a failure based on the way we have done 
things in the past. We have done them better recently, but it is 
only 10 years ago that we had the worst record for lost days 
because of work stoppages, strikes and lockouts.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	Let us say we have done what we have had to do. It was 
necessary in the public good. Let us say, can we not use this as an 
occasion to find a better way for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Recognizing the role played by workers, unions, companies, 
and Canadians in general, we must recognize that the measures 
taken today are not remarkable and that their sole purpose is to 
protect exports, harbours, and farmers, and to provide essential 
services. But, from now on, let us recognize that we must find 
more efficient and more realistic alternatives to ensure peace on 
the labour front, and co-operation between unions and 
management, in order for Canada to become stronger, more 
competitive and more prosperous.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and the House 
went in committee thereon, Mr. Kilgour in the chair.)
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. House in committee of the whole on 
Bill C-74, an act respecting the supervision of longshoring and 
related operations at west coast ports.

<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the government 
in the House has the floor regarding clause 2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, some discussions took place between the different 
parties in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Chairman, I think you will find there is unanimous 
consent if such is required, but you will find there is general 
consent in the committee to have the amendments put by 
members of the opposition. I do not believe there are any 
government amendments to the bill, although there may be 
some, as the hon. member for Calgary Southwest is keen on 
saying.
<P>
	The opposition may wish to move amendments and there 
would be a disposition to allow all of those amendments to be 
put, notwithstanding which clause they may be on. Then the 
discussion could range over all of the clauses and all of the 
amendments while being nominally on clause 2.
<P>
	At the end of the discussion I think you would find a 
disposition to put the question in order on all of the clauses, the 
amendments appropriately placed for each clause, the title and 
the preamble, or whatever there may be to put questions on at the 
end of the bill. I would invite the Chairman to do that if that is 
satisfactory. I think you will find general consent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> We received 11 amending clauses and I 
believe all of them are in order.
<P>
	The chief opposition whip has the floor regarding clause 2.
<P>
	On Clause 2
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I will table a series of eight amendments supported 
by the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, and I 
will read each of them.
<P>
	The first amendment reads:

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-74, in Clause 2, be amended by deleting, in lines 18 and 19, on page 
1, the word ``arbitrator''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	The third amendment reads:

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-74, in Clause 8, be amended by deleting, in lines 30, 36 and 37,

	The fourth amendment reads:

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-74, in Clause 8(2)(b), be amended by deleting, in lines 11 and 12, 
on page 4, the words ``and render a decision in respect thereof'' and replacing 
them with the words ``and report to the minister''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The fifth amendment reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-74, in Clause 8, on page 4, be amended by deleting paragraph 
(2)(c), paragraph (2)(d), paragraph (3)(b) and paragraph (4) and by deleting, in 
line 18, the word ``arbitrator''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The sixth amendment reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-74, in Clause 9, on page 4, be amended by deleting the word 
``arbitrator'', in line 34, and by deleting all the words following the word 
``mediation'', in lines 40 to 45.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The seventh amendment reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-74, in Clause 10, on page 5, be amended by deleting the word 
``arbitrator'', in lines 3 and 4.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The eighth amendment reads:

<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Chairman, I already made a speech at second reading and 
those amendments reflect the proposals put forth during that 
speech. Consequently, I have nothing else to add and I will let 
other members speak on these issues.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, the amendments submitted by the Bloc Quebecois, as 
I understand them, are meant to introduce a mediation system 
without arbitrators, without a timetale and without any 
indication of what would be done with the mediator's report.
<P>
	I would simply like to remind the members of this House that 
when the conflict began in the western ports, the government 
followed all of the steps set out in the Canada Labour Code. The 
first step was to name a conciliator from the department's 
Mediation and Conciliation Service. This conciliator was named 
back in 1993 to help the parties negotiate with each other. 
Unfortunately, the conciliator achieved no real results.
<P>
	Then, my predecessor officially named a conciliation 
commissioner. This action was taken back in October 1994. The 
commissioner worked with the parties for several months and 
submitted a report quite recently, in February 1995.
<P>
	Therefore, I think that all of the possible mediation and 
conciliation steps to bring the parties to an  agreement regarding 
the collective agreement have already been taken. This is why I 
find myself obliged to tell the Bloc Quebecois that it would be 
extremely difficult for this government to accept its proposed 
amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Chairman, our amendments clarify a 
number of points, including what should be done with the report. 
We suggest submitting the report to the minister. I assume that if 
the minister received a mediation report which involved the 
participation of both parties, she would know what to do, which 
means at least reading it and probably taking some kind of 
action. That was my first point.
<P>
	Second, I realize there was an investigation commissioner, 
but the fact remains that special legislation has something 
urgent about it and is a major step in the process, and the parties 
would certainly take the mediator's proposals more seriously in 
the knowledge that the minister would subsequently receive a 
report which they had helped to draft and that the minister would 
be able to intervene, to take this report and bring the discussions 
and the mediator's proposals before the House.
<P>
	So I think the basics are there. And if the minister wants to 
include a time limit in days in the amendments we are 
proposing, well, we would be happy to oblige if the minister is 
so concerned about that.
<P>
	On the other hand, I must say that when we consider how this 
dispute developed, all the employer did was order a lock-out 
and 15 hours later we have special legislation. This tends to 
poison labour relations, and that is exactly what happened.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	It should be pointed out that the union allowed grain 
movement and longshoring. It was management that interrupted 
these essential services which could be maintained under an 
anti-strikebreaking act. I disagree somewhat with my colleague 
from the NDP who said earlier that the Bloc Quebecois had 
made this emergency debate possible. I think it is important to 
debate this issue, even though we will be voting against this 
legislation.
<P>
	I will remind him that, had his party held its own in the 1990 
debate on anti-strikebreaking legislation, perhaps we would not 
be having this debate now. But the NDP did not do so in 
November 1990. Principles are one thing, actions are another 
and actions speak loader than words.
<P>
	I think that, with our amendments, the hon. minister has 
enough material to take more significant action in this matter.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I think the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois 
misunderstood me. First, let me assure the House that, as 
Minister of Labour, I personally read each  and every report I 
receive. Have no fear, if a report is sent to me, I will read it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10561"> 10561 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the Bloc member did not understand the fact that I 
already have a report that was sent to my predecessor. We have 
already tried conciliation at a previous step in this process. 
There was a concilation commissioner who submitted a report, 
not only to the minister, but to both parties involved who took 
cognizance of it.
<P>
	The conciliation commissioner did an outstanding job. He 
examined in detail all the problems involved and came up with 
some answers. His report was handed down not only to the 
minister, but also to both parties involved. The bill before us 
provides for the appointment of a mediator-arbitrator, that is to 
say that the emphasis will be put, first and foremost, on 
mediation.
<P>
	This is in line with the wishes expressed by members of the 
Bloc Quebecois who demanded a mediation process. This bill 
will ensure that such a mediation process takes place. If the 
parties cannot reach an agreement, the mediator will become an 
arbitrator and will then act in such a capacity. So, in that sense, 
the bill before us addresses the concerns of both parties who, 
unfortunately, could not come to an agreement.
<P>
	As I said earlier, a Minister of Labour is always reluctant to 
introduce back-to-work legislation. It is always better for the 
parties to come to an agreement by themselves, but since this 
was not possible, we must act to protect the entire economy of 
Western Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Chairman, I think there is a big difference 
with this bill. This bill provides for a back to work order which 
we agree with and do not wish to amend. What is proposed here 
is a mediation process as a result of the pressure tactics used by 
the union or a lockout declared by management, and we agree 
with a back-to-work legislation.
<P>
	What we say, however, is that it would be much better for the 
mediator to do his or her job in a setting different from that 
which existed before the pressure tactics, the lockout and the 
special back-to-work legislation. This bill contains all the 
elements needed for the parties to adopt more realistic attitudes, 
which was not the case when an investigation commissioner was 
chosen even before any pressure tactics was used by the parties, 
something they will no longer be able to do after this bill is 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Robillard: </B>Mr. Chairman, I think that the Minister of 
Labour can act according to the Canada Labour Code. If I 
understand correctly, what is wanted is that the bill require a 
return to work and the appointment of a mediator who would 
report to the minister.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	But what would happen afterwards? How would we make a 
decision? How would we reach a collective agreement? It is not 
incumbent on the Minister of Labour to make the final decision 
and to decide on the  clauses of the collective agreement. It is 
exactly for that reason that the Canada Labour Code gives us the 
possibility of naming an arbitrator. And therefore it seems to me 
very appropriate to have a mediator-arbitrator who will be able 
to play both roles.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Before recognizing the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, I think that I must give some 
explanation to the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are having a general debate on all of the amendments so 
that any member can get up at any time on any amendment. It 
should be understood by all members that is the case.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, I rise to provide some response to the question 
the minister asked and to draw attention to what I see as a 
contradiction between the bill and the excellent decision to set 
up a board of inquiry. There have been a lot of problems in this 
sector of labour relations for a number of years. The minister 
says it is time to clean things up, understand what is going on, 
change the rules and take the appropriate corrective action.
<P>
	At the same time, the bill repeats the same old traditional 
pattern of making special laws for ports, as has been done for a 
number of years. The practice has always been to decide for the 
parties. We would expect, and this is the focus of our 
amendments rather than the elimination of the notion of 
arbitrator, that the minister would want to change the way things 
are done, just as the board of inquiry should bring about 
effective changes in practices and ways of operating.
<P>
	We must remember that they got to this point because they 
knew from the outset that this was the way it worked in the 
sector. Therefore, from the outset, they negotiated knowing that, 
in the end, they would reach this point and that there might be 
special legislation because of what has happened in the past. 
What we must give them is the message that this longstanding 
pattern no longer works and must be changed.
<P>
	Therefore, adopting a special law is no solution. We are 
telling them to return to work and to their bargaining 
responsibilities, to resume negotiations with a mediator so that 
they are not relieved of their responsibility, but are rather 
confronted with it, and will have to reach an agreement as they 
are the interested parties. This is the meaning of the 
amendments we made.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I now understand more clearly the intent of the 
amendments brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois, but I want 
to say to the members of this House that we have to solve, in the 
very short term, a problem that exists at this very moment. At 
8.45 p.m. tonight, we have a problem in Western Canada and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10562"> 10562 </A></B>
<P>
appointment of a commission of inquiry will not give us short 
term solutions to this problem.
<P>
	The appointment of a commission of inquiry will certainly 
help us in the medium term so that this situation does not happen 
again. Right now, I agree that we are opting for a more 
traditional solution, if I may use this expression before the 
members of this House, to the dispute that is going on. This 
more traditional solution is the appointment of a 
mediator-arbitrator who will impose a settlement so that we 
have a collective agreement that will be effective until at least 
December 31, 1996.
<P>
	In the meantime, we will appoint a commission of inquiry 
which will review the bargaining process and we will be able to 
see what changes can be made later on. So, the bill before us will 
help us solve the problem in the very short term, but we will still 
take a long term look at the whole bargaining process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would like to draw the attention 
of the House to the last amendment on our list because it is a 
little different. That amendment provides that in clause 11, on 
page 5, line 17, all the words after the word ``agreement'' be 
deleted. That clause reads as follows: ``Nothing in this Act shall 
be construed so as to limit or restrict the rights of the parties to 
the collective agreement to agree to amend any provision of the 
collective agreement-and the clause goes on-amended by or 
pursuant to this Act, other than a provision relating to the term 
of the collective agreement, and to give effect thereto.''
<P>
	The purpose of our amendment is to delete all the words after 
the word ``agreement'' so that the parties will have much more 
freedom to agree on provisions other than those provided for in 
the bill, more particularly relating to the term of the agreement.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	We would like the parties to have the opportunity, if they so 
wish, to negotiate provisions other than those in the bill, and 
especially a back to work agreement. It would be important for 
the parties to have some breathing space to do that.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I have been informed this is already possible under 
the present provisions of the Canada Labour Code. The 
amendment proposed by the hon. member for the Bloc 
Quebecois is unnecessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Chairman, if it is already indicated in the 
Canada Labour Code, then it is a matter of clarification. If it is 
already in the Canada Labour Code, it would be unnecessary to 
say what it says in the bill, because this would mean adding 
something that already exists in the Canada Labour Code. Here, 
certain clauses restrict the rights of the parties, but we do not 
want any restrictions on the rights of the parties. This is in line 
with getting rid of the mediator-arbitrator, but it is an additional 
element that could apply even if the amendment on the 
mediator-arbitrator is rejected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Chairman, it is 
sad that I must stand here today to talk about putting an end to a 
strike that should not have happened.
<P>
	This type of work stoppage has happened again and again. 
There have been over 25 stoppages in the grain handling system 
in the last 25 years. There is no need for that.
<P>
	The irony is that as we debate putting an end to this 
longshoreman strike, at this very time there is a labour 
disruption effecting rail movements which will still prevent the 
proper movement of grain and other commodities to market.
<P>
	I refer to the Minister of Labour's response in question period 
yesterday to a question from the hon. member for Simcoe 
Centre. He said: ``The Minister of Labour may have time to wait 
and sort this out but Canadian farmers do not. Present shipments 
are in danger. They must plan for future crops now and should 
not have to worry about whether the rail system will be there 
when they need it. I ask the minister again, when will the 
government introduce back to work legislation?''
<P>
	The response from the Minister of Labour was: ``I would like 
to ask the Reform member to remain calm and to refrain from 
spreading panic among the parties concerned. As we speak, 
grain is moving in the west, in Vancouver this very day. We 
should keep in contact with the parties and keep in mind that it is 
always better to negotiate an agreement than to envision 
legislating these people back to work''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Simcoe Centre said in his next question: 
``We have been calm far too long. When is the time to get 
nervous? It is right now. There have been 13 work stoppages in 
29 years. Our western grain growers cannot afford to bear the 
brunt of another strike. Canada's transportation system must be 
reliable or our customers will go elsewhere. Once the back to 
work legislation is passed, will the government take steps to 
ensure the threat of future rail strikes is removed once and for 
all?''
<P>
	The minister's response was: ``As usual, the hon. member is 
going a bit too fast. At this stage, legislation is out of the 
question, so I will not answer hypothetical questions''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10563"> 10563 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2055 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister's response to the Reform member's question 
was not acceptable then and it is not acceptable now.
<P>
	Today we are talking about ending a strike which affects 
longshoremen. It is not good enough to do this today. We must 
bring in back to work legislation tomorrow to end the rail strike 
which will still cost farmers and other shippers money 
tomorrow, Friday, Saturday and the day after that.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. member is speaking to the matter. 
He can speak to any of the amendments or any of the clauses. 
The members on the government side were listened to 
courteously. I think the members of the government side might 
listen to this member who comes from the grain producing 
region of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Chairman, tomorrow let us get back to work 
legislation on the rail strikes. Next week let us get legislation 
before the House that will prevent this from happening again 
next year and in the years following.
<P>
	I would like to thank my fellow members of caucus who have 
worked so hard in pushing for an end to this strike. I would like 
to thank in particular the member for Wild Rose for asking 
yesterday for an emergency debate to end the longshoremen 
strike which stopped movement of grain and other products. I 
would also like to thank the Liberal government and the labour 
minister for her action in legislating this strike to an end.
<P>
	I want to talk about the costs this strike will bring to farmers, 
that the strike last year brought to farmers, that the rail strike 
will continue to bring to farmers in western Canada and to others 
who depend on this movement system.
<P>
	Particularly for the farmers these costs include demurrage 
costs on ships that wait to be loaded. It cost millions of dollars 
last year in the 12-day strike. It took the government 11 days to 
act last year. I guess it is to be congratulated. It took less time 
this year with this strike. How long is the government going to 
take on the rail strike? We have yet to see.
<P>
	There are 28 ships waiting in port right now with 17 more 
ships due by Friday. More than 60 per cent of the grain exports 
are not moving. Grain elevators are backed up. Lost sales which 
we incur with each of these strikes are the biggest single cost to 
farmers and for other shipping commodities through the west 
coast and other ports.
<P>
	What is the value of lost sales in grain due to this strike, due to 
the rail strike which still continues, due to the strike last year? 
Last year the estimated cost over the 12-day strike was over 
$200 million in lost sales. This year for the longshoremen strike 
it will be millions more. We do not know when the rail 
disruption will end. I would like to ask the minister when she 
plans to end the rail disruption.
<P>
	Why did this longshoremen strike and the rail strike ever 
happen? In 1992 a contract ended. We knew, this minister knew, 
this Liberal government knew, Reformers certainly knew, 
farmers knew and union members knew there would be a work 
stoppage.
<P>
	It has become tradition for unions to depend on back to work 
legislation to end strikes and lockouts. It has become tradition 
because they have learned over the past years they do very well 
by waiting for government to legislate them back to work. In 
some cases the agreements have actually been better than they 
have been asking for in negotiation. Labour has come to depend 
on governments legislating them back to work.
<P>
	Why did we have to wait until the work stoppage actually 
came into effect? Why are we waiting for the rail strike to 
continue? When will the minister act in that regard?
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	Last year when government legislated an end to a disruption 
on the west coast, the Reform Party presented during the debate 
positive alternatives which, if implemented, would have 
prevented this situation from ever happening. Reform pushed 
for last best offer arbitration during last year's debate. Nothing 
was done. I would like to quote from a speech that I gave about a 
year ago in the House in very similar circumstances.
<P>
	I want to present one of the Reform options which I presented 
to the House at that time and which the Liberal government 
should have responded to then and which I ask it to respond to 
now.
<P>
	I talked about two options. The second option:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-is to put in place a better labour-management negotiation process. This 
could involve ensuring that a new agreement will be in place before the old one 
expires-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To accomplish that an arbitrator could be appointed approximately six 
months before a contract expires. If a settlement has not been reached within 
two weeks of the end of the contract, then an arbitrator would ask management 
and labour to come up with their best offer, their best position. The arbitrator 
would then pick one, either the labour position or the management position. One 
position would be completely accepted and the other position completely 
rejected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Under this process a strike would not be allowed to occur. This is good for 
labour. It is good for management. It is good for western Canadian grain farmers 
and others using the system. These options should be considered in developing a 
long term solution to the recurring disruptions in the grain handling system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what I recommended in debate last year.
<P>
	Since then the hon. member for Lethbridge has put forward a 
private members' bill on this issue, Bill C-62, which he will talk 
about later. In that bill is the process for dealing with last best 
offer arbitration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10564"> 10564 </A></B>
<P>
	I encourage the government after the third hour of debate 
which takes place at noon on Monday to be here to vote in favour 
of Bill C-62 so that we will have in place a mechanism that will 
work and that will satisfy labour and management to some 
extent. It will prevent these disputes and these disruptions from 
happening in the future.
<P>
	I call on the Liberals now to be here on Monday to listen to the 
third hour of private members' debate and to vote so that these 
disputes will not occur in the future.
<P>
	As my last question I ask the hon. Minister of Labour if she 
will support Bill C-262 which will put in place a last best offer 
arbitration procedure that will prevent any disruptions in the 
grain handling system from occurring in the future?
<P>
	I ask the labour minister that now and I encourage her to 
support the bill next Monday. I ask her whether she will support 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister of Labour may prefer to answer 
both members at the same time. The hon. member for the official 
opposition put a question earlier. Does the minister wish to 
respond or would she rather wait until the end of this discussion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, in response to the question asked by the hon. member 
from the Bloc Quebecois, I will remind him that clause 11 of the 
bill before us allows the parties to amend any provision of the 
collective agreement, including those that will be imposed on 
them, other than the term of the collective agreement, of course. 
Clause 11 gives a fair bit of flexibility.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	Second, I would tell my colleague from the Reform Party that 
the government has already made a decision on all the problems 
that he has raised. First, it will solve the problem very quickly 
through this back to work legislation but also by setting up an 
industrial inquiry commission that will review the collective 
agreement structure.
<P>
	I do not know whether the investigation commissioner will 
draw the same conclusions as the hon. member from the Reform 
Party, but I think that we should analyse the situation as a whole 
and that is why we will appoint an investigation commissioner.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I have a question for the Minister of Labour. I wonder 
if she could tell the House whether or not it is the general policy 
of the government to bring in back to work legislation which 
does not legislate a settlement, as is the case with this 
legislation?
<P>
	Is it the policy of the government to bring in legislation 
without a settlement? The legislation before us does not have a 
settlement. It appoints a mediator or arbitrator. Is this the 
general policy of the government with respect to back to work 
legislation?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, the government assesses each situation on its own 
merits.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I was sitting here just a few minutes ago wondering 
why I was happy to be here at seven minutes after nine on a 
Wednesday evening. I just realized what it was. I get to sit in the 
front row once a year. However, that is hardly reason enough to 
be here once a year; to pass back to work legislation in labour 
disputes.
<P>
	Many of the points I want to make this evening to the 
government and to the opposition have already been made so I 
will dispense with them. However, there are a couple of 
questions and a couple of concerns that I do have with this 
legislation and I would like to spend a few minutes asking a 
couple of questions.
<P>
	Before I do that, I had a letter handed to me today from an 
alfalfa dehydrator in Olds, Alberta. I think it is worthwhile 
reading it into the record tonight. It is an obvious concern from 
people in that industry who go through these types of labour 
disputes on an almost regular basis. Certainly they have concern 
for the future of their businesses whenever they see one coming 
down the road.
<P>
	I will read this letter, if I may:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If in any small way my name or the name of my company can stop the insane 
abuse of power a very few people have over so many others, please use them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In our industry Canada only has a 3 per cent market share. The U.S.A. has 85 
per cent, China and Australia have about 5 per cent each. The Americans cannot 
be happier, they probably will sell lots more product now and will lock in more 
future sales because of Canada's poor track record and reliability and with no 
future end in sight to the strikes. My customers from Japan ask, ``How can we be 
so stupid?'' ``If you cannot supply them we have no choice''. Americans will 
win again, not because they are better, more competitive, or have better quality 
but through default.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the Dominion of Canada wants me to pay taxes and to help fight the deficit, 
please help me deliver products I have sold. End this strike forever.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is signed: ``A discouraged export business owner''. His 
name is Blair Wright from Olds, Alberta.
<P>
	The reason I read that is that I think it is critical. I echo the 
words of my colleagues who have said that we cannot continue 
to work under this system. I encourage the minister to develop 
some sort of system. I encourage her to do that in order to 
pre-empt these types of labour disputes. As the member of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10565"> 10565 </A></B>
<P>
Parliament for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, I would offer my 
support to the  minister and I would be prepared to help in any 
way I can to make that happen.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	The two questions I would like to ask the minister on the 
legislation are, first, why are the Montreal docks not included in 
this legislation? Second, if the Reform Party had been drafting 
this legislation it would have removed section 8 and replaced it 
with final offer selection, which has been discussed here before.
<P>
	I want to be very clear about this. I talked to the minister's 
officials before the debate began tonight. I understand that the 
reason behind not using final offer selection is that it was used 
about a year ago in a labour dispute that was then ongoing. I 
understand and I accept what they have told me.
<P>
	However, I would like to ask the minister if she believes that 
final offer selection could be useful at some point in this 
process. Would she commit the mediator-arbitrator to move to 
final offer selection at some point in this process if it is 
necessary?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, with respect to the port of Montreal, why is the 
situation there not included in this bill? Well, I would say that 
the situation in the port of Montreal is completely different.
<P>
	I said earlier that we evaluated each situation on its merits. 
That is what we have done in the case of the port of Montreal. As 
you know, there is a labour relations problem there too, but all 
the other ports in the province of Quebec are now also in 
operation. Trois-Rivières, Sorel and Quebec City come to mind. 
Therefore the impact or consequences are not as great compared 
to the situation in Western Canada. That is my first comment.
<P>
	My second is that, in the port of Montreal, we have seen over 
the years that the parties are very often able to reach an 
agreement. I believe that we have not had a general strike in the 
port of Montreal for over 20 years. At this point I have complete 
confidence that the parties can still come to an agreement in the 
port of Montreal. It is also very clear that I am making them a 
formal offer of mediation, precisely for the purpose of reaching 
such an agreement. Under these circumstances, I would consider 
legislative intervention completely premature.
<P>
	As for the second question, regarding the possibility of a final 
offer, I would like to say that the complexity of this year's 
debate, compared to last year's, is completely different. Last 
year, there was only one element involved. If I remember 
correctly, the issue then was whether or not to allow an increase 
from 65 to 70 cents. The question was very simple: yes or no? 
The issue was a very straightforward one.
<P>
	The situation before us today is much more complex. That is 
why we have opted for mediation-arbitration. If there is a final 
offer, the decision will be up to the arbitrator.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> The member for Winnipeg Transcona made it 
clear that he had not finished his earlier remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Chairman, I asked the minister a question 
earlier.
<P>
	Concerning back to work legislation, is it the general policy 
of the government to bring in back to work legislation which 
does not involve a settlement, but rather a mediator-arbitrator 
as is the case before us now?
<P>
	The reason I ask that question is because of the debate which 
has already ensued here and the comments which have been 
made about the possibility of further back to work legislation 
having to do with the rail situation. There is a concern, given 
some of the things the Minister of Transport has said in the past, 
that if the government brings in back to work legislation it may 
legislate a settlement to get rid of or reduce severely the 
employment security benefits that are in the current collective 
bargaining agreements.
<P>
	I want to ask the Minister of Labour whether or not she can 
give assurances to the House and to the people who are 
concerned about the nature of that back to work legislation. Has 
the government ruled out legislating a settlement, particularly 
in respect of the employment security benefits?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I repeat that each situation is assessed on its merit.
<P>
	As for the railway situation, it is now 9.15 p.m., so it is 
premature to talk about back to work legislation. I would not 
want to base my opinion on assumptions, but we will assess each 
of these situations. I am happy to see that negotiations were 
going on, today, in the railway sector. Once again, the main 
purpose of the minister of Labour is to help parties reach an 
agreement and to legislate. When we do that, it is because we do 
not have a choice any more.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> There are four people who want to speak and 
there are about 15 minutes left. One more comment from the 
member for Winnipeg-Transcona.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the Minister of 
Labour with respect, I understand there is no need for back to 
work legislation now and I hope there will be no need. I cannot 
foresee a situation in which there would be. But her colleague, 
the Minister of Transport, also has a responsibility in the area of 
rail. He has indicated on a number of occasions that the 
government would act to eliminate the employment security 
provisions of the collective bargaining agreements if they could 
not be negotiated away.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10566"> 10566 </A></B>
<P>
	What policy does the Minister of Labour bring to this 
particular situation which I am sure she is familiar with? On the 
merits of the situation as she now understands it, is she prepared 
to tell me and this House that the government will not legislate a 
settlement-
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> The member has been here as long as I have 
and would know the matter he has raised is not relevant to the 
bill now before the House. If the minister wants to make a 
comment she can, but it is certainly not relevant to what we are 
talking about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Chairman, I 
have a first question to put this debate into perspective. I keep 
hearing my colleague talk about strikes and more strikes. I think 
he mentioned the word five times. To my knowledge and from 
what I have read about the situation, a report was tabled, the 
employer implemented it unilaterally while the union was 
against it. The employer then proceeded to lock out the 
employees. To my knowledge such was the chain of events. 
Workers are not on strike, they have been locked-out. This is the 
first point. Madam Minister, I am asking you to tell us whether I 
am right or my colleague is right.
<P>
	As to the actual return to work we have no objections, but we 
do have objections with what the minister is proposing, a 
graduated approach. She mentioned earlier a conciliation which 
effectively took place. Normally, the second stage in labour 
relations is mediation, followed by arbitration, if need be. I 
believe that as far as graduated responses are concerned, this 
one, as my hon. colleague mentioned, is rather swift, since we 
have already reached the mediation-arbitration stage, only 
twenty hours after the lock-out started. This is rather quick, and 
I believe that it sends a dangerous message to Canadian 
employers as a whole, especially since no life is at risk. I 
understand that from an economic perspective, this issue is very 
important.
<P>
<B>(2120 ) </B>
<P>
	It is conceivable that, from now on, employers in the rest of 
Canada are going to say: ``If we lock out our workers, what 
might happen is that the minister and the House of Commons are 
going to pass back to work legislation which will impose a 
mediator-arbitrator and they will both abdicate their 
responsibilities''.
<P>
	My second question to the minister is this: Does she not think 
that she is going a bit too fast with her graduated back to work 
measures?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, let me take this opportunity to express my warmest 
and sincerest congratulations to the new Minister of Labour who 
acted very quickly on this issue in a very decisive fashion. I 
think that was warranted, given the situation we are facing.
<P>
	The decision to bring in legislation to force people back to 
their jobs is never taken lightly. It is a step that is only taken 
when the stakes are too high for a strike to be left to take its 
course. This is such a time.
<P>
	Last February, Canada's grain handling and transportation 
system was disrupted for 11 days when longshoremen on the 
west coast went on strike. It was a significant contributing factor 
in the big transportation backlog. This was only the most recent 
of several work stoppages in recent years that have affected the 
grains and oilseeds industry. The direct cost of that strike to the 
industry was estimated at $35 million above and beyond other 
significant losses resulting from deferred or lost sales.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it. Whenever our ability to transport 
our grains and oilseeds and other crops to port is disrupted, our 
customers look to other suppliers to meet their needs. These 
repeated work stoppages no matter what their cause have the 
same results, a negative impact on our sales. Some of our 
customers have questioned our reputation for consistent and 
timely delivery of quality grains and oilseeds.
<P>
	Last April and May the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food made an important trip to Japan, Korea, China and 
Hong Kong. While he was there he was told face to face by some 
very angry customers that they were not happy with Canada's 
performance. The message was clear: We had better clean up our 
act or our customers would find other suppliers.
<P>
	Immediately after that trip, to avoid any finger pointing or 
buck passing, as he puts it, the minister called together all the 
major operational players for a face to face meeting in Winnipeg 
on May 16. The objective of that meeting was to confront the 
reality of our problems and to work out practical solutions very 
quickly.
<P>
	Now we are faced with the same issue for a second 
consecutive year. No one can guarantee that our customers will 
indeed be understanding.
<P>
	I would like to mention a few specific examples of the 
potential impact of this strike. The Canadian Wheat Board has 
indicated that its export program for March is 2.9 million tonnes 
through both east and west coast ports. This represents an 
estimated sales value of $511.5 million. Every week the board 
exports 570,000 tonnes of wheat and barley worth more than 
$102 million. Over the balance of the crop year we will export 
more than one million tonnes a month.
<P>
	Every tonne not moved in March will roll over into the next 
month, making it more difficult to maintain the planned export 
program. It does not take a rocket scientist to see that the 
potential for lost sales from just one week of lost shipping will 
have a serious impact on our grain exports.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10567"> 10567 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	The wheat board has advised us that four vessels are waiting 
at the west coast port as we speak. Another 18 vessels will arrive 
this week to load 500,000 tonnes and 12 more will arrive before 
the end of March. Aside from the potential cost of lost sales, the 
charges will be significant if work does not resume immediately. 
No wonder the Canadian Wheat Board has asked the government 
to take quick action to resolve this critical situation.
<P>
	On top of the effects the strike would have on wheat and 
barley exports, is the potential impact on our export of canola, 
our second largest export crop. Canada will export 4.2 million 
tonnes of canola seed this year worth $1.6 million. A major 
portion of it will pass through the ports of the west coast.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Excuse me. I wonder if the member is aware 
that other members want to speak. There is a relatively short 
time left. Had the parliamentary secretary finished his remarks 
or was he just about to finish them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Chairman, since the 1970s, Japan has 
been our largest and most reliable customer of canola seed. In 
fact, canola has become the predominant vegetable used in 
Japan. While the Japanese prize the quality of the Canadian 
crop, they also place a premium on reliability. Japanese crushers 
purchase canola on the basis of just in time delivery and 
inventory approach. Needless to say, strikes and other work 
stoppages play havoc with this system.
<P>
	With the experiences of the last few years, Japanese crushers 
are becoming quite concerned about our ability to reliably ship 
the quantities of canola that are required when they are indeed 
required.
<P>
	Last week, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food met with the chairman of the 
international affairs committee of the Japanese Oil Seed 
Processors Association. He was seeking assurances that there 
would be no disruption in our oilseed shipments. The 
parliamentary secretary assured him that the government would 
act decisively to ensure that any disruption would be very minor.
<P>
	For this and many other reasons, I ask this house to support 
the action taken by the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I am astounded with what I hear tonight. I am totally 
astounded and ashamed to stand in this House and say what I 
have to say tonight. Yes, ashamed that I have to say it.
<P>
	For a whole week I have tried to get some communications 
through to the port of Montreal. Today I am told that I am such a 
second class citizen that they will not even listen to me in this 
House.
<P>
	I have a constituent who has $200,000 worth of sunflower 
seeds locked up in the port of Montreal and he cannot get them 
out without even trying to ship them. The bank manager is 
talking about foreclosing on him and we are joking around here 
about the lives of people.
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	When the House passes legislation where criminals can 
dictate to the judicial system and get paid for inconvenience and 
the people in my constituency have to go hungry, something is 
wrong in the House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He is talking about the last strike. What 
about this strike?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> The member can scream and I can scream 
too. This is serious to me. I told my constituent today that I 
would help him to take legal action whenever he can to get this 
mess cleaned up.
<P>
	We have tried to work with the government. We have tried to 
work with the minister to get that stuff out of there so that it will 
not be ruined. However what are we doing? Nothing, absolutely 
nothing. That is the type Parliament that has come about. I am 
ashamed. I feel like taking my citizenship and moving out of the 
country if this is the kind of justice we have. It is time that we 
change it.
<P>
	My uncle was shot before a firing squad in the Soviet Union to 
get out of a system like that and that is what we are coming to. 
We had better realize it. When a man who is depending on 
putting food on his table cannot get his product out of the yard, 
something is wrong.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman:</B> Pursuant to the order made earlier this day, it 
is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every 
question necessary to dispose of the committee of the whole 
stage of the bill now before the House.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-74 be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Robillard</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, it is with conviction that I rise again in 
this House to introduce the 1995 legislation on west coast port 
operations. As you know, the purpose of this bill is to end the 
current dispute between two parties.
<P>
	I have already explained at length all the details surrounding 
this dispute which, in my opinion and in the opinion of many 
Canadians, cannot go on. Until now, the government had pro-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10569"> 10569 </A></B>
<P>
vided all the assistance it could to help solve the problems. First, 
we appointed a conciliator.
<P>
	Then we appointed a conciliation commissioner, whose report 
was submitted to the parties. Unfortunately, we face a situation 
which requires government action. Believe me, it is with regret 
that, as the Minister of Labour, I must table this bill before the 
members of this House. It would be much better-and we all 
know it-for the parties to negotiate a collective agreement 
together, and that is our basic policy.
<P>
	However, all port operations on the west coast have now come 
to a stop and the economic consequences are such that the 
government must act. This bill provides for the immediate 
resumption of operations and the appointment of a 
mediator-arbitrator, who, I hope, will bring the parties closer.
<P>
	In closing, allow me to thank all the members of this House 
for their co-operation on this bill. This shows, I think, that we 
all care about this country's economic development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will, however, understand that my speech will 
differ from that of the Reform Party, even though we are both 
speaking in opposition.
<P>
	I would like to say that it is always difficult moment for 
Parliament when its elected members are obliged to adopt 
special legislation to force people back to work, since we agree, 
hope and say that, in the workplace, there is nothing better than a 
collective agreement that is wanted, negotiated and 
implemented by the parties.
<P>
	Therefore, I believe that the Minister of Labour cannot be 
particularly proud of starting her career here in this House, by 
imposing special legislation. She will be quite free in the 
coming days to go down in history by allowing us to adopt 
anti-strikebreaker legislation, legislation sought by the official 
opposition from the time there were eight of us, and we continue 
to think that this must be done.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, we are saying to the minister that the best way for 
her to continue her work as Minister of Labour is not to 
introduce more back to work legislation, but to follow in the 
footsteps of one of the greatest Quebec democrats, a person she 
should seek to emulate, I am referring, of course, to René 
Lévesque who gave the province of Quebec an effective 
anti-scab legislation.
<P>
	Since I mentioned anti-scab legislation, I should remind you 
that in a province or country-the Labour Minister in nodding in 
approval to the position of the Bloc-there is a direct link 
between such a legislation and the length of strikes and also, I 
should say, healthy labour relations.
<P>
	This is what we are saying to the minister: it is unbelievable 
that, in 1995, no anti-strikebreaking legislation is in place at 
this federal level of intervention. I know that she realizes such 
legislation is necessary and wants to put it in place. She said 
herself that preliminary consultations were under way and she 
was committed to consulting the parties. So, she will have the 
chance in the days to come to go down in history as having given 
this country an anti-strikebreaking act.
<P>
	With this in mind, as the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie said and the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup after him, we, the official 
opposition, fully grasp what a shame it is to have a lock-out 
bring the West Coast to a standstill. We know how important 
port activity is to the economy of the region. That is why we 
hope that a back to work agreement can be signed.
<P>
	The difference between the labour minister and ourselves is 
the fact that we do not want a back-to-work order at any cost. 
Our concern with this bill is that it will shamelessly resort to 
arbitration. The minister should be consistent with herself. She 
was very pleased to tell us earlier that the discussions have 
resumed, that both parties have come back to the negotiation 
table, although their efforts might be a bit timid. She even linked 
the resumption of the negotiations to the statement she made in 
the House during question period.
<P>
	We should be pleased about the efforts, albeit timid, made by 
both parties to resume negociations. We take comfort from the 
fact that, with the resumption of the negotiations, we might be 
able to avoid arbitration and rely on the mediation process.
<P>
	It is certainly not because we are naïve or overly tolerant that 
we in the official opposition continue to believe that mediation 
would have been possible. Why would mediation have been 
possible and why is it desirable? Because in the delicate balance 
of labour relations, arbitration means acting unilaterally. A third 
party outside the dispute is given the extraordinary power to 
make decisions on the application and the validity of each clause 
of a collective agreement. We think that this is not desirable, 
that the use of arbitration where a person will be able to impose a 
collective agreement that will be effective until December 1996 
is not desirable. I will say it again, we would have preferred 
being able to continue the mediation process.
<P>
	A link should also be made with another fact. We believe 
things would have been different if we had had anti-scab 
legislation in Ottawa. This debate provides us with an 
opportunity to do something. The hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup reminded us that this is the 
second time the House passes special legislation concerning 
operations at the west coast ports.
<P>
	At the time of the first legislation, the present labour minister 
had other things on her mind, and I am sure she had no idea that 
she would some day be the member for Saint-Henri-West-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10570"> 10570 </A></B>
<P>
mount in the House of Commons. But  she must not forget that, 
at that time, we were already debating back to work legislation.
<P>
	Why is it that her government, a government that she 
obviously supports, did not take the opportunity of that first 
labour dispute to set up a commission of inquiry on labour 
relations that were already a cause for concern.
<P>
<B>(2150) </B>
<P>
	Why did we wait so long? Why did we not learn from that first 
labour dispute and the passing of special legislation several 
months ago. It is because of all this deteriorating process that we 
are puzzled by the action taken by the minister.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to really invite my colleague to 
make an impression as Minister of Labour. We all know that she 
is a determined and brilliant woman and that she is able, if she 
wants to, to take advantage of this labour relations review 
process to bring the parliamentarians to participate in this 
debate on whether or not we should have an anti-scab legislation 
at the federal level. We believe so and we have an opportunity to 
evaluate a model which is the one established by the Quebec 
National Assembly.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour, who is a few years older than I am, 
will recall that this anti-scab legislation has proven right in 
Quebec, which used to be the champion for lost hours and days 
of work. The anti-scab legislation played a crucial role in 
pacifying labour relations. This is what we must aim at in the 
days to come.
<P>
	We have to keep in mind, because it is important to do so, that 
we have two classes of workers, since three provinces have 
passed anti-scab legislation: Ontario, British-Columbia and 
Quebec. Thus, this is to say that some 60 to 65 per cent of the 
Canadian workers are protected by anti-scab legislation. 
Therefore, there are two classes of Canadians. This situation is 
far from healthy or acceptable.
<P>
	To conclude, I want to say to the labour minister that she and I 
have something in common. Like her, I represent here a 
Montreal constituency. As hon. members for Montreal, we are 
obviously concerned with the continuing situation in the port of 
Montreal.
<P>
	The minister says she is confident that we can avoid resorting 
to special legislation and that a negotiated agreement can be 
reached. I am sure the parties involved will take advantage of 
the mediation offer aimed at a negotiated settlement, so that we 
can have a collective agreement that is desired.
<P>
	To avoid the kind of situation we are now in, it is important to 
maintain the optimum conditions for dialogue. However, these 
optimum conditions, that we would like to see for Montreal, can 
obviously not be maintained on the West Coast, because if the 
bill is passed, working conditions, non-monetary clauses as 
well as salary clauses, will be imposed by arbitration.
<P>
	The Reformers' impatience is hard to understand, because it 
must be said that they have been behaving in a very unruly 
manner tonight, and I am sure that my colleagues will agree with 
me because everyone knows that the members of the Reform 
were unruly.
<P>
	In conclusion, we agree with the return to work, but we would 
like to see ideal conditions for dialogue maintained, which is 
incompatible with a special bill.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Finally, with apologies, the hon. 
member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on third reading of Bill 
C-74.
<P>
	We want to move those ships out full of western Canadian 
grain. I appreciate the member from Winnipeg's indicating that 
to this assembly.
<P>
	For many years in my period of time as a member of the 
Alberta Legislature there were numerous opportunities, I 
remember about 12, where governments of Canada, both Liberal 
and Conservative, did not have the gumption or the 
aggressiveness to deal with this problem.
<P>
<B>(2155 ) </B>
<P>
	We in Alberta moved resolution after resolution asking the 
federal government to pass legislation to put the workers back to 
work. The governments did it but to a major cost to western 
Canadian farmers over and over again.
<P>
	A year ago it cost us a lot of money, $35 million in demurrage 
and penalties. The Alberta Wheat Pool tells us there was $100 
million in terms of loss to the Canadian economy and $450 
million in lost sales for grain farmers. That is provided by the 
figures from the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Many dollars were lost. Even in this short time that the 
workers were off work, we suffered serious losses. One of my 
colleagues illustrated in the House earlier that the strike cost one 
of our alfalfa shippers $250,000 because they could not get it off 
the boat and into the marketplace. That market was lost to some 
American producers. I do not think that is fair.
<P>
	I understand the minister and the government were advised 
several days ago that an agreement could not be reached. Why 
did we not bring legislation into the House so that if a strike did 
occur we could act immediately and put the workers back to 
work?
<P>
	This is the first step in a series of responsibilities the House 
will have. We have not settled the matter with regard to 
Montreal. My colleague, the member for Lisgar-Marquette, 
has illustrated that point very well on how one of his producers 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10571"> 10571 </A></B>
<P>
or processors in that province of Manitoba is affected in a very 
significant way. We have to deal with that. Why did we not deal 
with that tonight and get it over with for the industry?
<P>
	We do appreciate that the minister has brought the legislation 
before this assembly. We give her full credit and compliment her 
for that and compliment the composition of the legislation as it 
is. It has met one of the needs of western Canadians. The 
minister deserves that credit.
<P>
	I also on behalf of my colleagues want to give the minister 
credit for the fact that she and the government intend to set up a 
commission or some body to look at ways we can deal with this 
problem on a basis that does not require legislation or a 
knee-jerk reaction every time workers walk off the job or there 
is a lockout, as is the case at the present time. I give the 
government full credit for that.
<P>
	In all the years federal governments have dealt with this issue 
they have always brought legislation in to put the workers back 
to work or prevent or stop a lockout and they stopped there. They 
were afraid to challenge the unions on this very basic question. 
They were afraid to do what they thought would disturb the 
collective bargaining process and they wanted to maintain the 
integrity of that process.
<P>
	Western Canadian farmers face a very unique situation. It is 
different. We as farmers in the west are victims of the collective 
bargaining process. We pay the bills. When there is demurrage 
to be paid we pay it as farmers. When there is loss of sales we 
pay it as farmers. Whatever the losses are we are the ones who 
pay. It is not management. It is not the unions. They do not pay 
any of it. There are no losses on their part. It is the person who 
ships the raw product, grain and other agricultural products, or 
our processed products into the export market. We are the 
victims.
<P>
	The collective bargaining process as it now stands is 
completely unfair. The right to strike in that process does not fit 
that circumstance at all.
<P>
<B>(2200) </B>
<P>
	There must be a different approach. I have recommended in 
private members' Bill C-262 that we look at a process by which 
there is binding arbitration and that each party provides to the 
arbitrator a final position.
<P>
	The arbitrator then would choose one position or the other and 
at that the work continues and there is an agreement for both of 
the parties. That is one of the options we should look at. Maybe 
there are other options.
<P>
	The minister has indicated there will be a commission. The 
matter will be studied. I hope that is not a diversion or a delay. I 
hope the minister and Prime Minister are very sincere that there 
will be recommendations that will come into either the June 
portion of this session or into the fall session of the House 
whereby we deal with the problem once and for all.
<P>
	It can be done without violating what we talked about, the 
collective bargaining agreement process by which management 
and employees can settle their various disputes.
<P>
	Agriculture is different from General Motors, for example. 
General Motors has management. Its employees produce 
automobiles. If the automobiles are not manufactured and sold, 
management and employees are affected. It does not affect the 
other people beyond that. That is the very basic difference in 
terms of these two processes.
<P>
	We intend to support this legislation. We want the government 
to support it and move quickly on it. We want it to deal with the 
other circumstances affecting the export of agriculture and other 
export products. We want that to happen as quickly as possible. 
If it needs to be done tomorrow let us do it tomorrow and not 
wait until there is a major crisis in our economy.
<P>
	We are looking forward to some major changes in legislation 
this fall that will deal with this problem on a long term basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to pick up on something I was speaking about 
earlier but which was exacerbated by a speech given by a Liberal 
member who spoke about the national interest.
<P>
	In the context of talking about the national interest, a double 
standard exists between how we regard labour when it pursues 
its economic self-interest and how we regard capital when it 
pursues its economic self-interest.
<P>
	When money markets act in ways that hold the country 
hostage, we do not take the same offence as some members take 
when a trade union is said to be holding the economy hostage in 
its economic self-interest.
<P>
	What I was pleading for was that there not be this double 
standard that if we want to hold that everyone should be 
accountable to the common good or to the national interest, we 
have to do that with some uniformity.
<P>
	We cannot say that trade unions or working people should be 
accountable to the national interest but the money marketeers, 
the currency traders and the money speculators can do what they 
like, act in their own economic self-interest and that our only 
role as a Parliament is to appease them, ask them what they want 
next, do whatever they want so that they will invest in our 
country. We need to to stop having this double standard.
<P>
	Picking up on the comment that the Liberal member made 
about national interest, this is also an interesting concept given 
globalization and free trade agreements.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10572"> 10572 </A></B>
<P>
	Why are working people asked to subscribe to a notion called 
the national interest? I believe in the national interest, but when 
we ask the same thing of the corporate sector we are accused of 
being romantic. We are accused of not being with it. We are 
accused of not understanding that there are no borders any more.
<P>
	Investors, capital and corporations move all around the world 
doing whatever they want. Anyone who wants to talk about the 
national interest, except when they are trying to morally 
intimidate working people into giving up their economic 
self-interests, are called romantic. Why is that? Why is there 
this double standard when it comes to working people? I do not 
understand it.
<P>
	I think ordinary Canadians sense there is something fishy 
when they are always supposed to act in the national interest but 
the people who can play with interest rates and the money 
markets and who can look around the planet for cheaper labour 
markets or weaker environmental regulations or weaker labour 
laws, that is okay for them. They can seek their economic 
self-interests; that is just called finding a good investment 
climate. However, when working people want to do the same 
thing, shame on them. They are not taking the national interest 
into account.
<P>
	I say, shame on this House for accepting that double standard.
<P>
