</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will direct my remarks first to the people who are 
concerned about their own safety from criminals, especially 
criminals who misuse firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can imagine what it must be like for senior 
citizens to suffer home invasion at the hands of criminals with 
firearms.  That is becoming a common crime in our bigger cities. 
It is one that is starting to make everybody sit up and pay 
attention.  It was bad enough when somebody's mother or 
grandmother was afraid to go out at night and walk to the corner 
store to buy a little milk for her tea.  Now those folks are 
afraid inside their own homes.  Where is this going to stop? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the media like to claim that crime is 
decreasing.  But people I talk to tell me that crime is so heavy 
where they live that police do not even show up to investigate a 
break and enter unless somebody has been injured.  The police are 
just too busy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A big part of the reason for such crime is the lack of teeth in 
the Young Offenders Act.  That is another part of the crime 
story.  It is a fact that no single change is going to make 
Canadian society safe again.  It is going to take hard work by 
politicians to make Canada a safe place again for our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a new young offenders act.  We need a victims bill of 
rights.  We need, as my bill provides, tough penalties for the 
criminal misuse of firearms.  Instead of enacting these useful 
measures, which would produce measurable results, the government 
chose to require law-abiding owners of rifles and shotguns to 
file papers, jump through hoops and pay fees in another Liberal 
tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My private member's bill would repeal Bill C-68 and replace it 
with real protection against criminals and the misuse of firearms 
by enacting minimum jail terms that cannot be plea bargained 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill states that using, having or claiming to have a firearm 
during the commission of or the attempt to commit a crime or in 
flight after committing a crime would require a judge to impose a 
minimum of five years' imprisonment or not more than 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill also states that if a firearm is actually discharged, 
not just waved around or pointed at victims of crime, the penalty 
will increase to a minimum of 10 years or a maximum of 14 years 
and that these sentences will be served consecutively, that is, 
after or in addition to other sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people argue that five or 10 years is too harsh and too 
long a time for the poor criminal to spend in jail.  The way many 
of our prisons are run today it is really like a trip to the 
country club, not serious punishment.  But that is another matter 
not directly addressed today.  Prison reform is one more piece of 
the puzzle that the government could have enacted to achieve 
measurable results in the fight against crime, but it abandoned 
that responsibility and instead decided to target law-abiding 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my bill were passed at least convicted offenders would be 
deprived of their liberty and kept where they could not do more 
harm to society in general.  If some people object to this as 
being too harsh, I remind them to look at the victims of crime. 
Depending on the seriousness of the crime, it sometimes takes a 
victim many years, sometimes a lifetime, to recover from the ill 
effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember the parents all across Canada who have lost a 
child through the criminal misuse of firearms.  Or let us think 
of those who got shot themselves, sustaining such injuries as 
loss of sight or even paralysis.  Think of the many fine police 
officers who have been shot in the line of duty.  When the 
criminal gets out of jail their victim or victims will still be 
serving their sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even what passes as a small offence today, like the waving 
around of a shotgun during the commission of a crime, may lead 
victims to have to change jobs or take medication or even get 
counselling because they cannot cope with the endless nightmares 
which result from being threatened with a firearm in the course 
of their supposedly normal working day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we let people out of jail after they have committed crimes 
like this we send a message if the sentence has not been harsh 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some countries the use of a firearm in the commission of a 
crime is treated as a terrorist act, punishable by death.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we in North America have seen too many crime shows on 
television and tend to take such things for granted.  That is 
unfortunate.  The North American society would be much better off 
if we considered the use of a firearm in the commission of a 
crime as the terrorist act it really is.  It strikes a blow 
against the very foundation of our law-abiding society when 
criminals armed with firearms can prey on law-abiding citizens 
and be released with little or no time in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Society must take a much more serious attitude toward the use of 
firearms in the commission of a crime.  The best way to 
demonstrate that serious attitude is to demand that significant 
penalties be imposed on the criminal.  That would send a message 
strong enough to shrink the demand for illegal firearms and to 
help dry up smuggling.  It would be much easier to reduce 
smuggling if the smuggled items were not in demand.  Criminals 
would soon learn that they cannot use many aspects of the law and 
loopholes such as using young people in the commission of crimes 
because those young people are dealt with by the Young Offenders 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enacting serious penalties for the criminal misuse of firearms 
is a key component of Bill C-236. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key component of my private member's bill is the 
repeal of Bill C-68.  Today some of my colleagues will focus on 
reasons to repeal Bill C-68.  For example, it will do absolutely 
nothing to stop crime with firearms.  Its cost is much higher 
than the government promised.  The stats used to support its 
passage have since been shown to be grossly inaccurate.  The 
funds could be much better used.  It gives cabinet excessive 
powers.  It infringes on the fundamental rights of citizens to 
enjoy private property without government interference.  It 
crosses the line into provincial jurisdiction.  It provides 
police with the excessive powers of search and seizure.  And it 
can hand criminals a computerized list of the homes that have 
firearms for them to steal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those points are serious and deserving of many hours of 
debate in the House.  However, I will talk about one aspect of 
Bill C-68 which may be more serious than any of the others.  That 
point is based on the fact that normally law-abiding citizens 
have not consented to register their firearms and shotguns.  When 
I talk to them most of them tell me that they will not do so.  As 
with the legislation to enact the GST, Bill C-68 will have the 
rare distinction of turning literally millions of normally 
law-abiding Canadian citizens into criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the general public not only does not agree with legislation 
but believes it to be wrong, that lack of agreement creates a 
climate which broadly tolerates what some people might describe 
as civil disobedience.  Firearms owners generally view Bill C-68 
as bad legislation.  I certainly agree with them, as do many of 
my colleagues, not only this side of the House but also on the 
other side of the House.  I know many people in rural Canada and 
nearly everyone assures me that they will not comply with the 
requirement to register their rifles and shotguns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already well aware that millions of Canadians have lost 
faith in our governmental process to such an extent that they do 
not even vote.  Their parents or grandparents may have shed blood 
on foreign soil to defend our democratic rights.  Nevertheless, 
millions are ignoring their right to vote because they have lost 
faith in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the falling percentage of voters, millions of 
Canadians see themselves as being so overtaxed that they cannot 
get ahead no matter how hard they work.  There is a widespread 
trend of people doing anything they can to avoid paying taxes, 
especially the GST.  We even have a name for it.  We now call it 
the underground economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a child the only underground economy was mining. 
Those were the days when the average Canadian regarded the 
responsibility to vote as a primary concern and no law was 
lightly broken.  Average Canadians cared about their country and 
their government because they believed this country and its 
government cared about them.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead today a broad cross-section of Canadians believe we are 
politicians who only care about ourselves, not statesmen acting 
in the best interest of the country.  That sad fact has become 
the source of many jokes.  One of the most feared sentences today 
in Canada is: “Hello, I am from the government and I am here to 
help you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the passage of Bill C-68 soon we will have buried rifles 
and shotguns in backyards all across Canada.  Some people, 
especially those who suffered under totalitarian regimes in other 
lands, view their firearms as the last defence against tyranny. 
Others who learned to hunt with their fathers and grandfathers 
see firearms as a basic element in their family traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ranchers, trappers and farmers as well as sport shooters and 
collectors do not look at firearms as weapons for criminals to 
use.  They look at them as tools and an essential part of their 
everyday lives.  It is not only the first nations people who see 
Bill C-68 as a threat to their culture.  For many, Bill C-68 is 
the latest example of the urban lifestyle and urban values being 
crammed down the throats of the people living in rural areas 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together with the majority of people who live in my riding of 
Okanagan—Shuswap I see Bill C-68 as a sharp axe being used to 
hack at the base of the tree of our Canadian lifestyle.  It is a 
solemn obligation of elected members of government to nourish 
that tree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we passed Bill C-68 which is helping to kill some of the 
most treasured aspects of our Canadian lifestyle.  I believe 
every responsible member of parliament should work hard to repeal 
Bill C-68 to restore the Criminal Code to what it was before 
legislation was enacted and to pass tough new penalties for the 
criminal misuse of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, there are many other reasons parliament should 
repeal the act respecting firearms and other weapons, which is 
the formal title of Bill C-68 and which would happen by passing 
Bill C-236.  First it was presented in parliament under false 
pretences.  It was supposedly to reduce accidents by encouraging 
safer storage, but the fact is safe storage was already required 
by earlier legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was supposedly to reduce crime with firearms by requiring 
law-abiding owners of rifles and shotguns to fill out some papers 
and pay some fees.  However the fact is that registration of 
handguns has been required for many years yet small guns remain 
the criminal's weapon of choice.  It was supposedly to reduce the 
number of crimes in which firearms were involved.  We have since 
seen RCMP Commissioner Murray write former Deputy Justice 
Minister George Thomson to take exception to how the 1993 stats 
of the federal police force were distorted to promote Bill C-68. 
Commissioner Murray wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We determined that our statistics showed that there were 73 
firearms involved in violent crime compared to the Department of 
Justice's findings of 623 firearms involved in violent crime. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently some police forces consider a firearm to have been 
involved in a violent crime if a drug dealer happens to have 
firearms and ammunition stashed in his basement when he is 
arrested.  Members of the House did not have such an 
interpretation in mind when they fell for the government's flawed 
arguments in support of Bill C-68.  I will end on that note and 
hope everybody considers very carefully where Bill C-68 will take 
the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in Canada we acknowledge and respect that there are legitimate 
uses of firearms by responsible and law-abiding Canadians.  That 
is not at question at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsible law-abiding firearms owners have nothing to fear 
besides the fearmongering on the other side from the new Firearms 
Act.  Canadians do not want to live in a country in which people 
feel they want or need to possess a firearm for protection. 
Further, if we in Canada want to retain our safe and peaceful 
character as a country—and it is the best country in the world 
to live in for the fifth time in a row—we should signal in every 
possible way that we will not tolerate and we will severely 
punish the use of firearms in the commission of crimes.

recognized that Canadians understand the Firearms Act and that 
the amendments to the Criminal Code of Canada which comprise Bill

upon the culture of safety practised by responsible law-abiding 
firearms owners in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be a surprise for the opposition that 82% of all 
Canadians support the registration of all firearms, a majority in 
every province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Of course they find this very funny. 
Seventy-two per cent of rural Canadians approve of registration. 
There is strong support for the universal registration of 
firearms across Canada.  Bill C-68 establishes a framework to 
achieve a number of goals that relate directly to the safety of 
Canadians in their homes and on the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It creates stiff sentences for those who use firearms in the 
commission of a crime.  It creates systems and sanctions to deal 
with the smuggling of guns into Canada.  It provides that all 
firearms in Canada must be registered, a cornerstone measure that 
will help police fight smuggling and do their job more 
effectively.  It does all these things within a framework that 
respects the rights of responsible law-abiding gun owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us review for a moment the background of how the legislation 
came to be.  The opposition keeps forgetting how many times we 
have debated the issue in the House.  We were elected on the 
second mandate because of that piece of legislation.  It was 
introduced into the House of Commons on February 14, 1995 through 
successive debates including an extensive list of amendments 
brought to the bill by committee and debated at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On and on we have debated the issue in the House of Commons.  It 
has gone to committee.  Canadians have had a chance to bring 
forth their opinions.  Two major sets of regulations have been 
processed, the first being tabled in November 1996 and the second 
set being tabled in October 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee reviewing the first set of regulations 
made 39 recommendations, 30 of which were accepted in whole or in 
part.  The government accepted more than 93% of the justice 
committee's recommendations following extensive hearings on these 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point in this brief review is to ask the opposition why, in 
view of the extensive parliamentary involvement in both the 
legislation and the regulations and in view of the number of 
changes in accommodations which were made as the legislation 
passed through the House, we would even consider repealing Bill 
C-68, legislation that enjoys the support of 82% of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-236 would have us believe that parliament's legislation 
does nothing to address the criminal misuse of firearms. 
Opposition members may wish to consult the Criminal Code in this 
respect. A significant number of offences in the code were 
modified to carry a minimum punishment of imprisonment for four 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A significant number of offences in the code were modified to 
carry a minimum sentence of four years' imprisonment. These 
Criminal Code offences are found under the headings of causing 
death by criminal negligence, manslaughter, attempt to commit 
murder, causing bodily harm with intent, sexual assault with a 
weapon, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage taking, 
robbery and extortion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other offences are found for a variety of criminal offences 
including activities such as weapons trafficking, possession for 
the purpose of weapons trafficking, manufacture of automatic 
firearms, automatic firearms importing and exporting when 
knowing it is unauthorized, and tampering with the serial number 
of a firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were very attentive to criminal activities in formulating 
the offence provisions of Bill C-68.  Increasing the minimum 
terms, as the bill proposes, would add nothing useful to the 
general approach approved by parliament when it passed Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the supporters of Bill C-236 really took the time to study the 
issue, they would also find that there have been a number of 
appeals of the four year minimum sentences over the past two 
years. All of them have been upheld on appeal as appropriate 
sentencing, expressing the will of parliament. They also express 
the will of the Canadian people, 82% of whom support this 
legislation, as I mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The licensing of firearms users is one of the central features 
of this legislation.  Under Bill C-68, only people who are 
responsible and have not within the past five years been 
convicted of Criminal Code offences, of an offence involving 
violence against a person or the threat of such violence, of an 
offence involving  criminal activity or of the contravention of 
the Food and Drugs Act or the Narcotic Control Act are eligible 
for licensing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registration is an important component of the act. Let me remind 
proponents of Bill C-236 that this aspect of the legislation was 
recently validated by the Alberta court of appeal. People who 
sell guns should know to whom they are selling. If the person 
buying the gun has a licence, there is some reasonable assurance 
that the person is a law-abiding, responsible person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safety is an essential component, and this is why persons with 
licences will have completed and passed the Canadian firearm 
safety course and will have at least the basics in respect of 
the safe handling and use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the lost or stolen firearms eventually come to the 
attention of the police. 
A system of registration will assist the police in returning 
these firearms to their rightful owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since licensed users will have shown they were not involved in 
criminal activity and are otherwise responsible, and since guns 
will be registered, the police will have an invaluable tool to 
assist them in their fight against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opponents of the legislation contend that criminals will not 
register guns. However, the licensing and registration 
provisions will assist the police by providing them with 
additional tools to charge criminals and to fight organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many guns come to Canada from the United States. The attitude in 
the United States with respect to guns is significantly 
different from that in Canada. The illegal movement of firearms 
into Canada is a problem of considerable magnitude and we 
recognize that. 
The registration system will register guns coming into and 
leaving Canada and the movement of those guns within the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Illegal shipments will be easier to stop. Customs officers will 
be able to identify shipments against the registration database. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Obviously the opposition finds this 
very funny.  This is not a funny subject as far as we are 
concerned. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be possible to track down any firearm imported into and 
sold in Canada. Contraband reduction is an important tool 
through which the Firearms Act can contribute to crime 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act allows honest and law-abiding sportsmen to 
continue to practice their sport. It is possible to buy and sell 
firearms, to hunt with a gun, to target shoot, to collect 
firearms, to display them in a museum and to practice all sorts 
of other sound activities favoured by gun owners. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To counter criminal activities in the country, the Department of 
Justice is attending to a wide range of criminal justice issues 
such as our crime prevention program, our efforts to improve 
youth justice, our intentions to address organized crime issues, 
which we have done, and our approach to firearms control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Bill C-236 seeks to return the system of gun control 
to the status it held before Bill C-68.  In so doing it ignores 
the benefits of better licensing screening.  It ignores the 
benefits of registration.  It ignores the cherry picking that 
members opposite are suggesting in terms of the legislation.  It 
is simply regressive legislation.  Above all it is not responsive 
to Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said before, and I will close on this point, that there is 
strong support across Canada for the direction we are taking.  We 
were re-elected on that point.  We are implementing a reasonable 
system that respects and encourages responsible firearm owners in 
the safe practice of their sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our legislation, which was ruled upheld by the Alberta Court of 
Appeal, respects the rights of responsible law-abiding gun owners 
at the same time as building a culture of safety in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today we have the opportunity to discuss Bill C-236, an act to 
repeal the Firearms Act and to make certain amendments to the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, sponsored by a Reform member, proposes the total 
repeal of the Firearms Act, nothing more and nothing less. 
Unfortunately, the hon. member seems unaware that there is a 
very strong consensus that a certain degree of firearms control 
is desired by the people of Canada and of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, in stating that the Firearms Act does not meet any real 
need, and consequently does nothing except unduly infringe upon 
the property rights of honest citizens, the hon. member is 
engaging in a debate that is pointless, to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prudence is in order when addressing the matter of gun control— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> —something the Reform members clearly 
lack this morning—in order to clearly grasp the issue as a whole.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be recognized that in proposing the 
repeal of the Firearms Act the hon. member appears to wish to 
defend a legitimate right, the right to unrestricted right of 
ownership.  The importance of that right cannot be 
overemphasized.  Enjoyment of property is a fundamental right, 
and one that is protected by a number of important legal 
instruments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, for example, section 8 of the charter of rights and 
freedoms recognizes the following: “No one may enter upon the 
property of another or take anything therefrom without his 
express or implied consent”.  The protection of right of 
ownership is nothing new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a common law principle four centuries old and well 
entrenched in law, which states “a man's home is his castle”. 
Therefore, one cannot intrude on someone else's property with 
impunity, without incurring the anger of his fellow men. 
However, it would be against good citizenship to contend that 
our rights can be exercized irrespective of the common good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gun use cannot be viewed from a strictly personal point of view. 
Any argument solely based on individual property rights would 
just not fly. Living in a community necessitates compromises 
and, sadly perhaps, gun registration is one of these 
compromises, these reasonable measures to ensure our collective 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Living in society requires limitations on the exercise of our 
rights. These limitations are justified when public interest is 
at stake. Combating crime is certainly a collective concern. 
Rights may legitimately be limited when the safety of our fellow 
citizens is the basis for the proposed measures. On the face of 
it, the firearms legislation met that criterion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As lawmakers, we could legitimately pass legislation for greater 
firearms control. We had to do it to ensure the safety of our 
children and the people around us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not fool ourselves: firearms are not like any other 
property, firearms can kill. In many cases, firearms are 
manufactured for a specific purpose: to harm or even to kill. 
That is not insignificant. Few if any people will argue with the 
fact that, even in the hands of conscientious individuals like 
police officers or hunters, firearms have all the makings of 
dangerous and potentially lethal weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of respect for the victims of the misuse of firearms, we had 
to do what was necessary.  As legislators, we had to approach 
this issue responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that, deep down, the Reform Party member is, as 
I am, very concerned about the safety of his fellow citizens. 
But suggesting that the Firearms Act be repealed is taking this 
concern much too far.  There is no denying—and I am choosing my 
words carefully here—that the legislation has a number of flaws, 
but this does not mean it should be repealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One flaw is undoubtedly the fact that the Liberal government is 
moving much too quickly, criminalizing something that should not 
be criminalized, in order to look good or cover up its failure 
to give the public what it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's bill is poorly drafted, costly and 
unenforceable, and the government has failed to build a 
consensus among the main groups of firearms users, particularly 
hunters and suppliers, who are fiercely opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, it is very important to remember that a gun control 
bill is primarily intended to reduce crime and bring about a 
drop in the number of accidents caused by the mishandling of 
firearms.  It is thus possible to be in favour of gun control 
but to question certain important aspects of the legislation, 
the unfortunate effects of which could have been avoided.  That 
is the position in which I find myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Reform Party member questions the very legitimacy 
of the Firearms Act, and that is where he loses me.  Repeal is 
not the same as improvement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>By suggesting that this legislation simply be scrapped, the

might lead to a workable consensus benefiting everyone.

I have great difficulty supporting such a bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to my colleague's private 
member's bill which I support fully. Before going directly to the 
bill I think we should pass out some warnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 1 Bill C-68 will come into effect.  We want to send 
a warning to all smugglers.  Bill C-68 is coming in, so all 
smugglers beware.  As of December 1 they can no longer smuggle 
guns as Bill C-68 will be in effect.  But wait a minute.  I 
thought smuggling was against the law long before Bill C-68 came 
in.  This is what is so hilarious about this government. Suddenly 
it has come up with a bill that is probably going to cost $1 
billion to implement.  It is going to stop such things as 
smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should send a warning out that effective December 1 all 
smuggling will cease.  Mind you, we do not have any officers at 
the borders to prevent a lot of the smuggling from happening.  We 
do not have money for that.  We cannot supply any more police 
officers to enforce this because they are going to be very busy 
with the paperwork. They have to register all these guns that are 
causing such a problem.  And according to their statistics that 
was totally false.  The head of the chiefs of police was quite 
concerned that they supported this bill on false information put 
out by this government.  He has been quoted from his letters to 
the justice minister as stating his disappointment about this 
false information being presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that smuggling is going to be stopped because of Bill 
C-68 is just another farce. I imagine smugglers are having a good 
time laughing about that one. At no time has this Liberal 
government taken any initiative to put a stop to smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing on the bridge at Port Erie I watched the traffic coming 
and going across the border. I watched boats going across the 
river.  I asked how they knew what was on the boats as no one was 
checking them.  They said “We watch from the bridge.  If they 
are like this, it is probably cigarettes; if it is like this, it 
could be booze; if it is like this, it is probably guns; and if 
it is like this, it is probably people.  So if it is like this, 
maybe we will go after it”.  They do not have any manpower.  I 
asked what was on a truck that was going through the line and 
they said they did not know.  I ask if there was somebody in 
pursuit and they said no, they did not have the manpower for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government comes out with this huge document giving Canada's 
justice minister all kinds of power and authority through order 
in council to change things, that it will make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two people were shot with shotguns in my riding.  The people who 
did that are really going to be in trouble.  They are going to 
face the Liberal law.  They will probably get a life sentence, 
although wait a minute, they will be paroled in 25 years.  I 
think that is mandatory.  But who knows, even with Liberal 
justice, under section 745 of the Criminal Code, they could be 
out in 15 years. Yet we are getting tough with Bill C-68.  Under 
Bill C-68 they will still get life and will have to be paroled in 
25 years and they will still have the opportunity for a section 
745 hearing.  That is Liberal justice.  And they wonder why 
people laugh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 this government was elected and it was going to do 
something with the Young Offenders Act.  It is almost 1999 and 
nothing has happened.  The attorneys general across Canada are 
asking the Minister of Justice “When are you going to do 
something with that act?”  Of course she is having a difficult 
time doing anything about it.  I understand her caucus is not in 
agreement with it, but then I think she is glad they are balking 
about changing the Young Offenders Act.  After all, it is a 
wonderful old Liberal document.  It was enacted in 1984. 
Since then youth crime has escalated like we would not believe 
and it still is going up.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are cries all across Canada. There is a member yapping off 
on the other side of the House. People in his riding are saying 
do something about youth crime.  Since 1993 the Liberals have 
done absolutely nothing. But we have Bill C-68.  According to the 
auditor general it is going to cost probably $1 billion to bring 
it into force.  That is the auditor general's figure.  We have 
already spent several hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at another thing.  In 1993 the government announced 
that there were over a million young people starving and in 
poverty in this country. Guess what it will announce in 1999. 
There are a million young people still living in poverty.  Why 
does the government not take the money it is wasting on such 
things as Bill C-68 and do something for the needy?  Why does it 
not take hundreds of millions of dollars and do something for 
them, instead of wasting its money on a document that will not 
have any effect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to those two people who were shot by shotguns in my 
riding, the next sometime somebody shoots somebody with a shotgun 
it will be registered.  That will make the victims feel much 
better.  I am sure a husband or a wife will be very glad that 
their spouse was shot with a registered shotgun. And the 
government wonders why people laugh at what it says.  Liberal 
justice is a joke and people laugh at jokes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an incident in Saskatchewan.  Mrs. Lorraine Dewetter's 
husband was out in the field and his half-ton pick-up got stuck. 
He died in the field from a heart attack.  The police discovered 
the fellow had a .410 gauge shotgun in the pickup.  They picked 
the shotgun up and rightfully so.  They went to the house to 
inform Mrs. Dewetter that her husband had died from a heart 
attack in the field. While they were there, they searched the 
house and confiscated three more weapons:  a .22, another 
shotgun, and I do not know what else, all because of such things 
as Bill C-68.  That is what those things bring in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to look at the history of registration it is not too 
difficult.  Look at it.  The main purpose of registration, 
regardless of what the Liberals say, is confiscation. That is the 
final result.  That is the purpose of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Justice is given the authority by order in 
council to declare which things are illegal and which are not, it 
is pretty easy to do.  Just start snapping fingers and they will 
make things illegal as they go along.  And then we are doing a 
great job of attacking the wrong people, the law-abiding people 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the criminals must think this is funny.  Sixty years of 
registration of handguns and we do not see much change. In fact 
it has gotten worse.  It did not solve any problems.  Then we 
heard from the parliamentary secretary.  I remember.  She had a 
great statement.  It is really important to get these 
registrations done because if we find a stolen gun, then we know 
to whom to return it.  That is worth a million or so.  It is 
worth spending lots of money on documents and using up a lot of 
police time to make sure that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what kind of a world the Liberals live in when 
they talk about justice.  People across this land are not happy 
at all with Canada's justice system. They want it changed. If, as 
I just heard, somebody would say to hang them, I would certainly 
believe there are those who probably would do just that.   Maybe 
we should ask the 11 or 12 families of the victims of Clifford 
Olson whether or not that should be the penalty.  Maybe we should 
take a little more seriously how people feel about the justice 
system, but the Liberals do not.

Code.  We have a safe storage law.  We have laws against the 
criminal use of firearms in the commission of a crime.  All those 
things are covered.  The only thing that is not covered is 
registration, and the government had to write a huge document

registration of firearms.  It spent over a billion dollars,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to take part in the 
debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill brought forward by the hon. member from the Reform 
Party is consistent with a long held position of the Conservative 
Party that the registry system under Bill C-68 is ill conceived 
and is in fact a reactionary piece of legislation that will not 
accomplish the goals it was set up to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the well intentioned persons who support the 
legislation have bought in the idea that somehow registering a 
shotgun will be an effective way for the government to respond to 
organized crime and violent crime, the sad reality is that this 
is not the case.  Millions and millions of dollars are being 
spent by the government as a ruse to somehow hold itself up as 
being in favour of tougher legislation when it comes to the 
criminal use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the legislation focuses on law-abiding 
citizens.  We have heard many members of the opposition and 
government members discuss who it will affect most.  It will 
affect most farmers, fishermen, sportsmen, hunters, collectors, 
and individuals presently engaged in an activity which under the 
current law they are lawfully entitled to do.  The legislation is 
now criminalizing with sanctions something that individuals 
participate in by their own free will, of their own volition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all reality one has to question the priorities of the 
government in the area of justice when it has decided to target 
law-abiding citizens as opposed to those who have been referred 
to on this side of the House as being the true criminals, those 
individuals who make the conscious decision to pick up a firearm 
and use it for an illegal purpose and not those individuals 
engaged in lawful activities which they are entitled to enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get down to the root of Bill C-68.  It is a tax on a 
law-abiding activity.  The cost of that bill has become somewhat 
prohibitive in the minds of Canadians when a person looks at what 
it will eventually attach as a price tag.  The initial assessment 
of the Minister of Justice who first dreamed up the piece of 
legislation was to be in the range of $85 million.   Within 
months of its passage and movement in the direction of the gun 
registry it became clear this was not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By September, the opening session of this year, 1998, the tab 
had run up to $133.1 million.  As we approach the start-up date 
of December 1, one can only assume that it is in the range of 
$200 million.  As the hon. member for Wild Rose mentioned there 
are estimates in the range of $500 million to $1 billion, to 
which he received a lot of heckling and acrimony from the 
government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much does it cost in human life?  Not one iota of evidence 
suggests that the legislation will save lives.  Not one bit of 
linkage, statistical or otherwise, shows that registering 
shotguns will somehow save lives.  That is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police reaction to Bill C-68 is quite interesting.  There 
have been statistics from the Canadian Police Association.  The 
Canadian Chiefs of Police have spoken in favour of it.  However, 
frontline police officers, those who are tasked with 
administering and enforcing the legislation, will tell us very 
quickly that they would far rather spend their time and efforts 
fighting real crime, not going with warrants to individual houses 
based on some premise that they might have a gun stored there 
illegally or that they might have an unregistered gun. 
They would far rather spend their time and efforts fighting real 
crime, not going with warrants to individual houses based on 
some premise that they might have a gun stored there illegally or 
that they might have, more important, to tie it to the 
legislation, an unregistered gun.  It will become an 
overbureaucratic, time consuming exercise.  Police officers admit 
they could spend their time in a far more effective and 
worthwhile effort helping to keep Canadian streets free from 
crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One questions the priorities.  One questions the emphasis the 
government has placed on Bill C-68.  Let us talk about how the 
bill was originally sold to the general public.  There were 
tremendous statistics showing that the criminal use of shotguns 
and long guns was impacting on a rise in violent crime.  The 
assistant commissioner of the RCMP wrote to the government and 
said “Wait a minute.  These statistics are wrong.  This is not 
true”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics were spun to effectively support the 
government's position that these guns had to be registered. These 
statistics were wrong.  They were grossly exaggerated 10 or 100 
times.  The same statistics were used in the Supreme Court of 
Alberta in arguing a case which favoured the government by a slim 
three to two majority.  It has now been appealed further to the 
Supreme Court of Canada.  It begs the question why the government 
is to go ahead with the registry on December 1 knowing that it is 
before the courts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always possible when a case goes before the court that 
judges in their wisdom decide legislation is unconstitutional. It 
appears that more and more of the provinces and the territories 
are joining in this effort, this court action, to somehow 
question the government priority on the issue.  If that happens, 
why would we spend more money?  It is another blatant waste of 
money by the government, throwing bad money after bad to somehow 
preempt the court.  One has to question why the government is 
choosing to do this, knowing that a court challenge is pending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note the absence of members of the NDP from 
this debate.  They have been all over the board when it comes to 
gun registry.  It would have been interesting to hear their 
remarks with respect to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spin doctoring that has taken place is something of note. It 
is increasingly discouraging for Canadians to hear the government 
misquote statistics and their wishes in the Chamber and outside 
the Chamber when it comes to gun registry.  One can always find 
statistics to support a position.  That is not a difficult thing 
to do.  However when one goes into the court of public opinion, 
one hears a completely different version of what Canadians want 
with respect to gun registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very clear in stating that the Progressive 
Conservative Party is very much in favour of gun control and gun 
registry, for that matter, when it comes to pistols, the weapon 
of choice, but registering long guns is simply asinine.  It is 
going in the wrong direction when it comes to trying to fight 
crime, organized crime or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Efforts should be put into shoring up our borders, into putting 
more money into policing budgets which we know have been 
drastically cut, and into better legislation aimed at organized 
crime or more sanctions for the criminal use of firearms.  I am 
sure Canadians would applaud the government for those efforts if 
it were moving in that direction, but that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spin doctoring that has gone on is remarkable.  The 
government has become very good at it.  It has high priced 
individuals who spin its positions and tell Canadians effectively 
what it wants Canadians to believe.  This is incredibly 
irresponsible on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of Bill C-68 are very negligible.  One only has to 
look again at the government's use of statistics.  Where are the 
statistics the government is relying on to say that it will save 
lives?  They are completely absent from the debate because they 
do not exist.  Is that not what it is all about?  Should criminal 
justice not be about protecting people and saving lives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 does not measure up.  It does not meet those 
requirements.  That is why we are supporting the private member's 
bill that has been brought forward.  Let us end it now.  Let us 
stop spending money and throwing bad money after bad to try to 
register long arms and shotguns that are not weapons of choice 
when it comes to crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost is only one aspect of the legislation, the cost and the 
use the government has made of these statistics.  Thousands and 
thousands of Canadians appeared on Parliament Hill at the 
beginning of this session to express their outrage as to what 
would happen with this tax, this burdensome bureaucracy that will 
be put in place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 is not indicative of what Canadians want.  If 
anything, Canadians are crying out for a system that is simpler, 
more direct and delivers what it is supposed to deliver to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 certainly does not deliver justice.  It creates a 
false expectation for police and citizens.  Police officers are 
already labouring under a CPIC system that they cannot rely on to 
be accurate.  To suggest that we will have a national gun 
registry which will prevent a police officer from going to a 
house and knocking on the door, knowing there is or is not a gun 
behind that door, is completely asinine.  It will not give the 
confidence police officers need to carry out their task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the reasons I put forward to support this private 
member's bill and I urge other members, particularly my 
colleagues in the NDP, to do the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate although I must say that was 
not my intention when I arrived here a few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For six weeks all parties on this side of the House have been 
engaged in directing questions toward the Prime Minister, the 
Deputy Prime Minister and solicitor general about what he did or 
did not say on October 1 on that now infamous airplane ride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly a lot of us, certainly in our caucus and in I suspect in 
other opposition caucuses, would have preferred to talk about 
other things than whether the solicitor general would stay in his 
post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A farm crisis is going on in Saskatchewan.  There is the 
employment insurance issue which my colleague from 
Acadie—Bathurst is trying to raise.  What should we do with 
budget surpluses?  There are any number of questions, but because 
of the intransigence of the government we have been stuck dealing 
with the future of the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a private member's bill which talks about something 
that will not be decided by the House of Commons until the 
Supreme Court of Canada rules some time down the road.  The 
Alberta Court of Appeal ruled after September 21.  The Reform 
opposition party members could not wait.  Never mind uniting the 
right.  They were busily concerned about uniting themselves by 
having the motion on firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case is going to the Supreme Court of Canada.  It will not 
be decided here.  It was decided here between 1993 and 1997 when 
Bill C-68 passed the House of Commons.  I was not in the House at 
that time.  I do not know whether it is a good bill or a bad 
bill, but I know that it will not come back to the House at least 
until the Supreme Court rules against it.  Why are we wasting the 
time of the House of Commons and of the people of Canada talking 
about something that is totally irrelevant? 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is no surprise to me that the NDP member who spoke to 
bill has not even read it.  That is quite typical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 was sold to the Canadian public and the House under 
extreme false pretences.  We like to talk about the Alberta court 
and what happened there.  Need I remind the House that four of 
the five judges said that it was an infringement on provincial 
jurisdiction.  Due to the government saying that it was a 
criminal act they decided three to two that the federal 
government had that right to infringe on provincial jurisdiction 
under a criminal act. Even that was sold as a guise to the 
Canadian public.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to enact 
legislation that most law abiding citizens who 
own firearms will probably not comply with in the first place. 
While we are doing this I remind the government of its 
responsibility.  The government's foremost responsibility is to 
the safety and well-being of its law abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government do when it was at fault in terms of the 
legislation to compensate all hep C victims who contacted hep C 
through the tainted blood system?  It said that we had no funds. 
It said it could not afford to pay them, but it can afford to put 
hundreds of millions of dollars into firearms registration while 
those with tainted blood are dying.  I have to ask where the 
government's priorities are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years navy merchant marines have been fighting to be duly 
compensated for their war efforts.  These people have suffered, 
been left maimed and some have died in acts of war in order to 
feed our troops, yet this government has stated time after time 
that there are not enough funds to pay these people but it can 
spend hundreds and millions of dollars on a useless act causing 
total disagreement across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder where the government's priorities are. 
Government members will say anything to be re-elected, in order 
to come back to the House, but they think nothing at all of the 
true victims. Instead they would impose another tax or levy on 
law abiding citizens of Canada, which is shameful.  I hope those 
people on the other side can sleep at night when they enforce 
this act after they read the letters of those suffering from hep 
C.  It is a disgrace.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>REPORT STAGE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK17">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 17 consideration of Bill C-53, 
an act to increase the availability of financing for the 
establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement of small 
businesses, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and 
of Motions Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I might say that the vote that we just had is somewhat 
alarming in that in the last parliament closure was moved 35 
times either by time allocation or by closure motions.  In this 
parliament we find that already time allocation has been moved 
nine times, including the bill we are now debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk with people in the community I talk with them in 
private more often than in public because in private people are 
more apt to say things which they would not otherwise disclose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment that we are debating is designed to prevent one 
family member who is part owner of a small business from taking 
out a loan if another family member has already done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to financing for small business, we only hear of 
the times when it proves to be successful.  What the government 
never hears about are the disastrous effects of ill-conceived 
loans.  It is my purpose this afternoon to draw this to the 
attention of the House.  I could go from now to midnight talking 
about what is designed to be a positive thing which turns out in 
fact to be a negative thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure hon. members opposite that it is not very pleasant 
to sit in the kitchen with people who have run a third generation 
family business and hear their story about being put out of 
business because of a government loan to a competitor while they 
continued to struggle to survive and eventually lost their 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a rare occurrence.  It is very common throughout 
Saskatchewan.  Depending upon whom a person knows at the right 
time, which could be a politician, they get a loan to build a 
business in an area when that general trading area cannot support 
another business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw the attention of the House to a couple of 
instances.  There were four eating establishments in a small 
town. Of those eating establishments, three of the four were 
family businesses.  They had been family businesses since the 
town virtually began.  All of sudden two of those businesses 
received big government loans, one in excess of $100,000 and one 
in excess of $125,000. 
The total pie was divided.  There was not sufficient business to 
support those six eating establishments in that town.  Two of the 
businesses which were struggling went under, while the other two 
businesses which received the government grants continued. I 
might add that one of them is now closed.  We never hear what 
happens when government makes small business loans which create 
competition for a family business or some other business which is 
struggling to survive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a long list of names.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars 
have been paid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a small cafe owner who had always paid his local 
taxes.  He was a part of the community and supported every 
activity in the town.  Government money came in, his money in 
effect, and another business moved in and forced him to dilute 
his business to the extent that it is no longer a profitable 
organization.  Did that happen once?  Not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the budget and the amount of money that is given 
to small business we never know how many times it happens.  I 
could take two hours going through all of the business places I 
know of that have gone out of business because the government, 
with disregard, put money into an area which could not support 
another business of that nature.  It is a sad story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of as many people who have been desperately hurt and 
ruined by the Small Business Loans Act as I do of those who have 
prospered.  The government only tells us about those businesses 
which have prospered.  In all fairness, we need to look from 
coast to coast to see those who have been hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of members to another incident.  This was 
in a fair sized town where there were two bakeries.  Again they 
were both family enterprises.  They were both doing well.  They 
both supported their community.  They were both engaged in such 
things as the town council.  A person came in who knew the right 
person at the right time and a loan was floated.  That loan was 
in excessive of $140,000.  As a result, that person was able to 
keep going on government funding until they put a community owned 
bakery out of business.  There was not enough business to support 
three bakeries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is designed to stop a current practice.  This motion 
has been put forward to prevent one family member who is part 
owner of a small business from taking out a loan if another 
family member has already done so.  In other words, at present it 
is possible for an individual who is a member of a family running 
a business to get another loan.  Even though the first loan was 
not under his name, he can take out another loan for a different 
purpose when the business is already operating with a government 
loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing?  We do not have a careful watchdog to monitor 
who is getting the loans and for what purpose.  I am not just 
talking about the banks which guarantee the loans.  In my 
province we have business development corporations that would be 
a better source to inform the government under this loan 
procedure as to what business is most likely to succeed without 
hurting the businesses already in place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I come from I cannot afford nor do I have the time to sit 
and listen to those people in my cities, towns and in some cases 
my villages who have been totally put out of business and have 
moved simply because government money is going in opposition to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should reconsider this bill because a person does 
not deserve to lose his or her business of three generations and 
be wiped out with government money going in opposition to their 
business which has probably been in existence over the last 50 or 
60 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the government would consider this motion which I will be 
supporting. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to support the amendments put forward by my 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will do two things.  First, they will lower the 
maximum of a small business loan from $250,000 to $100,000. 
Second, they will prevent a second family member from obtaining a 
small business loan for a business when one has already been 
granted to another family member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to comment on this whole small business loans 
program which, again with all due respect, I think has completely 
gone down the wrong track in what we are doing for the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill essentially will put $1.5 billion into the small 
business loans program where businesses that do not qualify for 
any other funding, that have been turned down by the banks and 
financial institutions for various reasons, would then try to 
obtain financing from the small business loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue this is the wrong approach.  These people 
obviously are a higher risk.  We are using taxpayer money as a 
poor investment.  We are giving it to the worst business plans of 
this country, the businesses that are most likely to go broke and 
most likely to go bankrupt.  The taxpayers will receive zero 
dollars on their investment.  We are throwing money at bad 
business plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue it is the role of government to be responsible for 
introducing legislation in this House that ensures there will be 
a strong economic climate.  Again, I do not necessarily support 
subsidizing business after business by throwing money at it. 
Instead, we should be creating an economic climate where 
businesses can survive without government subsidies.  In essence 
that is what this is.  That is what we have failed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My home province of British Columbia is in an absolute crisis 
state.  As an example we can look at the forest industry in 
British Columbia.  Many of my colleagues from British Columbia 
can attest to the fact that one of the principal reasons the 
forest industry and the business climate in the forest sector is 
in a crisis situation is largely government policy and the 
direction the government has been going in both provincially and 
federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cannot be let off the hook.  It has 
created an economic climate, due to the quota system with the 
United States, where British Columbia has now lost a significant 
part of its quota to eastern Canada.  The mills are suffering 
incredibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking with the senior forester in one of the forest 
product companies in British Columbia over the weekend.  He tells 
me that their wood costs in 1994 were $43 a metre.  Today their 
wood costs are $83 a metre.  This has almost doubled.  I asked 
him why they had doubled and what had caused the cost of the wood 
landed in the mill to be double to what it was three or four 
years ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said strictly government policy, both federal and provincial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a big defender of small businesses.  They are the economic 
backbone of this country.  If we are to have successful 
businesses, let us not do it with government subsidies.  We have 
the government saying here is $1.5 billion available for small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the ones that probably are struggling and will survive 
do not have access to this.  Again, only the highest risk 
business plans are going to get access to this.  We may never 
recover this money.  I would argue very little we will recover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gives out but takes right back through high 
payroll taxes.  The EI premiums are billions of dollars higher 
than what they should be.  The list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking with small business owners, even very small businesses 
with only a few employees, they say they get government forms, 
both federal and provincial, in the mail two or three times a 
week.  It never ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A full time bookkeeper is needed to keep up with the 
bureaucracy, the paperwork, whether it is the GST or the payroll 
tax forms or worker compensation forms. Some of them are 
provincial but the list goes on and on.  How can they possibly 
survive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our role as legislators to cut that down, break down these 
barriers.  What kind of taxes are these companies paying?  Can 
they be competitive?  It goes further.  Some of our most 
entrepreneurial people who should be creating these small 
businesses are running down south of us to the U.S. the day after 
they leave school. Why?  Because of the economic climate in this 
country.  Why?  Because of the taxes they pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People pay double the taxes to our friends to the south.  These 
are realities.  These are the things the government should be 
focusing on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small business loans program has been around for a long 
time, which would only reinforce that the government is 
absolutely prepared to accept the status quo.  It thinks things 
are just fine.  Let us not change, just send out another $1.5 
billion and that will take care of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people cannot go to the bank.  They get turned down and 
then go to the finance companies and get turned down there.  They 
cannot raise any money, but we will give them some taxpayer 
money.  We likely will never see it again because their business 
plans are flawed to begin with.  The point I am trying to make is 
that government subsidies are not the answer. It has been proven 
time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the fishing industry on the east coast in 
Newfoundland and the Atlantic provinces.  What has this 
government done since 1993?  It has spend $2 billion paying 
fishermen to sit at home and wait for the fish to come back but 
it has not changed anything within the department and how it 
operates.  It has not looked at the root problems.  It has not 
focused on anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea was to throw money at it and hopefully the problems 
will solve themselves.  It accepted the status quo.  That is not 
good enough.  We need change. It is the same thing with the small 
business plan. That analogy can be drawn with small business 
people. Throwing money at them and saying go create a new 
business, we will create another level of bureaucracy to help 
them with their bankruptcy in six months is not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to create an economic climate where these businesses 
will thrive, where they will create employment, where they will 
be valuable contributors to their local economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not doing that.  It is in every sector whether fishing, 
forestry or mining.  All these areas are suffering. We have our 
heads buried in the sand.  We are not looking at it. Now the 
government has forced time allocation.  It will shut the debate 
off on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I plead with the government to look at the real problem. 
Travel to British Columbia to some of these interior communities. 
Go up to Lumby.  Go down to Duncan.  Go into Cranbrook.  Go up 
to Prince George and see what is happening. 
One and a half billion dollars in the small business loans 
program will not solve anything.  It will just be a high risk. If 
that is what the government is going to do it might as well go 
down to Vegas and dump it into a slot machine.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will argue I am against the small business programs.  I am 
not.  I will stand up and fight for small businesses.  But I 
would do it differently.  I would ensure that they have a strong 
economic climate.  I would ensure that they are not being taxed 
to death on payroll taxes.  It can be done without government 
subsidies.  If I can leave one message, the answer to our 
problems is not government subsidies.  It is our job to create 
the economic climate where they can survive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to lend support to Bill C-53 and to join in the debate 
around the motions that have been put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada small business financing act is designed to assist 
small business.  We in the NDP feel strongly that small 
businesses are a very important part of our community, a very 
vital part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that small and medium size businesses are an integral 
part of successful communities.  I am sure that all of us can 
think of our various communities and point to many of the small 
businesses within our communities, whether they be construction 
companies, restaurants or information technology businesses, and 
we can see examples of people who are working hard, people who 
are dedicated, people who put in long hours to earn their living 
and to contribute in a meaningful way to our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of a small business in my riding of Halifax West, a 
small family restaurant.  I go there sometimes in the morning for 
breakfast. I am served the most beautiful breakfasts, home cooked 
by the lady who operates this restaurant. This business creates 
an aura of hospitality, an aura of friendliness within the 
community.  A lot of the local people come to that restaurant. 
They sit there and talk over the affairs of their community. 
They relate one on one with their neighbours.  There is an 
atmosphere which is really good to see, people in the community 
interacting around this family business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is also very noticeable that the owner of this business 
works very hard.  She is in there first thing in the morning. 
She bakes homemade goods.  She then deals with the customers who 
come in on their way to work.  She is going all day.  At the end 
of the day she has worked very hard and many long hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996-97 small businesses created 81% of all new jobs, we are 
told.  In 1997-98 small firms with fewer than 49 employees 
created 56,516 new jobs.  Of the businesses operating in 1989, 
51% were still operating in 1995.  This is a testament of the 
endurance of these small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to realize that the people who operate 
these small businesses are people of integrity.  They are people 
of honesty and they are people who would not necessarily take 
advantage of the programs that are being offered in a negative 
way.  It bothers me when I hear Reform talking about not making 
things easier for people to access loans and to have help with 
their businesses.  The inference is almost that these people will 
automatically take advantage of the grants and the programs 
available.  But we must realize that most people in their small 
businesses are people of honesty and integrity and they are 
people who want to succeed.  If we as a government, if we as a 
society, can help them, we certainly should be doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that I urge all members in the House to 
give full support to the kinds of initiatives and the kinds of 
effort which will assist small business persons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments of the 
member for Halifax West.  I think he misconstrues the intent of 
the amendments in Group No. 2, which is to protect existing small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully concur with his remarks concerning the little 
restaurant, the great service he gets and how hard the owner 
works.  Full marks for that lady and full marks for the business. 
These amendments are aimed at preventing somebody from moving in 
and setting up another restaurant right beside it and getting a 
government loan which would allow it to unfairly compete and put 
that poor woman out of business. We have seen that happen in 
Saskatchewan. It is not an uncommon phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my part of Saskatchewan and in that part represented by the 
hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain the towns and villages are 
dying.  The small businesses that remain are hanging on by their 
fingernails.  When another business moves in to a place where 
there cannot possibly be room for two, and that business has a 
small business loan or a government grant, the business that is 
already there and just barely hanging on goes down first.  Then 
the business that came in with government help usually goes down 
within a couple of years because it does not have the feel for 
the market nor does it have the skills of the business that had 
survived in that place for two or three generations. Instead of 
having one struggling business making it on its own, we end up 
with nothing, thanks to the beneficence of our government in 
backing these loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of interference with the marketplace is not good for 
society.  I am not here to get into a long ideological harangue 
about the free market.  We can debate that at another time and in 
another place.  I am sure the hon. member for Halifax West and I 
could have a wonderful time debating that. We are debating a 
specific government bill and some proposed amendments to it 
which, in our eyes, would make it a better bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are men and women in small business on the benches 
opposite.  I have talked to some of them and they appear to be 
very reasonable folks.  I think that in their hearts they 
understand what we are talking about in these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be surprised if there is a member in this House who has 
not had someone say to him or her “A new business has opened 
just down the street from an existing business providing a 
similar type of service in my hometown.  It looks like the new 
business is going to put the old one out of business.  We think 
it must have got a small business loan or a grant”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is this cynical outlook. Whenever anybody starts a 
business in a place where conditions do not look good, the public 
immediately concludes it was done with government help and by 
George, I think that 90% of the time the public is right.  That 
is not the way to run a country.  However when push comes to 
shove and the big shepherd holds up his staff, those people over 
there who understand this phenomenon and who are small business 
people all say “baa” in unison and the bill passes. This is not 
parliament as it was intended to be, which brings me to the 
matter of time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now debating with a gun at our heads.  In the 35th 
Parliament the government used time allocation 32 times and 
closure three times. 
In this the 36th Parliament the government has already used time 
allocation nine times.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of calling this the House of Commons, perhaps we should 
rename it the Dumas or the Reichstag because this is not 
parliament as parliament was intended to be.  This is contrary to 
300 years of tradition.  It is contrary to the way that this 
parliament operated for the first half century or more of its 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe closure was first used in this House by Borden.  It 
was used extremely sparingly right up until the Trudeau 
administration.  Then they started to lay it on heavier.  Even 
that administration did not use it as many times in the several 
incarnations that it had as this government has used it in the 
last five years. The Mulroney government used it more extensively 
and with a heavier hand than the Trudeau administration but it 
was still a piker compared to this administration which is now 
routinely using it. The government uses time allocation time 
after time after time, no pun intended, and for no reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is an extremely important bill in the hopper and the 
opposition is being a little obstreperous and the bill has to get 
through or the country will collapse the next day at six o'clock 
in the morning, then yes.  The technique was put in for a reason, 
but it was not put in to be used frivolously or habitually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an affront to the traditions of parliamentary democracy. 
It is an affront which is practised routinely by this government. 
That is wrong.  We have to get back to the tradition that 
parliament, not cabinet, but parliament is the overall authority 
in the country.  Regardless of what the cabinet wants, parliament 
should be free to debate the issues of the day for as long as 
parliament wants and in any way it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heavy-handed manipulation has to stop. The whole institution 
is falling into disrepute.  Unfortunately, people outside this 
place do not take us very seriously any more. I am sure, Mr. 
Speaker, you have run into comments of this nature in your 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About three or four years ago I was severely taken to task by a 
clergyman in my riding for having made a comment to the effect 
that under the system of parliamentary democracy as it has 
evolved in Canada, we now have a system of an elected 
dictatorship somewhat akin to what there was in certain periods 
in ancient Rome.  He was irate.  He said that was disrespectful 
of the country and its traditions.  A few weeks ago I met this 
gentleman at a function and he said “You were right”.   And I 
was right.  This place is decaying because we no longer observe 
the democratic traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad thing for me to have to stand and make these remarks 
about an institution of which I am a part, but I think it is time 
for a little honesty and a little truth.  I am not alone in my 
views.  This view is widely held outside this place. It is 
hurting us, it is hurting the institution, and it is severely

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to this group of amendments today.  I find it rather 
interesting that with over 150 Liberal members in this present 
government, none of them feel compelled to get up and defend why 
these amendments should not pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that part of a debate is to put both sides of an issue 
on the table and to argue back and forth the merits of the case. 
What we have here today is a government which is totally 
abdicating its democratic responsibility.  The Liberals not only 
do not want to debate this matter themselves, they just want to 
ram it through, but they have also said we cannot debate it. 
Both of these are rather insulting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is insulting that the government would use its majority to 
force through a closure motion, or time allocation as it is 
technically called, in order to restrict the length of time of 
the debate. It is also very insulting that the Liberals will not 
engage me in debate.  I am really nonplussed by it. The silence 
on the other side probably says that they will support this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am debating with someone, for example if I have a 
difference of opinion with one of my children, we debate things 
back and forth.  I will say something and my son will say 
something else.  We will go back and forth giving opposing points 
of view. Eventually we have to come to an agreement.  I hope it 
does not characterize me as a soft father when I say that 
sometimes things go my way and sometimes my son is able to 
convince me of his point of view and things will go his way. That 
is what the process of debate is about.  We do not have that here 
which is most regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as the government has used its majority to ram through the 
time allocation motion, it is also going to use its majority to 
pull the strings of the members opposite who will then dutifully 
vote against these amendments.  These are good amendments.  These 
are amendments which protect the taxpayer.  These amendments 
protect businesses across the country.  These amendments really 
are worthwhile. The government will not tell us its reasons for 
opposing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if this is parliamentary but I will be corrected 
if it is not.  Is it because the government members are cowards? 
That is asked as a question so I hope the Speaker does not stop 
me.  It is just a question.  Why are the government members 
afraid to defend their position on this debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will go ahead and use this process and ram 
through whatever it thinks is right.  We see this over and over 
in this government.  We saw it big time when we were discussing 
the wheat board issue.  This government was totally out of touch 
with the aspirations of farmers in western Canada. The government 
used time allocation, used closure debate and control of its 
members, even from the west, in order to do something which is 
diametrically opposed to what Canadian farmers need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I am straying a bit from the specific amendments that we 
are talking about but I am using it to illustrate a very 
important point.  The point is that democracy only works when we 
have true representation from the members who were sent here and 
elected by the people in their respective ridings.  I wish that 
would actually occur.  Instead we have another dog and pony show 
where the master in the centre of the ring snaps the whip and 
everybody else jumps through the hoops on cue.  It is very 
depressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for me to say a few things about the actual 
amendments.  We should recognize a couple of things. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely true that small business is one of the most 
important factors in a vibrant economy, and in Canada there is no 
doubt that is the case.   We are told over and over again that 
the highest proportion of jobs are created by small business. The 
role of the government should definitely be to provide an 
environment in which small business can thrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe quite strongly in the principle of free enterprise.  I 
believe very much in the forces of the free marketplace in 
determining who is successful and who is not.  I have observed 
over and over in my short life that individuals who have been 
risk takers and hard workers very often have good luck. There 
seems to be a correlation there.  Those who are timid and pull 
back say “I want everybody else to look after me”.  In Canada 
we often think there is an inalienable right that “I do not have 
to work. I do not have to take any risks.  Somebody else has an 
obligation to look after me and my family”.  This has become a 
way of thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have genuine concern for the many who have absolute needs such 
as those who are disabled and cannot work.  We will make sure 
they do not suffer.  However there are many people who are able 
bodied.  We now have a string of governments that has arranged 
the affairs of the country in such a way that the motivation for 
people to take risks, to do things that are unusual, to work 
hard, to get up early and to go to sleep late because they are 
working hard all day, has been somewhat taken away.  A principle 
has been adopted that somehow it is an appropriate role of 
government to take away from the person who has earned it and to 
use it to subsidize the person who has not earned it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business is important but we need to be careful the public 
policy we develop is such that small business can survive and 
thrive because it is successful, not because of having made the 
correct political donations to the correct party and thereby 
being eligible for subsidies from the government, which is a 
legalized form of taking away from the person who earned it and 
giving it to the person who did not earn it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I opposed to small business loans?  Absolutely not.  I have 
had experience with loans.  I was fortunate in the sense that my 
partner and I had a good business plan and good backing.  We went 
to an ordinary bank, got a loan, got our business started and 
away it went.  I wish I could say that it was very successful, 
but unfortunately it was in the farming industry and in the end 
it did not work out that well, again partially because of 
government policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that some people have very good ideas but do not 
have the capital or have not accumulated capital in their 
lifetime to be able to access loans.  In this amendment we are 
saying that perhaps there is a role to play.  I know that my 
colleagues and I have had representations from some individuals 
who say the Small Business Loans Act and the small business 
financing act have some merit and have helped people to get on 
their feet who otherwise would never have been able to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make sure that we do not put the taxpayers at a huge risk 
that ordinary financial institutions are not willing to take.  If 
the bank down the street is not willing to give an individual 
with a business plan a loan, maybe it is because the business 
plan is not workable.  Maybe it is because there are too many 
flaws.  Maybe it is because the individual has not demonstrated a 
record of financial accountability. 
For us to say that we should limit the value of the loan is a 
valid comment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to 
the amendments to the legislation.  I want to give brief 
consideration to why I am a little concerned about the 
legislation in terms of dealing with funding to small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When funding businesses government does not often look at 
whether or not the businesses are new or whether they will be in 
competition with existing businesses that have not had government 
funding.  People who have worked very hard, made sacrifices over 
a number of years, and built up businesses in communities often 
find themselves suddenly confronted with a government subsidized 
business that is working in competition with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the business person who has worked for a number of years to 
establish a business it does not seem fair that the government is 
subsidizing someone to actually work in competition with them in 
an unfair and unequal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask what is the priority of government in funding 
small businesses and what the parameters of the decision to fund 
them should be.  A colleague of mine has put forward an amendment 
that no two people in the same family can apply for a loan for 
the same business.  This shows that the legislation has serious 
flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a business cannot get funding from a traditional source and 
goes to a government source of funding, it would only make sense 
that it be very controlled as to the risks of the taxpayer.  It 
should be quite obvious although not explicit that the government 
should show due diligence in making sure that there is only one 
loan going to a particular family business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another motion under Group No. 2 talks about the level of 
funding that should be available.  The amendment is suggesting 
that the level of $250,000 as set out in the legislation is far 
too extravagant.  It is too great of a risk for taxpayers to put 
funds into a business that cannot get funding through a 
traditional source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will expand upon that concept.  We have banks.  As a matter of 
fact we now have a commitment from two major banks to establish a 
single bank responsible for lending money to small businesses. 
They have committed a substantial number of dollars solely to 
funding small businesses.  If I remember a comment made by the 
CEO of the Royal Bank not too long ago, presently only a portion 
of that funding is used.  I believe the number he mentioned was 
something like 70% to 80%.  This means that 20% of the funds put 
aside for small businesses has not even been lent out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are applying for support from a government agency 
for whatever reason, and generally it is because the risk is too 
great, have not been given funding from traditional sources. 
When we start asking taxpayers to risk a maximum of $250,000 per 
applicant we are asking them to put at risk a fairly large sum of 
money. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the average size of loans made under the 
old program was only $65,000.  We have to ask why the government 
would feel it should raise the maximum loan amount from $100,000 
to $250,000 when the average loan is only $65,000.  It seems to 
me that the $100,000 was plenty.  It allowed some discretion on 
the part of loans officer or the people putting together the 
finance package.  It allowed them a considerable amount of 
support.  The fact that most successful applicants only get 
two-thirds of it shows that $100,000 was adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to question why the government feels it is necessary to 
amend the legislation.  Why does the government feel it is 
necessary to put that kind of financial support behind small 
businesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been a small business person I do not want to say that 
the government has no role to play.  However I am not convinced 
through my experience with community leadership.  I watched 
governments fund industries that had no hope of success.  The 
government ended up having to eat the investment in industries 
that had no hope of success.  I have seen governments do the same 
with small businesses.  I have to ask whether it should be an 
area of federal government involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no business in areas of responsibility where 
it is not needed.  This is one area where we have private 
institutions, banks, credit unions and other areas where people 
can get financial help.  If they cannot it is often because their 
proposal is not solid enough.  Maybe individuals need to be 
encouraged to make sure their business plans, concepts and ideas 
are solid enough to make their own sacrifice and not look to the 
taxpayers to make a like sacrifice for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great difficulty supporting the legislation although some 
of the amendments proposed by colleagues, particularly the 
amendment limiting the number of family members who can apply for 
a loan and lowering or keeping the level at $100,000 instead of 
$250,000, gives me an opportunity to say I can support it to a 
lesser degree.  I question whether the federal government would 
be satisfying more Canadian taxpayers and Canadians in general if 
it were to put that kind of money into health care, education and 
those areas where Canadians feel the federal government should 
put its dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all I will say on the bill and amendments.  I want to 
take a few minutes to talk about the government's response to 
debate on the legislation.  It is deplorable that the government 
has chosen one more time to seek closure on debate.  I question 
that in any democracy a government should have the right to say, 
because it does not agree with what we have to say, that it will 
not allow us to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful the government continues to use closure to limit 
debate and to try to minimize any criticism on the legislation it 
brings before the House.  If it honestly feels that the 
legislation it brings before the House is good, it should not 
have any problem with people challenging and debating it.  If the 
government cannot defend it in the House of Commons perhaps it 
should withdraw the legislation and come up with something that 
is better and meets the needs of the Canadian public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, after 
listening to the comments today I am a little surprised at what 
appears to be a lack of knowledge of Bill C-53.  I say that with 
all due respect to my colleagues who have just spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members seem to think that there are no fees involved in this 
loan and that people who qualify for small business loans do not 
necessarily pay for them.  The fact is that they pay 
administration fees and higher rates of interest.  The loans are 
there to help those businesses which otherwise would not be able 
to get loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I want to speak specifically to the motions 
that were presented in Group No. 2.  The first motion, presented 
by the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt, proposes that persons 
not be related.  Obviously he has not read clause 3 where it is 
already defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he would recall correctly from our discussions at committee, 
we had a very long and lengthy discussion on this very topic when 
we discussed the proposed regulations that will be coming down 
later.  As a committee we wanted to ensure that everyone is 
entitled to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also wanted to ensure that one business is not beyond the 
aggregate amount, which I believe is already covered in the bill 
and regulations will further define it.  As well, we wanted to 
ensure that if a husband and wife are in separate businesses 
neither one is prohibited from being able to apply for funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to speak briefly to Motion No. 3.  This is a 
proposal that would reduce the loan amount under the program to 
$100,000 from $250,000.  Again I think it would be important for 
members opposite to go back and read the testimony that we heard 
at committee, the discussions that took place and to look at the 
groups that appeared, the witnesses and those who had benefited 
from the Small Business Loans Act in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that even representatives of the Canadian Federation 
of Independent Business said we should not go back.  They 
suggested that it stay at $250,000.  They suggested that it not 
be raised.  They said that in the past they would have liked to 
have seen it lowered, but now that it is there we should not go 
back.  They also suggested that we look at the types of 
businesses, and that is being done.  They suggested that we look 
at who needs assistance and where the difficulties are in lending 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my colleagues on the other side that the average loan 
amount is around $60,000 to $70,000 under the SBLA presently. 
Even though the limit is $250,000, the majority are falling much 
below that.  There is no research at the present time which 
proves that larger loans pose any greater risk than smaller 
loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several groups appeared before the committee.  We asked the 
opposition for witnesses.  The only groups that came before us to 
discuss the SBLA were those which had used the SBLA and were 
successful businesses.  Some had borrowed to the tune of the 
$250,000 limit.  Some of them told us that if the limit of 
$250,000 had not been there they would not be in business today. 
They have gone on to develop businesses that are worth $2 million 
or $3 million. Those businesses started with a small government 
assistance loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that the assistance is paid for by higher than 
normal rates.  If these businesses could go to a bank and get a 
regular small business loan without the assistance of the 
government or a guarantee then they would pay a lesser rate of 
interest.  They are paying more money for this loan, but they are 
still doing well in their businesses.  They were able to make it 
and survive once they got their foot in the door.  If it was not 
for the government's guarantee they would not have been able to 
get that loan and they would not be in business today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 is pretty straightforward.  Motion No. 5 is very 
much a housekeeping amendment because when the bill was 
originally introduced there were 85 loans under the Fisheries 
Improvement Loans Act that were still in existence.  Those will 
soon be taken off the books, so we are just trying to ensure that 
the act and the legislation as it is written is as clean and 
understandable as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to talk about the successes of 
the Small Business Loans Act, the importance of continuing it, 
the new name for it—the Canada small business financing act—and 
the fact that so many businesses today will be able to get their 
foot in the door because it exists.  The guarantee gives a little 
reassurance, when necessary; an extra push to get them in the 
door.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many witnesses appeared before the committee, in particular from 
the restaurant sector, who said it is very difficult.  We have 
spoken to the banks and we continue to speak to the banks at 
committee about the restaurant sector in particular, which has 
difficulty getting small business loans from banks.  New people 
in business do not necessarily have long credit histories or long 
records of doing business and they need that extra assistance. 
We want to be there for them as a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows that it is small business that is creating 
jobs.  We know the potential that exists in Canada.  We want to 
ensure that all small businesses have access to financing.  That 
is what the Canadian small business financing act, Bill C-53, is 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little disappointed by some of the amendments that are 
before us today because we had many of these discussions at 
committee.  We discussed very thoroughly the size of a loan and 
the importance of it and the fact that individuals, to be able to 
have their businesses, need to be able to renovate, need to be 
able to open their doors and to run a good operation.  We also 
discussed the differences between different types of businesses, 
about leaseholds, about existing businesses, about how people can 
move on and what people want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a little disappointing that we are discussing loan limits. 
I really find it surprising, considering the fact that we have 
moved beyond $100,000 to $250,000.  Evidence before us indicated 
that some people do need that much.  Even the Canadian Federation 
of Independent Business, as I said earlier, said not to go back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many, many success stories.  We had people before us 
who talked about a building they had bought.  They renovated it 
and leased out space.  They were able to attract tenants and to 
become a centre for that community.  If it was not for the Canada 
Small Business Loans Act, soon to be called the Canadian small 
business financing act, they would not be in business today. 
They would not have had that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They put up a lot of their own dollars.  The government 
guaranteed up to $250,000.  That was it.  In this case, in 
particular, each of the individuals matched that with their own 
personal money and put up their own personal guarantees as well. 
There is a lot of investment in making small businesses grow, in 
making small businesses happen and I think as Canadians we want 
to see this happening from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that different areas go through different times.  We 
know there is difficulty in financing from time to time.  We are 
trying to ensure that everyone has access and everyone has 
opportuntiy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some ideas are too new for the banks to feel comfortable with in 
the normal scheme of lending.  Again, some people do not have a 
credit history or a credit risk history.  It is important that we 
be there as a government and that we continue to deal with small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak from earlier days, before I was elected, when I was 
practising law and the administration of loans.  I think it is 
important that people realize that the borrowers are paying a 
higher rate of interest.  They are paying a fee.  It is not a 
freebie.  It is not that the government gives money and gets 
nothing back.  The majority of these loans will be paid over 
time. Sure, there will be losses, but the majority will provide 
jobs, the majority will be successful.  Many of these businesses 
will go on to hire people and will continue to develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One group in particular that appeared before us started very 
small and now has several tenants.  They are collecting thousands 
of dollars in rent and they are able to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important that we all participate in the debate 
today.  I am sure that many of my colleagues will join me in 
reminding the opposition that the SBLA in the past has done a lot 
of good for small business and will continue to do a lot of good 
in the future.  We need to ensure that the economy moves forward, 
we need to ensure that small business has access to this money 
and we need to ensure that small business can create jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Six weeks ago the solicitor general was caught red handed 
prejudicing the RCMP complaints inquiry, but for six weeks the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

extremely honourable member of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the constant attack from the opposition he decided it 
was too difficult for him to do all his work and he decided to 
offer me his resignation.  I have accepted his resignation with 
regret because he was a good minister.  He is an excellent member 
of parliament.  He is a man of great integrity and honour and 
that is why I was happy to defend him.

Speaker, for six weeks the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime 
Minister have been rabidly defending the integrity of the 
solicitor general.  Even today, after he has been removed from 
his position for compromising the RCMP complaints inquiry, the 
Prime Minister defends him rather than give the proper 
explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister's ethical standard to evade, to excuse and 
to cover up as long as possible and only to act when he is 
absolutely cornered?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

into all the controversy of APEC as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has absolutely no fear of the commission.  That 
is why we made available all the documentation and all the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

absolutely.

commission as much as it wants because we have nothing to hide. 
The RCMP has done its job and always did its job.  Now if it has 
to explain some things it will do it and the commission will have 
access to any people that it wants to interview.  Even my own

not taint the process, why in the world did he resign?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a man of honour, he knew that it was not giving him all 
the time he needed to devote all his energy to his job.  As a man

the only thing worse than that behaviour is defending it.  We are 
going to attack the government for 30 days more, for weeks, and 
the only bonus would be that this Prime Minister would step down 
at the end of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the very day that the solicitor general quit the Prime 
Minister is still stonewalling and talking about what an

this is an independent inquiry with an independent judge to find

</I></B></P><P align=left>We want this tribunal, set by the laws of parliament, to look

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the new solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the Prime Minister has one less fall guy it is time to 
focus on the real issue, that is one of serious political 
interference by the Prime Minister's Office at last year's APEC

</I></B></P><P align=left>The public complaints commission has never had a mandate to

in the breeze for six weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does he persist with Bill C-44 which will allow the 
government to fire the chair of the RCMP Public Complaints 
Commission at will.  Will the solicitor general admit that a 
mistake is there?  Will the Prime Minister remove this sword that 
hangs over the public complaints commission in the form of Bill 
C-44, which further politicizes the entire process?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has said the commission was not

that it was compromised.  If this had happened in a court of law 
there would have been a mistrial.

Canada's health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a book launched today about corporate control over Canada's 
health care system, author Colleen Fuller states “When the 
present Minister of Health was installed, Liberal rhetoric about 
a private hospital violating the CHA died down until finally the 
federal protector of medicare was comfortable with the 
corporation's for profit investment in health care”.

the member has not read my correspondence with the Alberta 
College of Physicians and Surgeons to which I wrote not once, but 
on two different occasions to express our commitment to the 
Canada Health Act, our concern about the privatization of 
services, and our request, which the college ultimately acceded 
to, to put off the consideration of the private hospital's 
application for a licence until after the debate on Bill 37 in 
the Alberta Legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That debate is now going on and the Liberal Party in that 
province is making its position clear, as we do here, that 
privatized medicine is not acceptable.

we are increasingly optimistic that the claim can be resolved

payments to the emergency claimants and I am told that the 
lawyers think they are close enough to an agreement with the 
parties on the overall claim that it might be reached before we 
would get payment to those in emergency need.

to report to the member and the House soon that those claims have 
been resolved.

petitioners are residents of the districts of Nipawin, White Fox

petitioners that C-68 will be a virtually unenforceable bill, 
that it will have no effect on criminal activity, and that it 
would constitute a breach of traditional civil liberties and be 
an affront to law abiding Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore these petitioners call on parliament to repeal Bill 
C-68 and all associated regulations with respect to firearms or 
ammunition and to pass due legislation designed to severely 
penalize the criminal use of any weapon.

parliament's duty to ensure that marriage, as it has always been

many different districts in Saskatchewan which I will not attempt 
to name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the financial statements of the Government of Canada 
have recorded annual deficits since 1970, which have led to a net 
federal public debt of over half a trillion dollars, because 
funding for public interest groups by the federal government is 
partly responsible for creating that public debt, and because 
these public interest groups further their own interests and 
force other Canadians to subsidize their causes, whether they 
agree with them or not, the petitioners call on parliament to 
eliminate all funding of public interest groups in each and every 
forthcoming budget of the Government of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my final petition is signed by 724 residents of 
Saskatchewan, again from widely separated communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and provincial governments are poised to raise the 
Canada pension plan's contribution rate from 5.85% to 9.9%, a $10 
billion tax increase or $1,380 per year for the average taxpayer 
and his or her employer. Canadians cannot afford such a massive 
tax increase to support a pension plan that is unsustainable and 
will probably lead to further tax increases. A mandatory defined 
contribution, fully funded, privately managed plan or mandatory 
retirement savings plan would address the deficiencies of the CPP 
and negate the necessity of perpetual tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners request that parliament reject any 
further CPP premium increases and enact legislation that would 
abolish the CPP and replace it with an MRSP.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK206">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-53, an act to increase 
the availability of financing for the establishment, expansion, 
modernization and improvement of small businesses, as reported 
(with amendment) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 2, 3, 4 
and 5. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to support Bill C-53, particularly because it improves 
existing loan guarantee programs that effectively stimulate 
economic growth.  It helps to create jobs through small 
businesses.  It encourages the kind of economic activity and 
entrepreneurial qualities among Canadians that can ensure our 
prosperity in the coming century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the proposed Canada Small Business Act 
would continue the existing act's history.  That act's history 
over the last 37 years has been to support innovation.  It has 
been there to support risk taking, a significant element of the 
government's investment for Canada's future.  Most important, it 
is meeting the demonstrated needs of our small business community 
throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
released its survey of small businesses this past January, 
“Credit where credit is due”.  Nearly 30% of the business 
owners who were surveyed listed availability of credit among 
their most serious business concerns.  They need financing for 
buying and modernizing their equipment, for renovating, for 
purchasing premises and for buying land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two kinds of businesses face especially difficult problems in 
securing financing.  These are very small and very young firms. 
It happens that these are also the financing gaps that the 
current act has been especially designed to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of size, nearly three-quarters of the firms taking 
out a loan guaranteed by the existing act have fewer than five 
employees, far more than regular bank borrowers who are of the 
same size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of the age of firms, the difference is even more 
striking.  It is important to note that almost 38% of small 
businesses with a loan guarantee under the act are less than one 
year old.  By contrast, among small businesses with ordinary 
financing from banks only 5% are younger than one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that last year over 60% of loans under 
the act went to firms that had been in business for three years 
or less.  The entrepreneurs who start these small firms and the 
spirit that drives them and moves them to succeed are Canada's 
economic hope for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small and medium businesses are the anchor of our national 
economy.  They made crucial contributions to our collective 
economic well-being over the years. 
This is an important reason why we should be supporting the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even giant multinationals started in a niche market, and some 
quite literally in the corner of a garage.  I can point out that 
Magna International started in Richmond Hill over 30 years ago. 
Today Magna International is one of the leading, if not leading, 
international automotive part manufacturers in the world.  That 
environment is exactly what is proposed in the bill to help 
create those kinds of opportunities.  Small business people need 
the federal government to appreciate and encourage 
entrepreneurial spirit, the willingness to take risk, which has 
been the hallmark of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs over 2.5 million small businesses and self-employed 
entrepreneurs.  They account for approximately 40% of the gross 
national product.  Small businesses are responsible for the 
overwhelming portion of new jobs, 70% to 80% over the past three 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The loan guarantee program is more than an investment in small 
businesses.  It is an investment in jobs and an investment in job 
opportunities.  We have to do more than talk about it.  We have 
to provide those opportunities.  We have to be able to act.  The 
bill addresses those issues.  In the last year alone borrowers 
expected to create an additional 74,600 jobs as a direct result 
of the loans.  That represents more than 2.5 jobs per loan in 
just one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last five years borrowers anticipated creating over 
480,000 jobs.  We consider that the average loan guaranteed last 
year was approximately $68,000 and that the loan guarantee 
program is moving toward cost recovery.  This is a remarkably 
cost effective way of expanding the nation's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments, financial institutions and private lenders will 
certainly continue to come up with new ideas and plans for 
financing small business, innovative services, products and 
delivery channels.  However it is important to note that none of 
them is primarily targeted to the young, small firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I believe we are debating the amendments and the hon. 
member is speaking to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  At this point I would 
ask the hon. member to focus his comments on the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was highlighting the 
changes that were made in the bill.  Perhaps the hon. member 
thinks it is a bit of history.  It is also helpful to put the 
amendments in some context, which I was doing, and to address 
those concerns to members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, it is targeting the young, small firms whose needs 
are served by small business financing programs.  There is no 
question that the bill will help assist in that regard.  The 
measure of success of the program is the extent to which small 
businesses would have had to borrow money without the program 
being in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out some key provisions the member was 
asking about.  The bill would provide authority to the Department 
of Industry to conduct audits to ensure compliance with the act 
and regulations.  It certainly will provide authority to create 
limited pilot programs, something that we need on a cost recovery 
basis, on capital leasing and lending to the volunteer sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's contingency liability would be capped at $1.5 
billion over five years.  This means again, regardless of the 
dollar value for the loans made under the act, the taxpayers 
would never have to cover more than $1.5 billion on loans during 
that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that economic impact studies also show that the 
program has been successful in providing funding to firms that 
predominantly would not otherwise be able to obtain it.  The 
amendments in the bill, as pointed out, would strengthen the 
capacity and the ability of small business entrepreneurs to 
provide necessary jobs, to develop necessary technology and to 
expand their businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business is the engine of the country.  It is important 
that all members note that in giving support to the amendments 
and to the bill we will have a stronger small business community 
across the country, thereby creating the kind of economic output 
necessary to continue our strong recovery. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-53 and the 
various amendments that are before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the amendments, if I am not mistaking, are enacting 
amendments or enabling amendments.  I would like to focus on the 
substance of the bill, which is to provide access to capital to 
small business.  The Small Business Loans Act has been an 
effective tool for helping small businesses access financing over 
the past 37 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 was designed to meet three objectives:  to continue 
helping small young businesses access financing, to increase 
program accountability, and to move the program toward cost 
recovery.  Bill C-53 contains no changes to the basic program 
parameters.  The new provisions it contains are aimed at ensuring 
the program's long term viability, cost effectiveness and 
stability to better meet the needs of small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent and quite unexpected volatility in currency and 
trading markets that we have all witnessed confirms again the 
importance of sound, consistent public policy.  Small businesses 
need stability, even more so at a time when we face the prospect 
of restructuring in the financial services industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decisions related to the recommendations of the MacKay task 
force and the proposed bank mergers will have a direct bearing on 
the well-being of small business, which is the source of economic 
and job growth in every region of the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small and medium size businesses are the cornerstone of our 
economy.  Their contribution is vital to our economic welfare. 
This is one of the reasons why it is so important to support the 
bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, there are over 2.5 million small businesses, if we 
include the self-employed.  They account for 99% of all Canadian 
companies and for between 70% and 80% of all the jobs created in 
Canada in the past three years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 results from a comprehensive program and policy review 
conducted over the past year in consultation with both private 
and public sector stakeholders.  It takes into account 
recommendations of the auditor general and the Standing Committee 
on Public Accounts. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Small Business Financing Act will keep the basic 
parameters of the Small Business Loans Act: loans granted by 
approved lenders for a maximum of 10 years; possibility for 
businesses of borrowing up to $250,000; requirement that lenders 
pay only once the 2% registration fee, which the borrowers can 
absorb; and requirement that lenders pay an annual 
administration fee of 1.25%. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 is a step forward in streamlining, improving and 
stabilizing the Small Business Loans Act.  The key provisions are 
as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill will provide authority for the Department of 
Industry to conduct audits to ensure compliance with the act and 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it will provide authority to create limited pilot 
programs on a cost recovery basis on capital leasing and lending 
to the voluntary sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we are also proposing to replace the current sunset 
clause.  Every five years Industry Canada will conduct a 
comprehensive review of the program.  The resulting report on the 
program's performance would be tabled in parliament for committee 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a means of maintaining and ensuring cost recovery, the 
governor in council through regulation would have the power to 
restrict eligibility criteria for access to program loans. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum amount of the government's potential liability would 
be set at $1.5 billion over five years.  This means that, 
regardless of the monetary value of the loans granted under the 
act, the taxpayer would never be required to cover more than 
$1.5 billion of the loans granted during that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $1.5 billion figure would only be reached in the highly 
unlikely event that all loans were defaulted on.  Historically, 
the loss rate on loans is 5.6%, which means that over 94% of all 
loans were paid back without incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This potential liability would be renewed automatically every 
five years.  Loans could therefore continue to be made while 
Parliament carries out its in-depth investigation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1961 the SBLA has served the small business community 
well. The Canada small business financing act will provide an 
even more effective mechanism for the government and financial 
institutions to share the risks of lending to small businesses to 
help them grow and create jobs.

Speaker, I will not be using all the time available to me.  I

No. 3 in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this motion is to reduce the maximum available 
capital from $250,000 to $100,000.  My main argument can be 
found in the title of the bill, which reads “an act to increase 
the availability of financing for the establishment, expansion, 
modernization and improvement of small businesses”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the stated goal is to increase financing, I have difficulty 
going along with cutting back on what was previously available 
to small businesses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take advantage of the presence in the House of 
the Secretary of State for Regional Development for Quebec to 
point out that this particular program of small business loans 
is important precisely because of the shortcomings in the 
programs under the secretary of state's responsibility. Because 
of the absence of good regional development measures, businesses 
need access to such a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the CFDCs, of course, but they are of no help to small 
businesses wishing to expand.  The emphasis is often on new 
small businesses, which are very important, and capital funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment moved by the Reform Party member would not create 
problems for those wishing to start up a business. 
However, existing businesses sometimes need loans to consolidate 
their activities, to expand, to develop and to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often criticize the government's prime interest in big 
business or high tech companies.  I have nothing against them, 
they are extraordinary.  However, these businesses set up 
primarily around big cities and centres. This is unfortunate for 
businesses in rural areas, in the regions that want to keep 
their young people and staunch the flow to the major centres. 
This program will help local businesses create jobs or keep 
them.  Businesses sometimes modernize to keep jobs.  If they do 
not, they could have to close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program then makes this possible, and we in the Bloc 
Quebecois support it. 
Though sovereignists we may be in the Bloc Quebecois, we are not 
always negative, we do not always oppose government measures, 
although this measure, in our opinion, should have been 
improved.  This bill should have been improved.  We would have 
hoped for a broader vision for all government programs, not only 
those of the federal government, and that they would have been 
compared to those of the provinces, especially Quebec, and the 
financial opportunities offered by such organizations as the 
CFDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failing the best, we will have to be satisfied with what is 
not too bad.  This is why the Bloc Quebecois supports this 
bill. Obviously, however, we oppose any attempt to limit the 
availability of funds to small businesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was leading into the 
debate but I wanted to show my disappointment that the Liberal 
government has used time allocation or closure 44 times since it 
came to power. We have more speakers.  I was sitting here waiting 
for my turn. More speakers are coming up and they will be 
disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the bill and the group of amendments, I have 
read the bill very thoroughly.  I attended the auditor general's 
briefing on Bill C-53 and the Small Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the beginning I have been addressing the issues on Bill 
C-53 and the particular amendments.  I addressed this bill at the 
first stage.  I proposed right from the beginning certain 
amendments or recommendations and I am very delighted to speak on 
those recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 3 contains two motions, Motion No. 6 and Motion No. 
11.  Motion No. 6 deals with clause 8 and Motion No. 11 deals 
with clause 15. I will go over these clauses separately.  These 
amendments are put forward by the official opposition.  I am very 
delighted to speak on them and I will support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 deals with the liability of the minister.  We are 
proposing that the liability should be reduced to 50%, or any 
prescribed lesser percent. The rationale behind that reduction of 
the liability of the government is that lowering the percentage 
of the government's liability for a defaulted loan means that the 
lender must also assume a larger portion of any loss.  By 
lowering the government's liability from 85% to 50%, the lender 
also assumes a greater risk in making the loan. In fact the risk 
would be equally shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The default rate under the old Small Business Loans Act was 
nearly 10 times higher than that in the private sector. This bill 
does not provide an adequate review of risk analysis. There is no 
provision for losses.  Borrowers are not guaranteed but financial 
institutions are guaranteed. If bad decisions are made by the 
financial institutions, they are guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore the bill does not put a mechanism in place to 
prevent financial institutions charging administrative fees when 
small businessmen go to them for loans. They should not be 
charging a fee in the first place but the auditor general has 
reported that they have been charging a fee in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By lowering the government's liability from 85% to 50%, it will 
be the lenders who will be given more responsibility to share the 
risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has noted various cases where major 
borrowers were able to obtain numerous loans with totals 
exceeding certain limits because they were operating the same 
businesses. In one group, 23 related corporations obtained more 
than $4 million in loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This practice are contrary to the intent of the act.  Currently 
there are no provisions under the Small Business Loans Act to 
prevent this practice, even though such rules exist under the 
Income Tax Act.  That act has provisions designed to limit access 
to the corporate tax rate for small business and to prevent abuse 
by the creation of a number of related corporations.  The 
government needs to address that issue more rigorously in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to support Motion No. 6.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Motion No. 11 we are making an amendment in clause 15 which 
deals with the audit or the examination of various files.  We are 
recommending that lines 20 to 22 on page 9 of the bill be 
replaced with “the minister will routinely conduct an audit or 
examination of the” files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada does not audit any account until the file 
becomes a claim file, which is absolutely wrong.  It should audit 
files that need to be audited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rationale in putting forward this recommendation is that as 
presently worded Industry Canada officials must give written 
notice to a lender before conducting an audit of the lender's 
records or documents.  This change would allow officials to 
conduct an audit routinely.  Moreover, they could do so whenever 
they desired.  It would ensure federal accountability in the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The December 1997 auditor general's report highlighted examples 
where lending institutions have not exercised due care in making 
a loan.  In short, better auditing provisions need to be in place 
and it becomes very important that we deal with these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada introduced a policy of full cost recovery for 
loans issued after April 1, 1995.  The department reduced its 
loss sharing ratio from 90% to 85% and imposed on lenders a 1.25% 
annual administration fee.  According to Industry Canada 
projections, these modifications to the program should result in 
full cost recovery over a 10 year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has reservations regarding the department's 
ability to move toward full cost recovery, noting an increased 
proportion of riskier loans in its guaranteed loan portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An internal study undertaken in 1997 by the department confirmed 
a significant increase in risk in the program's loan portfolio, 
stating higher default rates which are occurring earlier in the 
life of a loan.  As a result, the auditor general urged the 
department to undertake greater efforts to develop systems and 
practices to better evaluate program performance in order to 
assist in monitoring loan portfolio risk so that smaller 
businesses get the benefit from this whole program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general recommended that industry take steps to 
ensure that lenders have complied with the regulations of this 
act.  It was found that some loan files did not contain the 
information necessary to perform a total credit risk analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does nothing to address the shortcomings of the audit 
process outlined above.  It is likely that the same criticism 
levelled by the auditor general in this regard will continue.  As 
a part of its review, Industry Canada does not assess whether the 
lender has exercised due care when making a loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments would make the process more accountable. The 
auditor general's recommendations would be in place. Small 
businesses would be getting the advantage, not the large 
businesses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, again it 
is a pleasure to speak on the very important topic of the 
well-being of small business in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say something very obliquely about the whole 
issue of closure.  The government uses that technique in order to 
stop the debate. It wants to have the bill finished, in this case 
today, and it is at a loss to try to persuade us to pass the bill 
really fast.  We want to discuss it and see whether we can 
persuade the government to make some amendments. 
This is very important to us.  I believe that we represent the 
well-being of the taxpayers much more than does the government 
side. It is important for that point of view to be stressed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the government's inability or lack of 
desire to seriously consider our amendments.  If the government 
would say that the amendment makes a lot of sense and that it 
would go along with it, that would be the end of the story.  We 
would not have a long debate.  It would not take a whole week of 
debate to come to a conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government says “It is our way or the highway. We 
are the only ones who know perfectly how this should be done”. 
That is not an accurate assessment of the government's abilities. 
Undoubtedly the government has very capable members of 
parliament but their ability to represent their constituencies is 
severely hampered by the fact that they do not have the freedom 
to vote according to the wishes of their constituents, even on 
amendments to a bill.  I cannot understand that.  I want that to 
be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of amendments has two very important components.  One 
is Motion No. 6 put forward by one of my colleagues.  This is an 
amendment which protects the people who earn the money, the 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has already been alluded to that some people and some small 
businesses are concerned because as taxpayers they have to pay 
their taxes both as individuals and as businesses. That money is 
taken by the government whether they want to give it or not.  It 
is not a voluntary fund.  It is not a charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a case of somebody from the government or elsewhere 
coming to the people in the little towns which I represent and 
saying “There is a person in your town who wants to start a 
business and we would like to give them a little bit of help. 
They are just not quite solid enough to qualify for a loan from 
the bank, so we would like to give them your money. How much 
money would you like to give them?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event that the person has a solid business plan, a good 
reputation in the community and is not seeking to undermine by 
direct competition a business which is already in that town, then 
perhaps the individual business person would say “Yes, having 
this business in my town is going to be helpful.  I trust this 
person.  I will give you a cheque for $500 to help”. That would 
be a voluntary way of collecting this money, but that is not how 
it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the tax man comes, it is not a voluntary donation that we 
make.  The tax man reaches into our pockets and takes our 
earnings, against our will in some cases. Certainly it is true in 
my part of the world that most Canadians whom I speak to are 
quite happy to pay a reasonable level of taxation.  However, in 
this case, that money to be taken is to be given to another 
business person.  We are taking money away from those who are 
successfully earning it and giving it to others in the hopes that 
they will also earn it, which is not entirely a bad premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, statistics show that many of these small business 
people who get started have a much higher than average rate of 
default.  I guess that is to be expected because not everyone's 
good dream will come to fruition.  Some people unfortunately will 
not be able to put their dreams into action and things will not 
quite work out the way they wanted them to.  That is why ordinary 
banks and lending institutions will not advance the money to 
them.  Hence they come to the government, to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments we are proposing are reasonable.  They are 
probably going to be rejected by the government. 
Instead of listening to reasoned debate, the government would 
rather call all its members on command to stand up and vote for 
time allocation so we cannot talk about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will vote on these amendments and the government will say to 
vote against the amendments. All the individualized robots will 
stand up when their strings are pulled and say that they are 
against the amendments, without having heard the arguments, 
without having heard the reasoning. Meanwhile, it all comes to an 
end and the taxpayer gets to pick up the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about these two amendments, the first of which says 
that the liability that the taxpayers should pick up should be 
restricted to 50% of the loan. This has two effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is very important.  When a loan is granted under 
this program, the bank or financial institution administering it 
on behalf of the government will be a little more careful. It is 
too easy right now to say “We will decline you.  Go to the Small 
Business Loans Act people and they will give you the money”. The 
banks and other institutions basically cut their potential losses 
but they cut them at the expense of somebody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have discovered over the years that people generally are much 
more careful with their own money than they are when they spend 
someone else's.  This is the premise here.  The administrators of 
the loan system are spending someone else's money. They say 
“Sure, we will pick up 85% of the responsibility if this person 
wants to start a business.  We do not think it will work but it 
is tough to say no to someone.  Let's just say yes. If they do 
not make it, we will pull it out of the taxpayers' pockets.  We 
will pull it out of the pockets of those who are competing 
against this person.  We will end up being covered.  Spread out 
over all the taxpayers, it does not make that much difference”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the Liberal members, all the green Liberals over 
there.  I am not permitted to point out to people that empty 
chairs in this House are green so I will not say that. I am 
making an appeal to the Liberal members to vote in favour of the 
amendment in order to protect the taxpayer.  The taxpayer is 
footing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an added incentive on the part of the person granting the 
loan to say “We carry a full 50% of the responsibility and 
therefore we must be careful”.  The second reason this is a good 
amendment is that it saves the taxpayers money.  It saves the 
money of the person who has put a successful business together, 
is earning money and is paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully by putting in measures like this one, we can look 
forward to that great and glorious day when we will actually have 
some tax cuts, some real tax cuts and not some phony declared 
cuts from the other side.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the maximum of $250,000 and what it would 
do for my constituency which grows the world's best durum to 
produce the world's best pasta.   That industry could not get a 
loan because the government would not allow it.  I challenge 
members opposite the next time they or their spouses go shopping 
to see if they can find a pasta product in any mall in Canada 
that is packaged in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $250,000 strikes home.  I had some producers who wanted to 
borrow money to produce organic grain.  They could not get a loan 
because the government said that grain could not be handled in 
that way.  It is making quarter of a million dollar loans to 
people in some areas of Canada, but raw material producers cannot 
even get a loan for the grain and meat packaging that should be 
done in my constituency and in western Canada because it violates 
some government bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want members to think for a moment about where I live.  We 
have the largest inland terminals.  We handle more grain in one 
town than in any other place in Canada.  No one is allowed as a 
private individual to turn that grain into flour, let alone 
borrow the money from the government to do so.  While the ceiling 
is being raised from $100,000 to $250,000 it is not going to 
produce raw materials in our province, particularly in grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is hardly a butchering plant left in western Canada.  Most 
of them have closed out.  At one time the city of Winnipeg had 
four plants.  The policies of the government removed the ability 
of wheat and meat producers to sell finished product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is against the law for individuals to obtain a loan of 
$250,000 to build a plant to sell organic flour.  As a result, 
the people in my area of the province are not interested in 
increasing the ceiling of the loan or in increasing the risk of a 
business to the tune of $250,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I challenge members to go to a mall to see if they can 
find pasta produced and packaged in Canada.  We do not do it.  We 
do not allow for that.  We ship it to Minneapolis by train load 
and buy it back, but it must never be produced in Saskatchewan 
because it is a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time prairie pasta producers have the biggest 
project going.  Would they be able to get a loan?  Not on their 
life.  The government would deny them a loan because they are 
violating some antique policy in the Canadian Wheat Board.  The 
government is telling the people in the west that they are hewers 
of wood and drawers of water and will stay that way.  That is the 
policy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The state of North Dakota which borders my constituency is to 
put up millions of dollars to build a pasta plant near the U.S. 
border within a few miles of my constituency.  Should I come to 
the House to congratulate the Liberals for moving the loan level 
up to $250,000 when they deny western Canada the right to produce 
its raw products and make a sale? 
I will not support it for the simple reason that most of this 
money would be denied entrepreneurs in my province.

the west have a right to produce products from our natural 
resources—and I am talking about grain, flour and the packaging 
of meat and so on—I cannot support it.  When it comes to raising 
the amount of money that we will be put at risk I will not 
support it, and the people of Canada should not support it 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business said $100,000 is 
plenty.  If $100,000 will not get a small business going, 
$250,000 certainly will not either.  I will not support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to speak to the 
motions and to speak to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the remarks of the member for Elk Island.  When we 
were in opposition, which is almost 10 years ago, this bill was 
on the floor of the House of Commons.  At that time Minister Tom 
Hockin from London, Ontario, was responsible for amending the 
Small Business Loans Act, amending the legislation, and we 
decided that the bill was so important for activating 
entrepreneurial spirit that we supported the government's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that it was not perfect.  I have never seen an 
absolutely perfect piece of legislation in the House in the 10 
years I have been elected or in the previous 10 years that I was 
a minister's assistant or a prime minister's assistant.  The 
reality is that legislation is never perfect but we try.  The art 
of politics is to try to design something that is doable and 
something we can activate as soon as possible.  At the time when 
we were in opposition we put the legislation through the House in 
one day.  We supported the government and in fact— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  If you put it through, why are we doing it 
again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  The hon. member for Elk Island is 
asking a question.  Why are we amending the legislation? This is 
the nature of this place.  We are constantly amending, updating 
and refining laws.  This is the Small Business Loans Act.  This 
is a bill which normally all members of parliament in all parties 
get behind. This is the first time in the history of this bill 
where we have the Reform Party using a delaying tactic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end the bill will go through.  The Minister of Industry 
and his parliamentary secretary have done a great job in 
listening to witnesses and in listening to literally thousands of 
small businessmen and women who participated in the Small 
Business Loans Act.  Anything the government has done in the bill 
in consultation with opposition members and with the small 
business sector is a result of that listening experience.  Yet 
here we are today and Reform Party members are almost being 
obstructionists. 
We should put the bill through with a snap of our fingers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing we have done in this House in the last 10 
years—and I believe we have done it with the help of all 
parties—it is that we have created a sense of importance and a 
sense of urgency that we all must get behind the small business 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are on the eve of Christmas and they are doubting and 
questioning.  I have heard remarks from members of the Reform 
Party on the bill over the past couple of weeks.  They are 
wondering whether or not small business deserves the legislation. 
We have heard them say that the legislation is essentially no 
different from another tax on all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing further from reality than that assertion.  The 
loan loss provision in the Small Business Loans Act is absolutely 
minuscule in comparison to the number of jobs that are being 
created which are generating billions of dollars worth of income 
tax revenue for the treasuries of Canada, the provinces and the 
municipalities.  That activity emerging from the small business 
community is something we can all be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion that the Reform Party would try to take us off focus 
by proposing amendments and distractions linked to tax reform is 
going in the wrong way.  We will lose some of the momentum we 
have been building in the House.  Over the last 10 years we have 
been a fist in support of small business.  It does not matter 
whether it was the Reform critic of Industry, the NDP, the Bloc 
or the Conservative Party.  We have all worked together.  We have 
all been in unison.  This legislation was one of the prize pieces 
that managed to go from first reading to third reading in no time 
flat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members of the Reform Party would reflect on whether it 
is good to be seen as breaking rank from the special collegial 
approach we have always had in terms of the Small Business Loans 
Act.   Before they drag out the debate much longer maybe we could 
say they have some concerns and made their points, but it is time 
to put the legislation through the House and obtain royal assent 
so that all financial institutions in Canada use the Small 
Business Loans Act to keep the focus, to keep the morale and to 
keep the energy of small business moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to members of the Reform Party to end the debate so 
that the bill will go through all readings and bring the act up 
to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
wonder if you would seek unanimous consent for me to ask the hon. 
member a question or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent of the House to let the member ask a question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the motion of the hon. 
member of the official opposition.  Yet I am sad at the same 
time because, as my colleague on this side of the House has just 
pointed out, all members of all parties worked together on the 
industry committee on this legislation introduced by the 
Minister of Industry, and I find it regrettable that the hon. 
member of the opposition has moved this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see what the motion is, and I shall then address the main 
points. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saskatoon—Humboldt is proposing in Motion No. 6 
that Bill C-53 in clause 8 be amended by replacing line 26 on 
page 5 with the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) 50%, or any prescribed lesser per cent. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  It means that under the present 
legislation the loans which are awarded under the small business 
loans program are guaranteed up to 85%.  He wishes to reduce that 
to 50%.  What impact will that have on our small and medium sized 
businesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite simple. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two types of businesses that run into particular 
difficulties in obtaining financing.  These are the very small 
businesses and the very new businesses. The current legislation 
helps remedy this double shortcoming.  As far as size is 
concerned, close to three-quarters of businesses obtaining loans 
under the present legislation have fewer than five employees. 
This is a far higher fraction than for those obtaining loans 
from the banks in general.  That is one very important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research and recent experiences with this program show that the 
level of loan guarantee has a major impact on use of this 
program and the banks' interest in it.  I would point out that 
there are 1,300 institutions using this program in Canada, via 
13,000 service points. 
Someone on the other side mistakenly referred to 13,000 
borrowers. The right number is 1,300 borrowers using 13,000 
service points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lowering the guarantee rate given by government on each of these 
loans would have a negative impact on the entire sector of small 
and medium size business, particularly the very small and the 
very new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the number of years in existence is concerned, the gap 
is still more striking.  Some 38% of small businesses benefit 
from a loan guarantee under the act.  These have been in 
existence for less than one year.  When we look at regular bank 
customers, however, only 5% of small businesses are less than 
one year old.  It is therefore clear that the act must maintain 
the 85% guarantee.  This is one of the main reasons I cannot 
support the motion of the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason has to do with the businesses owned by members of 
ethnocultural communities.  All the surveys tell us that members 
of such communities have trouble getting access to credit and 
capital.  These are people starting small, and often very small, 
businesses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT58"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT58"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the figures show that the impact of reducing the 
guarantee from 85% to 50% would be very negative for small 
businesses in general, it would be even more negative for small 
businesses managed and operated by members of ethnocultural 
communities.  The same would hold for businesses run by women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to see how someone with a certain degree of 
intelligence—and I have to assume that we are dealing with an 
intelligent individual, because he did, after all, have the 
trust of his constituents—cannot understand that lowering the 
guarantee from 85% to 50% would have a very negative impact on 
the development and growth of small businesses in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second motion, I frankly find it a bit confusing.  It 
asks, and I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will routinely conduct an audit or examination— 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion eliminates completely the notice of several days the 
minister must give a business subject to an audit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment completely eliminates the notice period for 
audits of loans under the act and provides that they be done on a 
routine basis.  What does routine basis mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an accountant, but I have taken accounting classes.  I 
also studied fiscal law when I was in law school.  When we talk 
about audits it is very clear that notices are given when we are 
talking about specific legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is proposing that Industry Canada have the power 
to conduct audits on the basis of lenders' application of the 
program.  However, neither the auditor general's audit nor the 
sample audit which was done for the department indicates 
pervasive or systemic compliance problems.  Only such 
circumstances would justify routine audits without notice.  It is 
quite clear that the member's motion calls for routine audits, 
but provides no notice period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research has shown that compliance is sufficiently ensured 
through sample audits.  As well, the notice period of at least 21 
days was added in response to the concerns which were expressed 
by the stakeholders.  The lenders who deliver the program 
originally asked for a notice period of 45 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminating that notice period would be a reversal of a 
commitment made to the financial institutions which deliver this 
program.  This was a commitment negotiated by all parties 
represented on the industry committee.  All of the members who 
sit on the Standing Committee for Industry negotiated that 
commitment.  Now we have one of those members submitting a motion 
which goes completely against it.  Here again, without calling 
into question that member's intelligence, I wonder where his head 
is.  The member obviously has a short memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments are simply unacceptable.  They go 
against all of the discussions that took place in the industry 
committee.  The amendments go against the very objective of the 
legislation.  I do not understand the member.  I wish the member 
were here in the House right now.  I would like to be able to ask 
him a question privately, outside of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two motions simply cannot be supported.  They go against 
the very objectives of the legislation and they go against the 
objective of the government, which is to assist small businesses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood made a very 
telling remark during his dissertation on these amendments.  If I 
may paraphrase, he asked why we were bothering to debate this. It 
is all decided anyway.  We are wasting time.  The government 
knows what it wants.  The government knows what it is going to 
do.  This is all theatre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely compliment the member for Broadview—Greenwood 
because he has reached the nub of what this place is all about. I 
could not have said it better myself.  I know I was paraphrasing 
his words, but that in essence is what the hon. member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is not paraphrasing, that is 
distorting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  The hon. member says I am distorting 
it.  I would invite him to check <I>Hansard</I> when he gets home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Group No. 3, the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine stated that it is totally 
unacceptable that the level of government responsibility for 
defaulted loans should be decreased from 85% to 50%.  Why should 
the taxpayers of this country be on the hook to support bad 
management decisions by the poor, impoverished, helpless 
chartered banks?  Good heavens.  These are small business loans. 
These are small loans, period.  Do we have to carry the can for 
people who are talking about annual profits of $1 billion or $1.5 
billion?  It is absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eminent economist Walter Williams once made a statement 
about this sort of thing which I think should be engraved above 
the Speaker's chair so that everyone can read it.  He said “If 
someone with a business venture of doubtful credibility came to 
me and asked me to loan him $50,000 to support the business, I 
would tell him to go play in traffic.  But when this gentleman 
who needs the $50,000 to support a dubious business venture wants 
money, he does not come to me but to the government, which has 
the coercive power of the majesty of the law to say `You have to 
give this business some money.  If it goes broke, that is your 
bad luck.  But you have to give it to him because we the 
government say that we are going to force you to do it through 
your taxes.  Mr. Walter Williams, if you do not pay your taxes, 
we will put you in jail”'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By a very direct and easily chartered course we can see that by 
giving this huge degree of guaranteed support to what may be 
loans of rather dubious quality we are telling ordinary taxpaying 
Canadians that they are going support to the utmost these dubious 
business ventures.  If they do not, the government will put them 
in jail.  That is the simple, very easily traced path of what we 
are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not feel as strongly about the second amendment as I do 
about the first.  The hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine became very emotional about this.  I 
would like to know what is wrong with performing audits without 
notice.  Do we have to allow loans of dubious quality not to be 
audited through the lending institutions?   What is going on? 
Taxpayer money is being put up to guarantee these loans. Surely 
we can have the privilege or the right to audit these things 
without notice. But the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine says no, that would be a 
terrible thing to do.  She has not heard of accountability.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  The hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood should get together with the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine to discuss this because they are 
obviously coming from two diametrically opposed directions on 
this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  You guys are just stalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  The hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood says I am stalling.  He said earlier that it 
was a waste of time to debate these amendments because the 
decisions have already been made.  Having said that, I guess I 
should give him what he wants and not continue to debate this ad 
infinitum or ad nauseam. I will defer to the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood and we will get on to the next group of 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will endeavour to show these folks opposite that some useful 
improvements could be made to their legislation, that there are 
improvements that could even cause my colleagues and I to support 
their legislation but we certainly could never dream of 
supporting it in its present condition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the problem with these 
motions is that Reform Party members voted against this bill in 
the House and voted against the bill and the amendments in 
committee.  They have tried every deceptive way to stop this 
bill— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>   Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not believe the rules of the House permit attributing to 
members motives of deception.  I would ask you to require the 
member to retract what he just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sure all members 
will be careful in debating these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Madam Speaker, the Reform Party has 
tried to obstruct every part of this bill.  I will first talk 
about Motion No. 6.  It is very clear to me that the opposition 
is trying to completely water down the importance of this bill 
because it does not believe in small business and it is going to 
pay for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that small business be able to obtain a 
loan that is of higher risk than conventional loans.  That is the 
objective of this bill.  This motion would take away from that. 
Borrowers do pay a higher interest when they obtain these loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 was debated in committee.  It was agreed on by all 
parties.  The industry committee is made up of all parties. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT61"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT61"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After much discussion with the stakeholders, including financial 
institutions, it was agreed that instead of 45 days it should be 
reduced to 21 days in order that a proper audit could be done, an 
audit that the auditor general experienced.  We are using the 
auditor general's experience as we put information into this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember, there are some 1,500 lenders and 13,000 points of 
service that have to comply with this request.  It would be 
easier to have 21 days notice.  On the other hand, it was also 
agreed that the minister would respond within 21 days to make the 
audit procedure in a proper manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I emphasize the importance of the small businesses 
financing bill.  These motions water it down and should not be 
approved.  I will continue to defend and make sure we have a 
Canada small businesses financing act that is valuable for small 
business from coast to coast. Therefore, I ask that members not 
vote for these two amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, speaking on Group No. 3 motions before 
the House for debate, I challenge the previous member who said 
that Reformers are not in favour of small business.  That is a 
crock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers very much support small business.  What we do not 
support is the Canadian taxpayer funding businesses that may or 
may not survive and being responsible for the debt incurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 is simply asking for an amendment that lowers the 
percentage of the government's liability for defaulted loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about when we are talking about the 
government's liability is that the government does not have any 
money itself.  It is taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about is making an amendment that lowers the 
percentage of taxpayer liability for a defaulted loan.  What is 
meant is that the person who is lending money to a small business 
that is more risky, that has a higher chance of defaulting on 
that loan, has to assume a higher risk.  That is a very logical 
move to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking for is instead of the taxpayer assuming 85% 
of the risk in covering a default that they assume only 50%.  I 
suggest that if the lender is still responsible for 50% of a 
defaulted loan, they will be a little more judicious in making 
sure that some very extreme risk cases are not funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They just won't make the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  The member opposite says that maybe 
they won't make the loan.  If the taxpayer is paying for the 
default of that loan, maybe the person should not be getting a 
loan. Maybe small businesses that are too risky should either put 
up more collateral or be a little more responsible rather than 
putting the responsibility on to the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know about the members opposite, whether they ever 
communicate with their taxpayers, the people on the street who 
vote for them.  When I get letters from my constituents, from 
taxpayers, they are concerned that the priorities of government 
are skewed.  That government is responsible for providing 
essential services to the people of Canada and by not putting its 
priority on funding special interests or businesses is a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel it is prudent for the government to be protecting the 
taxpayer by making sure that when it is covering loans or putting 
its neck out and supporting loans that may be defaulted there is 
a balance in that of what the taxpayer is responsible for and 
what the lender is responsible for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Motion No. 6 is to make sure that balance is 
kept, that the taxpayers are responsible for one half and that 
the lender is responsible for the other half.  What we are 
talking about are high risk loans that are being loaned because 
traditional sources and vehicles of loans for small businesses 
are not available to them.  We are talking about a very small 
percentage of small businesses that may or may not succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members across seem to feel it is the responsibility of the 
government and the taxpayers to make sure that everybody who 
wants to start a business is given money to do so.  It does not 
work that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not every child in this country has an education or has the 
available means for a post-graduate education.  They have to earn 
that right.  They have to go to school and get the marks.  They 
have to show they are diligent in the requirements to go on to 
university or college. The same should apply to the small 
business community, to somebody who decides that he or she wants 
to be in business.  There has to be an onus put on that 
individual to make sure that business has a market and is in a 
community that can support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an individual asks for financing, either from a bank or a 
government protected bank, there should be minimum risk.  The 
banks must know the business has the ability to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 states the lender would assume 50% of that 
liability and the taxpayer would assume 50% of that liability. It 
would put the onus on the small business to show the lender and 
the Canadian taxpayer that it has done everything possible to 
make sure the business is viable and will go ahead.  I suggest 
the number of loans written off would probably decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding now is the default rate is 10 times higher on 
these loans guaranteed by the federal government.  I suggest that 
10 times higher is perhaps too much to put on the Canadian 
taxpayer.  I think they would feel the priority of their money 
should be in things like health care and education, the things 
they feel are far more important than perhaps taking 85% on the 
default of a loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Motion No. 6 is reasonable and logical.  I also believe 
it would have the support of the people who pay the bill when 
these loans are defaulted, Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 is self-explanatory when it states that the 
auditor should not have to give a 21 day notice.  They should be 
able to do what Revenue Canada does, phone up and say they will 
be there in three days to go through the books.  There is no 
reason why the same degree of short notice that Revenue Canada 
can avail on should not be applied to this bill as well. I hope 
everybody will support these motions.

Speaker, I would like to first of all set the record straight.  I 
am very pleased to support Motion No. 6.  It would in effect 
change the bill to ensure that the borrower would assume at least 
half the responsibility and the government or the lender the 
other half, which is sponsored by taxpayers. 
Right now it would be 85% to the lender and 15% to the borrowing. 
I suggest it should be an equal partnership if they have 
enough confidence in their own business plan when they come

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, I want to set the record straight with respect 
to Reform's commitment to small business.  I think it is very 
important.  We believe very strongly in small businesses and are 
a great defender of them.  I think we would just go about it 
differently.  We think it is very important that we provide small 
businesses immediate tax relief.  We also want to make sure they 
have decreased payroll taxes as opposed to putting money into 
this small business loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial legislation, as everyone well knows, would provide 
$1.5 billion to small business loans programs.  I think there are 
other ways we could do it than again through government subsidies 
for businesses.  I think there are other ways that would be more 
beneficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at capital gains tax.  Now the tax rate is 75%; 
perhaps lowering it to half that. There are other ways to attract 
investors, other ways for people to get money, without taking it 
out of the pockets of taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion would decrease the liability of the lender or the 
bank down to 50% from 85%.  That would make sure the person who 
is wanting to borrow this money would have enough confidence that 
they would assume liability for half. That is not a lot to ask 
when we are using taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if the borrower is liable for only 15% of this loan, what 
kind of confidence do they have in their business plan to ensure 
that it will be viable and not be a burden on the taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business is the economic engine which drives this country. 
We in the Reform Party believe that.  We recognize that.  In 
fact, 75% of our caucus are small business people.  We believe 
very strong in that.  But government subsidies are not the 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the government again giving out $1.5 billion for small 
business loans programs. But with incredibly high payroll taxes 
and incredibly high bureaucracy it is just not working.  It is 
our job as legislators to create an economic environment where 
small businesses can succeed.  Right now they are struggling 
through extremely high levels of bureaucracy, red tape, forms, 
paperwork and the list goes on and on.  They are buried in it 
from all levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would argue there are many other ways that we can 
help small business.  Make no mistake, that is one of the 
principle objectives of the Reform Party of Canada.  We believe 
strongly in ensuring that small business has an economic 
climate where it can succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this small business program is just throwing money 
at it and hoping the problem will fix itself.  I would argue that 
is not going to happen.  I can never imagine in the private 
sector anywhere where anybody could borrow money and only be at a 
liability rate of 15%.  They would be laughed at. The banks would 
absolutely laugh at them anywhere else in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So assuming 50% liability, if a person has the confidence in his 
or her business plan, I would think what would be quite 
reasonable and would have been an excellent amendment to this 
legislation, equal partnership between the lender and the 
borrower in the liability of that loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to support this Reform 
amendment to create an equal partnership.  We need, more 
important, to move away from government subsidies and take away 
that liability on the taxpayer.  These are high risk loans. The 
default rate is very high with taxpayer money. It is not our 
money.  It is not our money to do as we please with.  The people 
who send us here hope we will use tax dollars wisely.  It is not 
that we would not invest the money in small businesses.  We would 
do it different to ensure that they were getting the help they 
need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to speak in general terms about the whole aspect of the 
government's loaning money to small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the reason the government first got into the business of 
loaning money to small businesses was that the banks simply 
refused to take on some of these ventures that had a little more 
risk involved in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look deep down into the purpose of government's 
loaning money to small businesses.  I think everyone will agree 
it is to encourage entrepreneurship, to put people to work in 
order to allow these people to flourish and perhaps even expand 
their businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the speakers today came up with instances where 
businesses had started in somebody's garage and then grown to 
nationwide and international businesses.  That is exactly what I 
think is the optimum goal of getting into a situation where the 
government loans businesses money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything we do here with regard to the Small Business Loans 
ACT should be pointed in that direction but I had a constituent 
who came to me the other day with an absolute horror story about 
borrowing money from the government. She is 58. She was involved 
in a government sponsored loans act. The Alberta Women's 
Enterprize Initiative Association loans money under western 
economic diversification.  I realize that is not exactly what we 
are debating but it is along those same principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lady went to the organization and asked to borrow some 
money.  She needed approximately $60,000.  It wrote her a 
contract for $60,000 at the rate of 17%.  This was in 1996 at a 
time when if you had any collateral at all you could borrow money 
for 6% or 7%.  Here it was saddling this person with a 17% 
interest rate. If that is helping small businesses it seems like 
a rather underhanded way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that the lender chose not to release all the funds. No 
doubt it was written into the contract. The lender kept about 
half the funds the person borrowed and on which she was paying 
interest.  Half the funds were kept on deposit in the financial 
institution from which she had borrowed the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is helping small business that is a little like throwing 
a drowning person a cement life saver.  If going into a new 
business were not risky enough, withhold about half the capital 
borrowed and charge 17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time the lady came to see me it was too late for me to 
intervene.  She had declared bankruptcy.  They had foreclosed on 
absolutely everything she had.  She had signed over her 
condominium, her life savings, her pension plan, everything she 
had as collateral toward this debt in order to get into business 
and be self-sufficient.  Now she is basically a charity case. She 
has had to move in with her daughter and she is in a terrible 
predicament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt very badly when this lady came to me and asked what I 
could do to help her. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1655

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short answer was that I could do very little if anything to 
help.  Likely I could do nothing.  At the time she came to see me 
this case was before the courts.  She is being sued for 
outstanding debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I could do was sympathize with her and say that if I had the 
opportunity I would bring her case before parliament. She agreed 
that there was nothing I could do to intervene.  She wondered if 
there was something that parliament could do to prevent this from 
happening to other unsuspecting people.  She admits quite freely 
that she was not cautious enough.  She should have read all the 
fine print.  She definitely made some mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think when we are talking about small business loan programs 
we should bear in mind what our ultimate goal is. If our goal is 
to help small businesses that had the other more established 
conventional lending institutions turn their backs on them, then 
we must make sure we are actually doing that and not simply 
putting a mill stone around these peoples' necks that they simply 
cannot carry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make sure taxpayers money is secured and that there 
is reasonable expectation for the business to flourish.  I think 
the people who are borrowing money to invest in a business must 
prove they have expertise to carry on this business and that they 
have the necessary training, some rudimentary understanding of 
how business works, rudimentary accounting abilities and also 
have some good independent counsel available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to leave today thinking that the House and the 
committee considering this bill will bear in mind the burden 
placed on them to ensure this legislation is fair and does do 
what people such as the lady who came to see me expect it to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise on Motion No. 6 put forward by my colleague from Saskatoon. 
We support this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment lowers the percentage of the government's 
liability for a defaulted loan.  This means the Liberals want to 
increase the government's liability with regard to small business 
loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are probably asking themselves have the Liberals not 
learned lessons with regard to liability.  Obviously not. They 
are the masters of this.  They have a $600 billion liability 
called the national debt that does not take into account the 
unfunded liability with the Canada pension plan, with native land 
claims and a host of other things we could toss on to the kitty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government, according to independent estimates such 
as the Fraser Institute, has put a total liability, in other 
words dug a potential hole, of two trillion dollars.  The 
government wants to once again saddle taxpayers with future debt 
and future taxes with an even greater liability.  The government 
does not think the way to solve the problems of small business is 
to actually lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, the Liberal solution for these things is always to increase 
the government's liability and therefore the taxpayers'.  The 
government feels it at election but the taxpayers are the ones 
who feel it in the long term. 
The people of my generation are certainly going to be paying for 
all the boondoggles this government has got us into and for all 
the debt that it dug us into when it had some of its former prime 
ministers and finance ministers at the helm.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment also means that the lender must assume a larger 
portion of any loss.  Business is about calculated risk.  That is 
something which unfortunately some of my Liberal friends across 
the way forget about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a business person is going to go to the government or is 
going to turn toward the Small Business Loans Act as opposed to 
going to a conventional bank or any other type of lender as they 
would for just about anything else, aside from any of these kinds 
of protections or special arrangements made through the Small 
Business Loans Act, they go ahead and negotiate a loan under 
normal circumstances.  Under these circumstances, of course, the 
government picks up the liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only fair for people who want access to money, especially 
when it is arranged through some special contrivance with the 
government, to be willing to accept some level of risk.  I do not 
think we would be asking them to accept too great a risk with the 
way the Small Business Loans Act would be structured by our 
motion.  It means that there is some sort of individual 
responsibility.  That is something that my Liberal friends across 
the way do not understand very well.  They understand collective 
responsibility very well, but not individual responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to digress and talk about the Charter of Rights an 
Freedoms to illustrate this point.  The charter was based upon 
the idea of collective responsibility.  That is something Pierre 
Trudeau believed in.  He believed that rather than going ahead 
and representing people as individuals, the charter should 
safeguard their rights as groups.  As a result, we have all sorts 
of groups across this land claiming victimhood status or some 
other sort of label.  The charter does not protect people as 
individuals, it instead protects peoples' collective rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part and parcel of the Liberal philosophy here.  It is 
representing collective rights.  It is representing group rights. 
It does not talk much about the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6, put forward by my hon. colleague from Saskatoon, 
states that by lowering the liability from 85% to 50% the lender 
also assumes a greater risk in making the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would like the government to have more liability 
which means that the taxpayer would have more liability.  It also 
means that the Liberals are disregarding the idea of individual 
responsibility for small business accountability.  They are 
trying to up the ante for the government to pick up the cost.  As 
well, lo and behold, it was not bad enough that they beat up on 
two groups with a baseball bat, they took that bat to a third 
group.  They actually now want the lenders, the banks or the 
institutions that give these loans, to have greater risk in terms 
of giving out this money.  Is that not the solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk to small business people they do not tell me that 
they want to have greater access to rope with which to hang 
themselves.  They do not want unending supplies of rope to 
regulate themselves, to tie themselves up or to strangle 
themselves and cut off the creative juices of productivity.  No, 
they do not want any of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want lower taxes.  That is what businesses are talking 
about.  They want less regulation.  They want less payroll taxes 
so they can employ more people and provide more jobs.  But that 
is not something these Liberals understand very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Nobody does it better than the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Nobody gives out jobs to their political 
friends better than Liberals.  That member across the way who 
heckled about Liberal jobs knows only too well about patronage. 
This institution is full of people who got jobs because of their 
friendship with the Prime Minister or other members across the 
way.  But I do not think that is the way to provide employment in 
this country. 
I do not think that is the solution.  I think the Liberal job 
creation strategy of patronage puts the taxpayers on the hook for 
these types of things and that is not the way it should go.  I 
have never door knocked a small businessperson in this country 
who told me they want to make sure there is full employment in 
this country and, therefore, every Liberal hack across the land 
should get a job, and a good patronage one at that.  I have never 
heard them say that yet.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The default rate under the Small Business Loans Act is nearly 10 
times higher than in the private sector.  The changes that the 
government wants to make will make it even worse.  How is the 
government helping small businesses by giving them more rope to 
hang themselves with?  That is not what they are asking for. 
Small business across the country is asking for tax cuts, less 
regulation and less government interference.  They want 
government out of their face and the Liberal government will not 
give it to them.  It comes back again and again.  It is always 
meddling with private business in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals think it is more important to give money to foreign 
aid than they think it is to give tax cuts.  They think it is 
more important to forgive foreign banks their debts, to the tune 
of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars—

interrupt you when you are on a roll about some of the problems 
the government has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk about the Small Business Loans Act.  They talk 
about wanting to increase the problems for the banks and the 
lenders which will be left holding the bag.  The government will 
be left holding the bag.  The default rates are going to continue 
to increase because of Liberal policies.  This whole philosophy 
is wrong-headed.  It is Liberal wrong-headed thinking.  It is not 
talking about allowing greater competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know small business people in Calgary who, when they needed 
money to expand their business, did not go grovelling to the 
Small Business Loans Act or any of those types of places.  To get 
entrepreneurial capital they went to the banks themselves, but 
they could not get it because of the conservative lending 
philosophies.  That is the way banks operate.  I understand that. 
Where did they go?  They could not get it anywhere in this 
country.  They went across the border to institutions in the 
United States because there was greater competition and less 
regulation.  As a result, they got access to the capital they 
needed.  That is a real solution that Liberals across the way are 
not talking about, greater competition and less regulation in 
banking.  That would be a—

to rise today to speak to Motions Nos. 6 and 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a lot of inaccurate information coming from members 
of the Reform Party.  It truly shows that they have a lack of 
understanding of what the Small Business Loans Act is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would assume that any financial institution would do proper 
due diligence on any person applying for a small business loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard somebody say that the loss is 10 times higher than it is 
in the private sector.  That is not true.  It is about double. 
The private sector has a loss of about 3.7% on its loans, and the 
average is 6%.  I cannot see how that is 10 times higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the 50% proposal.  Reform members assume that it 
is 50% of all losses.  It is not.  If it is a financial 
institution and it has an accumulated loan portfolio of $100 
million, it is 90% on the first $250,000, 50% on the next 
$250,000, and for any losses over and above that it is 10%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are saying there is going to be a huge amount of losses. 
That is not true.  I have trouble understanding their logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most small businesses would prefer to get their loans from 
financial institutions because to get small business loans they 
have to pay interest which is 3% above prime and another 1.5% in 
administrative fees.  It is unfortunate that these people cannot 
get their loans from financial institutions, but they help to 
create a lot of jobs.  Over the life of the Small Business Loans 
Act several hundred thousand jobs have been created.  A lot of 
businesses have grown bigger and they will create a lot more jobs 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 concerns the 21 day notice period.  A financial 
institution may have many loans across many of its branches. When 
it is given notice of an audit it takes a few days to collect the 
information.  That is the reason the committee supported 21 days 
for the notice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
spoke to the earlier amendments and I am delighted to speak to 
the amendments put forward in Group No. 4, Motions Nos. 7 and 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 was put forward by the official opposition.  Motion 
No. 8 was put forward by the Bloc.  I will be supporting Motion 
No. 7, but I have no reason to support Motion No. 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 would entirely delete two pilot projects aimed at 
expanding the loans program to the volunteer and capital lease 
sectors of the economy.  Capital lease ventures are those in 
which the major assets of the business are leased.  This serves 
to lessen the amount of money that can be recovered from the sale 
of assets in the case of default.  The volunteer sector is made 
up of not for profit organizations.  The Reform Party can rightly 
question why the taxpayer should be guaranteeing loans made to 
non-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party opposes the initiative outlined in clause 13 of 
Bill C-53 as it represents a broadening of the program that we 
cannot support in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Small Business Loans Act is intended to help small 
businesses in our economy.  Small businesses are the engine of 
the economy.  They keep the economy running.  Ninety-six per cent 
of the jobs in this country are created by small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government promotes bigger and larger businesses. It 
forgets about the small businesses.  Small businesses are already 
under pressure.  They have to pay high premiums for employment 
insurance.  They have to pay high premiums for the CPP.  They 
have all kinds of red tape.  Government is on the backs of small 
businesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, the government is giving subsidies, guarantees, 
loans and all kinds of good things to big business. Recently the 
government gave a $25 million tax free loan to Bombardier.  The 
government is taking care of big business, not small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government expands the scope of the SBLA to volunteer 
or non-profit organizations, it deprives smaller businesses of 
the opportunity to get financing from this program.  The intent 
of the act is therefore defeated.  Neither my colleague nor I can 
support this expansion of the Small Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 was put forward by the Bloc.  It would effectively 
expand the loan provision contained in the pilot project advanced 
by Bill C-53.  This pilot project includes the ability of 
industry to grant loans to the volunteer and capital sectors 
of the economy.  This would deprive entrepreneurs of the 
opportunity to start a business and create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is fundamentally opposed to expanding the loans 
program to include volunteer organizations in our economy.  All 
our MPs will support the initiative or any amendment to enhance 
prospects to help small business.  Based on that our position is 
very clear.  We cannot support any amendment or any of the 
sections which will expand the scope away from small business to 
anywhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general clearly identified in his report that larger 
organizations had been taking advantage, that smaller 
organizations had been collaborating, and that subsidies applied 
to other organizations that had received further loans.  The 
system has already been abused.  The auditor general has made 
some clear observations in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than clarifying the situation, making it simpler and 
focusing on small business, the government intends to diversify 
the scope so that small businesses will have to compete with 
medium and larger organizations for financing.  Through this 
amendment they will have to compete with non-profit and volunteer 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government wants to support volunteer organizations there are 
other means to do it.  We do not mean that volunteer 
organizations should not be supported, but they should not be 
allowed to compete with smaller businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government always gets things wrong.  It has been supporting 
larger businesses.  I gave an example the other day of being on 
the verge of an storm.  When the storm comes the bigger trees 
will fall and the smaller plants such as the grass will remain 
green.  Small organizations have this ability because they are 
grassroots organizations run by between two and five individuals, 
but they will only survive the storm if we support them.  We need 
to nourish the small business sector of our economy if we want 
the system to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, government should set things right in terms of how 
the economy works.  The government should look at employment 
records to see who creates the jobs. Many times the government 
pats itself on the back because it has created jobs.  It is not 
government that creates jobs.  It is the small business sector or 
its entrepreneurs that create jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been an entrepreneur.  I have been involved with small 
businesses from time to time.  I understand as many other small 
business entrepreneurs understand.  Small businesses are 
independent organizations.  The small business organization, the 
CFIB, has 
90,000 members.  It has been pleading with the government to 
ensure small businesses can take advantage of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell I ask government members to look into the 
effectiveness of the program to ensure that it achieves the 
objectives for which it was intended.  With these observations in 
mind I am hesitant to support the amendment made by the Bloc, but 
I will support Motion No. 7 put forward by the hon. member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt which highlights the withdrawal of that 
clause. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in this debate, especially as the fourth group is 
being considered, because I can speak of an amendment I made, 
which is supported by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I will not explain my amendment without responding to our 
colleague who has just spoken.  I think we cannot say how 
important the small and medium businesses are to the creation of 
jobs and to economic development and yet not look at the 
difficulties they have getting financing. 
The Small Business Loans Act, as the auditor general pointed 
out, needed a tightening of accounting criteria. However, it 
works and its principles carry over to other sectors and to 
other credit requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the aim of this part of the bill, which proposes—I 
would say even timidly—that pilot projects be set up to 
permit, among other things, what we in Quebec call social 
economics, that is, all the private projects that do not come 
from the co-operative sector, for example.  The labour and other 
co-operatives sector live and develop in the private economy 
sector, but it has its own internal rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This part of the social economy formed by co-operatives includes 
businesses not trying for maximum profits, but to create jobs 
and provide services. 
Their objective being financial self-sufficiency, why would this 
sector not also have access to the government guarantee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have no hesitation whatsoever in agreeing with 
this part of the bill. What I would like to see is to have 
another element added which would also be studied, in a pilot 
project, the operating capital fund. I shall explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the Reform members keep on saying about this 
bill, small and medium size businesses experience horrendous 
problems, particularly at time of setting up or of rapid 
expansion.  They have enormous difficulty in obtaining credit. 
If the laws of the marketplace are the only things coming into 
play, they will not get any credit, or they will have to pay 
exorbitant rates reflecting the risk they represent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the industry committee we receive representatives of the 
major banks every three months, and they tell us that, when 
fledgling or rapidly expanding businesses are concerned, there 
is a risk.  If there is no government guarantee, they tell us 
that this risk will have a very costly impact on small and 
medium size businesses and on economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the pilot project aimed at making the government 
guarantee accessible to businesses in the social economy sector, 
but I would also like to see another dimension added, the 
financing of working capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the studies that have been carried out for some time on the 
review of this act, a recommendation was looked at for 
guaranteeing working capital under certain conditions. 
No trace of this was evident in the bill itself, but it was 
discussed a great deal.  Some people were really very much in 
favour of this, because when financing is insufficient to cover 
the company until there is some revenue coming in, the project 
can fail completely because no credit was given at a certain 
point.  This is a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, people can say that other solutions will be found, 
that there will be funds from this or that source.  In Quebec 
there are a few of these, but they do not cover all localities 
and all municipalities.  This holds true even more in the rest 
of Canada than in Quebec.  Why not include, therefore, in the 
pilot project a means of studying the conditions under which 
working capital could be guaranteed, for instance through 
management advice?  There is nothing to prevent adding such 
advice to the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried an experiment and proposed to a number of Bloc Quebecois 
colleagues to follow my example and send a questionnaire to SMBs 
asking them if they were in favour of guarantees for working 
capital. One of the questions was “Do you think that if SMBs had 
more ready access to sufficient credit in hard times and to 
management advice there would be fewer bankruptcies and greater 
development?”  The number of yes responses was astronomical, 
because this is their experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often the credit lacking, plus the management advice, makes the 
difference between a business going bankrupt and weathering the 
storm and developing.  It is the governments' responsibility to 
be aware of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business people often start up without the necessary training 
and background, but once they have started and invested money 
they have accumulated for years—or money from their 
brother-in-law, and so on—there is no question of leaving them 
there saying “Too bad, they will learn a lesson going 
bankrupt`'. 
We have to be there with management advice and loan capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of bankruptcies is too high, but there is no need for 
that.  It could be different.   For things to change, SMBs need 
help and not just to be left to the market.  The market will 
allow the big businesses to come through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, public companies can get financing by selling stocks. 
They made the fortunes of people who bought stocks for a while. 
The situation is uncertain at the moment, and I know that in 
Great Britain there is concern about the American bubble, but 
that does not affect SMBs.  They need accessible credit, a sort 
of a blood transfusion, in conditions that are not too 
difficult, with a dose of management advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleagues opposite, since I do not think I can expect 
this from those beside me, will understand that it is easy to 
include working capital in the pilot project because it is a 
pilot project.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this were possible, I think it would a very important plus 
for a number of businesses that would otherwise be facing an 
unhappy ending to their adventure.  They lose everything, 
because at some point they lacked sufficient funding and 
management advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really hope that this addition to the pilot project will mean 
progress in understanding the conditions in which businesses 
grow and develop rather than die.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Mercier was very passionate in her 
defence of small business people.  I certainly appreciate her 
passion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I wonder whether she has her priorities just a little 
skewed. The parts of the bill that we do not like are not about 
small entrepreneurs.  They are about big banks and making their 
lives easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These 85% loan guarantees are not meant to be of benefit to the 
borrower.  These are of benefit to the lender.  I am sure the 
hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre agrees with me on 
this point.  It is probably the only thing in the world on which 
we agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to make the world safe for Matthew Barrett. This 
is exactly what we are doing.  If we were to amend this piece of 
legislation to remove any reference whatsoever to lending money 
to people in capital leasing ventures, we would be improving the 
legislation because we would be lowering the risk to the 
taxpayer, not the risk to the banks. The banks do not take a 
risk.  The parts of the bill we just discussed ensure that the 
banks are not going to get their hands burned.  The only people 
who are going to get burned are you and me and all the other 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who was an independent businessman for most of his 
adult life, I find that this is unconscionable.  I will go from 
unconscionable to obscene when I look at the provision for 
allowing small business loans to not for profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good heavens.  What does this have to do with economic growth? 
This is just another backdoor handout by this Liberal government 
to people who really have no legitimate call on public funds.  Of 
course for the Liberal government that is nothing new. There is 
always money for SNC Lavelin, for Bombardier and for the 
Desmarais family, for anybody who is really big and powerful and 
on the inside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Liberals have to have friends too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  The hon. member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre says that the Liberals have to have 
friends and he makes a very good point because aside from the 
type of people I have been discussing, I do not know who they 
would have for friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken as much on this piece of obscene legislation as I 
care to.  We know from what the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood said earlier that it is a waste of time to 
debate things in this House.  I will leave it to my colleagues if 
they wish to continue the debate.  Perhaps my colleague from 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre will say a few words.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to focus my 
remarks on Group No. 4, Motions Nos. 7 and 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 basically wants to eliminate the pilot projects as 
mentioned in the bill.  We have had committee hearings and 
consultations with the stakeholders and we have had an indication 
of strong support for this innovative pilot project under Bill 
C-53. The removal of the clause would eliminate the proposed 
pilot projects which respond to the express support for 
innovation by the stakeholders and various Senate and Commons 
committees. As was mentioned in committee, the industry committee 
would be instrumental in designing the proposed pilot program 
which would operate independently on a cost recovery basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given these measures the government sees no reason to eliminate 
an element of this bill which responds to the clearly expressed 
wishes of various parliamentary committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To point out what the Reform Party wants to eliminate, I will 
use as an example the Merritton Lions Club.  It is a very strong 
club which is non-profit and is volunteer based.  It has a large 
community centre and a large community arena which are operated 
on a not for profit basis and which address the concerns and 
needs of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Merritton Lions Club raises a lot of money to put on Labour 
Day parades and various other functions. It does good work in the 
community and returns everything back to the community.  As far 
as I am concerned, it is a very responsible and accountable group 
and its objective is the betterment of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This non-profit group could borrow money in a pilot program 
perhaps to renovate the kitchen facilities which have become 
obsolete.  This would better serve the community at large and all 
visiting teams at the arena and various participants that use the 
community centre and bowling alley. That could be a typical pilot 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminating that pilot project would shortchange us for being 
innovative and looking to the future on how the citizens of 
Canada could benefit.  For that reason I cannot support Motion 
No. 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 would include working capital as one of the pilot 
projects.  It was clear from the consultations that access to 
working capital remains a critical problem for small business. 
However, during our consultations on the Canada business 
financing act and specifically with the stakeholders, we heard 
over and over again that this was not the right tool for working 
capital. Stakeholders, including the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, believe that the risks are too high 
requiring business owners and lenders to apply more due diligence 
and monitoring than is currently needed for loans under this 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIB stated in its presentation to the industry committee 
just a few weeks ago “We have long been on record as saying that 
working capital needs should not come under the SBLA because it 
could ruin the entire program.  Lending for working capital 
purposes is a very different game”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the member for Mercier for her desire to 
continue to help small business, which is not necessarily the 
same for most of the parties in the House, except one.  Her 
efforts continue to help small business get on with doing 
business and creating jobs for this country. I would like to 
thank her for her work on behalf of small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure as a result of her amendment that further discussion 
needs to be done in the Standing Committee on Industry.  She 
brings forward a very good suggestion. 
It is probably not the right one at this time, but the industry 
committee needs to look at how to provide working capital for 
small business in a better manner.  I am sure that the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business would be able to add its 
remarks on how that should be done.

<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the 
government members are not willing to speak about the glowing 
virtues of Bill C-53, this bill they say they are so proud of, 
then they are going to have to listen to me critique it a bit 
more.  That is the way this place works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the folks back home to clearly understand what is 
happening here today.  We have a debate on Bill C-53, the Canada 
small business financing act.  The opposition has once again made 
some very useful amendments to this piece of legislation.  Once 
again, the government has brought in closure and is trying to 
shut down the debate. It does not want to seriously consider the 
amendments that have been brought forward by the various parties 
on this side of the House to try and make it a better piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I talk at great length about Group No. 4, I would like to 
note that this is not the first time the government has brought 
in closure.  This is not the first time it has used time 
allocation or closure motions.  As a matter of fact in the 35th 
Parliament the government brought in closure 35 times.  There 
were 32 time allocation motions and three closure motions. In 
this brand new 36th Parliament since I was elected on June 2, 
1997, the government has brought in nine time allocation motions, 
including the one on Bill C-53.  The grand total is 44 times. 
There have been 41 time allocation motions and three closure 
motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to say that Bill C-53 is a boon to small 
business yet the Liberals want to bring in time allocation.  If 
this were such a boon to small business, if these Liberals were 
so generous to small business, all of them would be in here 
giving speeches and sending copies off to their constituents, 
preening themselves about how they love small business. But no. I 
think they are ashamed of the fact that they have raised taxes 40 
times.  They have raised payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  We have had a number of discussions here today about 
staying focused on the motions.  I have heard this member a 
number of times go far away from the motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for St. Catharines 
for raising this point.  I am sure the hon. member was 
zeroing in on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, focus we shall have.  I 
shall focus on Group No. 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7, the Reform motion put forward by my friend the 
hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt, would change the nature of 
Bill C-53. We would not have as much of an expansion of the loans 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government across the way knows only too well about 
expansion.  It started off as a fairly small government when the 
Liberals first got their hooks on it many moons ago and it has 
grown and grown.  The taxes have gone up and up and up to deal 
with this growing government and this expansionist philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking with the great focus which those Liberal friends of 
mine would like me to speak, I will deal with Motion No. 7. The 
volunteer sector is the not for profit organizations.  There is a 
legitimate question to be raised about why the taxpayer should 
guarantee loans made to some of those organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, Motion No. 8 expands the loan provisions. As 
well, this involves the ability of industry to grant loans to the 
volunteer and capital leasing sectors of this economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry is not just industry in terms of other businesses. 
More specifically, it means the department and that touches on 
the minister.  It touches on political interference and there 
certainly is a history of that. 
When we look at government involvement in loans and the granting 
of loans, we could rattle off a litany of political interference 
with regard to loans by the Liberal administration.

is one of the reasons we are opposed to this type of thing.  I 
think of Charlottetown, that failed constitutional agreement that 
was rejected by Canadians from coast to coast.  I remember how 
there were threats and musings over the phone by people who 
represented the government, saying that not for profit volunteer 
organizations better back the Charlottetown accord otherwise 
their grants might not be approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went ahead and supported the Charlottetown accord.  Then 
after they were told they had better get their grants in right 
away because they had been good loyal supporters of the Liberal 
regime.  That is the reason we cannot have political 
interference.  That is the reason we have problems with this 
legislation.  That is the reason the opposition is talking about 
amending it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
government members were so proud of this piece of legislation I 
know they would stand in this place to defend it, but they do 
not.  There is a general lack of interest on the government side 
in this regard yet they have brought in closure.  Something 
smells funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Liberal friends across the way would like me to focus on the 
motions actually mentioned in Group No. 5.  They are Motions Nos. 
9 and 10.   This is all about making the process a more open 
process.  The way it is done right now we need an effective check 
to be placed on the minister, the minister's departmental 
officials and their ability to arbitrarily implement changes in 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about these back door regulations that the 
government can bring in.  I remember in the red book promises of 
1993 and 1997 how the government across the way, the Liberals, 
talked about wanting a more open, transparent government.  I 
support that.  I think we should have a more open and transparent 
government.  The reason I do not vote Liberal is that I believe 
in those things but I have not seen them deliver.  That is the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I speak to the people at home.  They are the ones who 
will have to make these decisions in the next election.  They 
should make sure they get a hold of Motions Nos. 9 and 10 in 
Group No. 5 with regard to Bill C-53, the Small Business Loans 
Act.  The government has brought in closure.  It has tried to 
stifle the debate the opposition has tried to generate and 
the amendments to improve the legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt put a lot of time, 
blood, sweat, effort and tears into coming up with these changes 
so that we could improve the legislation.  The people across the 
way do not want to listen to these things.  Indeed I mentioned 
before how 44 times they have brought down closure in the House 
because they do not like listening to the ideas of the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we want a more open process?  Why do we want to prevent 
departmental officials in their ability to arbitrarily implement 
changes in the legislation?  It is because small business owners 
want some sort of degree of predictability.  They do not like 
being at the caprice or at the whim of the government and some of 
its back door officials or some of its henchmen.  They do not 
like the idea of having legislation changed just because some 
bureaucrat some place, some hidden face in the bureaucracy, would 
like to make their lives a little more difficult or change the 
circumstances upon which they started their business and upon 
which they are going ahead and pushing forward with that 
business, or their ability to go ahead and access capital and 
financing.  They do not need that type of intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke with respect to political interference.  When one allows 
some bureaucrat or departmental official the ability to go ahead 
and tweak these regulations and do with them as they please and 
to treat small businesses as though they were puppets, that can 
lead to all types of interference and all types of corruption. We 
have seen that before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as though I stand in this place to speak about these 
things as something theoretical.  They are very practical.  On a 
day to day basis we stand in the House to put forward statements, 
to ask questions and to try to find out about some of the 
spurious activities that have gone on with regard to loans. 
Friends of the government have been able to benefit from loan 
arrangements to the tune of millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Name one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  The Blood Bank Corporation.  The hon 
member asked me to name one.  I would only be too happy to talk 
about these types of things and how insidious they can be. It is 
not the only example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency one can count a 
number of problems where the Liberals promised to create jobs and 
did not do the job in a number of these cases just because of 
political interference.  People overrode guidelines that were set 
for the granting of money or for providing a loan and the 
Liberals closed their eyes because they were political friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They covered them up despite the fact they knew it would not 
work and that they knew they did not have a commitment from the 
Chinese government for $300 million worth of business for the 
storage of blood.  They went ahead and gave out over $2 million 
of federal taxpayer money.  The Government of Newfoundland helped 
out with another $500,000.  They used that to finance from 
private people $6.3 million.  Now everybody is holding the bag 
for about $10 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a million here and a million there, pretty soon we are 
talking real money.  That is the problem when we allow tinkering 
behind the scenes by bureaucrats.  They go ahead and they put 
taxpayers dollars at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look around and see the pages in the House.  They are the ones 
who will have to pay taxes because of what the government has 
done. They are the ones who will have to pay for the mistakes. 
They are the ones who will be left holding the bag on some of 
these bad loans and these defaults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I bring to your attention again, as I have numerous times 
this afternoon, the importance of staying focused on the 
amendments on regulation change.  I would hope that we would stay 
focused on them, because I am at the point where I think my 
privileges as a member of parliament have been broken.  I believe 
that if there is a ruling concerning— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member intervenes again. 
The first time I thought the member was going to come around and 
he did a little bit.  I know the hon. member for Calgary West 
will focus his last three minutes or so on the regulations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me read it verbatim for 
members across the way so they can make sure they get the full 
benefit of it.  The amendment was brought forward by the member 
for Saskatchewan—Humboldt, a Reform colleague of mine.  I want 
to focus the debate for them because I was talking about 
political interference.  I will read it as it stands:  “This 
amendment is brought forward in order to make the bill's 
regulatory process more open”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Reform Party is trying to do.  We are trying to 
make the regulatory process more open.  I hope the member across 
the way has his ears open.  We are trying to make it more open 
and make it more accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is speaking about as directly as I can to Motions Nos. 9 
and 10.  By tabling regulations in parliament and having the 
House of Commons or a committee subsequently pass them, we want 
to make sure an effective check is placed on ministers or 
departmental officials in terms of a bill to arbitrarily 
implement changes in the legislation.  That is as straightforward 
as it gets.  I am reading it straight up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a widespread problem where departmental officials and 
ministers will bring through the back door via regulations what 
they would not or will not spell out in legislation.  We are 
opposed to this practice and are attempting to remedy the 
problem.  That is about as direct as I can be in terms of the 
problems we are facing and why we brought forward Motions Nos. 9 
and 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we have too many examples in this place of 
where the Liberals have said “Trust us”.   They were to put the 
legislation forward and not cross all the <I>t</I>'s and dot all 
the <I>i</I>'s.  They said “Don't worry.  Some capable technocrat 
or bureaucrat will know what is best for you”.  They will tinker 
with it and and make whatever changes they feel best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on them.  Fool me once and shame on the Liberals.  Fool me 
twice and what we have is a government that has broken trust too 
many times.  We put our faith in the government and it went ahead 
and raised our taxes and brought in more regulation.  It made it 
more difficult to do business and to generate jobs.  The Liberals 
say they believe in creating jobs, jobs, jobs, but we see the 
record of political interference, bad loan policies and defaults. 
I am sorry I cannot put my faith in them on this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to see it printed in black and white.  I want to be able 
to debate it in the House as we are doing now.  Members across 
the way would be content to sit down, not debate and allow it to 
pass.  It is evidence, point in fact, because they brought 
forward closure legislation that they do not want the legislation 
looked at with any great degree of scrutiny or a microscope 
brought to it.  They want it shovelled through so they can leave 
for Christmas, not worry about it any more and pass it off to the 
bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what they would prefer to do.  They do not like the 
business of governing.  It would be a lot easier to set up third 
party arm's length relationships so that when something happens 
the minister cannot be blamed.  It will be some nameless, 
faceless bureaucrat they can fire and blame the problem on.  That 
is not good enough.  They are the stewards of taxpayers money. 
They are the ones who vote for the increase in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they do that, the onus is on them.  They have a 
responsibility as Liberal legislators to make sure we debate 
these issues and that they are not being decided by some 
bureaucrat behind closed doors.  They should be brought out for 
scrutiny so that we have a chance to debate the decisions.  They 
should be accountable for them without arm's length relationships 
or firing somebody in the bureaucracy or in the ministry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 9 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-53, in Clause 14, be amended by replacing line 22 on

</I></B></P><P align=left>“subject to subsections (2), (3) and (3.1), on the

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that two sections in the regulations under 
paragraph 1 shall be made on the recommendation of the Minister 
of Finance.  Whereas under subsection (3) of the bill, the 
minister shall call for a copy of the regulations proposed to be 
made under subsection (1) to be laid before each House of 
parliament before it is made and the House shall refer the 
proposed regulations to the appropriate committee of each House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a housekeeping amendment that I am delighted to put in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill C-53, in clause 14, be amended 
by adding after line 19 on page 9 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(3.1) No regulation made under subsection (1) shall come into 
force unless and until it is affirmed by a resolution of both 
Houses of Parliament introduced and passed in accordance with the 
rules of those Houses”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give our rationale for this amendment.  This amendment is 
brought forward in order make the bill's regulatory process more 
open and accountable.  What Canadians want from this government 
is accountability in Bill C-53 which deals with the Small 
Business Loans Act.  We need the process to be more open, 
transparent and credible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By tabling regulations in parliament and having the House or a 
committee subsequently pass them, an effective check is placed on 
the departmental officials' ability to arbitrarily implement 
changes in legislation.  That is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals passed the following amendment at a clause by 
clause committee consideration: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) The Minister shall cause a copy of each regulation proposed 
to be made under subsection (1) to be laid before each House of 
Parliament before it is made. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is wholly inadequate.  Reform's amendment at clause by 
clause stipulated that the regulation itself, not a draft of the 
proposed regulations, be put before the committee.  Also, 
Reform's amendment placed a 15 day timeframe on the committee 
reporting the regulations back to the House.  There is no similar 
requirement in the Liberal amendment.  That is why this amendment 
becomes important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a widespread problem where departmental officials and 
the minister's officials will bring regulations through the back 
door what they would not or will not spell out in the 
legislation.  We do not want to fool anyone here.  We want the 
legislation to be transparent, open and accountable.  We do not 
want a back door open to introduce these regulations. Reform is 
opposed to this practice, and this motion attempts to remedy 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals voted against our motion and passed their watered 
down version.  That is why we are trying to move this one again 
at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry tabled with the committee, on three 
days short notice, the parliamentary draft of regulations for 
Bill C-53.  It consisted of 25 separate sections dealing with 
changes in the approval or application process.  Not one of them 
dealt with the most contentious issues like expanding the 
parameters to include pilot projects for volunteers and capital 
leasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to discuss these issues in detail but 
unfortunately the government has put time allocation on this so 
that we cannot debate and argue those issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While every regulation made by the government stands permanently 
referred to the committee for the scrutiny of regulations, that 
committee does not have the authority to revoke the regulations. 
The hon. member knows very well.  It merely has the power to 
recommend a disallowance.  It cannot revoke.  It can just 
disallow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of a statutory disallowance procedure, abuse of 
the regulatory process by officials and ministers has taken place 
in the past.  There is the recent example of aboriginal-only 
fisheries.  Beyond that, the scrutiny of regulations committee 
has a very narrow band in which it can recommend action on any 
regulations.  That becomes the place where Canadians cannot raise 
their argument, where Canadians cannot discuss the advantages and 
disadvantages.  We do not get the opportunity to debate.  That is 
the point I am trying to make here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases there is an unfair onus to prove through legal 
precedent that the regulation is ultra vires of the Constitution. 
In such cases this is impossible to do because the regulation has 
never before been implemented.  It cannot have been challenged 
before a court because it has not been tabled before nor has it 
been implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like an iceberg, legislation like Bill C-53 provides only 10% of 
the equation.  Only 10% of the equation is provided by the House. 
The other 90% comes from the back door via regulations from the 
minister after the legislation is passed in parliament.  What 
good is this debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What good is this debate if we only have 10% of the agenda 
before us while 90% or some significant amount is added through 
the regulations?  That is what we are trying to stop.  That is 
why we want the system to be transparent and accountable right 
here in the House where we are debating the bill. Having 
regulations reviewed by parliament ensures a modicum of 
accountability rather than just a rubber stamp of approval by the 
minister.  We cannot have that shoved through the opposition or 
through the members and we cannot have that pass through this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing regulations before parliament ensures the publication 
process and review of regulations is more open to the public. 
Witnesses can add their concerns or bring about improvements. 
They can do so in more of a public forum.  As it is now the 
publication period merely allows for the opportunity to comment. 
Comments are reviewed by officials within the department.  In 
many cases they are the same people who drafted those 
regulations.  So where is the justification?  As such they must 
be seen to be in a conflict of interest position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to changing the wording of the regulations, the 
prime example is the Canadian food and restaurant association. It 
has serious problems with the regulations that were given to 
committee members only last week.  The regulatory process is 
largely unacceptable to Canadians.  Putting it before committee 
would to some extent allow for more public input by stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting the motions put forward by the hon. member 
for Saskatoon—Humboldt.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 9 ensures the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10 would mean that a resolution of both Houses of 
parliament would be required before a regulation could be made. 
The proposed amendment is contrary to the established process for 
making regulations.  Requiring a resolution of both Houses of 
parliament before proceeding to making a regulation is opposite 
to the principle of delegated authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it appears to contradict clause 14(1).  This 
would amendment would impose significant limitations on the 
ability of the government to respond when regulatory changes are 
required for the effective administration of the program or when 
regulations must be adapted to respond to program abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 3 already requires that the proposed regulatory 
changes be laid before each House of parliament, giving 
parliament and the standing committee notice of all proposed 
regulatory changes.  These items were discussed very thoroughly 
in the committee meetings.  As far as I am concerned it did the 
committee well in making this recommendation for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit the ongoing delay by the Reform Party and its 
continuous attacking of small business or the tying up of this 
bill so as to not make things happen is the debate that we have 
carried on this afternoon.   There have not been any valid points 
brought forward.  It is only an attempt to delay this small 
business financing act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent to stop the bill in any which way, including the 
front door and the back door, is not going to work with this

Bill C-53, the small business financing act, is what we are 
debating. Motion No. 12 has been put forward by a Reform 
colleague of mine, the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt.  He wants 
to make sure there is proper accountability with regard to this. 
Lo and behold, the Reform Party is once again talking about 
accountability and is trying to amend a government bill to make 
it a better bill and to make the world a better place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it does with most motions put forward by the opposition, the

minimum length of incarceration, if warranted, would be six

</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to 
have been moved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>POVERTY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to follow up on a question I put to the government 
earlier in November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Deputy Prime Minister if the government was planning 
to redefine the way poverty is measured in Canada. I have to say 
that the response I received was very pathetic. Rather than 
address the very serious question about changing the low income 
cutoff for the definition of how we measure poverty in Canada, 
the government fell back on its usual line which was to say that 
its commitment to eradicate poverty was nothing more than the 
child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single time members of the opposition have raised in the 
House the issue about the growth in child poverty and the growth 
in poverty in Canada, we have had the same response from the 
government, that $850 million has been committed to the child tax 
benefit. If any member of the government took the time to examine 
the statistics, the facts and the record about what really has 
happened with the child tax benefit, they would know that the 
reality is that the poorest of children received less benefit 
from the child tax benefit in 1997 than they did in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only families whose support has increased are the working 
poor with incomes roughly between $10,000 or $25,000.  I point 
this out because it shows the hypocrisy of the government 
program.  It purports to be concerned about child poverty but the 
child tax benefit falls far, far short of helping the poorest 
Canadians, the poorest children.  They are worse off than they 
were in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In debating this issue briefly tonight, we should recognize that 
tomorrow is the anniversary of the unanimous resolution in the 
House of Commons in 1989 to eradicate child poverty by the year 
2000.  The sad reality is that in Canada not only have we not 
made any progress but the situation has deteriorated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, there are suggestions that the government 
is looking to change how it defines poverty.  It reminds me of a 
statement made by a social policy consultant, Mr. Shillington, 
who said to beware of those who would address child poverty by 
discussing its definition rather than its root causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is still before us. We have not yet had an answer. 
Is the Liberal government planning behind closed doors to look at 
a redefinition of how we measure poverty in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for bringing this up is that at the finance committee 
on October 14, the Liberal member for Mississauga South asked the 
finance minister “Do you believe the government should redefine 
or define in the first instance true poverty in Canada, true 
poverty where we are talking about food, clothing and shelter?” 
The response from the finance minister in part was “I think it 
would be quite helpful in fact to have a definition of poverty 
that is not a relative definition of poverty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sends out huge warning signs that the government is looking 
at redefining the way it measures poverty. It really begs the 
question— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that the 
time has run out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the idea 
that instead of acting to address poverty the Government of 
Canada is simply trying to define poverty away is a grave 
misunderstanding of what the government stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, the government has consistently demonstrated its concern 
and commitment to low income Canadians and especially the needs 
of children and youth.  For instance, the government, in 
partnership with provincial and territorial governments, has 
taken action in the area of child poverty and has made children a 
priority through the national child benefit.  The benefit will 
help low income parents to improve their circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2000 a total of $1.7 billion per year of new money 
will be directed to low income families.  This is over and above 
the $5.1 billion the government spends on families with children 
year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite has made clear that this $1.7 billion on top 
of the $5.1 billion does not impress her.  Perhaps this is 
because she arrived in this place at a time when the government 
had begun to reverse the fiscal situation that we all faced when 
we first came here in 1993.  Had she been here at that time she 
might realize that any new money was pretty miraculous, 
considering we had been through years of doing nothing but 
cutting.  We are pretty proud of the fact, and maybe we do 
overstate it, that the first new money we spent was on families 
with children who are in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is concerned with the measurement of poverty as 
well but not in the way she implied in her question.  The fact is 
that among experts there is no consensus around the existing 
measures of poverty.  Some think existing measures are too high 
and some think they are not high enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada has stated that its low income cutoff, a 
measure used by many—

interrupt the parliamentary secretary.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IMMIGRATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, illegal immigration is becoming a big problem in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent report given to the federal government has indicated 
that as many as 16,000 illegal immigrants are entering Canada 
every year with the help of smugglers.  Whether they are entering 
the country by boat, on land or through the air, the number of 
illegal immigrants passing the borders and coming into the 
country is costing the Canadian taxpayer an enormous amount of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it be in the processing of false immigration claims or 
in the fighting of organized crime in which a large number of 
illegal immigrants are involved, the money being spent in 
relation to this problem continues to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trafficking of illegal immigrants is becoming a profitable 
business and furthermore an international business.  Smugglers 
have set up syndicates for these types of operations in countries 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This demonstrates how vast the problem really is and how much of 
a global dilemma it is becoming.  Not only should we deal with 
the problem here in Canada but the issue should also be dealt 
with internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs that the federal and provincial governments have to 
cover also include over $400 million a year for the handling and 
processing of false refugee claimants.  Moreover, it has been 
estimated that each claimant costs the government $50,000 in 
social benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study that I mentioned earlier indicates that between 30% 
and 60% of the claimants that approach the Canadian government 
lack proper documents.  In addition, experts estimate that most 
of the people without documentation are linked to smugglers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people can be expected to pay up to $50,000 to be 
transported into countries such as Canada, although the price 
does depend on the destination and complexity of the 
circumstances surrounding the trip.  However, since most recently 
apprehended smugglers have received fairly lenient sentences, the 
majority of them claim that the risk is worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These newly arrived people often enter our country with 
substantial debt due to the enormous price they had to pay to be 
transported across the border.  Most really could not afford the 
high costs but often found it necessary to leave their homes 
anyway and head for another country.  Imagining they would be 
able to repay it once they had found employment at their 
destination, they often arrive and have trouble finding a job, 
which becomes problematic.  Many of them then become involved in 
low paying jobs or other things and some in fact become involved 
in criminal activity, which also becomes a problem.  This 
obviously contributes to the rise in crime in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organized crime problem in Canada is a multibillion dollar 
burden on society.  This study given to the federal government 
maintains that the illegal immigration problem that we are 
encountering is doing nothing but adding to the already 
tremendous amount of money that is coming out the country's 
pockets. 
Illegal immigrants are adding to Canada's costs of operation, 
both in fighting crime and in processing false immigration 
claims.  Something needs to be done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General once 
again what he proposes be done to suppress this problem.  We need 
to do something about this on a national level and then bring it 
to the attention of an international forum.  How can we as 
Canadians rectify this problem? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first, I want to thank the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington 
for his very pertinent question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the federal government has made the prevention 
and interdiction of illegal immigrants trafficking one of its 
priorities, precisely for the reasons mentioned by the hon. 
member. Indeed, according to the report to which my colleague 
made reference, it is estimated that, every year, up to 16,000 
people enter Canada with the help of smugglers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on that report, this illegal activity may generate up to 
$400 million in illicit profits. In light of this, I can 
certainly understand the hon. member's concern. 
To curb such activity, Canada has made the smuggling of aliens a 
criminal offence entrenched in our national legislation and 
carrying stiff penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, Canadian officials from a number of federal departments 
are co-operating with their counterparts in other UN countries on 
a convention on transnational organized crime. One potential 
related protocol would deal with the smuggling of aliens. 
Canadian officials are actively involved in various 
international initiatives, particularly those of the G-8 Lyon 
group on organized crime, and conducting major international 
consultations on the asylum policies in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At home, officials from the RCMP and the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration continue to co-operate across the 
country and through our missions abroad to put an end to these 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to work together with our partners in order to 
fight this criminal activity and any other form of organized 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only repeat how much I share my hon. colleague's concern 
and that, as he indicated, both national and international 
solutions must be sought. This is a priority. Fighting organized 
crime is the solicitor general's top priority.

<P><A NAME="LINK284"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to pursue 
some questions I raised in the House on June 2, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question pertains specifically to the issue of Meme breast 
implants and more broadly about the state of affairs in the 
health protection branch.  The answers to both of my questions 
were incomplete and certainly not pertinent to the serious 
situation which I posed to this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised specifically the concerns about the criminal 
investigation launched last June into the breast implant issue 
and asked why the government had taken so long to pursue this 
very serious issue after it had been raised nine years previously 
by a former colleague of mine, Joy Langan, from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further asked the minister about the government's ability to 
assess and ensure the safety of current breast implant products 
on the market, along with my colleague, the Leader of the New 
Democratic Party.  In both instances we found that the answers 
were very superficial and did not deal with the gravity of the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely clear that we are dealing with the two-pronged 
situation of women who suffered the consequences of inadequate 
protection from the government many years ago with respect to the 
breast implant product, and of the concerns we have today with 
respect to products now on the market.  We have very serious 
worries about whether this government is actually ensuring the 
safety of those products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the experts in the field have actually said that present 
day saline filled breast implants are the same design over which 
a plastic surgeon sued the manufacturer in the mid-1980s.  All 
such devices have the same leaky valves that cannot hold water. 
They grow algae and fungi like a dirty aquarium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to hear specifically what steps this government is 
taking to assess products on the market to ensure that they are 
safe beyond any reasonable doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also raised more broadly the issue of the role of the health 
protection branch because we are not just dealing with the 
question of a criminal investigation into breast implants, but 
also a criminal investigation into the safety of our blood 
supply.  We are dealing with serious sworn testimony from 
scientists about gag orders, about intimidation, about threats, 
about pressure to approve a bovine growth hormone when they do 
not believe it is safe.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with a pattern of inconsistency and secrecy 
throughout the department in a number of areas.  We are dealing 
with a situation where the drug approval process is largely paid 
for by the pharmaceutical industry.  This all adds up to a very 
grave situation that requires the government to take immediate 
and prompt action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have called for a complete investigation into the 
health protection branch on an urgent basis.  We have raised this 
suggestion on numerous occasions since last spring.  We will 
continue our efforts to implore the Minister of Health to take 
these concerns seriously and get to the bottom of what many would 
call a culture of deception in the health protection branch. 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the member opposite for her question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that certain allegations have been made against the 
health protection branch of the department of my colleague, the 
Minister of Health. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ministry of Health is taking a number of measures to restore 
trust and morale among staff and credibility with the public.  I 
repeat, credibility with the public.  This includes the 
establishment of expert advisory committees to guide scientific 
decision making and resolve scientific disputes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the longer term, the Minister of Health will examine the 
function of public health protection in the context of an 
integrated federal role.  He will then have to consider three 
important issues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we need a process for decision making that delineates 
each step in the development of risk management strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we need to expand the traditional communications 
function to have a broader public affairs orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we need to address fundamental human resources and 
organizational culture issues, such as the need for scientific 
staff to understand the larger context in which their work takes 
place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health is looking at the best possible standards 
of service to protect public health and safety, which is—I 
repeat—an objective that we share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
