</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I wish I could say at the outset that 
it is a pleasure for me to rise to speak to Bill C-26 this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the pleas of opposition members during second reading 
debate on March 27 to the government to actually listen to 
producers, to farmers, to the special crops producers themselves 
when this bill was being considered at committee, the government 
failed to implement the very amendments that the producer groups 
wanted almost unanimously.  I speak primarily about the issue of 
the negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way Bill C-26 is presently constituted, the check-off or the 
levy from producers' cheques when they haul in a load of special 
crops will be mandatory despite what the government says and 
despite the fact that producers wanted it to be voluntary. 
It is only voluntary by nature of negative option billing.  In 
other words, the producer must at the beginning of the crop year 
state that he or she does not want their levy to be put into the 
pool to provide for the insurance of the buyers and then keep 
track of how much is collected off their crops during the year 
and submit those receipts at the end of the year.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an amendment at committee stage put forward by the 
government and the parliamentary secretary implied that the 
producer would now only have to apply once during the year in 
order to opt out.  I do not see that in the way the amendment is 
written.  It is a small step in the right direction in that it 
clarifies that the Canadian Grain Commission, acting as the agent 
for this fund, must reimburse the producer if he or she opts out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only substantive amendment made at committee stage that was 
passed, just to bring the viewers at home and the industry up to 
speed, was that the Liberal dominated agricultural standing 
committee dropped the possible future inclusion of the six 
standard grains:  wheat, barley, oats, rye, flax and canola. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some concern in the industry in western Canada that at 
some time in the future this levy on special crops could be 
expanded to the standard grains.  Fortunately the government saw 
the wisdom of clarifying that and actually excluded them. 
Unfortunately the government did not show the same wisdom when we 
were debating Bill C-4, the changes to the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act.  It should have done that to exclude any grains other than 
barley and wheat which are presently under the control of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-26 do?  It establishes a system of licensing 
and insuring special crops dealers and buyers.  It moves from the 
present system whereby the buyers and the dealers have to put up 
a securities bond to cover the unfortunate eventuality of 
bankruptcy or receivership to protect the producers.  It moves 
away from the present system of putting up bonds to a system of 
licensing and insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has been hailed by the government as the greatest 
thing since sliced bread in the context of what is good for the 
special crops producers, but there is absolutely no evidence that 
moving to this new system of licensing and insuring will actually 
expand the special crops industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Bill C-26 makes some changes to the Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act.  The present 
enforcement mechanisms in the act are much too limited in scope. 
Most of the mechanisms are too harsh and costly to impose.  In 
many cases, if there are minor infractions, there is a limit to 
what the Canadian Grain Commission can do.  I think this is a 
step in the right direction and certainly one that we would 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Bill C-26 would repeal the 59 year old Grain Futures 
Act, clearing the way for the Manitoba Securities Commission to 
assume responsibility for regulating the Winnipeg commodity 
exchange.  I think that, as well, is a step in the right 
direction and certainly something we would support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, there are a number of things contained in the bill 
which the opposition supports.  However, I must say at the outset 
of the debate today that while my Reform colleagues and I, acting 
as agriculture critics for the official opposition, gave 
tentative support pending committee stage at second reading, we 
will withdraw that support and oppose this bill unless the 
amendments that we have before us in Groups Nos. 1 and 2 today 
are passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do our motions in Group No. 1 actually do?  We feel there 
is a need for a board of directors made up primarily of farmers 
versus the advisory board that is presently constituted in Bill 
C-26.  The bill, as presently laid out, allows the minister to 
appoint an advisory board to assist him with the management of 
this levy fund and the insurance that will flow from it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have said, what producers have said and what witnesses 
who appeared before the standing committees have said is that 
they want to see farmers in control of the fund.  They do not 
want to see it in the control of the administrators, the 
bureaucrats with the Canadian Grain Commission.  They do not want 
to see it being controlled by possible patronage appointees put 
forward by the hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it is farmers' money, producers' money, that is being 
taken off their cheques and funnelled into the fund they want to 
see that controlled by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put forward a group of amendments.  First, Motion No. 7 
states that the minister must, not may, bring forward a board of 
directors made up of farmers.  Second, these producers would be 
chosen from names submitted by special grains commodities groups. 
In other words, farmers would choose those people, put the list 
forward, and the minister would choose them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly have seen with the appointment of a past Liberal 
MP, Ron Fewchuk, the type of political appointment that we do not 
want to see on this board.  There are many other examples.  I 
just use the one that echoes the concern of producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the motions contained in Group No. 1 we see that the people 
on the advisory board will not have a lot of power.  We have seen 
that with the Canadian Wheat Board.  Even if the minister 
appoints this advisory board made up of nine members, the 
majority of whom must be producers as it states in the act 
currently, we heard from producers that they are concerned about 
not having much power.  They are only in an advisory capacity. 
Certainly we have seen that with the Canadian Wheat Board.  That 
is one reason, because of a lot of pressure from western Canadian 
grain farmers, that the wheat board is moving toward a board of 
directors made up primarily of producers, of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this group of amendments we want to see the same thing for 
this special crops advisory board.  We want to see it become a 
managerial board of directors that would have some real power to 
look after farmers' money drawn from a check-off from their 
cheques and used to assure grain buyers and grain dealers. It is 
the farmers' money.  Why should they not have control of that 
rather than bureaucrats or government appointees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is basically the thrust of Reform's motions contained in 
Group No. 1.  I certainly urge all members to seriously consider 
these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are amendments not just put forward by the official 
opposition.  We heard from a lot of producer groups concern on 
the part of farmers.  They did not want to see this check-off 
used because it is mandatory up front, as I already laid out at 
the start of my remarks.  They did not want to see that check-off 
used in a way that they might feel is detrimental.  They want to 
see it managed as effectively and as efficiently as possible. The 
only way they can see that happening is if farmers control the 
fund.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
last time I spoke to Bill C-26 was at second reading.  I stated 
that there were a number of elements of the bill that needed to 
be looked at more closely and that I expected the committee would 
look into the bill in further detail when it did clause by clause 
analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee in fact looked into the issues of concern.  The 
government even introduced several amendments that made this 
piece of legislation better for western Canadian farmers. 
Committee members from all parties supported the government 
amendments.  The government actually provided some good, sound 
amendments in this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government did not see eye to eye with the 
opposition parties on one key element, that being the voluntary 
aspect of the bill.  The amendments that my party has put forward 
from the hon. member for Brandon—Souris take into account this 
element of the bill.  The majority of the stakeholders who 
appeared wanted this system to be voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 2 Motions Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6 speak to the aspect the 
government has not addressed.  I will speak to this later.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments put forward by the hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River address a number of concerns.  Group No. 1 
amendments speak to removing oversight power from the special 
crops advisory committee to an appointed special crops board of 
no more than nine members.  The members would be appointed by the 
minister from a list of recognized commodity organizations in 
western Canada.  This change from the special crops advisory 
committee to a special crops board was suggested by Saskatchewan 
pulse growers and supported in committee by Manitoba pulse 
growers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brief of the Saskatchewan pulse growers which they submitted 
to the standing committee addresses this issue by suggesting that 
section 49.02 be amended, stating that there be an increase of 
the powers of the advisory committee to that of a board of 
directors because the bill relies on regulations for many of the 
specifics with respect to the insurance program.  It is desirable 
for special crops producers to have direct responsibility for the 
development of regulations as well as the selection of the 
insurer and agent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments speak to the need for producers to have a say 
in how the speciality crops program will be carried.  This allows 
the stakeholders to shape the regulations of the legislation and 
it is positive for producers to have input into the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party will be supporting these amendments because they 
add to the democratic process of allowing the producers to engage 
in the legislative process by giving them responsibility for the 
development of the regulations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the group of motions put 
forward by the member for Prince George—Peace River.  They make 
a valuable contribution to the bill and I urge all parties to 
support the motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party believes that Bill C-26 is basically a 
good piece of legislation.  It follows years of consultation but 
some improvements are needed.  The motions moved by the member 
for Prince George—Peace River contain some of them as do the 
motions moved by the member for Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special crops are of growing importance in western Canada. 
According to many, Canada is the world's leading exporter of 
lentils and peas.  They are important economic products for 
western Canada and for Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would support any measures that would improve the ability of 
farmers to prosper from growing and marketing these special 
crops.  We also support measures that would put the entire 
special crops industry on a firmer financial footing.  That is 
primarily why we are in favour of Bill C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we come to the motions moved by the member for Prince 
George—Peace River we see the member recommends that the 
minister appoint a special crops board rather than a mere 
advisory committee.  The member is also recommending that the 
directors of the board be chosen by the minister but from a list 
of officially registered special crops commodity groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several reasons why both these recommendations make 
good sense.  Farmers will be paying for this insurance program 
without any contribution from government.  Therefore it makes 
sense that they should call the shots.  For example, they should 
decide who should act as the agent for the insurance program, for 
their insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food heard from 
many organizations representing special crops growers.  In 
particular the Saskatchewan and Manitoba pulse growers 
associations both recommended a full-fledged board of directors 
rather than an advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe this would improve the legislation and would improve 
its acceptance by farmers.  These producer recommendations are 
embedded in the motions put forward by the member for Prince 
George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the proposals recommend themselves.  I urge 
government members and all other members of the House to support 
the motions.  I congratulate the member for bringing them 
forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to be able to respond to some of the comments 
made by the previous speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to start on a positive basis. 
I have taken note of the fact that the spokesman for the official 
opposition supports changes to the monetary penalties act.  We 
appreciate that.  We think those changes are taking us in the 
right direction.  The official opposition supports the change 
that the Manitoba Securities Commission takes over responsibility 
for the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange.  We appreciate that support 
as well.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect to this group of motions to which we 
will give our support.  There is an amendment from the official 
opposition that will make one change and we will support it. 
Right now the way the bill is written up, it is written to say 
that the minister may appoint a special crops advisory committee. 
The amendment would change the language of the bill to say that 
the minister shall appoint a special crops advisory committee; in 
other words moving it from the permissive to the mandatory. 
Certainly we will support that motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so far as the other proposed amendments are concerned, we on 
the government side will be opposing them.  I will take the next 
three or four minutes to explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speaker for the official opposition talked about the 
mandatory check-off, what we call the mandatory non-refundable 
approach to financing the insurance scheme.  The subject will 
come up for further debate in detail when we get to the second 
group of motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we oppose the voluntary opt in approach is that it 
would create administrative difficulties.  It would create some 
uncertainty.  We support the so-called mandatory refundable 
approach.  We want a plan that is viable.  We want a plan that is 
administratively efficient, and we think this is the best way to 
go.  It is already done by the pulse organizations in the 
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.  They say it works for 
their organizations and we believe strongly that it will work for 
this insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that we consulted widely over a long period of 
time leading up to the bill and we think this is exactly what 
producers want.  This is what dealers want. This is what the 
special crops industry wants.  This is why we are doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was reference made that somehow a fund would be created by 
the bill.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is an 
insurance plan; nothing more and nothing less.  If they are 
talking about a fund that is factually incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to seeking out candidates for appointments to the 
special crops advisory committee the minister will consult 
widely. There will be plenty of opportunity for commodity groups 
to make their recommendations so the minister fully understands 
the wishes of producers and dealers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get to the heart of these motions which proposes 
that we have an elected board of directors as opposed to an 
appointed special crops advisory committee.  We have consulted 
widely and have found the industry does not support this 
approach. 
Our consultations indicate that they want an appointed board by 
the minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spokesperson for the official opposition tried to draw an 
analogy with Bill C-4, the wheat board bill.  This is not 
analogous.  When we talk about the special crops industry, if we 
were to move to an elected board of directors, the cost of 
elections would be prohibitive.  A number of spokespersons for 
the industry have told us that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally the costs of an election would have to be borne by the 
producers.  They already have enough costs weighing them down. 
This would be an unnecessary cost.  That is why we would oppose 
having an elaborate election which would require an elaborate 
system and an elaborate mechanism to choose nine directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you know as well as I and all Canadians do that 
if we get into the business of having to elect the directors as 
opposed to appointing them, we will get into the question of who 
is going to be eligible.  Where would the boundary lines be drawn 
if the area was going to be divided up one constituency or 
district per director?  To some extent it would be very 
difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also point out that right now there is no registry of 
official commodity groups.  The previous speaker was suggesting 
that we could go to the commodity groups for their suggestions. 
There is no registry at the moment.  That simply would not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to an appointed special crops advisory committee, 
we have to exercise some trust.  We have to exercise some faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not interesting.  I hear a member from the Reform Party 
making a negative remark about government.  I am quite sure that 
is why they came to Ottawa in the first place.  They would like 
to form a government.  Typical of the Reform Party to talk down 
to our public institutions and to be negative about parliament. 
It is typical of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advisory committee will work very well.  It will have a 
majority of producers.   It will speak for producers and it will 
speak for the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I would like to point out, and this was discussed 
in consultations many times over, is that if we move from an 
advisory group which makes recommendations to an elected board of 
directors, then we raise the possibility of financial 
responsibility.  In other words the board of directors would be 
making decisions. Along with that comes financial 
responsibilities as opposed to an appointed advisory committee 
making recommendations to the minister who would make the 
decisions.  The people we consulted said that an elected board of 
directors may create a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, we have consulted widely.  This is what the industry 
wants.  We think it will work very well with an appointed 
advisory committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to listen to the hon. 
parliamentary secretary from Manitoba. 
He has his roots in the soil but they are growing in the wrong 
direction; instead of up they are going down and when they are 
down they go up. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding how the listening apparatus of a human ear is 
so different.  When the witnesses were before us we never heard 
anything about an advisory board.  The special crops people said 
they wanted a board that was appointed by the industry. They said 
they only needed a small board and they knew industry people who 
could run the board.  An advisory board means that they are going 
to give advice to somebody.  Who is it in this bill that is going 
to give advice? It is the minister again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we saw how this Liberal government loves to create a 
two tier system among the hepatitis C victims and among the 
farmers.  The hon. parliamentary secretary should realize that 
the Ontario wheat board has had a fully elected board for years. 
It did not need an advisory board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advisory board in western Canada gave us information that we 
did not need and it did not give us information that we should 
have had.  None of those advisory board members ever told us that 
the wheat board was the biggest player on the Minneapolis grain 
exchange.  They sat on the wheat board advisory board for years 
and we did not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  You elected them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  We elected them but who shut their 
mouths?  The agriculture minister says they were elected but how 
were they elected?  They still have to listen to the minister and 
the wheat board.  It is really astounding.  The special crops 
industry would not have developed to the stage that it is at had 
it not been for the Canadian Wheat Board putting pressure on 
farmers to know nothing, to do nothing and to be happy with 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario farmers made the decision that they wanted a fully 
elected board and now they even have a clause to opt out.  What a 
difference in farmers from Ontario and from western Canada.  If 
we could just reverse the universe and put western Canada into 
the middle of the country maybe we would get some privileges and 
be treated equally. The Liberal government has never known what 
equality means when it comes to western farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special crops industry is a tremendous boon to the western 
agricultural industry.  If it were not for the special crops 
industry, farmers would be starving today.  The problem today is 
we will probably need a special crops industry for wheat and 
barley soon because nobody wants to grow it.  It will become a 
special crops industry.  It has become so non-profitable that 
farmers have refused to grow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard time and time again that the farmers want to run 
it themselves.  They want a voluntary insurance and licensing 
agency.  What do they mean by voluntary?  They have said they 
want to choose whether or not to participate at the beginning of 
the crop year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can guarantee to this House that had this been really 
voluntary, probably 90% to 95% of the farmers would have 
participated in this board or the special crops industry 
mechanism.  However, they have not been given that opportunity or 
will not be given that opportunity.  Farmers will again be second 
class to eastern farmers.  They will not have the opportunity to 
run their business as they see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a year or two ago when the special crops people began 
phoning me about being licensed as a grain dealer.  What did this 
government do?  It sent the RCMP after these poor farmers because 
they were being successful.  That is illegal in this country 
according to this democratic Liberal government.  If they are 
successful, the government either taxes them to death or 
regulates them to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an instance where the special crops industry has built 
western Canada to a point where it can practically survive on it 
alone without growing wheat board grains. Now the government 
wants to over-regulate it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not know what voluntary means because it has 
not looked it up in the dictionary.  Voluntary means they take 
your money and hang on to it as long as they possibly can and 
then maybe they will give some back after all the costs are taken 
off. That is what farmers object to.  When farmers say voluntary 
they mean voluntary.  When farmers say they will run it 
themselves they will run it themselves and they will not hound 
government to interfere with them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It astounds me that in a democratic country where farmers have 
more or less designed and implemented an industry that has been 
very functional and a tremendous boon to western agriculture and 
industry, they are all of a sudden hounded by the RCMP. “Hey, 
you haven't got a licence.  You are not a grain elevator”.  Good 
gosh, a grain elevator handles just grain, it does not process 
the stuff; it buys it, sells it and delivers it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A special crops industry is one where for example the sunflower 
seed is grown, it is dehulled, it is roasted and it is sold.  One 
makes it go and it is run effectively in the way which gives the 
best returns to the producer, not to the industry itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded when I read the Senate hearings a week ago.  My 
good friend Earl Geddes, whom I know very well said that the 
milling industry had to be licensed because one farmer could be 
milling wheat for the other farmer, the neighbour, and this would 
not protect the domestic industry. What have farmers done all 
their lives?  They have worked as a unit.  They have helped each 
other out when they have had problems.  Then when they grow a 
product they cannot even do with it what they want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special crops industry thought it had freedom, it had the 
rights to do it because it involved nothing with the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  Now we find out we want an advisory board, an 
advisory board like we have seen for the last 15 years that was 
non-functional and that did nothing for farmers but cost money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of utmost importance that this bill be amended and that 
the Reform amendments be passed by the House or we will have more 
division in agriculture.  If that is what the government wants, 
then it should pass the bill the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to finally do something for agriculture 
producers in western Canada, it should listen.  Give farmers the 
right to run the business the way they feel is best so that they 
can function positively and be encouraged by the fact that 
finally government is listening, not that government is 
regulating and over-regulating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two minutes left which will not really get me into 
another subject.  I will just say that if the government really 
wants to put its mark on western Canada it will listen to the 
amendments Reform has proposed and it will have a happy special 
crops industry performing what is best for this country.  It will 
put this country on the map when it comes to things like pinto 
beans, navy beans, whatever has not been grown that farmers are 
now starting to grow because they will take the risks.  Farmers 
will try these new products.  They will grow them, they will 
process them, they will market them and nobody else will gain but 
the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge government members to finally sit up and listen to 
western Canada.  Let farmers do what they feel is right for their 
industry, not what some politicians in Ottawa think is right 
because they have a little too much of the Ottawa dust in their 
ears that they cannot hear properly.  We need some good heavy 
downpours, some good showers and some soap and I am sure hon. 
members would listen better and let farmers work the way they do 
it best, co-operatively and for the benefit of society as a 
whole, not just for people individually. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, perhaps we should have a bit of a history lesson here 
and ask a simple question.  Why are there so many special crops 
now being grown on the prairies?  us.  If members opposite do not 
know, we will give them a quick lesson.  They are being grown 
because farmers want to get rid of all the regulations and 
restrictions that have plagued them for at least three 
generations.  That is why they want special crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture 
had a lot to say about elections.  We are not talking about 
elections.  The motions which my hon. friend put forth are not 
about elections.  What we are talking about and what we oppose is 
the federal government handpicking people and putting them on an 
advisory board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually every time I make a trip to my constituency in the 
west I learn of some person who has been appointed to some board 
in Ottawa.  Some of them have the audacity to tell me how much 
money they make for being appointed as advisory people to a 
board.  That is what we are opposing.  That is what the west 
opposes. That is what the industry opposes.  That is what the 
canola seed people oppose.  That is what the pulse people oppose. 
That is what the sunflower people oppose.  They do not want to 
be regulated by this government. For some reason this government 
does not seem to understand that.  It just does not get the 
message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message is clear and simple.  The Canadian Canola Growers 
Association will submit two lists to the minister of agriculture. 
It will do the election for each special crop group.  The 
sunflower growers will do the same thing.  The people who produce 
the peas will do the same.  The minister will then appoint to 
this special board according to a simple recommendation from the 
producer, not by election or anything costly as the parliamentary 
secretary said.  Here is the list of names, take your choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we have a problem here.  It is not a problem for the 
producers.  It is not a problem for the people who grow the flax. 
It is not a problem for the people into the beans.  It is not a 
problem for them at all.  The problem lies on the opposite side. 
It is what if they are not Liberals.  That is the problem.  These 
special people are saying they have had 50 years of government 
hacks telling them how to run their business.  They want to give 
the government a group of names to pick from. That is what this 
and all these motions are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say the following to the people from the west who have gone 
into special crops.  You turn around and deny these people the 
right to submit their names to the minister and let him choose 
from the names they have selected and you will be in violation of 
a basic principle.  That principle is that party hacks have more 
importance than those who come from the industry. That is the 
bottom line.  It is as clear as that.  Even a kid in grade four 
could understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the parliamentary secretary does not understand.  He wants 
to talk about elections.  We are not talking about expensive 
elections.  We are asking the minister of agriculture to select 
the names that come from the various interest groups in order to 
form the special board.  Nothing could be more down to earth, 
nothing could be more grassroots and nothing could be more 
democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hear members across saying maybe that is the way we should 
go.  Let us get out of this habit of appointing a $100,000 a year 
political hack, giving him this and giving him that. The canola 
growers will select their person for the board.  I challenge 
anyone opposite to say that our clauses are not in keeping with 
the democratic principle or with what is best in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the Nipawin area of Saskatchewan said they could not 
make any money from growing wheat.  Now there is no more wheat in 
most of the crops there.  Even in my constituency people have 
been telling me time and again they are going strictly to oats, 
that they cannot afford to grow wheat under the board and that 
they have a legal market in Montana.

move more than 10 miles from my home to see people experimenting 
with all kinds of new crops saying they wish anything they grow 
would be out of the control of the government.  That is exactly 
what they are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are providing an opportunity to pick advisory boards 
without going the political route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members have the courage to do this?  Do they have the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
not sure I can follow that rousing debate.  I might be a little 
shorter on history than some of the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to address the amendments to Bill C-26 today. Bill C-26 
is an act to establish a licensing system and an insurance plan 
for the special crops industry in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides for the licensing of all buyers of special crops and 
for the voluntary participation of producers in the insurance 
plan.  Voluntary participation protects them against default 
payment for special crops by licencees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the problem.  Our western producers are sometimes a 
little hesitant to trust this government to protect them.  That 
is why we brought forward these amendments to the act.  I 
understand from the secretary that some are going to be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing that is important is that we want people involved 
in the industry of raising specialty crops to be involved in the 
decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have the minister create a nine member board but 
create that board from a list of people put up by the specialty 
crops groups themselves.  That makes perfect sense. That is what 
western Canadian farmers would understand.  They could trust a 
system like that. It would be people they know, people who 
understand the industry be in there making decisions in the best 
interest of the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is all western producers are asking. They want to 
make a living off the land and they want to be the architects of 
their own destiny.  They want things like this and they need 
them.  If we give this to them, they will be pleased and they 
will work hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Lethbridge in southern Alberta has a wide range of 
agricultural components.  It starts in the Rocky Mountains and 
goes out on to the plains.  It has some of the area of the 
highest heat units for any area in Canada.  Specialty crops are 
an order of the day. Most specialty crops are grown in the area I 
come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason people have gone to these crops is that they manage 
the crops themselves.  Even the sunflower producers on Bow Island 
grow them.  They have become quite a great marketing enterprise 
with Spitz sunflowers.  This started out as a small business and 
now it is huge. Sunflower seeds are part of this list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we give farmers the opportunity to be creative and to decide 
their own destiny, they can and will be successful.  We have to 
stop government interference.  Therefore our amendment asks to 
have the board appointed by the minister but selected from a 
group of people selected by the producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes a lot of sense.  I am sure the government, when it 
reconsiders this, will support it.  This is what we are asking 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations from witnesses at the committee, from the 
producer groups, are things the government should be very 
carefully considering and putting into this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lentils, peas and mustard are special crops that need special 
conditions.  They need special treatment.  They need people who 
know all the special conditions making decisions on how this 
insurance plan is going to work. 
The weather is critical.  Some are more fragile than others.  It 
is important that people on the board know all the conditions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak at report stage to Bill C-26 and in 
particular to the set of motions before the House.  I want to 
support the motions put forward by my colleagues, specifically my 
colleague for Prince George—Peace River who has introduced some 
good amendments to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak a little more specifically about why the 
whole area of specialty crops has become such an important part 
of farming in western Canada.  My family and I operate a 2,000 
acre grain farm in Alberta and we are now growing more and more 
non-traditional crops, meaning not wheat, barley or canola. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this is the difficulties we have encountered over 
the years with the Canadian Wheat Board.  I do not think our 
operation is very much different than a lot of farms in western 
Canada which have experienced difficulty with market signals 
being sent by the monopoly situation with the Canadian Wheat 
Board and not knowing what kind of return we are going to 
receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers now have a tremendous amount of money being expended 
every year.  At this time of year fertilizer and chemical bills 
start to roll in and in many cases they are in excess of 
$100,000.  This results in farmers needing the ability to price 
ahead to be aware of what crops are going to be sold and they are 
starting to look to other crops.  Farmers are looking to peas, to 
fescue and to lentils, to crops outside the jurisdiction of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the rotation system that is required to ensure 
disease does not build up, we still need to maintain some 
traditional crops.  On our farm this year there are 1,000 acres 
of wheat which went in the ground within the last two weeks. 
Some of this wheat is soft spring wheat that we sell outside of 
the board but some like the hard red springs will have to be sold 
through the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party wants to see as a board that advises the federal 
government and takes authority on advising the specialty crops 
commission.  Advisory boards sometimes have the potential for 
having people who know absolutely nothing about the industry 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all too many opportunities I am afraid to have former 
politicians, because they did not win in the election last time 
around, to get appointed to these boards and they may not do 
justice to the real issues. Farmers should be on these boards as 
they know what is best for their industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support Motions Nos. 1 and 8 in Group No. 1 which state this 
should be a speciality crops board rather than an advisory group 
appointed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go back to the Canadian What Board to see how the 
difference works. I am aware that we have had an advisory board 
in the Canadian Wheat Board, appointed by the federal government, 
for some time with basically not much authority.  It has been a 
closed shop.  I do not know that it has done a very good job.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in my part of the country are calling for the Canadian 
Wheat Board not to have a group of commissioners appointed by the 
federal government with an advisory board attached.  They are 
calling for the Canadian Wheat Board to be operated by a group of 
directors of farmers who control the functions of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not very much different from what we are talking about 
today.  Farmers pay the real cost of administering the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  They will pay all the costs involved in this board. 
Why should they not have a direct incentive and direct say in how 
it works? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out another reason I think that is important.  I 
have friends and neighbours that have gone into the speciality 
crop industry in terms of organically grown grains.  They have 
gone to a very big effort because it is a specialty market.  They 
have to ensure that their farm is free of chemicals and 
commercial fertilizers for five years before they can grow 
organically grown crops.  Yet they still have to go through the 
Canadian Wheat Board to get an export permit to market those 
crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers of agriculture over the years have said that we should 
diversify, that we should try to get out of some of the main 
crops and into specialty markets.  My friend, Dexter Smith of 
Peace River, has done just that.  He has spent a tremendous 
amount of work to rig up his farm for organically grown wheat. He 
has to find his own markets.  The Canadian Wheat Board does not 
do his marketing for him.  Farmers have tried to develop a set of 
standards for their industry with no help from government, I 
might add.  The government is standing in their way in many 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dexter Smith has to go to the Canadian Wheat Board to buy his 
product back before he can sell it.  The Canadian Wheat Board 
does not offer any elevators to take the specialty crop.  There 
are no elevators in the entire Peace River country to take Dexter 
Smith's crop.  There are no elevators in Alberta to take it.  It 
would just get dumped in with the regular wheat and therefore 
lose the effect of having been organically grown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has to find his own markets.  He has to arrange for the 
transportation.  Yet what do we have?  The Canadian Wheat Board 
standing in his way, inhibiting his ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have an advisory board on the specialty crops that we are 
talking about today, it will be appointed by the federal 
government, probably with some ex-politicians, people not having 
expertise in the area.  That will get in the way of the people in 
the industry.  We really want people with knowledge of these 
specialty crops and how best to serve their own industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be better than to have a specialty crops board with 
members elected by fellow producers out of their industry, 
knowing that they would have the expertise on how to govern their 
own industry?  It seems to me that is a reasonable request which 
has to be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, things have changed significantly in the farm 
industry over the years.  When I started farming 30 years ago 
wheat, barley and canola were the main crops in our part of the 
world.  That is not the case any more.  We have lost our 
transportation subsidies through the Crow rate.  We have lost 
subsidies in terms of GRIP and other government programs.  In 
fact our Canadian grain farming industry has moved faster than 
that of any other country to get rid of subsidies worldwide.  We 
are far ahead of our GATT commitments in terms of phasing down 
our subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, what is our trade department doing for us to try to ensure 
we have opportunities to export to countries in Europe that are 
still maintaining heavy domestic and export subsidies?  I would 
maintain not that much.  It had better start to do something soon 
or our guys are going to get tired and say, “We are complying 
with what you have asked of us to get to a market driven 
industry, but we have competitors worldwide that are still being 
subsidized very heavily.  You had better do something about it or 
we are going to be back asking for subsidies again”.  That is 
the exact approach we do not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade department and the Liberal government had better start 
getting aggressive, or else they will lose market opportunities 
and some excellent farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to add my weight to those in the 
Reform Party who in speaking today said that we need some common 
sense in the approaches to this industry.  If we are to have 
speciality crop marketing boards, let us make them producer 
marketing boards that are elected from their own members instead 
of having a group of advisory board members that may not have any 
expertise in the area.  It seems to me the bill would then enjoy 
the support of the entire farming community in those sectors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to follow some of my more knowledgeable friends in 
the Reform Party on this debate.  We are addressing Group No. 1 
motions on Bill C-26, an act to amend the Canada Grain Act. In 
particular we are discussing a couple of issues, but the big 
issue is the push to ensure there is some producer representation 
on the special crops advisory board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extraordinarily disappointed with the presentation we heard 
from the parliamentary secretary a few minutes ago.  He suggested 
a very transparent tactic in my judgment.  He suggested that 
elaborate elections will be necessary to bring about the motion 
my friend from Prince George—Peace River has proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is proposing only that the specialty crop producer groups be 
the ones who submit to the minister a list of names of people who 
would be excellent representatives on this special crops advisory 
board.  The parliamentary secretary had the audacity to try to 
frighten people by suggesting there was to be some big elaborate 
election.  It is not true, and the parliamentary secretary knows 
it.  I am very disappointed he would go to those lengths to try 
to frighten people.  It certainly does not do him or his 
government any credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are disappointed that the government once again has 
ignored the advice of witnesses who appeared before the 
agriculture committee and said they had no particular problem 
with the advisory board as long as they had some representation 
on it.  They said they wanted their people to come forward.  They 
are, after all, the people who are supporting it.  It is their 
money that goes into supporting it through a check-off program. 
It is not the government's money.  It is farmers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that matter to the government?  No.  It knows everything. 
It does not need the advice of producers.  Heavens no, that would 
be terrible.  We know how the government feels about advice.  We 
saw that in the hepatitis C debate not long ago when backbenchers 
had lots of advice for cabinet that was ignored.  That is exactly 
what will happen when patronage appointments come forward to 
offer advice to the government on special crops.  The government 
has complete latitude under the legislation to appoint patronage 
appointees to the speciality crops advisory board.  That is 
wrong.  When will the government get that through its head? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The freshwater fish association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my friend mentions the 
freshwater fish association.  We know what happened with the 
Freshwater Fish Marketing Board.  A former Liberal member who had 
absolutely nothing to do with fishing in his past life, except he 
had gone fishing once or twice, was appointed head of the 
marketing board.  He had absolutely no clue what it was about, 
but he picked up a $100,000 a year job because he was a former 
Liberal MP.  Now he runs it, I am sure to the chagrin of 
producers in that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is to take that same sullied formula and apply it 
to the special crops advisory board.  It is absolutely ridiculous 
and completely contrary to all the advice it received from the 
agriculture committee.  The government in its defence sets up an 
elaborate make believe scheme in which it suggests that Reformers 
are proposing to elect people.  It is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are saying is that these specialty crops groups can at 
their annual general meeting get together and maybe have a little 
election among themselves.  They can say that they think Bill, 
for example, has done a good job in the past and put forward his 
name, as well as Larry and Myra. They will be the names they 
submit.  Maybe the minister will choose one of them.  Maybe he 
can even check their Liberal credentials to find out if they are 
good Liberals, and if they are they can end up on the advisory 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is radical.  It makes a lot of sense to have 
representation of the people whose money is going into this thing 
on the board. 
That is exactly what the witnesses are asking.  I can say from 
personal experience that producers of speciality crops are very 
upset with the idea of more regulation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a Medicine Hat riding where there is a lot of 
irrigation.  As a result people grow a lot of high value 
specialty crops.  People in my riding grow beans, sunflowers and 
all kinds of crops including spearmint.  They have told me they 
do not want to deal with the board any more.  They are tired of 
dealing with the board.  When they have an option they get out of 
wheat because if they deal with wheat they have to go through the 
board.  They are going into specialty crops and are trying to 
make a living without interference from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever the government sees something going well, it seems it 
has to step into it or more than likely step on it and crush the 
life out of it.  That is exactly what the government has done 
many times in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking on behalf of my constituents when I say that the 
last thing we want is the federal government to bring on line 
some more patronage appointees to tell producers how things 
should be done from their perspective atop the hierarchy, when 
producers themselves are the ones gunning it out, supporting the 
board with their own money and trying to make a living.  They are 
the ones who know how.  They have a stake in it.  Why is the 
government so afraid to let producers have a say in the whole 
process?  It just does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my friends across the way to learn from the 
hepatitis C vote.  Those backbenchers know they had absolutely 
zero influence on the hepatitis C vote.  They were chided by 
their Prime Minister for having the effrontery to actually raise 
their voices and suggest that in the case of hepatitis C maybe 
the government should open its mind a bit and consider 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should understand that is exactly what the government will 
do with the people they appoint to the advisory board.  They will 
do exactly what they want.  Although the government loves to give 
the appearance that it is committed to democracy, at every 
instance and every opportunity it turns around and does exactly 
what it wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful.  It is wrong but it is certainly the pattern we 
have seen from the government.  I urge members across the way to 
support the motions that have been put forward by my friend from 
Prince George—Peace River, motions that will bring at least a 
hint of democracy to the legislation. I encourage members across 
the way to support the motions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Speaker, I would like to mention again, as I did during 
the second reading debate, a resolution that was passed at the 
Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association's annual meeting. 
Similar motions were passed at the Western Canadian Wheat Growers 
convention, the Western Barley Growers convention and the 
Saskatchewan Pulse Development Board.  In addition, the concern 
mentioned in this motion has been raised by other stakeholders in 
the farming industry out west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the majority of Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association 
members also are growers of specialty crops, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the proposed Special Crops Rural Initiative Program 
would appear to favour the Canadian Grain Commission and not 
necessarily special crop growers, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Special Crops Rural Initiative Program is promoted 
as being voluntary, it is in reality a form of negative billing 
which all consumers reject—, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the scheme has questionable support at the farm level, 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association rejects the 
compulsory nature of the Special Crops Rural Initiative Program, 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Special Crops Industry has flourished without such a 
program, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore be it resolved that the Saskatchewan Canola Growers 
Association inform the federal and western provincial ministers 
of Agriculture of their concerns and at the very least that the 
Special Crops Rural Initiative Program be truly voluntary for 
both the growers and the special crops dealers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution aptly describes what Bill C-26 fails to do.  It 
fails to give farmers choice, not unlike what the government did 
with Bill C-4, which failed to give farmers choice in how they 
sell their wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compulsory nature of the special crops insurance plan is a 
form of negative option billing.  Today's producers run large 
operations and should not have to apply to opt out and then to 
receive their money back if they do not wish to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farming businesses should have the right to decide for 
themselves if they want to be bonded or licensed and, if so, pay 
the bills themselves.  Producers should have the choice to decide 
for themselves if there is too much risk selling to an unlicensed 
buyer.  Special crops producers would be better off having choice 
between selling to large licensed grain dealers and small 
unlicensed grain dealers.  That would make sense.  I hope the 
government considers giving farmers that choice.

this bill, but we can make this a better piece of legislation if 
the government supports these amendments and the amendments put 
forward by the member for Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government wants to rush Bill C-26 because it 
believes it is simply a matter of housekeeping.  However, let us 
try to give farmers in western Canada a piece of legislation that 
gives them choice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to the amendments in 
Group No. 2, put forward by my hon. colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note at the outset that these amendments, Motions Nos. 2, 3, 4 
and 6, as put forward by my hon. colleague from the fifth party, 
clearly outline the need for voluntary participation in this levy 
that is going to be imposed on producers of special crops in 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the commodity groups appeared before the standing committee 
on agriculture almost unanimously their one greatest concern was 
the fact that, despite the premise that the levy or the check-off 
would be voluntary, the fact is that it is mandatory upfront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to explain this to everyone watching the debate 
today so they clearly understand what this means.  When the 
producer hauls a truckload of the designated special crops to the 
delivery point, the levy of 38 cents per $100 will be deducted 
regardless of whether he or she opts out of the check-off; in 
other words, does not want to participate in the insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from the Conservative Party just said, very 
clearly this is a form of negative option billing.  In this case 
the producer has no option but to have that levy deducted from 
his or her paycheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the start of the year he or she can apply to the agent, the 
Canadian Grain Commission, which is going to be administering 
this fund, stating that they do not want to participate and they 
want their levy money returned to them following the completion 
of the crop year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the bill is constituted, they then have to keep track of 
how much would be deducted off of each and every truckload and 
each and every designated commodity because they may grow more 
than one of the special crops.  They have to keep track of that 
and then at the end of the year or at a designated time set up by 
the agent apply for a refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some concern expressed at committee, both for the need 
to have this voluntary upfront and if it does have to be this 
negative option billing process that the producer should only 
have to let his or her views be known once.  In other words, if 
they wanted to opt out they should not have the administrative 
burden of keeping track throughout the year and tallying it all 
up at the end of the year, similar to how they now have to keep 
track of the GST and apply for a refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without fail, when the producer groups appeared before the 
committee they said this was their greatest concern.  Did the 
government listen?  Unfortunately, no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments that I had put forward on behalf of the official 
opposition at committee were voted down by the Liberals on the 
standing committee for agriculture. 
The amendments that I introduced at committee were virtually 
identical to the ones put forward by my hon. colleague now at 
report stage. 
Appearing before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food on April 21 were eight commodity groups:  the Alberta 
Pulse Growers Commission, the Manitoba Pulse Growers Association, 
the Saskatchewan Canola Growers, the Saskatchewan Farmer 
Consultations for SCRIP, the Saskatchewan Pulse Growers, the 
Western Barley Growers, the Western Canadian Marketers and 
Processors Association and the Western Canadian Wheat Growers 
Association.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If memory serves me correctly, with the possible exception of 
the Western Canadian Marketers and Processors, all of the 
witnesses appearing expressed the same concern about the way in 
which this levy would be collected.  In other words, there would 
be an additional administrative burden placed on farmers. They 
would not be able to opt out, in a one-time opting out, whereby 
they could say “I have looked at this.  I have studied it.  I 
understand that the government is moving to endeavour to have 
insurance for all of the special crops buyers and dealers to 
ensure that in the event one of them were to go bankrupt the 
producer, if he or she had speciality crops in storage with that 
particular dealer, would be covered”. 
Why is the industry interested in making some changes in this 
area?  As we have heard, there is a concern out there that there 
are a number of unlicensed small dealers, small buyers, and that 
farmers in some cases may be unaware they are not protected.  In 
other words, these dealers, these buyers of the speciality crops, 
are possibly unlicensed and therefore have not put up a bond to 
protect the producer, to protect the farmer, in the event of 
bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to implement this process.  It will mean 
more regulation.  All dealers and buyers will have to be 
licensed, for which of course there will be a licence fee, and 
all of them will have to be insured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from a number of producers about this.  The problem is 
that once again we see big government making decisions for the 
producers.  Instead of the old adage “buyer beware”, possibly 
we could have “seller beware” and allow the producer to make a 
conscious choice.  Perhaps he or she could derive a bit more 
money, a few more dollars per pound or per bushel or per tonne, 
whatever the case may be, for their product if they were to take 
the risk of selling that product to an unlicensed, uninsured, 
unprotected buyer or dealer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was a substantial amount money involved the producer 
might not want to take the risk.  For example, they may be 
shipping carloads of a commodity.  We could be talking about 
hundreds of thousands of dollars.  If they did not want to take 
that risk, they would then ensure that they sold their product or 
had it in storage with a dealer or buyer who was insured, who was 
bonded, so they would be protected in the unlikely event that the 
particular company were to go broke.  I say unlikely because the 
instances of these corporations, these dealers, going broke is 
very, very rare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there is a real lack of evidence as to whether 
this process, this check-off to ensure that all dealers and 
buyers are insured and licensed, is going to be a great boon for 
the special crops industry.  Certainly the government would like 
everyone to believe that this is going to promote the industry. 
However there is no real evidence that this will happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In some quarters there has been some evidence to suggest that it 
will provide a disincentive for good business practices by these 
dealers.  Presently if a sizeable bond has to be put up, there is 
an incentive built in to ensure they operate in as efficient and 
effective manner as possible and to ensure that they do 
everything to keep from going bankrupt.  If they go bankrupt, of 
course they will lose the sizeable bond they put up. Now they 
will be working with an insurance fund where the farmers are 
paying for the insurance.  They will not be putting up any bond 
whatsoever.  Therefore, it is no wonder dealers and agents are in 
favour of this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad to 
respond to some of the remarks made by members opposite. Let me 
mention a couple of things before I address the concerns which 
apply to the Group No. 2 motions before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party critic refers to this as a fund.  This is not a 
fund.  It is an insurance plan, no more and no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Medicine Hat expressed concern about having 
producer representation on the special crops advisory committee. 
Had the member for Medicine Hat bothered to read the bill, he 
would have found that not only does the bill provide for producer 
representation on the advisory committee but it also requires 
that a majority of the members of the advisory committee be 
producers. It is explicitly expressed in the bill that a majority 
of the members of the advisory committee will be producers.  That 
is about as straightforward as I can make it.  It is factual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party made several remarks about  electing 
or not electing the special crops advisory committee. Now those 
members are saying that they are not in favour of elections. All 
they want are commodity groups to come up with a list of possible 
appointees and for the minister to choose the members from the 
list. At least the Reform Party has made some progress.  I guess 
those members have realized in the last few days or weeks that 
elections would be a very expensive way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party is not talking about expensive elections, it 
is good because I do not think anyone would want that.  Their 
suggestion of having a list drawn up by commodity groups and the 
minister would then choose members from that appointed list is 
problematic too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We opposed the motion because there is no mechanism for 
officially registering commodity groups when it comes to special 
crops.  We would have to ask with respect to the the Reform 
Party's suggestion, how many commodity groups would have the 
privilege or right to come up with the list of names for the 
committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the insurance scheme, I think we have 11 recognized 
special crops.  Would it be just those 11? 
What if the situation was that one specialty crop was represented 
by more than one official commodity group?  What would be done 
then? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has made it very clear that not only will there be 
a majority of producers represented on the advisory committee, 
but the minister will consult very widely.  There is no barrier, 
none whatsoever, to any of the commodity groups, to any 
individual producer or anyone who is concerned to bring forward 
all the names they want.  Then the minister will have to do the 
best job he or she can to come up with the final list of 
appointees to the advisory committee.  I think the system will 
work quite well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get to Group No. 2.  Previous speakers talked about 
abandoning our proposal for a mandatory refundable system.  They 
would like an opt-in plan.  We want this insurance plan to work 
and to work well.  We want it to be viable.  We want it to be 
administratively efficient.  This is why after many years of 
consultation we have decided that the best way to do it is a 
mandatory refundable approach. That approach is already used when 
it comes to the funding of pulse organizations in Alberta and 
Manitoba.  It goes even further in Saskatchewan where there is a 
mandatory non-refundable approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to make it as simple as possible to have fees 
returned at the end of the crop year.  At first it was envisaged 
that producers would have to apply for a refund of fees if they 
had opted out but not any more.  Now the onus will be on the 
dealers, on the agents.  They will have to do the book work and 
return the fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party critic talked about whether it would be 
necessary for a producer to opt out only once or whether a 
producer would have to opt out every crop year. That kind of 
provision is not written into the bill.  It is a matter for 
regulation.  That will be decided when the regulations are drawn 
up.  I know the minister will hear representations.  If there is 
one overwhelmingly dominant view, I am sure that view will be 
accepted.  However that is a matter for regulation. We think the 
mandatory refundable approach is the best approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember another thing.  At this juncture, and I hope 
that it changes, a lot of specialty crop producers are not well 
aware of this plan.  I am absolutely sure that while they do not 
know about it, they would like to be part of it.  I would not 
want a voluntary opt-in situation as proposed by the Conservative 
Party and Reform Party in which some could find themselves 
without insurance because they did not know that the insurance 
plan was available.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This way there will have to be a conscious decision.  A farmer 
or producer will have to think this through, can he take the risk 
of selling his produce, his crop to an agent without insurance. 
Farmers are big boys.  They can make that decision.  But we want 
the system as simple as possible and we want it viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember that if this plan does not work, then they do not have 
any security because the bond system is going out.  We want to 
make absolutely sure that the farmers think about this and think 
about it well, and that they will make the right decision.  I 
think that they will. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the chance to rise and speak to Group No. 2 but also 
to rebut what the parliamentary secretary has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with something he said a minute ago.  He suggested 
that if the insurance plan was voluntary, some farmers might not 
actually become a part of it because they did not know about it. 
That suggests the parliamentary secretary takes a pretty dim view 
of the ability of farmers to run their own affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously farmers run extraordinarily complex operations when 
they run a farm.  They make hundreds of thousands, even millions 
of dollars of decisions every year.  Is the parliamentary 
secretary suggesting that perhaps they might forget to plant 
their crops in the spring?  Maybe we should have someone from the 
government come out and plant their crops for them.  Or maybe 
they would forget to take off their crops in the fall.  Maybe we 
should have somebody come out and take their crops off for them 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the parliamentary secretary is suggesting is ridiculous, 
that farmers would not know about it, that they are just too 
dumb. That is what he is suggesting. I disagree with that.  It is 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I heard the parliamentary secretary say that I had 
misspoken when I suggested that all of the members of the special 
crops advisory committee should be appointed and that the 
government was not proposing to appoint some producers.  Indeed 
that is correct.  I have with me Bill C-26 which would amend the 
Canada Grain Act.  The member is correct.  In fact the situation 
would be that if there are nine members on the board, a majority 
of them would be chosen by the government and the others would 
come from elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply point out that under the plan that is being proposed by 
the official opposition all of those nine positions would come 
from producer groups.  The parliamentary secretary is suggesting 
that the government would still retain the power to choose a 
bunch of unelected hacks, political patronage appointees, for 
some of these positions.  We say that is wrong.  We say all nine 
positions should be filled by the producers. I do not think that 
is radical.  I think it makes sense. That is what the witnesses 
told the committee and the member knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also knows that Canadians are democrats.  They want to have 
their representatives on these boards which are supposed to 
represent their interests. That is just common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member was quite correct in pointing out where I 
had misspoken, I think he was true to the letter of what I was 
saying if not the spirit. That is where he was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on the voluntary check-off idea for a moment. 
Reformers moved this in committee.  It is now being moved by 
Conservatives at report stage. We agree with it.  We agree with 
the idea of a voluntary check-off. The idea of having a mandatory 
check-off I know producers disagree with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard it from producers in my riding.  They told me as 
much.  They want the voluntary option.  They do not like the idea 
of the government holding on to their money until the end of the 
year and then getting it back in some way, shape or form. They 
like the voluntary option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my friends across the way, if they wonder how this will 
go over with people, of what happened when the cable industry 
proposed to do the same thing with cable television, this idea of 
negative option billing.  It went over like a lead balloon. There 
was a virtual revolt because consumers want to have the choice. 
Consumer sovereignty, what a novel idea.  It should be the same 
thing in Bill C-26 but the government always wants to have its 
own way.  It always takes the attitude that it knows better.  It 
does not know better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not give people the option?  Why not let it be voluntary? 
What is wrong with that?  Why not have the voluntary option?  We 
know that the groups that appeared before the committee almost to 
a person said they wanted the voluntary option.  What is so wrong 
with that?  Why not listen to what people are saying?  Why hold 
hearings if no one listens to what people are saying?  I think 
that is fair.  I think it makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government has missed the whole idea behind 
the point of having witnesses appear before a committee.  It is 
to get some guidance on how these things are supposed to work. 
Remember that the witnesses are the people who are affected. They 
have a stake in it.  They have their whole livelihood in this so 
why would they not be the ones who are best suited to make those 
choices, to make those judgments?  Why is the government not 
listening to the real experts?  That is what it should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We disagree with the whole idea of the government's having the 
sole ability to pick whomever it wants to sit on this board, some 
of them of course would be producers but again it could go ahead 
and pick only producers with the right political credentials and 
some of them would be people who would probably be political 
appointments, probably defeated Liberal MPs from the prairies, of 
which there are many after the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a lot to choose from, a big slate this time, even 
though some have already been scooped up into other patronage 
positions so perhaps they would have to serve in two patronage 
positions at once, I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we disagree with the idea of the mandatory check-off. 
Not only do producers not want it, it is contrary to the whole 
idea of consumer sovereignty.  I remind the government that if it 
is going to have witnesses, and a bunch of them tell it what to 
do, listen to them.  Hello in there, listen to them.  That is 
what people want.  They want to have their testimony listened to 
and abided by, especially when they speak more or less with one 
voice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I too am in support of the motions put forward by 
the member for Brandon—Souris.  I think this has been one of the 
most controversial parts of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The insurance program for special crops producers in Bill C-26 
will be financed by producers from a levy or check-off on all 
crops delivered to the buyers and dealers.  The government says 
this insurance program is voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard and as is clear, that is not quite true. 
Farmers have to pay a levy up front and at the end of the year 
according to the government's plan, they can apply to get their 
money back.  This is rather like the negative option billing 
process put forward by the cable television suppliers.  We know 
that generated a consumer revolt.  People simply do not want 
these kinds of procedures in order to ensure they have insurance 
coverage should they want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard at the agriculture committee when Bill C-26 was 
discussed was many producer groups asking that the insurance plan 
be made voluntary.  They said that farmers would not appreciate 
another check-off, that they would not appreciate the paperwork 
necessary to get their money back at the end of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion was put at committee that the plan be made voluntary 
but government members voted it down. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a difficult position to be in.  The main trust of the 
bill is something we support but this managing nature is 
something we do not support.  As a result, New Democrat members 
will support the motions put forward by the member for 
Brandon—Souris, the effect of which would provide producers with 
a choice in their payment of the insurance levy.  As I have said, 
this is what producers through their commodity organizations have 
requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members at the hearings of the agriculture committee 
had no solid explanation as to why this plan should be made 
mandatory and had no explanation as to why that was a better 
choice than making it voluntary.  We have yet to hear arguments 
as to why having the plan voluntary would not work effectively, 
especially since it is what producers want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions put forward by the member for Brandon—Souris are 
asking that the right thing be done by producers.  I hope 
government members will vote in support of those motions unless 
we hear good, solid explanations as to why the voluntary nature 
of the plan which growers want is something that will not work. 
To date we have heard nothing and I doubt we ever will. Therefore 
I urge members to vote in favour of these amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would first like to compliment the Conservative Party 
for picking up on this clause and giving us this second group of 
amendments to the bill to make it voluntary. It is very important 
and quite complementary to what farmers want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does voluntary really mean?  To me it means something I 
decide how to do and how I want to handle it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comment was made that it is only 38 cents per $100 that this 
is going to cost farmers.  Maybe that is not that huge a sum but 
when we look at the input costs of farmers to the 38 cents on 
every $100 they spend it is another 3.8% increase in expenses. 
They are the best to decide whether they have the funds available 
to service that extra debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at 38 cents per $100 I know that covers our hail 
insurance premiums which is something we need because we are in a 
hail area.  If we do not have that coverage we are probably out 
of luck and looking at bankruptcy around the corner if we cannot 
cover our costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot condemn this plan as a total package because I think it 
is going in the right direction.  However, the Liberal government 
would find that if it were voluntary to the terms that a farmer 
would define as voluntary, it would probably receive 90% to 95% 
acceptance if farmers could afford that money.  The majority of 
farmers want to take risks out of their operations.  With the 
huge input costs it is becoming harder and harder to make that 
bottom line meet what it is suppose to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary said, it is not a fund.  It is an 
insurance plan.  However, we still have to realize it is set up 
for the special crops industry and they will have to make it 
financially sound.  If it does not pay the expenses or the claims 
that will be processed against it they will have to increase that 
premium to make it viable or else there will be no insurance 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are things we have to consider.  If we make it mandatory 
and then all of a sudden the premium rates increase to $1 per 
$100 that probably would be something that farmers could not 
afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to believe that governments always intend the best but 
sometimes because they do not listen to producer groups or 
farmers maybe the intention is not fulfilled or it somehow gets 
distracted.  When the parliamentary secretary says that there 
will be at least five producers on that advisory board, that 
still leaves the option of four appointed political people or 
friends or whomever they would like to appoint. 
That means they would only have to persuade one out of five 
farmers to side with them and farmer clout would be gone as far 
as the board is concerned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear politicians saying they will make it as simple as 
possible,  this really bothers me.  What does that really mean? 
During debate not too long ago the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville talked about Bill C-68 and the regulations put 
forward.  The member indicated how they were becoming impossible 
to implement and costs would be prohibitive.  One of the Liberal 
members stated it is no more complex than the Income Tax Act.  If 
that is the simple method implemented to bring this bill forward 
I would be really scared on simplification. I think that spells 
disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason farmers are very hesitant to approve 
something they do not have control over.  We know that with the 
regulations we now have on farms regarding environmental issues, 
such as gasoline tanks being diked, it is becoming very hard for 
farmers to have the right to farm.  That is why I think they are 
very hesitant to accept this bill when the voluntary portion is 
not included in it. I must compliment the Conservative Party for 
bringing this forward. I think this will make the bill fly if the 
amendment is passed and it will be quite successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary indicated that the government would 
listen and act in good faith.  I want to believe that is going to 
happen but we have to look back approximately one year when the 
wheat board minister, who was the agriculture minister, set up 
the Western Grain Marketing Panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a year and a half we heard in this House that farmers were 
going to get marketing choices. The government said it would 
listen to farmers and spent a couple of million dollars 
travelling across western Canada. I think the committee did 
listen. There were some very good people whom the minister 
appointed to that panel.  They did a very good job.  What has 
happened to that report? Absolutely nothing.  None of the 
suggestions by the panel was accepted. Its advice was not heeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The then minister of agriculture went back to farmers and had 
them write letters.  Thousands of letters came in.  They said 
exactly the opposite of what the Western Grain Marketing Panel 
had said.  All the suggestions and recommendations were thrown 
aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are again debating Bill C-4 and not only has it created a lot 
of debate in the House but it also forced the Senate to have 
another round of hearings in western Canada and listen to 
farmers.  We have spent millions of dollars on the process of 
listening and wanting to act in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to show our producers, our constituents and taxpayers 
that we really want to act in good faith.  Let us accept what 
people tell government, implement their suggestions, implement 
the regulations they would like to see in these bills and then 
act on it.  Bills can be changed.  Nothing says this bill is for 
eternity. We may have a different government after the next 
election and it may say it does not think the regulations are 
right.  Let us get something the general public, the producer and 
the taxpayer, really thinks is in its interest and is cost 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that if farmers believe this insurance plan and 
this licensing plan is worth the money spent on it they will 
support it.  I have never seen a program yet in western Canada 
during the 35 years that I was a farmer that was not supported by 
the majority of farmers if it made sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Practically 75% to 85% of the farmers in my area supported the 
western grain stabilization act.  When they realized how it 
really worked when it triggered payouts close to 100% supported 
it.  Other farmers wanted to join.  They had that option. They 
were allowed to join.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I think would happen with Bill C-26.  If it was 
made voluntary, we would be amazed at the percentage of farmers 
who would support it and would give the government credit for 
making it voluntary and cost effective and for ensuring that 
there was protection not just for the producers but also for the 
processing industry.  When they work together, get good 
protection, get the markets, it can only help everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded when I spoke to two young farmers last week.  I 
asked if they were hear to listen to the Senate hearings on Bill 
C-4. One of the young gentlemen said that they were here to try 
to create a seed industry, the export of seeds, for pinto beans 
to Mexico.  I asked why they were interested in growing pinto 
beans as seed for Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that they had developed this industry and they were 
always running into problems with foreign markets.  The Mexicans 
are producing an inferior product.  The people who wanted to buy 
the product hedged on the price saying that the Mexicans could 
sell them the product for less money, but they never looked at 
the quality of that product.  They were trying to develop a seed 
market for the Mexican farmers so that it would improve their 
product and they would have a level playing field on the foreign 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way the special crops industry has worked over the 
years.  It is a tremendous asset to this country.  We should 
accommodate their wishes and pass these amendments.

hear quite a bit of this.  This is the government of all 
governments that loves to regulate, loves complications, loves 
paperwork, loves to control people. As somebody said earlier in 
this debate, it likes to keep its foot on people's necks to keep 
them down.  That is the traditional Liberal approach in both 
social and economic matters.  I guess it is something one has to 
get used to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very fortunate as a farmer in that I produce the one 
commodity which this government has not yet managed to get its 
grubby little hands on.  I still have the possibility of raising 
a product and selling it.  I do not have to get permits.  I do 
not have to tug at my rural forelock when I approach some 
bureaucrat.  I take my product, which happens to be beef cattle, 
to the market and I run them through the ring.  The auctioneer 
says sold, I get all my money and that is it, finished.  That is 
the last I see of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An hon. member says to just wait.  Actually we have had to fight 
this fight on several occasions.  There have been constant 
threatening moves on the part of various federal governments over 
the years to intervene in our market.  We have always been able 
to stave them off because we have an extremely strong producers 
organization which defends us from the machinations of the 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been able to keep ourselves independent.  We do have a 
small check-off but it is organized by us for us.   We deal with 
our own business and we do not have any government intervention. 
It is lovely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a situation in my riding which I think is relevant. 
There is a fellow who grows organic wheat as he calls it, no 
pesticides and no herbicides.  It is not a special crop in the 
sense of Bill C-26, but a special crop nonetheless. 
He has problems with his marketing.  The elevator system cannot 
handle the product because the moment it touches a commercial 
elevator it is no longer certifiable.  It will be contaminated 
with the product already in the system.  That cannot be avoided. 
He has to find his own markets.  He has to arrange the 
transportation.  He does it all himself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now Mr. Arnold Schmidt of Fox Valley in my riding has a 
trailer load of his product sitting at Emerson, Manitoba. This 
trailer load of product has been hijacked by the federal 
government.  He wants to get it across the border.  This is not a 
carload of grain in a hopper car.  It is a bagged product sitting 
at Emerson, Manitoba.  It costs the man $25 a day to have it 
sitting there effectively under seizure. He can bring it home if 
he wants to but this would not be a terribly productive 
operation.  If he does, it will cost him more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is supposed to buy that product back from the Canadian Wheat 
Board. In other words it can be sold to the Canadian Wheat Board 
and then bought back.  In the process about 90 cents a bushel is 
dribbled off to the government for a service that was not 
provided. He is not in any pooling system.  They cannot use his 
product but under those regulations he would have to pay into the 
pool.  He has to pay ransom to get his product out of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably this man is a little upset.  The problem is that 
this is his sole means of livelihood.  He grows literally 
thousands of acres of organically grown grains.  He is marketing 
it mostly in Canada but some of it goes outside Canada. There is 
an outfit in the states called Our Daily Bread which deals in 
nothing but organically grown grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden, without warning and for no apparent reason, the 
government has decided it will enforce this and nail the guy 
down. This is an example of how the benevolence of government, 
doing things that are supposed to help us farmers, can simply 
make life difficult for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who grow beans, peas and lentils to a large extent 
are doing it because these products are not under government 
control.  It is a free market out there for this stuff. People 
can do as they like just as I can do with my cattle.  They have 
their own producers organizations which apparently function very 
well.  However when the government sees something that is not 
regulated “My God, we have to do something.  These people are 
dangerous.  They are making a living and we are not involved”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This drives me around the bend.  How many years have we been 
growing specialty crops on the prairies?  Not very many.  Perhaps 
one of my colleagues could tell me.  Is it 12 years, 15 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Fifteen years tops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Fifteen years tops.  It has taken that 
long for the government to wake up to the fact that there is 
something out there it has not yet regulated “We have failed in 
our duties as a government.  Let us get out there and grab them 
by the neck”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the specific amendments being proposed.  They 
certainly will ease the pain.  Why anybody should be subjected to 
a form of negative billing by their very own government truly 
escapes me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the cable companies during the last parliament were 
negative billing on their cable services, there were members on 
the other side who went berserk. Now the government is proposing 
negative billing and apparently it is quite all right.  Mother 
government has determined that this is the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again my compliments to the member for Brandon—Souris.  I 
wholeheartedly support his amendments. 
I wish the amendments went further in the sense that I do not 
think that too many of these people growing specialty crops if it 
comes right down to it even want the bill, but if we are going to 
have it, surely it could be improved.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to join the debate today on the second group of 
amendments to Bill C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been quite a debate here about government's role in 
the specialty crops area.  I think the phrase that is hated most 
of all on the prairies is “I am from the federal government and 
I am here to help you”.  That is when farmers and producers head 
for cover in the back 40. They know they may have a 
well-intentioned government out there ready to provide a program 
but quite often it goes off the rails in the process. Some of my 
colleagues have already talked about that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here really is a matter of whether this is a voluntary 
check-off or one that is a negative option billing and has to be 
applied for. It seems that government has not learned a lesson 
from the cable television industry issue that raised so much 
furore a couple of years ago.  It is okay to back off there but 
when it comes to farmers, mother government knows best.  It 
sounds like something we used to hear out of Russia in the height 
of the central planning days.  It certainly did not work there 
and I do not see how it is going to work here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue itself of whether there should be insurance for these 
producers of specialty crops is not a bad one but it is one which 
should be decided by the producers themselves.  As one of my 
colleagues said earlier, if we take half a per cent here and one 
per cent there, pretty soon it adds up to something big.  Farmers 
are under a lot of stress already and have difficulty competing. 
They want to decide for themselves whether they want to take 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On my own home farm in Alberta we do not choose to take hail 
insurance.  It is an option we have.  It is a management tool. It 
is available. That is the way it should be with regard to the 
specialty crops issue.  It should be available.  If farmers want 
it, they will support it.  If enough of them support it, it is 
going to be a viable option.  If they do not, or if only 20% 
support it, maybe it is not going to be viable and maybe it is 
something that really is not needed. It seems to me that farmers 
should have that choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Choice is not something the government seems to offer when it 
comes to farmers.  On the Canadian Wheat Board debate, if there 
was a choice offered, producers would vote with their product. 
They would support whatever system worked best for them. Maybe 
two systems could work side by side, the Canadian Wheat Board 
working side by side with the free market option.  Maybe it could 
work that way and I think it probably would.  Surely the choice 
should be left up to the producers.  It is in every other aspect 
of Canadian life.  It seems to me that is what should be done 
here as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bothers me that the government has chosen to take a negative 
approach, that farmers have to pay it unless they want it back. 
The government seems to think that farmers will forget about it 
and it will sort of chew away and that money will be added to the 
pool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this was voluntary and farmers decided not to take it, what 
is the issue?  The farmers would no longer be eligible for that 
insurance.  Farmers would know that, in the same way they know 
that if they do not choose to take crop insurance they are not 
eligible to collect.  If they do not choose to take hail 
insurance, they are not eligible to collect hail insurance.  It 
would be the same here.  It is a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the government has a condescending view of 
farmers, that they are people who cannot run their own lives and 
do not know how to operate a business.  I have a big surprise for 
the Liberal government.  Farmers know full well what they are 
doing. They are running operations which in many cases are in the 
millions of dollars. They make choices every day.  They make 
choices on what kind of fertilizer to put on, what kind of seed, 
what is the best kind.  They access information through the 
Internet on the best varieties.  These people are intelligent. 
Surely they can decide whether they want an insurance program for 
specialty crops. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Peace River country a lot of people are growing peas, a 
speciality crop.  It is a management tool that surely should be 
available to them but let them make the decision.  Why should 
they have to wait a year to get their money back if they do not 
want to participate in the project?  They would not be covered 
for the insurance if they decided to get their money back at the 
end of the year.  The pool would have that money for a full year. 
It is a bureaucratic set-up.  It takes time to get it back and 
for the check-off to take place.  Surely the better system would 
be to have it voluntary so that they would say this is a 
management tool they want and need in their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is the issue of having some responsibility for 
farmers who do not want to take that insurance.  They have a 
choice in to whom they sell product.  They have a choice in the 
same way that if I produced a book I could sell the book.  If I 
produced a pen I could sell it to somebody.  If I thought the 
person was a poor credit risk, that he or she would go broke and 
not pay me, I would want to do some investigative research to 
know it was a stable company when I hauled my product there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we need government interfering in all that process? Could 
it not just be a process for those people who choose a voluntary 
process?  Could it not just be a process that says “I will sell 
my peas off my farm to that company, but before doing that I want 
to know that when I get a cheque it will not be NSF, that the 
company is good for it.  I have a choice of whether or not I take 
insurance.  If I decide I do not want that 2% cost to me I will 
do my own research and find out whether or not it is a viable 
company?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that 98% of the commerce that goes on in Canada out of 
a $750 billion gross domestic product takes place in that manner. 
Government does not interfere in all areas of business.  When we 
buy a car there is no insurance that says the company will to 
produce it.  It is a simple business transaction. It seems to me 
the same should apply here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my comments.  I know a lot of people in my riding of 
Peace River would choose not to participate if it were voluntary. 
There are those who would choose to participate.  I guess it 
would be a matter of whether there were enough people involved in 
the process to make it into an economic feasible insurance 
program.  If there are not enough people who want to participate 
maybe it should not be in place to begin with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise today to speak to the amendments to Bill C-26. 
I thank the member for Prince George—Peace River and the members 
of the agriculture committee from the Conservative Party for 
working on the amendments and coming up with a very good list of 
improvements to the bill.  It is a pleasure to rise to support 
the amendments that the Conservative Party has put forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that farmers and producers need government involvement 
in regulations to implement an insurance plan is wrong.  These 
producers are running huge operations and are very capable of 
making proper management decisions to maximize the return on 
their investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now across the prairies it is springtime and choices are 
being made as to what crop to seed, how to prepare the seed bed, 
when to do that, and everything that goes along with those 
decisions: fertilizer, spray or whatever.  They are made by the 
farmer because the farmer makes those decisions in his own best 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that government has come forward with this licensing 
program to have a negative option billing system is wrong.  We 
saw it last year or the year before when cable companies were 
trying to use that method.  It is just not right, the fact we 
have to tell somebody we do not want that and unless we say no we 
will get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is that?  That is not the way the country should be run. If 
farmers want to be involved in an insurance plan they will 
indicate that they want to be involved.  They will let the 
minister know up front and they are involved.  This way they have 
to let the minister know they do not want to be part of the plan. 
The levy is still taken from them and then they have to apply to 
get it back. 
That just creates another set of books to be kept by farmers.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are hearing is that producers want government out of 
their lives.  They want to be able to make their own decisions, 
run their own operations and do what they know is best for them. 
They do not need to keep another set of books.  They do not need 
to pay their accountants another $50 or $100 to figure this one 
out.  If they could let it be known up front that they do not 
want to be involved, it could be a voluntary process.  It would 
go a long way toward improving what the bill is trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are speaking in support of the amendments in Group No. 2 put 
forward by the Conservative Party.  They were also raised and 
discussed in committee.  They are good amendments. They are good 
quality suggestions on how to improve a bill and make it more 
friendly for western producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However they were defeated by Liberal committee members. They 
have come back in this form and there is a chance to debate them 
in the House.  They were debated at committee.  Witnesses came 
before committee to suggest some things and now we have the 
ability to discuss them here, to have another airing of them.  I 
hope government members will see the light and find their way 
clear to support some of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is this idea of government being involved in everything we 
do in our lives.  What is government's role in the lives of 
farmers and Canadians in general?  How much should it be 
involved?  We are being overregulated, overgoverned and 
overtaxed.  We need the government to establish an atmosphere in 
which we can thrive.  That is all we ask.  We ask to be left 
alone in whatever endeavours we choose.  That is certainly true 
for the agricultural community.  Some people in the agricultural 
community are far better qualified to have more input into how 
things can be developed in Canada than any government member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We debated the Canadian Wheat Board Act about a month ago. 
Government members all voted for that bill with its amendments. 
Yet only 14 of them had a direct relationship to the western 
grain producer.  That shows how these things can be taken away 
from the people who have most to do with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should create an atmosphere within the agricultural community 
for entrepreneurs to come forward, to develop their own skills, 
and to have voluntary means for becoming involved in different 
programs.  They are asking for the option to run their own lives. 
They want the government out of their lives.  They fill out 
enough forms.  The government knows enough about their operations 
already.  It does not need to be involved any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer my support to these amendments.  I hope the entire House 
will see the merit of them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to some of my colleagues speak to the amendments to the 
bill.  It brought me back a few years to shortly after we were 
first elected in 1993.  This issue arose then.  It was a fairly 
major issue in my part of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my old riding of Moose Jaw—Lake Centre a good number of 
people produced specialty crops.  There were also dealers that 
bought and sold the various crops.  I talked to many of those 
fellows at that point in time.  A great many were certainly 
supportive, if not anxious, to see some sort of insurance program 
whereby producers could be assured that their produce would be 
insured against any company that might happen to get into 
financial trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many dealers wanted to see this take place.  Unfortunately it 
did not happen as quickly as it might have or could have, but it 
was not for lack of trying on many people's part.  At that time 
some government members liked the idea of an insurance program. 
I see one of them in the House right now. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1325

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what I am here to argue or to debate today.  I truly 
believe that there should be and must be some way to protect 
dealers and producers from unfortunate events taking place within 
a company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What strikes me as odd is that if we speak with farmers in the 
coffee shops and grain elevators in central Saskatchewan where I 
come from, generally speaking the federal government will become 
the laughing stock of the conversation. This is not all the time 
but a lot of the time. The angle farmers take is that the federal 
government is in their faces again and whenever it gets involved 
things cannot be good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment allows producers to have voluntary participation 
in the program.  That is the key to having some success within 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at other aspects—and we do not have to be farmers to 
think some of these ideas—obviously we do not have carry fire 
insurance on our houses if we do not want to.  It is voluntary. 
We do not have to carry insurance on possessions if we choose not 
to.  Obviously most Canadians carry insurance because we could 
not afford to have any type of major loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is also the case in the farm business.  Many farmers carry 
crop insurance because they cannot afford a single loss.  They 
all carry insurance on their farm machinery because they cannot 
afford to lose a $200,000 combine, which would break many 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key is that the whole system is voluntary and that is what 
makes it effective.  As a farmer I have not carried crop 
insurance for about 10 or 12 years because I thought it was too 
expensive for what I might get back out of it if I lost a crop. I 
was prepared to look after myself in the event of crop failure. 
We have had a few in Saskatchewan.  We are not like Peace River 
in northern British Columbia where if they do not get 60 bushels 
an acre it is a failure.  I happen to live in Saskatchewan where 
we are quite happy if we get 60 bushels in two or three acres. 
That is the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Try P.E.I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan:</B>  We hear the member for Prince Edward 
Island.  Those people happen to be very wealthy.  I do not know 
why he is even in the House speaking about this issue because 
they do not need an insurance program in P.E.I.  The point is 
that it has to be voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will look at a side issue, GST, and how it is collected from 
farmers.  A huge bureaucracy has been created in Revenue Canada 
to handle the GST revenue.  It is ridiculous.  I have always said 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If farmers are buying a product, a piece of equipment or 
something that they need for the farm and it is zero rated, why 
do they pay the GST up front, go through the bureaucracy of 
applying to get it back, run it through a paper trail that is six 
miles long and finally get their cheques back for the GST in 
about four or five months? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  You just don't understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan:</B>  The member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands says that I do not understand.  I guess he is 
absolutely right.  I just do not understand why we do these 
things in our system today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a simple way to do it in Bill C-26.  We have the 
computer system and the technology.  We have other check-offs to 
which we have access if we want to take them.  However, when I 
sell my load of lentils and if I choose to buy the insurance 
should be up to me.  It must not be up to the bureaucracy or the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my learned colleagues in the Chamber just a few minutes 
ago mentioned the cattle industry.  I produce a few cows.  I have 
the opportunity to sell to whom I want.  I do not have to worry 
about check-offs.  I do not have to worry about the bureaucracy. 
If I lose money by selling to the wrong person and a cheque 
bounces, that is my responsibility.  I have nobody to blame but 
myself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For far too long, in both provincial and federal governments, we 
as a country, in all areas of our society, have come to say that 
government must be all things to all people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time is long past for that kind of thinking.  We must take 
some responsibility for our own actions.  If we buy something 
that does not work, if we sell something that does not work, yes 
it is unfortunate, but we have to be prepared to look after 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that comes to mind is the Canada pension plan.  We 
went through a huge debate on that during the last six months as 
to how it should work.  We are hearing more and more people say 
they are not going to rely on the CPP because it probably will 
not be there when they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the same kind of thinking that we are getting from 
farmers in the agriculture industry.  They are saying “Get out 
of my face.  Leave me alone.  I will look after myself.  If 
things go bad I have no one to blame.  Nobody else has to take 
that responsibility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of our party mentioned a while ago the pretty good 
success that farmers, at least in western Canada, have had with 
special crops.  My area is no different.  We have been able to 
grow lentils, peas and other things that we never grew before 
simply because the varieties are better and we have had good 
weather, resulting in some decent crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made some money over those few years.  We have made a few 
dollars on those special crops.  In fact they have kept a lot of 
the farmers in my area in business.  During the late 1980s and 
early 1990s prices were deflated and many farmers went bankrupt. 
They were forced to switch to those special crops.  The only 
thing I would say is that we probably waited a little too long 
because they have been very good for us.  What could put a damper 
on that sector of the industry is overregulation from any level 
of government and I think that is what we are seeing in Bill 
C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 which amended the Canadian Wheat Board was passed by 
this House not too long ago.  It is now in the Senate.  Again, 
that bill will overregulate.  It will put people in place to 
create a huge bureaucracy where none is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would tell the government to back off, to listen to what the 
regular farmers are saying and only give that type of assistance 
or help where people want it and where it is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the member for Brandon—Souris that I appreciate 
the fact that he brought this amendment back to the House at this 
stage.  Certainly I would support that kind of thinking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to join in this discussion again, simply 
because we have something here which I believe we do not want to 
make compulsory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw to the attention of my hon. friends opposite that 
in Saskatchewan and the three western provinces at this time 
those farmers who wish to contribute to research do so and it is 
deducted at the elevator.  Those who do not wish to do so have no 
deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that it is not compulsory.  There is not very much 
complaining; none in fact.  But the number of farmers who are 
contributing, according to the latest information I have, is very 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How high? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  I do not know, but the last I have is 
that it is high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I do know this.  We have a new venture.  We have a new 
series of crops.  We have a new industry in the west.  All of a 
sudden the thinking is that if we cannot get more compulsory 
aspects into it then of course that is a bad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member for Brandon—Souris is doing in bringing in 
these resolutions is simply saying  “Let the industry, the 
agency and the board prove themselves.  If they want to go in and 
take insurance, fine.  Let them take it.  If they do not feel it 
is worth it, then let them opt out”.  That is how simple it is. 
But to demand insurance when there is no proven product is not a 
very good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I carry house insurance with the same company for a number of 
years and I find out that when I put in a claim I get zippo out 
of it, what am I going to do? 
I am going to at least change companies.  Under this plan they 
will not have a choice; they are either in or out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These motions deal with the insurance plan.  If they can prove 
to the producers that it is good, then they will have them all 
in.  If they see that it is not good, they have the right to drop 
out with nothing to declare.  Nothing could be fairer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a new commodity group coming into being I do not 
understand why they want to add a compulsory element.  Why do we 
not let the producer decide?  It is his crop and his risk, so let 
him decide.  We should not force him into a program where he may 
wait two or three years after his premiums have been used up to 
see whether it is valuable or not.  If we go into this we should 
at least allow it to be voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things we need to have compulsory insurance on.  All across 
Canada we need to have compulsory insurance on our cars.  The 
reason for that is not so much that we may wreck our own 
property, but we may hurt someone else.  We can all understand 
that type of compulsory insurance.  It is not compulsory to put 
fire insurance on our houses and it should not be compulsory for 
the producers of the specialty crops to have to put insurance on 
those crops.  Many people feel they cannot afford to do this. 
Therefore, to make it compulsory is not adding anything 
whatsoever to this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask the western farmers if they should have this.  What did the 
witnesses say in committee?  Did they say they wanted compulsory 
insurance?  No, they did not say that.  If they did not say that, 
if the producers do not want it, I think we are going too far by 
making it mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, they can have insurance.  Let them enter the insurance 
plan, but if they do not want to stay in it then let them out. 
Let the thing work on its own merit.  We should not have 
something that is compulsory and keeps going because it is run by 
a few, whether it is making payments or whether the producer is 
left to evaluate it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 4 consideration of Bill C-3, an act

amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee; and of Motion No. 7.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-3 at report 
stage.  I will restrict my comments to Group No. 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the amendment as proposed by the member for 
Sydney—Victoria even though it causes me some concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the review of this legislation by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights we heard from many 
witnesses about their fears and worries over abuse, leaks and 
criminal misuse of the DNA databank.  To overcome these fears and 
to protect against the wrongful use of DNA information we need 
some form of consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Crowfoot proposed an amendment before the 
justice committee to limit the punishment in clause 11 to 
strictly indictable with a maximum term of two years.  Motion No. 
7 maintains the dual procedure aspect, but increases the maximum 
indictable procedure to five years.  If we are to protect the 
information in the databank we require sufficient consequence to 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that many of the naysayers to DNA legislation will be 
brought on side when parliament impresses upon them how seriously 
we intend to attempt to protect potentially sensitive DNA 
information. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to address the amendment in 
Group No. 3 to Bill C-3.  At the outset I would like to state 
that this particular amendment addresses two real concerns that I 
hear constantly from Canadians as I travel across Canada and 
throughout my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is the whole issue of the privacy of the individual; the 
privacy of individual Canadian citizens.  The second issue 
concerns sufficient deterrence to dissuade Canadians who might 
break the law in some fashion.  In this particular case we are 
talking about those who might reveal information contained in DNA 
sampling.  We want to make the threshold of the penalty 
sufficiently high enough to ensure that people will be dissuaded 
from releasing that type of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very clearly, as my hon. colleague for Surrey North just noted, 
during testimony when the justice committee was reviewing Bill 
C-3 there were a number of concerns brought forward by witnesses 
dealing with these two fundamental issues.  One concern is 
privacy.  How will the DNA samples be protected to ensure they 
will not be used in a manner in which they are not intended to be 
used?  We have seen cases in the past dealing with income tax and 
other issues whereby government agencies obtained certain 
information about Canadian citizens which was ultimately leaked 
into the public arena.  A growing concern for Canadian citizens 
is their fundamental right to privacy.  One of the major 
stumbling blocks in this DNA legislation is the need to convince 
Canadians that it will be used appropriately and properly and 
that the legislation is in place to protect the well-being of 
society, because there is an inherent distrust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that with the advent of things like Bill C-68, 
the gun registration, there is a growing inherent distrust of 
government on the part of the average Canadian citizen.  There 
are some good reasons for that.  Citizens have seen some of their 
fundamental rights continuously eroded, continuously chipped away 
by big government.  Big government knows best.  Big government is 
going to look after us from the cradle to the grave.  We had some 
speeches on this very point in the preceding debate on Bill C-26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ensure that the concerns about the right to privacy 
are adequately addressed.  How are we going to ensure that? 
Simply put, as my hon. colleague from Surrey North just said, 
deterrence has to be sufficient.  Any individual who would break 
the law and reveal that information has to be dissuaded from 
doing it. 
We want to have the penalties sufficient to deter them from doing 
it.  I often refer to the system not as a criminal justice system 
unfortunately but as a legal system.  Too often we see in our 
criminal justice system that it is not meeting the needs of the 
average Canadian.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is failing.  A large part of that is because there is 
inadequate punishment for crimes. We need some minimal sentences. 
We need some sentences that truly deter those who would break 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in the last couple of years farmers receive more 
punishment for trucking a load of grain across the U.S. border 
and selling their own product without getting the necessary 
Canadian Wheat Board permits than someone who commits rape, 
someone who preys on the most vulnerable in our society, the 
women and children.  It is disgusting that people can get away 
with conditional sentencing.  Those people are not deterred 
whatsoever from committing heinous crimes against the most 
vulnerable members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government continues to do nothing to address the 
issue of conditional sentencing and the need for minimal 
sentences to deter these individuals. This is absolutely 
appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have contained in Group No. 3 a proposal that deserves 
serious consideration.  We want to increase this penalty from two 
years to five years to make it sufficient to hopefully deter 
anyone from doing such things and, perhaps more important, to 
ensure Canadians can have confidence that the government is 
serious about preventing this information from getting out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Group No. 3 amendments deserve serious consideration and I 
urge all members to do exactly that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on Bill C-3, the taking and 
storing of DNA samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the solicitor general introduced the bill last fall I 
attended the press conference for the release of the bill. One of 
the biggest concerns members of the media had was how we would 
protect ourselves, protect society from the misuse and abuse of 
someone holding key information that we all contain in our 
bodies, DNA sampling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it straight, up front, plain and clear that we in 
our party felt the idea of a DNA bank and sampling was a great 
idea, a wonderful idea.  Make no mistake, we certainly support 
that type of thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent a week in Washington, D.C. last fall speaking with 
experts about DNA sampling and other justice matters. One of the 
things I discovered when I was there is how much faith the 
Americans are putting into this DNA bank.  Certainly there are 
some things in the American system that I would not want to see 
in Canada, make no mistake about that.  The feeling among the 
scientific and technological community in the United States is 
that this is the biggest breakthrough since the introduction of 
fingerprints in being able to identify criminals. That is a 
huge step. 
This DNA identification act is such an important part of such 
groundbreaking technology that it has the absolute ability to 
solve crimes committed many years ago.  Where most evidence may 
have been lost, misplaced or forgotten about, we have the ability 
under this bill with this kind of technology to solve a crime 
that has remained unsolved for years. Think of the impact that is 
going to have on families of victims.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many who have never been able to find out who committed a 
terrible act against a member of their family will now have that 
opportunity through this technology to solve those crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of that, and we have seen it recently with a 
couple of major cases in Canada, is the ability to exonerate 
people who have been wrongfully accused. There are people on both 
sides of this issue, also those who would like to see DNA not 
used for many reasons. We have now the ability to exonerate 
people who have been wrongly convicted.  I think that is just as 
important as it is for those who need to see crimes solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key to this is that the samples for this DNA registry must 
be taken at the proper time, used properly and stored properly. 
That is what Group No. 3 deals with, the absolute assurance that 
these DNA samples will not be used for other types of activities 
that would be both illegal and morally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a strong supporter of the idea that we need to take 
DNA samples at the point of arrest because obviously that is the 
most beneficial time. We need to have those samples go with that 
accused person right through their trial and if they are found 
guilty, those DNA samples would remain a part of our DNA registry 
that would become a large part of our criminologists' files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final step is that the samples of those people who are found 
not guilty must be removed from the registry in order to 
safeguard the privacy of innocent people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 3 also talks about the ability to assure our society 
that these samples are not used improperly.  This is an 
opportunity to have a very strong set of regulations in this 
area.  I spoke a few minutes ago on Bill C-26.  I said government 
overregulates and we have far too much bureaucracy and I still 
believe that.  But here is an area where we must come down hard. 
We must use the maximum amount of punishment to assure people 
that their DNA samples will not be used for devious purposes. 
This is an area where government policy and laws need to play a 
very important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know people have access and have the ability to hack into 
computers.  We know this is happening. There is no question in my 
mind that people are getting into our police computers on a 
regular basis and it is pretty hard to stop.  We must have strong 
enough laws in place to make sure that those people are caught, 
convicted and punished to the full extent of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the only way we are going to see a DNA registry really 
have the acceptance and the success that I think it can have.  It 
can be a major breakthrough in crime detection and even 
prevention.  We know a criminal will say that if there is an 
increased chance they will get caught for this crime, they will 
think twice about committing that crime in the first place, 
especially in the areas of rather petty crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put all the links of this chain together to make Bill 
C-3 successful, in the taking and storing of DNA samples.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without all those pegs being put into the proper holes, the 
registry or the bank itself has the very strong possibility of 
not being successful and not being used to its fullest extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really support the kind of idea where we would come down 
heavy.  I want to also be a little negative toward the government 
because in some areas of other amendments that we proposed for 
this bill, it has pretty much ignored us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not prepared to move on some of the amendments 
we talked about such as taking samples at the point of arrest.  I 
think without having all these links in place the bill itself may 
fall far short of what it is really capable of. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to the Group No. 3 motions of Bill C-3, an 
act that would bring about a DNA database. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two key issues we need to address here.  One is the 
issue of privacy and the other is the issue of deterrence. My 
friend from Prince George—Peace River talked a little about 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very important that whatever system is put in 
place people know their privacy is ensured.  As finance critic 
for the official opposition, I could say how many times we have 
had people come forward to say how very concerned they are with 
respect to the information they have to give to banks and to 
government organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People want to know that information will not be misused.  That 
is a pretty important consideration.  I think a lot of people are 
concerned in a day and age where technology has become all 
encompassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving information to one person may mean that it is spread out, 
that everybody has access to it everywhere.  It is a very 
legitimate concern.  I support the hon. member's motion to put in 
place some big penalties to ensure that if people misuse this 
information they will face a very severe penalty, up to five 
years in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this absolutely because knowledge is power.  I think 
we need to ensure whatever system is set up that we have the 
right deterrents in place to guarantee that the information will 
not be misused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support what the hon. member has brought forward as a motion 
in Group No. 3.  I think it is a good idea.  We need to support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, you still have eight minutes

see, their son Mark was murdered in Langley, British Columbia by 
a drunk driver.  Since that terrible ordeal they have raised 
immense awareness about drunk driving by getting petitions 
signed. Today I have the privilege of submitting one of the 
largest petitions ever sent to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot stop here.  This House will prepare a draft bill on 
drunk driving no later than November 30, 1998.  We must pay 
attention to the message Ken and Eileen have brought us through 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians signing this petition. Do not 
drink and drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to say this. The murder of Mark Roffel was 
senseless but his family and hundreds of thousands of Canadians 
will remember him forever. His story will live on through a 
positive change in drunk driving legislation.

that a 10% decrease in health spending would reduce life

$3.5 billion cut to health is the real threat to medicare and to 
people's lives, not compensation for hepatitis C victims.

at the health protection branch was a factor in federal 
regulatory failure of blood and the infection of tens of 
thousands of Canadians with HIV and hepatitis C.  Instead of 
learning from that four year multimillion dollar Krever report 
and applying its lessons to other important health protection 
issues such as pharmaceutical drug approval, the government is 
choosing to slide down the path of cutbacks and deregulation,

over 84% want change.  Alberta is taking a lead by electing a

unelected, unaccountable upper chamber.

to learn that the Reform Party supports efforts by the provinces 
to elect senators who would then be appointed and then be totally

that has to be a Liberal answer.  We have had 131 years of a

</I></B></P><P align=left>The polls also show that only 14% of Canadians think the Prime

28 straight partisan appointments.

the choice of the people? 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party had a chance to bring about a real 
reform of the Senate when the Charlottetown accord was before 
Canadians.  Instead it voted against the Charlottetown accord and 
caused any real reform of the Senate to be put off indefinitely. 
Reformers should look at themselves in the mirror and see where 
the blame lies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am informed as 
follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) It is routine for the minister of the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans, DFO, and staff to meet and speak with various members 
of the fishing community, including lodge operators and the Sport 
Fishing Institute of British Columbia, to discuss stakeholder 
issues. Former minister, the honourable Brian Tobin, met with 
sport fish lodge owners on July 12, 1995, to discuss chinook 
conservation measures and their impacts on lodge operations. 
Departmental staff are unaware of any other meeting, or 
conversation which took place during this timeframe relating to 
the context of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) With regard to the July 12, 1995 meeting reported in (a) 
above, any briefing which took place was verbal information 
provided by senior departmental officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Further to the honourable Brian Tobin's meeting on July 12, 
1995, with sport fish lodge owners, the honourable Brian Tobin 
was informed about the subsequent refusal of lodges to provide 
catch data on August 17, 1995. Former DFO minister, the 
honourable Fred Mifflin, received briefing material on June 10, 
1996. Departmental records indicated that the honourable David 
Anderson, at the time minister of revenue and member of 
parliament for Victoria, was briefed in late July, 1995 
regarding the refusal of lodges in the Queen Charlotte Islands, 
B.C., including Oak Bay Marine Group, to provinde catch data to 
DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) Departmental officials advise that a staff member of former 
DFO minister the honourable Brian Tobin's office attended one DFO 
Pacific salmon management teleconference call on May 26, 1995, 
which discussed proposed chinook salmon conservation measures. 
Discussions included expected opposition to the measures by Queen 
Charlotte Island lodge operators including Oak Bay Marine Group. 
The department is unaware of any DFO minister or his staff 
members participating in further teleconferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) Departmental staff provided a response to an anticipated 
oral question for the House of Commons relating to the referenced 
subject matter to the honourable David Anderson on September 24, 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) Departmental staff and current ministerial staff are unaware 
of any meeting during the stated timeframe between Ministers or their 
staff where Oak Bay Marine Group officials made clear their 
displeasure at being required to provide catch data to DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) Yes, the honourable David Anderson did go fishing for 4 
hours on August 12, 1997 on a private vessel owned by Martin 
Dowling of Campbell River, B.C. The members of the party in 
addition to the minister and Mr. Dowling were Greg McDougall, 
Gerry Kristianson and Randy Wright, who is the 
vice-president, operations, of the Oak Bay Marine Group.

expect an answer to this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have taken note of

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>DNA IDENTIFICATION ACT

<A NAME="LINK200">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-3, an act respecting 
DNA identification and to make consequential amendments to the 
Criminal Code and other acts, as reported (with amendment) from 
the committee; and of Motion No. 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the bill was last under 
consideration by the House the hon. member for Medicine Hat had 
the floor.  He has eight minutes remaining in his speech. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise again to address the motion in Group No. 3. 
My friends across the way were hoping I was finished but sadly 
for them and for me too, I guess, we are not finished yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on two issues and just remind members why we are 
supporting the motion by the NDP member.  The reasons are 
twofold.  We are concerned about the privacy aspect.  As I 
pointed out before question period, there are concerns among the 
public in an age when technology has become so prevalent that if 
the government through the DNA databank were to receive a piece 
of information, a DNA sample, somehow it will become public and 
could be used in other ways the public would be very concerned 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very legitimate concern.  Many Canadians are concerned 
that the government already has too much information about them. 
If we are to ensure that this very useful tool is given to police 
for use in stopping legitimate criminals, we must ensure the 
public's concerns are allayed.  The best way to do that in this 
case, other than using due diligence when this DNA databank is 
set up, is to put in place very stiff penalties so that if people 
misuse the information they will face very severe consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are very pleased to support the Group No. 3 
motion that would place a maximum five year penalty on anybody 
who misuses the data.  We are supportive of it.  I believe the 
original legislation has a two year penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read through the bill from cover to cover, as I often do 
before I turn in for the evening, that aspect concerned me.  I 
was happy to see this amendment come forward.  Reformers will 
stand in support of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the DNA databank is a good idea.  We want it.  We 
think it is important for the police to have it, but we need to 
ensure legitimate concerns are dealt with. 
We think this is one way we could deal with this concern and 
therefore will support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been given just a few moments to 
comment upon what is happening in the House today.  We have a 
bill on the topic of using DNA samples as a tool to suppress 
crime, a bill in fact that the Liberals never really wanted. They 
were brought to the issue by the sweep of international events as 
other countries were responding to changing enforcement 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people are far ahead of the government on the will 
to respond to crime.  They want more than the narrow limits of 
the bill on DNA.  The theme I am talking about here is how 
philosophically weak is the Liberal government.  It specifically 
shows in the comments to the groupings of the amendments before 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a comment the other day that seemed to fit my point. 
After some political talk around a table over drinks with some 
obvious frustration, one interrupted the other and asked “Just 
what do the Liberals really stand for anyway?”  The answer I 
overheard was telling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said something to the effect that “When you get right down 
to it I suppose I have to admit that Liberals really stand for 
what will get us elected.  When I think about it, it does not 
seem to matter too much about the long term view of what I think 
is good for the country.  My party keeps changing and I really do 
not think we stand for anything exclusively.  We have the red 
book now but things always change”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that understanding or admission is a touchy sore point 
with the Prime Minister.  I have heard him on several occasions 
in the House try to cover the inherent weak nature of his party 
and deliver his personal prescription of what it means to be a 
Liberal in the usual puff phrases referring to democracy, 
compassion, pragmatism and so on.  I have heard this from every 
political stripe, from the diehard socialist to the deluded 
fascist, every group imaginable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say much about democracy and equality in our party also, but 
we write them down in a blue book after exhaustive voting, 
grassroots debate and discussion.  Then we publish it for the 
country and we are on the record as accountable for those 
positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers have been doing that for years before the Liberals 
ever conceived of the idea of a red book.  It is because 
Reformers had a blue book and were killing the Liberals in the 
polls in the west that they quickly hothoused the production of 
the 1993 Liberal red book.  The country knows that one now very 
much as the list of broken promises or the red ink book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Prime Minister knows in his heart how weak 
and without courage Liberals are.  His pronouncements in the 
House about it betray him.  The private admission of the lady to 
whom I referred who said she was a Liberal is not news. Everyone 
has heard those comments.  The sad part of it for our country is 
that the lady, in spite of her admission, did not seem to feel 
motivated to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To her it seemed okay that despite how much her party hurt the 
country or despite how short term expediency left Canada missing 
opportunities for greatness and raising the human spirit, she 
seemed content to sit with the insiders Liberal club; no risk, no 
hint of courage, no concern about leadership, just complacency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of what the Prime Minister has done on the hepatitis C 
file, Liberals who know better just shed their tears in private. 
They unfortunately stay in their Liberal seats instead of joining 
the people's agenda on our side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal manoeuvres on the DNA bill are typical of so much of 
their administration of the people's business.  They are weak and 
this weakness has produced the consequence now that will directly 
affect the basic safety of our citizens.  Liberal weakness to 
defend the streets of Canada against evil and the perpetrators of 
crime is a reflection of their inadequate policy.  Our country 
faces challenges and to be a Liberal today is obviously just not 
good enough to meet those challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic economic policies of the government have been timid. 
Liberals have put the country through needless pain by drawing 
out the ordering of our national finances in halting steps, while 
sending shaky mixed messages to the investor community about 
where we are going.  The Liberals are weak and are not up to the 
job of running the finances of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Saturday, May 9, a <I>Vancouver Sun</I> headline read “Only 
weak dollar helps us keep pace with Americans”.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article shows how Canada has fallen behind the U.S. in 
productivity, foreign investment and the generation of jobs and 
income.  The finance minister does get some good advice on how to 
stem the trend, but he is weak.  He is afraid of the politics of 
envy of the NDP.  The socialist tendencies in his party hold 
Canada back.  That results in keeping unemployment unnecessarily 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make another point. The minister of trade is so weak that 
he cannot explain or sell an MAI type of agreement that would 
protect Canada's economic interests as we try expanding our 
economy abroad.  He is so inadequate that he lets Maude Barlow 
and others lie baldface to the nation and deceive communities 
right across this country with their socialist, small minded 
inferiority complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal trade minister was not up to building a national 
political mandate within our country or lead internationally to 
overcome the problems of the MAI, even when Canada has a former 
cabinet minister in charge of the OECD.  No wonder.  The record 
is there.  He is just a weak Liberal who is out of his league 
when he takes Canada to the international table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make those observations leading up to the greatest admission 
of weakness by Liberals that I have seen for some time.  It was 
the press release of May 1 by the solicitor general and the 
justice minister.  I quote in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>May 1, 1998, Solicitor General of Canada and Minister of Justice 
and Attorney General Canada released today the conclusions of 
three eminent jurists asked to review the constitutionality of 
taking DNA samples without prior judicial authorization at the 
time a person is charged with a designated offence, such as 
sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995, DNA samples can be taken for investigative purposes 
under the authority of a judicial warrant and the federal 
government now has legislation before parliament, Bill C-3, that 
would create a DNA databank based on DNA samples collected after 
conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responding to a number of individuals and organizations that 
have continued to press for such amendment, the Department of 
Justice sought legal opinions from former Justice Martin Taylor 
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, and from former Chief 
Justices Charles Dubin of the Ontario Court of Appeal and Claude 
Bisson of the Quebec Court of Appeal.  Each concluded 
independently that this proposal would not survive charter 
scrutiny. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If charter scrutiny is the problem, then maybe the charter is 
wrong or out of date.  If we have judges who will not approve a 
more expansive bill, then maybe we have the wrong kind of judges. 
After all, the public has had no input into their selection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes down to courage and confidence of the government, 
courage and skill to act for the people.   Make the supreme court 
reflective of Canadian society.  Change the charter if we have 
to, the people are behind it.  Pass legislation in this House 
that meets the challenges of the job.  If the judges are not up 
to speed and strike it down, then use the notwithstanding clause. 
Under this Liberal administration parliament no longer seems 
supreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are attempting to amend this bill through these various 
report stage motions.  It is good as far as it goes, but I call 
on the government to show some resolve and strength of 
leadership.  The DNA bill should be parallel to taking 
fingerprints.  Liberals hiding and running because of legal 
technicalities is not a government of the 21st century.  Opinions 
will continue to vary.  We do not need this weak government.  We 
need a government to positively decide and lead with courage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, you will note that because I am going to the Senators 
game tonight we will have a victory over there.  That is why the 
juggling of the order, to allow me the time to get ready so that 
I can help them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA evidence has been used in the courts since 1988.  The 
question is why has it taken a full decade for the government to 
come up with comprehensive legislation for the collecting of DNA 
samples to allow peace officers and the justice system to do 
their jobs.  The tools are widely available for the collection of 
DNA samples.  The track record for proving convictions and for 
proving innocence such as the recent high profile exonerations 
demonstrates the validity and viability of DNA testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so far behind in this technology?  Why is 
the government going through such great lengths to limit these 
tools and methods of DNA collection?  Should the government 
instead be concentrating on regulating and safeguarding the 
methods available? 
The government is concerned with the protection of the rights of 
the criminals.  That is why the bill allows only for the 
collection of DNA samples after a conviction for a crime that has 
been committed. Too bad the government does not use the same 
rationale in protecting the rights of law-abiding Canadians.  The 
government has no problem setting up a central gun registry 
forcing people who have not committed a crime to give private 
information to the government and to keep a central databank.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government willing to punish law-abiding Canadians by 
establishing a flawed gun registry while at the same time 
hindering justice by not collecting DNA when a person is charged 
with a crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association represents the frontline of our 
justice system.  Police officers are concerned that if they have 
to wait until a conviction in order to collect DNA samples, they 
will not be able to introduce DNA evidence during trial 
proceedings. This would be like not using fingerprints as 
evidence until after the person has been convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government tell us what it is afraid of?  Will it 
accept the Canadian Police Association's recommendation that DNA 
samples be collected when a person who has previously committed a 
crime is being charged with the present crime?  The police are 
concerned that if they have to wait for the conviction before 
collecting a DNA sample the accused would rather skip bail or not 
fulfil parole conditions rather than voluntarily submitting to DNA 
samples being taken from him or her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why volunteer to give evidence which may very well convict him 
or her of an unsolved crime?  How can the government continue to 
argue against the rationale that is being given by the police who 
know and have to work with the criminal element?  Why is the 
government willing to listen to people protecting the rights of 
criminals rather than the Canadian Police Association which 
promotes the interest of our police men and women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is already concerned with the lack of teeth in 
Canada's justice system. The Young Offenders Act is under public 
scrutiny because it sees young offenders repeating crimes. The 
public is concerned about criminals released on early parole 
because once released many are again committing crimes.  If these 
repeat offenders knew that their DNA samples were in a central 
registry, would they not be less likely to commit a crime?  Does 
it not make sense to put into place preventive measures such as 
an extensive DNA sample bank for future victims? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association's main philosophical objection 
with Bill C-3 is this.  It is a fundamental disagreement over the 
sovereign legislative authority of parliament in originating 
criminal law as opposed to a judicially supreme system favoured 
by the department and some justices.  Having responsible 
government taken away from a free people is a terrible thing but 
giving it away is surely worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was concerned about what the courts would think 
of this bill when it was drafting it.  Rather, should the courts 
not be concerned about what parliament is thinking?  It is 
parliament that makes the laws, not the courts. The job of the 
courts is to enforce the laws that parliament makes.  If this 
business of second guessing each other continues, it is the 
legislative function of parliament that will be hindered.  It is 
known now that parliament is being hindered by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have a desire to protect our families and society.  This 
bill would provide for matching DNA samples taken from a crime 
scene with those samples in the DNA bank. Does it not make sense 
that the larger the data source of the DNA bank, the likelier a 
match will be found?  Why not seek measures to increase the data 
in the DNA bank rather than limiting the tools needed by law 
enforcement officers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two more points.  One of my colleagues said that this 
bill is a half step. It is obvious that this bill is going to 
have to be amended a number of times over the next few years.  In 
the meantime because of samples that are not taken as a result of 
this proposed legislation, crimes will go unsolved.  There is no 
question about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not get the bill right the first time?  Why not accept the 
valuable suggestions from the Canadian Police Association and the 
opposition so that we have a bill that works from the start 
rather than having to amend it in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us are concerned about due process.  All of us are 
concerned about privacy.  None of us want to see a system of DNA 
registration that would hinder our individual rights.  The 
safeguard that has been proposed is that anyone who has already 
been convicted of a crime when charged with another would have to 
provide DNA samples.  This way the general law-abiding public 
would not be subject to undue process in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government think that people who have committed crimes 
against society have the same privileges as those who have kept 
the law?  It is obvious attention is not given to the 
independence of this House.  It is not given to the innocence of 
the victims but rather we are determined to continue to give 
rights to those who have already committed a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Churchill said, give our police the tools so they can finish 
the job.  Do not hinder them in their pursuit of doing their job 
of bringing criminals to trial.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>DNA IDENTIFICATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK208">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-3, an act respecting 
DNA identification and to make consequential amendments to the 
Criminal Code and other acts, as reported (with amendment) from 
the committee; and of Motion No. 7. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak regarding Group No. 3 in this DNA bill, 
particularly to speak in support of Motion No. 7 which amends 
clause 11 of the bill. It proposes that the penalty be increased 
from two to five years for anyone who violates, misuses or 
communicates any part of a person's DNA sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion would clearly be a deterrent to those who would be 
inclined to use this information for criminal purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why this motion is necessary since there is 
considerable nervousness surrounding the privacy of individuals. 
The privacy commissioner has stated on a number of occasions that 
he has serious reservations with the storing of DNA samples 
themselves rather than just the analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He felt this legislation seeks to use DNA to link specific 
offenders with specific crimes.  Keeping the DNA sample itself 
would inevitably invite further uses of the DNA that have little 
to do with identifying offenders such as allowing researchers to 
use the material to study genetic links to criminal behaviour. 
That is the idea being proposed now in Correctional Service 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been told by the commissioner's office that we are 
looking for alternative therapies to criminal behaviour.  The 
problem with the privacy commissioner's theory that the analysis 
of the DNA is sufficient without the need to preserve the actual 
sample is that he did not take into account that in order for the 
databank to keep pace with technological advances the samples are 
needed.  If not we would have recollect samples should the 
original analysis be obsolete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expenses associated with the repetition of these tasks would 
be astronomical. 
I hope that that would be taken into account.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of my hon. colleague from the NDP should put the 
privacy commissioner's fears to rest knowing that a strong 
penalty was in place for the misuse of samples.  There is only 
one word in this whole business that I have mentioned that 
frightens me a bit in the sense that it is a word which would 
cause most Liberals if not all of them to reject this kind of 
amendment to a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word is deterrent. Anytime we talk about creating penalties 
for breaking the law, penalties for doing wrong and that we need 
to impose penalties that would be a deterrent to individuals 
doing these things, the Liberal government seems to reject it. 
Deterrent is not part of the Liberal government's language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals have these flowery ideas, soft cushy mushy ideas that 
criminals have to be coddled in all fashions imaginable in order 
to change in their lives and make things better.  I hope the 
Liberals will look at this part and say that yes we do need to 
deter people from misusing DNA samples that are collected. 
Anybody who would misuse or abuse that position should suffer the 
consequences.  It would cause others to think twice before they 
did the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only wish we could put people into power.  Maybe someday we 
will, when we get rid of these pussycats in the government's 
front row who do not know the meaning of good law and order and 
strong discipline.  The government is forever coddling criminals. 
It is to the point that in the penitentiaries the disposable 
income for a convict is $150 per month whereas the disposable 
income for a soldier in our army is about $40 a month.  We do not 
look after law-abiding people nearly as well as we do the people 
behind bars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anytime any kind of bill is introduced that would be strong 
enough to deter people from other activities along those lines 
would be wonderful. It would bring about some changes this 
government would not want to see, not the way the government 
coddles up to the convicts making sure their rights are looked 
after while the victims rights in our land continually go 
downhill, depleted day in and day out. The victims are just poor 
victims but the criminals, man oh man, the things that are done 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really have to be careful when we take these DNA samples 
according to the government.  Criminals immediately get 
psychological attention.  They can get massages, legal aid, all 
these things come to their rescue.  I have talked to family after 
family after family of victims.  If they need a psychologist to 
deal with someone who has lost a loved one, they have to pay for 
the service themselves, if they can afford it and most cannot, 
but we make sure the criminal gets that. If a criminal needs 
psychiatric help and has to be placed under observation for 30 
days, we make sure the taxpayers pay for it while the victims, if 
they want any service at all, will have to pay for it themselves, 
if they can afford it and of course most of them cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time we focused on the victims in our country. The 
victims are the people that are being terribly offended in this 
nation by a government that does not seem to care at all about 
them.  The government shows about as much care for victims of 
criminal activities as it has shown for the people who were 
affected by hepatitis C before 1986.  This caring loving 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is completely off track.  These amendments would 
help bring it back on track.  The police association and all 
those who work on the front line, the ones who want to make the 
arrests who want to clean up the problems we are having with 
criminals in our land are saying to the government “Let us take 
the sample at the time of arrest, let us take it at the time of 
charge”.  But no. 
We are not going to allow that to happen until after.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the police all over the country and anyone who works 
with crime and law and order.  Walk into a police department in 
Calgary, Toronto or anywhere.  Ask the police when it should be 
done and they will say that it certainly should not be done after 
conviction because it does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have to be careful when we do anything in this 
country because we will offend the charter of rights of the 
criminals.  This is the charter that the mighty government under 
the Trudeau leadership brought in, to our great nation's dismay. 
It has been a roadblock to good justice in this land for far too 
long. I for one am really getting tired of watching progress 
being moved in a direction only to have the Supreme Court of 
Canada rule that under the charter of rights and freedoms we 
cannot go any further in that direction because it would offend 
or hurt the poor criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Canadians wake up to what is really going on in this land 
and that this government gets what it deserves in the next 
election, booted out of here so we can put something in that will 
do something with law and order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, my 
colleague from Wild Rose mentioned the criminals and the easy 
life they have.  The criminals in my area of the country get to 
play golf.  The average taxpayer in my riding has to pay more 
than $50 a round but the criminals get to play golf on their own 
golf course.  Is that not great? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to think about this, I think the average Canadian 
would say that if we kept criminals busy 60 hours a week, 40 
hours a week eight hours a day doing meaningful work and 20 hours 
of study a week learning to be better people, they would come out 
of those places a lot better than the people who come out after 
all the mollycoddling with colour television sets and playing on 
the golf course when other people have to pay.  It is entirely 
wrong and is not the way it should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of my colleagues said, if the government would just 
accept the sensible amendments to these bills, we would not have 
to keep revisiting these things. It is amazing how many bills 
come back for amendments one or two years later.  The Nunavut 
bill is back in the House.  The Minister of Canadian Heritage is 
running around handing out $300,000 for polls, which could have 
been done for $8,000 by professional companies, to try to justify 
and support bills that were passed when they had no idea what the 
definitions would be.  It is a total mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would just accept meaningful changes to its 
bills, little amendments like the one we are looking at here 
under Group No. 3, the bills would be much better.  They would 
work better and they would not have to keep coming back here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Group No. 3, the motion was put forward by a member of the 
NDP.  We on the Reform side support the motion. It proposes a 
change in the penalty for releasing the DNA results for any other 
reason than for the purposes of the act.  The government has a 
two year penalty in there.  If somebody gets these DNA results 
and sends them out on a mailing list or allows them to be 
publicized in some way, there is only a two year penalty provided 
for under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Wild Rose said, this is a typical example 
of the mollycoddling approach the Liberal government has toward 
criminals. This is a serious crime and it should have a much 
greater penalty.  The proposal that has come from our NDP 
colleague is a five year penalty. We agree with it because if it 
was two years we could bet the person would be out in three 
months.  That is just the way it works with this Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking today about the DNA act takes me back to when the 
member for Wild Rose actually got the first DNA bill through this 
House.  Anybody who was here in the 35th Parliament, and all of 
those Liberals sitting on that side were here, will remember the 
day in question period when the member for Wild Rose stood up and 
challenged the then justice minister to do something about 
authorizing the use of DNA.  On that day, whether it was by 
mistake or good fortune, the minister agreed to meet with the 
opposition. 
He said if the opposition would meet with him that day it could 
be done.  The member for Wild Rose got right back up and said 
“We will do it this afternoon” and it was done.  Within a very 
short time we had a bill through the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was thrilled as the member for North Vancouver because the 
very first crime that was solved using that bill was a crime in 
North Vancouver.  The police had been waiting for the power to 
use the DNA results.  Why it had been delayed for so long heaven 
only knows.  All it took was the willingness of the government to 
sit down and do something sensible that the people of Canada 
wanted.  When we look at the DNA bill and the amendments proposed 
by the opposition members, anyone reading the bill can see that 
they are sensible amendments and really should be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague for Wild Rose alluded to, we have had 30 years 
of the Liberal wishy-washy bleeding heart approach to crime. 
Where has that got us?  Absolutely nowhere.  The situation today 
is that the police are frustrated. They can arrest people for 
crimes and they cannot get convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I cannot use props but the tiepin I am wearing today was 
lent to me by a policeman friend.  The policemen I know are 
friends and they should be friends of law-abiding people.  These 
days the police are forced to act as facilitators because if they 
actually arrest anybody, they have a terrible job getting anyone 
convicted. The tiepin is a pair of gold handcuffs that the police 
wear to represent the difficult time they have in actually 
getting criminals convicted. I wish we could do something in the 
House to assist the police to do their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the frustrations alluded to by two of my colleagues is 
what we call the tyranny of the judges.  The supreme court 
overrules the intent of parliament, turning us into an even worse 
type of wishy-washy Liberal approach to crime. I wonder, but 
perhaps I do not have to wonder too much what that has to do with 
the fact that the government actually appoints the judges and we 
end up with the same philosophy in making judgments on what comes 
down in the way of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago the Supreme Court of Canada made a judgment on 
the Delgamuukw case, the Indian land claims case that came out of 
B.C.  The case goes back probably about a decade.  Many years 
were spent hearing the testimony in the case in B.C.  It took 
more than a year for the judge to come out with his judgment. The 
judgment that there was no Indian claim to title was upheld by 
the B.C. supreme court after lengthy hearings. Then it went to 
the Supreme Court of Canada. In a lightning fast hearing a 
central Canadian court overturned everything that had been 
determined in the British Columbia courts and created nothing but 
chaos for the land claims process in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of the type of tyranny that goes on that 
should be dealt with with the notwithstanding clause as mentioned 
by the member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby. These 
sorts of decisions undermine the parliamentary process.  They 
make it very difficult for parliament to do its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the Easter break I was in Australia.  I was looking at a 
similar problem Australia ran into.  About five or six years ago 
a court made a similar ruling to the one that has just been made 
by the Supreme Court of Canada. The court ruled that the 
aboriginals of Australia basically owned everything.  They had 
title to everything.  That created such chaos in Australia over 
the next three to four years that every time the government tried 
to do something, to develop a new park, to build a school, 
whatever it was trying to do, aboriginals would lodge claims in 
the court that they owned the land and nothing could be done with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already see that happening in B.C.  Three or four weeks ago 
the B.C. government announced it was building a new school in the 
heart of the city.  What happened?  Immediately some natives 
claimed that they own the land and the school cannot be built 
until they have settled their land claim.  We can see this whole 
process running away into uncontrolled judicial decisions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Australia, after putting up with that for four years, they 
finally passed the native land titles act to put an end to the 
tyranny that was shown by the judges and to extinguish that 
aboriginal title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things stem from the refusal of government to treat 
crime in a meaningful manner and to treat criminals for what they 
are, criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what causes crime.  Criminals cause crime.  We need to 
take a much harder line with criminals than we have been taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the opposition is pleased to see this type of DNA 
legislation coming through, we would certainly like to see 
amendments made to reinforce the provisions of the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise today to speak to the amendments to Bill C-3, 
the DNA act.  The motion in Group No. 3 that we are debating 
would increase the penalty for anybody who abuses this 
information.  If the information is used for anything other than 
what was intended, a very severe penalty should be applied.  This 
is needed because the information is very useful in fighting 
crime.  It is also very personal and should be used only for what 
it was intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA profiles contain uniquely private and personal information. 
This information should be used only for the purposes of 
identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of this bill is to create a databank to identify 
every person who has committed a crime in this country.  If the 
profile is on file, then anytime it comes up again we know 
exactly who the person is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would give a strong tool to our police, to our crime 
fighters.  It is a strong tool for the protection of society.  It 
is a strong tool for deterring criminals from acting because they 
will know there is a positive means of identification on file and 
that there will be no mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion goes on to state other reasons it is important to 
protect these profiles.  The improper use or disclosure of DNA 
profiles can lead to significant harm to the individual, 
including discrimination in areas such as employment, education, 
health care, reproduction and insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a great deal of concern about the rights of 
people.  If we have rights for the average citizen in Canada, 
then we need to secure those rights and make them stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have this DNA information on file, it should be used for 
crime prevention and that is all it should be used for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this amendment from the member for Sydney—Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this very personal information gets out for any reason other 
than that for which it was intended, then the crime should be 
very, very strong.  This should, in itself, go a long way in 
putting to rest some of the fears of the people who are worried 
about the rights of criminals.  However, I think we should worry 
more about the rights of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forensic DNA analysis provides information not only about an 
individual, but also about the individual's parents and children, 
thus implicating family privacy.  Again, this is the type of 
information we do not want to be made public.  The information is 
meant to be used as a tool to fight crime.  It is not meant to be 
used as a tool to invade anybody's privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, there is a need for a strong deterrent for anybody who 
would abuse this databank.  Once this databank is in place, we 
need a very strong deterrent for anybody thinking of taking up 
criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA profiles are also tied to reproductive decisions which are 
among the most private and intimate decisions an individual can 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons that have been put forward to protect DNA 
information indicate why we need this amendment.  We need a 
strong penalty for anybody abusing this information because it 
delves into absolutely every aspect of a person's life.  There 
are no secrets when a DNA profile is created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the bill states that the commissioner shall ensure that 
the national DNA databank authority maintains a record of every 
person who accesses the national DNA databank established under 
subsection (1). 
There has to be a record of any person who uses this databank to 
absolutely make certain that the use of this information is for 
what it was intended and that it cannot be manipulated for use in 
any other manner.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned earlier the research that could be done with 
the DNA databank information on criminals.  Persons could take 
all of that information and use it for various reasons.  But it 
has to be kept for the use that was intended.  That is why this 
motion was put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also states that every three years after this legislation 
comes into force a complete investigation must be carried out 
with respect to the national DNA databank and all aspects 
surrounding it.  This is another aspect that was put in place to 
ensure the privacy of the individuals in the databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who thinks this bill is going to invade a person's 
rights must realize that all manner of legislation is being put 
into place to protect against that.  The legislation is being put 
in place to make this bill acceptable to the people who feel that 
the information could be used in a improper manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of these aspects to the bill and the fact that this 
amendment has been brought forward to increase the penalty for 
the improper use of the databank, I think we have come to the 
point where it will be usable, the information will be protected 
and we will not have to be concerned with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us allow this DNA databank to exist.  Let us use it as a 
strong tool to fight crime.  Let us use it as a strong tool to 
protect people's rights in this country.  Let us use it as a tool 
for deterrence and police action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to support Motion No. 7 under Group No. 3 
which is before us.  This motion recognizes the reality that not 
everyone in the public service is always pure and without fault. 
It recognizes the reality that confidential information can be 
misused.  In fact, we can cite many instances where confidential 
information has been misused.  Take for example the Income Tax 
Act.  Everything is supposed to be confidential, yet every year 
we get specific examples of information having been improperly 
released by bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am not big on very severe criminal penalties for 
ordinary citizens who get fouled up in the law, I am very 
supportive of strong penalties for people in positions of trust 
who abuse their responsibilities and commit offences.  I would 
say that this proposal to raise the maximum penalty from two to 
five years for the improper release of information is very well 
placed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also could list examples of the improper use of lists.  This 
government is great for lists.  In fact all Canadian governments 
have been great for lists.  We will recall that Bill C-68 was 
passed in the last parliament.  Because there were lists of all 
the lawful owners of handguns in this country the government was 
able, suddenly and out of the blue, to declare that about 400,000 
people owned firearms which were no longer legal.  They were, in 
effect, confiscated because their value was reduced to zero by 
the stroke of a government pen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government did not have a list, the government could not 
indulge in this sort of hanky-panky.  It is no wonder the 
Canadian people are reluctant to have their names on anything, 
particularly in the computer age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other amendments, of course, which we will be 
supporting to this particular legislation as we go on through the 
day and perhaps tomorrow.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the absurdity, for example, that DNA samples can be 
taken only after conviction.  I suppose we should take 
fingerprints only after conviction and take mug shots only after 
conviction.  Why there should be different rules for DNA than for 
fingerprinting is something I do not understand.  However, that 
is another amendment which we will be discussing at a later time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to Motion No. 7, I think it is very well thought 
out.  I compliment the hon. member for bringing this forward.  I 
notice some people on the other side nodding in agreement.  I 
hope this amendment will ultimately pass because it really does 
improve the legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, there 
are a couple of issues here that I think we should stop to take a 
look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who just spoke made the point that we will not 
be able to take DNA samples until after a conviction.  I think 
that is something we had better take a long, hard look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this specific amendment is dealing with, however, is the 
fact that we are going to increase the penalty for misuse of a 
DNA sample from two years to five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pretty simple proposition.  This is not complicated. 
Even members of the government should be able to fathom this one, 
turn it around in their heads and support it.  I expect they 
will.  However, it begs a few more questions.  Who are we 
protecting?  Are we protecting the person who commits the violent 
offence?  Are we protecting the public?  Are we protecting some 
unknown entity?  I am a little confused in the circle of life 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we simplified the laws of this land instead of 
making them more complicated.  If we are talking about misuse of 
a DNA sample, then let us increase the penalty.  Let us 
understand what it is for, but let us also use that tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police associations have asked for it.  The barrister 
associations are a bit mixed on it.  We do not have one complete 
answer there.  However, it is a useful tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not catching the explanation that tells me that it is some 
type of an invasive plan or that it is invasive to the person who 
actually has a DNA sample taken.  By plucking a hair from a head 
or by taking a swab of saliva out of a mouth we have a DNA 
sample.  Is that somehow more invasive than putting ink on a 
person's hands and fingerprinting them at the point where that 
person is charged?  We do not have to wait.  What is going on 
here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As responsible people, as the people who help to set the laws of 
this country, we should come to grips with this.  This is not a 
complicated issue.  This is childishly simple.  Let us deal with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is past due.  We spent far too much time arguing about this 
and discussing this in the House of Commons.  The justice 
committee has come in with specific recommendations.  It is time 
to approve those recommendations and move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should understand that this is a new tool in the arsenal 
against crime.  It needs some protective measures so we do not 
abuse it.  We always run the risk of abuse in government or abuse 
by officials or abuse by a third party with some type of an 
ulterior motive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not think that we are quite in the days of Orwellian 
thought yet.  This is not <I>Nineteen Eighty-Four</I>.  We have 
the opportunity here to move forward.  This is not an invasion of 
somebody's home.  It is not an invasion of their bedroom.  This 
is about a DNA sample which is going to be held in a databank 
with protective measures so that it will not be available to the 
general public.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to the motion before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important when Canadians look at their justice system that 
they feel the system actually has the ability to achieve what it 
sets out to achieve.  It is vitally important that the justice 
system have teeth in it for those who would break the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest criticisms—and it is coffee shop talk 
everywhere we go in the country—is that there is not sufficient 
teeth in the system right now.  Many Canadians feel that serious 
and violent offenders are getting off with a mere slap on the 
wrist in many cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to have built-in safeguards to protect the 
safety and the privacy of citizens and to respect their 
individual rights.  I have spoken many times in the House on my 
very deep commitment to individual rights in Canada, something 
that I do not think we stress nearly enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I am very supportive of the motion which would provide 
a much stronger guarantee to individuals that information 
obtained from a DNA profile would not be used improperly.  In 
fact anybody who would do so would be faced with very severe 
penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that those penalties be articulated in the act 
and that they are tough.  I do not want to see this databank 
abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, Canadians are very much tired of a justice system 
that does not deliver.  They are very much tired of a justice 
system that has no teeth in it.  They are very much tired of a 
justice system where they see plea bargains that end up with 
serious and violent offenders getting a mere slap on the wrist 
for committing heinous acts and crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no different when we are talking about the protection of 
individual rights.  I believe that we have to consider the rights 
of individuals to their privacy.  We have to accept the fact that 
the government has a very strong obligation to ensure that 
information obtained under a DNA profile is not abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very much in favour of the notion of DNA databanks.  As a 
person who has absolutely no intention of ever committing a 
crime, I have no problem signing up for the program and making my 
DNA available to a databank right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  I hear members across the way objecting 
to that, and I do not understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people voluntarily provide their fingerprints for a variety 
of reasons to a fingerprint databank.  I have absolutely no 
problem with making the job of law enforcement easier.  I have 
absolutely no problem with the notion that people charged with a 
serious crime be compelled to provide a DNA profile or a DNA 
sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have a problem with is a justice system which 
mollycoddles those who commit serious crimes and those accused of 
committing serious crimes and which does not extract proper 
compensation or proper retribution for the transgressions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parliamentarian, as a person who is going to be required to 
vote on the motion, I have absolutely no problem.  I believe very 
strongly that the motion as it is written is a vast improvement 
to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as parliamentarians have an obligation to Canadians to 
provide a justice system that works and that provides the 
safeguards Canadians expect, especially when it comes to their 
individual rights.  Therefore I believe the motion as written 
addresses both those concerns, particularly if the justice system 
and the courts in the future will interpret the motion and will 
apply the motion as it is written.  It will be a big step forward 
in terms of how our justice system in Canada is applied and does 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate my support for the motion.  It is time that we have 
a justice system in the country that works.  It is time that we 
have means of identifying criminals and those who are accused of 
serious crimes.  It is time that Canadians feel their justice 
system is working for them and not for the criminal element in 
society.  It is time that we as a nation recognize our 
obligations primarily to our fellow citizens to provide for their 
safety and for their well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of those reason I will be supporting the motion and will 
be encouraging all my colleagues in the House to do so as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
first like to point out that the group of amendments containing 
Motion No. 8 was initiated by my colleague, the member for 
Charlesbourg.  As he is busy with other duties related to his 
role as an MP today, he is unable to move the motion and I will 
therefore do so on his behalf.  I am pleased to do so because 
this is not the first time this kind of amendment has been 
introduced by the Bloc Quebecois.  I will go into further detail 
later.  The motion has primarily to do with the intended 
procedure for passing regulations related to legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out briefly that we are still talking 
about Bill C-3.  For those unfamiliar with the bill, it allows 
genetic fingerprinting in certain cases in order to establish a 
DNA databank for identifying individuals who have committed 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a way of taking more modern scientific and medical 
technologies, which have made enormous strides, one step 
further.  There is already a similar structure in place for 
fingerprints.  According to the scientific information we have 
been given, DNA testing is very accurate and has a very high 
success rate.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a certain extent, this bill represents that approach.  It is 
important to understand that this is a first, that it represents 
something new and different, which demands a degree of caution. 
It is to be expected that the public will ask questions and that 
there will even be some reluctance.  Some kind of legislative 
and regulatory framework is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what worries us a bit in this particular case, giving 
latitude to others than this House, this Parliament, when the 
time comes to define the type of regulations which will 
accompany an act like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of DNA samples for identification, or for ultimate use 
in evidence being a relatively recent development, a great deal 
of caution is needed in our approach.  At this point, it is the 
House which has the opportunity to debate the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at the report stage.  The bill has been debated at second 
reading and in committee.  Situations may crop up when the 
powers will need to be expanded, or restricted. a little, and 
this requires much care and much follow-up.  Parliamentarians 
should have some control over the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People expect us to be the ones in society with the power to 
make decisions on legislative measures, and they do not want to 
see others—even a well-intentioned minister—making use of 
departmental employees or ministerial staff to define practices, 
particularly if these are new practices. This would give them 
the sole power to make the rules and to have them passed by 
cabinet.  All these powers, the way the bill is set up at 
present, are concentrated in the hands of a single individual, 
and do not lie with this Parliament as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only case where this is happening.  It is a 
frequent occurrence.  Without referring to any specific case, I 
would just say that this is a general government trend, this 
desire to get their hands on as much power as possible  One way 
of doing so is through regulations. 
So, yet again the role of members is being reduced because their 
impact in the formulation of regulations is being restricted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well to talk about the stages in committee and so 
on, there should still be a formal process providing for the 
consultation of the House in the passing of regulations.  In our 
parliamentary system, that includes the other House to some 
degree and that is why the motion refers to it.  You are no 
doubt aware of our opinion about the usefulness of that House, 
and when I say “that House” I mean “the other” House.  It is an 
obstacle we can do without.  We could even save some money. 
However, since they are still there, the motion refers to the 
usual course of legislative process and thus approval by the 
other House of amendments to the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of Parliament should be in agreement with this.  I 
do not know how any member, regardless of political stripe, in 
the government or in opposition, can object to being consulted, 
to having a say and to taking a larger part in the legislative 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must never lose sight of the fact that a member of Parliament 
has a role to play in the legislative process, first and 
foremost.  This is why we were elected, why people sent us here. 
People have expectations.  Who gets the ultimate blame if 
things go wrong?  We do.  So it is only right that we be 
included as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tendency is to always put regulatory powers in the hands of 
the executive, cabinet, in other words, and the tendency must be 
stopped somewhere.  Perhaps right here. 
I have trouble seeing how members, particularly Liberal members, 
could oppose this motion, Motion No. 8, in Group No. 4, in a 
series of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this spirit that my colleague, the member for 
Charlesbourg, introduced his amendment.  He is an expert and 
could have gone into much greater detail about Bill C-3 than I 
have, and he will perhaps have another opportunity to do so 
depending on how debate goes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have tried to do right now is to explain the purpose of 
Motion No. 8 in Group No. 4 and to say that the member for 
Charlesbourg will obviously be able to count on the support of 
all his colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois.  I hope he will also 
be able to count on the support of colleagues in other parties, 
including the member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges, who I am sure will 
give us his support, and other members of the Liberal Party who 
are listening very closely today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore conclude my remarks and hope that members will be 
persuaded by the argument that we should play a greater role as 
lawmakers, and that all parliamentarians will pass this 
amendment, which is Motion No. 8. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what 
a pleasure to see you back in the chair.  I was giving speeches 
on Thursday and there you were.  You had to listen to two.  You 
will probably have to listen to two today. I can see you are 
thrilled with that prospect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating Group No. 4, Motion No. 8 on Bill C-3, the DNA 
bill.  This motion amends clause 12 of the bill. As the bill now 
reads, under clause 12 the governor in council can make 
regulations for carrying out the purposes and provisions of the 
bill but there is no statutory requirement for the regulations to 
be laid before parliament or the appropriate committee for 
review.  We see this as a major problem.  Parliamentarians and 
eventually the joint Standing Committee on Scrutiny of 
Regulations should be able to properly review, comment on and 
correct problems in the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc member wished all parliamentarians would support this 
motion because it would give us more say in the running of 
things.  He will be hoping for that result but I suspect the 
Chrétien lookalikes will end up all standing in their places and 
doing what they have to do.  While I will argue in favour of this 
motion I do not think for a moment that we are going to see 
support for it.  None of the members opposite have stood in 
support.  There is a very large attendance of them today.  They 
are drastically interested in the bill.  I see some laughter from 
the gallery and I think we all know why they are laughing when I 
talk about the large number of Liberals here today to listen to 
the content of the speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had problems with regulations. When they do not go 
before a committee there is a danger there will be some sort of 
flaw in them.  I am a member of the joint Standing Committee on 
Scrutiny of Regulations and I have been on that committee since I 
was first elected in 1993.  I suspect most members would wonder 
what it is all really about and what that committee does. It is 
probably one of the most useful committees on the Hill.  It is 
totally non-partisan in nature.  We look at purely the legality 
and the appropriateness of the regulations that come before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it usually takes a few years before the 
regulations work their way through the system and come to our 
attention.  On the odd occasion when a member of the House or 
some outside person notices some sort of problem in a regulation, 
they can bring that to our attention and we can take a look at it 
to see whether that regulation is ultra vires or whether it is 
appropriate.  I admit that most of the problems we deal with are 
minor in nature.  They tend to be related to translation where 
there could be a different word in French than in English.  They 
may be minor misprints of one type or another. Sometimes they are 
technical in nature or legal in nature and the concerned 
departments will readily agree to alter them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time we strike things that are major in nature. The 
committee presently has the power to make a report to the House 
requesting disallowance of a regulation.  We are very close to 
that situation now in connection with regulations for the 
participation of the police in political activities.  For some 
years the committee has been very concerned about the police 
regulations which in effect make it illegal for a policeman to 
even stand at a shopping centre and gather names on a petition to 
not have a roadway go through his area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how serious those regulations are.  They so restrict 
political participation by police officers even on their own time 
that probably many of the activities of policemen during 
elections municipally, provincially or federally are illegal and 
they do not even realize it.  For example, to wear the button of 
a political party when off duty or to have a sign on their lawn 
is illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a major court case going on now in Quebec where these 
regulations are being challenged.  Even with this, the committee 
has already recognized that this is inappropriate.  We have been 
pressuring the solicitor general to get the law changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is happening right now.  We are having a meeting 
tomorrow.  We believe there will be new regulations drafted that 
meet the requirements for appropriateness.  This is a very 
powerful function that the committee performs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked at the regulations in a totally non-partisan way. 
We have dealt with them.  We have spoken with the solicitor 
general, with the drafters and we are getting those regulations 
replaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of any committee scrutiny or process whereby that 
can occur, all we end up with are ongoing legal battles. 
Eventually they reach some conclusion but it is a lot better for 
the political process to fix these problems promptly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the reasons Reform is very supportive of this 
motion.  The motion is not ideal in that the committees that 
these regulations will go before will probably be pretty much yes 
men and women for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Yes persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Yes persons, as one of the Liberals said. 
Isn't that just the ultimate in political correctness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These yes persons, or the Chrétien lookalikes as I mentioned 
earlier, will each bleat their approval of any of the regulations 
without really considering seriously whether they are appropriate 
or legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least by putting them through the process, eventually they 
will reach the joint Standing Committee on Scrutiny of 
Regulations and could even be brought to our attention earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the regulations go before the justice committee, then at 
least members of the opposition or a member of the public, a 
witness who sees those regulations coming forward and has 
concerns about them, can bring them to the attention of the joint 
Standing Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations.  We can give our 
input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things absolutely essential with regulations is to 
get a regulatory impact statement.  Then there is an obligation 
on the department producing the regulations to also produce a 
regulatory impact statement explaining what impact is expected 
for the regulation to have on the public or on those affected by 
the regulation and it also gives the cost and whether 
alternatives have been pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be other ways of achieving the same result.  Those 
regulatory impact statements are an important part of the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I endorse the motion put forward by the Bloc.  I doubt very much 
that the government will find in its heart to support this very 
good suggestion at the time of the vote but we certainly will.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General

would like to read the motion, with its five points, two of 
which are of greater concern to us.

Quebecois which, for four or five years now, has constantly 
complained about duplication and overlap, I find this amendment 
somewhat strange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for North Vancouver himself mentioned that the House 
already has well established procedures requiring all 
departments to publish proposed regulations ahead of time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Any interested party may comment on a proposed regulation before 
it takes effect. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well established.  As the member for North Vancouver 
alluded to in a non-partisan way and to quote his words, there is 
a process already in place which provides for the prepublication 
and consultation of any regulations implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the government considers this amendment 
unnecessary. I ask all hon. members to vote against the amendment 
since it is not needed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this motion.  This might come 
as some dismay to the hon. member opposite, but I do not share 
that opinion.  This is an important part of the process to have 
embodied in this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It attempts in a substantive way to keep elected officials in 
the legislative loop, to keep them as a part of the process and 
to ensure that arbitrary changes do not occur.  The hon. member 
for Charlesbourg does go about this in an interesting way.  One 
could almost draw from this an inference that the Bloc or the 
hon. member are supportive now of the Senate's being actively 
involved in the review of this type of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill in its present form would not allow those members of 
parliament who are most affected on behalf of their constituents 
in the changing of the legislation to be directly involved.  In 
the current reading of the bill the solicitor general could bring 
about a change arbitrarily.  He could bring about a change 
without going through the normal process of review of looking at 
the legislation and bringing in what might somehow be interpreted 
as damaging to the entire bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do support what the hon. member for Charlesbourg is trying to 
effect in this amendment.  It is something that I think we all 
want to encourage.  We want to encourage consultation and 
participation in the process.  It recognizes as well the 
importance of both houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Draft regulations are fine.  Putting a process in place is fine. 
But what we want to do here at all times is ensure there is 
proper review and consultation.  Parliamentarians are certainly a 
necessity and must be consulted when we are reviewing something 
like this.  Let us not forget that this is arguably one of the 
most important opportunities we in this House have to bring 
forward a piece of legislation to combat serious violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad reality is that the bill in its current form does not go 
far enough.  It does not allow police officers to use this 
legislation to the full extent.  It does not allow them to arm 
themselves with an investigative tool to permit them to combat 
violent crime.  It does not allow them to investigate fully and 
make full use of the technology.  We are not keeping up with the 
rate at which technology is changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also is consistent with the need for transparency and the 
need for responsibility for those who are entrusted with this 
important task of changing legislation to have their say, to have 
the ability to go before committee, to talk to the amendments, to 
flesh out ideas and to call witnesses if necessary.  Therefore 
they can follow the procedure that has been put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members to take a serious look at this 
legislation, including the member opposite.  I encourage them to 
support this type of change.  It would be consistent with the 
stance that his government has taken to encourage openness and 
transparency.  This amendment does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to encourage these types of amendments at this point 
when we are debating them in the House, before they are law, 
before they are put in place hard and fast.  We know when that 
does occur we will have to go back almost to the start.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is then a very complicated process to invoke the change. Time 
is certainly of the essence with this particular bill.  The clock 
is running.  Sadly we know that each day in Canada violent crimes 
are happening.  As we speak, violent crimes are being perpetrated 
across this country. As we speak, police officers are still 
unable to use DNA to the full extent that they could and which 
this bill offers them an opportunity to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all hon. members to partake in this process. Support 
this type of change which will allow members of the justice 
committee, members of the House on behalf of their constituents 
and all Canadians to have in place entrenched in this bill a 
process where they can surely have a voice in any changes that 
may come in the future with respect to DNA legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this is in many ways the beginning of what may be a 
very expansive use of DNA.  This is something we have to keep in 
mind.  The opportunity is before us.  The opportunity is there 
for all members to partake in this, to seize the moment to put 
forward a piece of legislation that is going to empower police 
officers to make the most of this technology. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wholeheartedly support the amendment as proposed by the member 
for Charlesbourg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 12 as written in the bill permits the governor in council 
to make regulations as he sees fit, but we have seen how this 
government operates in this House on the recent hepatitis C 
issue. The Prime Minister decides.  The backbenchers follow 
orders.  A mistake, an injustice occurs and it takes an uprising 
to force the government to re-evaluate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 merely permits some form of parliamentary scrutiny 
over the power to make regulations or laws in this country. After 
all, have all members of parliament not been sent to this place 
to control and make the laws that are to affect their 
constituents back home? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we leave clause 12 as it is presented in the bill, we are 
abrogating our responsibility to oversee, debate and influence. 
We will be leaving it all to be decided by the governor in 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully appreciate how the members opposite leave everything to 
the Prime Minister and the powers within the party, but hopefully 
this will not always be the case. Hopefully, at some time and 
some time soon, all members of parliament will have the power and 
will be able to exercise that power to scrutinize and control the 
legislation and operations of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation must be set up so that when that day occurs, the 
members of this place will have the authority to review 
regulations or laws with respect to DNA identification.  That is 
what democracy is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we ever want to leave the control of this place in the 
hands of a select few?  Do we all not receive the same mandate to 
represent our constituencies, to ensure our laws are fair and 
just to all of us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been previously stated, Bill C-68 which introduced the 
firearms act has an identical scheme of review as proposed by 
Motion No. 8.  Surely we should be consistent by providing a 
similar scheme here as well.  I urge all members to support this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before resuming debate, it is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows:  the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington, Children; the 
hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, Health; the hon. member 
for Mercier, Employment insurance fund. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak to the amendment to Bill C-3 proposed by the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg. I stand in the House today on behalf of 
the New Democratic Party indicating our support for the amendment 
put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who will read <I>Hansard</I> or who may be listening to 
the debate today and who sometimes think of this House as one 
where there is no serious debate and no cohesion and no 
understanding of the principles of legislation, it is interesting 
to note that on both this amendment and the prior amendment, 
members of the New Democratic Party are supporting a motion put 
forward by the Bloc, supported by members of the Reform Party and 
by members of the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a most serious bill such as this Bill C-3, it is important 
that we be open to changes to the legislation that will make it 
better. 
The motion put forward by my justice committee colleague, the 
Bloc Quebecois member, indicates that any regulations that make 
significant changes to this bill be brought before the House for 
debate and for review and be referred, and I think this is 
particularly important, to the appropriate standing committee for 
review.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The public should know that at the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights and other standing committees of this House we 
examine pieces of legislation.  We call witnesses before the 
committee to understand the impact and the implications of 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scope of this legislation is so far reaching.  The 
methodology of obtaining DNA samples and the whole area of DNA 
are so new that there are provisions within the legislation 
itself to bring it back before the House for review. That is 
something which is telling because this is complex legislation. I 
think all members of this House are dealing with it in an intense 
way and in the best way they can, however there are provisions to 
bring this legislation back to the House for review to make sure 
that we can correct any defects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposes to bring back before this House important 
regulations so we can continue to monitor the effectiveness of 
the legislation as we move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in support of it and indicate to the House that the NDP 
will be supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, prior to resuming

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate people coming in to listen to these important 
speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Conservative Party and my colleague from 
the NDP made some excellent points as to why we should support 
Motion No. 8. My fellow colleagues from the Reform Party did 
likewise. It is important that members hear the arguments as to 
why we should and should not do something in the House. It would 
be different if they paid close attention and started listening 
to what these individuals finish saying and why we should support 
these things. We would be a lot better off in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here likewise to support Group No. 4, Motion No. 8.  The 
motion amends clause 12 of Bill C-3 regarding regulations. Clause 
12 now reads that the “governor in council may make regulations 
for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this act”. 
There is no statutory requirement for the regulations to be laid 
before parliament or the appropriate committee for review. This 
amendment will ensure that members of parliament are provided the 
opportunity to review the regulations made by the governor in 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68, the firearms legislation, has an identical section as 
the one proposed in this particular amendment.  Although we 
support this amendment, given the need for the regulations to be 
scrutinized by the appropriate committee, we know from experience 
with Bill C-68 last November and in February 1997 that the 
committee just goes through the motions. All Reform amendments to 
these regulations were defeated by the Liberal members of the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amazes me that they feel that these regulations do not have 
to be scrutinized by parliament.  I want to repeat that. I am 
amazed that there are people here who represent Canadians and who 
feel that regulations of this nature do not have to be 
scrutinized by parliament.  What are members of parliament sent 
here for if it is not for something like that and particularly 
that, to scrutinize the regulations in the bills that are 
presented before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has become such a dictatorship that it feels it 
can usurp parliament and its function.  How can a law be enacted 
that will not be monitored?  It is an absolute shame that time 
and time again all we do is go through the motions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A majority of members in the House of Commons, mainly on the 
government side, go through the motions.  They just do not pay 
attention and do not care.  Whatever the lead sheep tells them to 
do they will jump up, bow down and do as they are told.  That is 
not the way it ought to be but unfortunately it is.  Maybe it is 
party politics or dedication to a leader: whatever I say you 
shall do.  When will they rise to their feet when they have the 
opportunity to represent the voice of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA bill is one of the greatest things that could be 
available to our police departments to provide the kind of 
protection society needs, deserves and wants.  However they will 
not support an amendment that states we should scrutinize these 
regulations and monitor them as elected people.  According to 
that side of the House we do not have to do that.  We simply take 
the orders in council and whatever they say we shall do. That 
should come to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on that side of the House who cannot support a motion 
that states the people of the country would be far better 
represented by doing those kinds of things needs to take a good 
long look at themselves and ask why they are here.  Is it for 
themselves?  Is it for the party they represent or is it for the 
Canadian people?  If it is not the Canadian people they should 
resign and go home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask them to support Motion No. 8. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise to speak to the amendment before us. It may be 
the most important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation needs to come to the House to be scrutinized by 
the people who were elected to represent the people of Canada. We 
have already seen this done in Bill C-68, the gun registration 
bill, and it needs to be done here.  We were elected to come here 
to represent the people of Canada.  We are not here to take what 
the House wants back to them.  That has been the problem with 
governments since time began. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to review the legislation.  As representatives of the 
people of Canada we want to have a look at it.  That is what this 
opportunity is for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the Bloc amendment for its openness and transparency. 
That is what we need more of in the country and the amendment 
will start the process of going down that road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA act, Bill C-3, is very important to the people of 
Canada, the population in general.  We are here to represent 
those people.  We should be the ones who review the legislation, 
not a governor in council order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why we have to stand to debate this type of 
legislation.  Why is it that members elected by the people of 
Canada to represent them do not get a chance to look at it and 
that it comes through the governor in council? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the DNA bill is in place it will be a tool that will change 
the way crime fighting is done in the country.  It will help to 
put some sense back into our system.  It will not allow criminals 
to hide behind any legality.  Once the profile is in place it can 
be used whenever a crime is committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing us to debate the bill in the House and in committee and 
to bring it to our constituents to get their feelings on it is 
the only way we should proceed.

is a strange day when all opposition parties support the same 
amendment, but this is one of those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of public scrutiny or scrutiny by the House 
cannot be overemphasized.  We cannot have bills or rules coming 
forth to govern bills that have not had the blessing of the 
people of Canada.  That is what we are here to do and that is why 
we are supporting the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not precedent setting.  It has already been done with Bill 
C-68, which helps to move us along that way. I wanted to add my

suspected or charged with a primary designated offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not provide authority for the police to take a DNA 
sample from anyone who is under arrest or from anyone who has 
been charged.  We understand the procedure for taking a sample 
granted under Bill C-104 which has been operative for some time 
now. However that requires evidence of a DNA sample at the scene, 
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an individual is 
responsible for leaving that DNA at the scene, and then a judge's 
warrant authorizing the taking of a sample from the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very cumbersome.  The witnesses who appeared before our 
standing committee, particularly the crown prosecutors and 
witnesses representing the Canadian Police Association and the 
chiefs of police, stated very clearly that if the bill were 
amended to allow them to take DNA samples at the time a person is 
charged it could save lives.  It could identify individuals who 
have left their DNA at the scenes of rapes, murders, assaults and 
other primary offence scenes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard that there are literally hundreds, if not 
thousands, of unsolved crimes of murders, rapes, serious 
assaults, manslaughter cases or so on where DNA samples have been 
left at the scene.  Individuals who have committed those offences 
have been undetected.  The police want a mechanism whereby when a 
person commits one of the primary designated offences the police 
can take a sample of DNA from the individual.  This was rejected 
at clause by clause consideration of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have introduced in Motion No. 10 a somewhat watered down 
version but still a very important part of the bill that would 
allow police to take a DNA sample from anyone charged with a 
primary designated offence who has been convicted of a previous 
primary designated offence.  They could take the sample, hold it 
and not have it analysed until after conviction or after the 
individual has failed to appear in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the individual runs and does not appear in court, an analysis 
can be conducted to determine whether or not the person is 
responsible or at least left any of his or her DNA at the scene 
of unsolved crimes.  This is extremely important because on a 
yearly basis I understand from the testimony we heard before the 
committee some 60,000 individuals do not respond to 
reconnaissance or to bail.  They simply skip and do not appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern is that if we have to wait until after conviction 
before the sample is taken it means for the individual on bail, 
knowing full well if he is convicted of the offence for which he 
is charged, that the DNA sample taken from him may link him to a 
more serious offence or at least another offence where he has 
left his DNA at the scene.  The individual simply may disappear 
and never honour the reconnaissance or honour the bail he has 
been granted.  Therefore it will be a frustration for police.  We 
have been told by police witnesses that this bill of all bills 
could begin to save lives immediately.  That is why it is so 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from the government side that this would not be 
constitutional.  It would not survive a constitutional challenge 
based upon privacy and based upon the intrusivity of taking a DNA 
sample at the time of a charge without the authority of a 
warrant. 
The Canadian Police Association provided us with a legal opinion 
that refuted that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A testimony submitted by Mr. Scott Newark, director of the 
Canadian Police Association, stated very clearly that they were 
willing to pay the cost of a reference to the Supreme Court of 
Canada before this bill goes forward any further to determine 
whether the government's hesitancy and timidity in this area is 
grounded, to determine whether the legal opinion submitted before 
the court would be acceptable and that these tests could be taken 
at the time of arrest or at the time of charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has refused this.  After the fact it obtained 
three legal opinions.  I suspect the government went shopping for 
legal opinions.  It has now submitted legal opinions to members 
of the committee and members of the House in support of its 
viewpoint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now members can look at four legal opinions, three saying it 
would not be constitutional and one saying it would be 
constitutional.  We never had an opportunity to question the 
retired justices on their deliberations, considerations, 
recommendations and conclusions.  We never had an opportunity to 
have constitutional experts testify before the committee as to 
the veracity of the conclusions that are now part of the record. 
This is very unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These legal opinions should have been placed before the 
committee at the time the bill entered committee.  We would have 
been able to examine them carefully. We would have had the time 
to look at the opinions and perhaps obtain other legal opinions 
from those with a different viewpoint on the constitutionality of 
taking samples from the accused at the time of arrest or charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police have the authority to take breath samples.  They have 
the authority to take blood samples in cases of suspected 
impaired driving.  What is the difference?  If they can take one 
bodily sample already and the authority exists under the Criminal 
Code to do so, what in the world is wrong with doing it under the 
auspices of this bill?  Why not allow the police to take a DNA 
sample from an individual who has been charged with a designated 
offence and who has one previous conviction to show that person 
is a repeat offender in this area?  What is wrong with taking a 
sample and holding that sample until the individual has been 
convicted or fails to appear in court before it is analysed and 
placed in the bank?  Once it is in the bank it can be compared 
with the samples and the profiles of other DNA left at the scenes 
of rapes, murders, serious assaults and manslaughters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members to carefully examine this motion.  We 
think it is a balanced motion that draws a healthy balance 
between the concerns expressed by the justice officials and the 
requests and demands of police officers across this country and 
others in law enforcement.  I urge all hon. members to give this 
motion their support when the vote comes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a privilege to rise in the House to speak on this legislation. 
I have been privileged to sit on the justice committee 
throughout the deliberations and to examine the legislation as it 
has made its way through the committee stage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do support the bill.  It is an excellent piece of legislation. 
I also support my friend's motion which I consider to be a point 
of philosophical divergence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three points at which a DNA sample could be taken, 
point of arrest, point of charge, point of conviction.  The 
purpose of this legislation is to give the police access to DNA 
profiles for the purposes of identifying individuals so they can 
be linked or not linked as the case may be to crime scenes.  It 
is not conclusive proof but taken with other evidence adds to the 
weight of evidence against an accused.  It also works the other 
way to eliminate suspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told at committee stage that a properly gathered sample 
creates a 1 in 94 billion probability sample. Notwithstanding 
this high level probability, it is not in and of itself 
conclusive as to the issue of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The crown would still have to adduce evidence beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence charged.  Defence 
counsel will still attack reliability, credibility, means of 
gathering the sample, the integrity of the sample, the errors in 
collection, et cetera.  Nevertheless, it is of significant use to 
police investigation.  Canadians have only to witness the Morin 
inquiry to understand the powerful input of DNA evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is such a great tool, then why can the Parliament of 
Canada not make it readily available to the police?  What could 
be the possible justification for withholding a tool that is 
readily accessible, surrounded by safeguards for abuse and would 
be of great assistance in solving outstanding crimes?  The issues 
revolve around the point at which the sample is taken and the 
means by which the sample is taken.  There are three points at 
which a sample of blood, hair or saliva could be taken, at 
arrest, charge or conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not seriously argued before us that samples should be 
taken a point of arrest.  This would simply create a fishing 
expedition on the part of the police and imperil the liberty of 
the citizen.  The argument came down to a choice between point of 
charge and point of conviction.  If truth were known many if not 
all members of the committee would have been content with a 
charge regime.  To lay the charge the police must have reasonable 
and probable grounds that a crime has been committed.  At that 
time, as a matter of routine, fingerprints and mugshots are 
taken; similarly, so could DNA samples.  The police want to be 
able to take DNA samples at that point and enter the results in a 
DNA bank for cross-reference purposes and for identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology has become so advanced that the taking of a 
sample is minimally intrusive.  Logically if the taking of DNA 
samples is less intrusive than fingerprinting why should the 
justice system be deprived of that tool?  If it is 
constitutionally okay to take a fingerprint and a mugshot, why is 
it not constitutionally okay to take DNA? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is where legal theory becomes so arcane and obscure as to 
lose even the most diligent of students.  The core of the 
argument is that the state is absolutely prohibited from 
intruding on the sanctity of the person without consent.  The 
person has an absolute right to the integrity of his or her 
personhood.  Therefore the taking of a cell by any means, however 
intrusive or non-intrusive, is a breach of that person's privacy. 
The state is absolutely forbidden from doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the depth and range of material revealed by DNA 
samples provides to the state a marker of that individual which 
is not only a complete profile but could be used for other 
purposes.  In other words, the legal wall between the person and 
the state has been breached and the state knows far more about 
that individual than it has any right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument is of dubious merit for two reasons.  The first is 
the fear of using the profile for purposes other than 
identification.  I believe the committee was not concerned about 
that issue as the procedures and safeguards were such a series of 
Chinese walls that it would be virtually impossible to breach 
those walls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is the issue of invading the privacy of a person. The 
charter gives protection to the undue invasion of privacy. 
However, it can be statutorily sanctioned as it is with 
fingerprinting.  If one can invade privacy by statute on 
fingerprinting, one can also surely do it by DNA sample 
simultaneously. We are after all legislators and our business is 
that of creating law.  If statute sanctions fingerprinting as not 
unduly invasive, why cannot DNA sampling by statute, such as this 
this bill, also be considered to be not unduly invasive?  Nice 
question with no neat answer. 
The advice of justice lawyers was that if we move the sample from 
point of conviction down to point of charge the bill would not 
withstand a charter challenge.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in and around law for about 28 years and consider 
the views of justice lawyers to be excellent.  When you retain 
lawyers you do not stand up and contradict them easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the matter came to a clause by clause stage the minister 
and his lawyers from the justice department were quite adamant 
that the charge regime would not survive a charter challenge.  To 
their credit, their arguments were strong.  If we go to a charge 
regime the bill would not survive a charter challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One week after the bill was taken back to the House justice 
lawyers were quoted, however, in the front pages of <I>The Globe 
and Mail</I> as saying every time they go to the supreme court 
they do not have a clue what will happen.  Flip a coin.  The 
supreme court is adrift in a sea of confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The additions of Justices Binnie and Bastarach do not help in 
predicting the outcome.  When this was brought to the attention 
of the justice minister she stated in committee that she was 
obtaining three more outside opinions from retired justices.  To 
no one's great surprise, the opinions support the government's 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resembles the theatre of the absurd.  The Parliament of 
Canada stands on the sidelines while justice lawyers and their 
surrogates argue out a position based on established precedent; 
hardly the point.  The motion says in effect we have read your 
opinions, we have heard your arguments and we are not persuaded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there are adequate safeguards to protect privacy and 
sanctity of the person and that search and seizure is warranted 
in this instance.  The tabling of the opinions could amount to 
the subtle use of a notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has a huge hole in it.  If Paul Bernardo were sitting 
in a police station this morning charged with a sexual offence he 
would not be DNA banked until he was convicted and if not 
convicted he would never be banked.  The police could say to 
themselves with legitimacy they do not have the resources to do 
this.  He is a blond, blue eyed boy with a job and a home in 
beautiful downtown Guildwood,  which happens to be my riding. 
They could also state they have a lot more pressing problems than 
to get a justice warrant.  The police in Fredericton who are 
conducting other investigations would never know about it.  Nor 
would the police in Edmonton. So this is quite a large gap in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may have detected a bit of skepticism on my part with 
respect to the efficacy of the bill but I am ultimately persuaded 
that the good qualities in the bill might be lost to charter 
challenge.  However, I do support this motion and I do wish that 
the government had exercised a more subtle approach in excising 
out a charge regime be it on one conviction or on two convictions 
so that the bill could have a charter challenge at the point 
where we could try to advance the law in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my final point, the doctrine of supremacy of 
parliament.  I was greatly intrigued by the comments of Mr. 
Justice Cory in the Brin decision.  He said that courts use the 
charter to dialogue with the legislature.  Dialogue as 
experienced by this legislator is more like a monologue.  We 
speak, you listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Courts develop legal theory, charter theory about trees and 
branches and living documents to arrive at conclusions which look 
suspiciously like ex post facto reasoning, you legislators sit 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in and around the justice system in Ontario for 
quite a number of years and consider it to be one of the finest 
in the world.  Ultimately, however, it is a very crude means of 
resolving disputes.  Lawsuits have winners and losers, unevenly 
resourced litigants and narrow views of relevance materiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation such as this is a product of years of analysis, 
drafting, study and witnesses.  The committee spent months 
looking at this legislation and it went through an extensive 
consultation process prior to being introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the committee represent in excess of one million 
people who come from a variety of backgrounds, both philosophical 
and political.  I would argue with little fear of contradiction 
that if we as a committee had our choice absent charter arguments 
that we would be presenting a regime based on charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view judicial attitudes are not consistent with Canadian 
values on this issue and judges need to know that after extensive 
debate and analysis parliamentarians are only presenting this 
bill due to limited and narrow thinking by judicial activists.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my hat goes off to the previous speaker.  I think he 
gave a very compelling address to this parliament.  I have the 
greatest respect for him, his legal background and his input on 
the justice committee.  He obviously has substantial experience 
which is of benefit to us at that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us, in the form of amendments, Motions Nos. 10 
and 11.  This is perhaps our last chance to right a potential 
wrong because we are not going to have the opportunity to do it 
again for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the hon. member for Crowfoot is aimed 
specifically at allowing for the collection of DNA evidence at 
the time of charge.  It has an additional safeguard, which was 
put in I suggest as a compromise to entice members of the 
government to take a second look at this amendment.  This 
amendment would allow a person who has previously been convicted 
of a schedule of offences that have been deemed heinous enough or 
serious enough to suggest that therefore the prevention element 
should take precedence over that particular convicted person's 
right to be free from this intrusive taking of a DNA sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to that issue of intrusiveness later in my remarks, 
but the important point to be made here is that what we are 
talking about is the taking of a DNA sample which would allow for 
the prevention of the further commission of an offence, 
potentially, because the police with the DNA in their possession 
at that point in time could then take that sample and match it 
with crime scene samples that are connected to outstanding 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Figures were discussed at the justice committee.  In the province 
of British Columbia alone there are 600 unsolved murders.  If we 
calculate that in terms of the population across the country, in 
terms of sexual assaults, serious assaults and unsolved crimes, 
what greater benefit could there be than for the use of such an 
innovative police investigative tool to address and solve these 
crimes?  We should keep in mind that the perpetrators of these 
crimes are still out there.  They have not been caught. They are 
not accountable.  They have not been brought to justice.  They are 
ready, I would suggest, to do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would allow the police to make that match, to 
make that connection, to go out there armed with that evidence 
and hopefully complete an investigation that might prevent the 
perpetration of another crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the greatest respect for the hon. member who spoke 
previously.  He has a great deal of confidence in the justice 
lawyers.  I do not share the same degree of confidence.  We have 
seen in the past that the Department of Justice has gone outside 
of its own lawyers' cadre to get a practising lawyer to represent 
the government in court.  We have seen that in the current 
firearms challenge in Alberta.  Similarly what we saw here was an 
opinion at the eleventh hour from three very respected jurists. 
There is no question they are very respected, but I would suggest 
that the question that was put to them was put to them in very 
narrow terms, coupled with the fact that we already knew the 
position of the government.  Mr. Speaker, you will have to excuse 
my scepticism on the response that we received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is of course not the only opinion that the justice 
committee had the benefit of.  We had the benefit of a similarly 
respected and decorated criminal lawyer, Mr. Danson, who gave the 
opinion in a very straightforward way that in fact the sampling 
at the time of charge, and that is without this added designation 
of having a previous conviction, would withstand a charter 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I embrace some of the comments with respect to the supremacy of 
this parliament and the responsibility that we have here to make 
laws in the area of criminal law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarks of the hon. member I think reflect, in many ways, 
the opinions of a lot of the non-partisanship that must go into 
the criminal field.  The members of the committee voiced very 
similar opinions regarding the fact that we are being supreme 
court driven.  That is a dangerous area in which to find 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal law, first and foremost, has to be accountable and 
responsible to the people.  The people have elected members of 
parliament.  They have entrusted them and placed in them their 
hope and desire that we will make laws which reflect the 
protection of the public and the accountability we must find in 
our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a supreme court paranoia or a supreme court 
constipation about criminal law it is a very dangerous position 
to be in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member gave the very apt example of Paul Bernardo.  He 
said that under the current legislation we would not be able to 
use his DNA in future investigations.  The very premise of this 
motion is that we should be taking a very proactive as opposed to 
reactive role in the use of DNA in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important example made and emphasized by the Canadian Police 
Association was that an individual taken into custody for a 
designated offence, who was previously charged and convicted of a 
designated offence, has the benefit of due process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the police cannot take a DNA sample and use it in the course 
of a trial, use it as a sample against other outstanding, 
unsolved offences, it is a lost opportunity.  It will slip 
through our fingers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association emphasized the fact—and there 
are statistics to support this position—that individuals who are 
released on bail are simply not going to return.  If criminals 
have in the back of their minds that if they return and are 
convicted of an offence they must face the possibility that they 
will have their DNA matched with a crime they knew they committed 
in another part of the country, they will not return for trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are certainly not going to return if they are charged with 
a break and enter offence and they know they were involved in an 
offence of a much more serious personal nature, such as murder or 
sexual assault.  If that opportunity is lost because of the way 
the current legislation is drafted it would be an absolute 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, in a very straightforward way, would address that. 
It would allow police to use DNA to a much greater degree.  That 
is the intention here.  There is no hidden agenda.  I would 
suggest that this motion is put forward in a very constructive, 
straightforward and practical way.  I am surprised there is not 
more support for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Luckily we will have the opportunity to vote.  I am still 
holding out hope and optimism that common sense will prevail and 
we will find that this amendment will be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safeguards we have in place in the rest of the bill, that is 
to say, the provisions that would make it criminal if a person 
was to misuse the DNA technology, I suggest would protect 
individual rights.  They would protect individuals from the fear 
of misuse; the Orwellian thought that somehow, some way, a person 
might misuse this DNA and therefore create a miscarriage of 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot succumb to that fear, given the public interest and 
the importance of optimizing the use of DNA technology.  It will 
happen.  Mark my words.  If Canada does not seize the opportunity 
to be on the cutting edge, to be a country prepared to move 
forward, making the most of this DNA legislation, we will be left 
behind. 
Other countries will be looking at our country, shaking their 
heads and saying “Why didn't they do it when they had the 
opportunity?”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this particular amendment.  It 
is one of a number of amendments that have been proposed to this 
bill governing the establishment of a DNA databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the amendment that is proposed at 
this point is directed at a mechanism which would take a DNA 
sample, analyze it for a DNA profile and put it into a DNA 
databank where it would, for practical purposes, be stored and 
kept indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other ways in which the state can obtain a DNA sample 
and do an analysis.  It can do it by warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this particular motion, it is the desire of the 
mover and those supporting it to see a DNA sample taken when an 
individual is charged with a serious offence, the individual 
having been previously convicted of a serious offence, perhaps 
even a related offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to keep that in mind.  Just because one would 
not be able to take a sample at the point of charge does not mean 
the state could not move by warrant to obtain a sample from the 
individual at the time of charge for the purposes of 
investigating the offence at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the sample being taken, as proposed under this 
amendment, is not for the purpose of investigating the offence at 
hand, it is for the purpose of obtaining a DNA profile of the 
individual and putting it into the DNA databank for future 
reference and for the protection of society that would come from 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  No, it could be used for both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  The member points out that it could be 
used for both.  I accept that the amendment is proposing that it 
be used for both.  However, I am not so sure the amendment is 
drafted in a way that I would accept is suited to both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, I wanted to take note of the reasons that some 
members of the House, including myself, view this amendment as 
having some potential difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Scarborough East and other members 
that if I were king I would implement a measure which would allow 
a sample to be taken at the time of charge, such as is proposed 
by this amendment. However, there are several areas of 
difficulty.  I want to put them on the record because I never 
want it to be said that the reason the House did not adopt this, 
and the reason the committee that studied the bill did not adopt 
a similar type of amendment, was because we knew it would not be 
legally acceptable.  I would not want that to be taken from the 
procedure here today, or previously, or from what may evolve in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in the next while there will be a procedure which 
will allow DNA data to be taken at the time of charge in 
appropriate circumstances and not just when one is investigating 
the particular case at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons the government is sensitive to this are based on a 
series of charter decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each case we have a snapshot, a photograph, a freeze frame 
decision by the supreme court about a particular aspect of our 
civil rights, about a particular perspective on our charter 
rights.  When we add up all the snapshots the court, as it is 
supposed to do, cautioned the state about certain aspects of the 
freedoms of Canadians.  By the time they are all added up, which 
is what the justice department did, we have a significant body of 
caution directed at actions of the state which would remove a 
sample from an individual's body.  In order to do that in our 
society the state has to have justification.  That is a search 
and seizure. There must be a reasonable ground to do it.  There 
has to be a reasonable basis even to do it under a warrant.  One 
may be able to construct a reasonable justification for doing it 
at charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One threshold, one snapshot provided us by the supreme court of 
which we take note is the view that taking something from the 
human body is actually quite an intrusive act.  In the case of 
DNA data sampling now it can be a rough of some of the skin, a 
swab from the inside of the mouth or a hair taken from the head. 
In each case it involves the taking from the body of something 
that is a part of the body.  The court has defined and construed 
that as quite intrusive, and I accept that at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that under warrant or under reasonable circumstances 
in other parts of the Criminal Code peace officers or other 
authorized persons can take breath samples, blood samples with a 
warrant, and DNA samples with a warrant.  We must remember that 
this amendment deals with taking a DNA sample for profile at the 
time a person is innocent of the charge because he or she has not 
yet been convicted.  At that point in time is when this amendment 
would cause the sample to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty clear to most of us who sat on the justice 
committee that within a few months or a few years the obtaining 
of a sample of DNA will be obtainable technologically by much 
less than taking something from the body.  Technology involving a 
scan, a brush by, something very much less intrusive than the 
taking of a piece of the body however minute it might be such as 
a hair follicle or hair root, does not exist right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That snapshot of the intrusiveness of DNA sampling was a caution 
light which has caused, at least in part, justice officials, the 
government and some of us in the House to accept that it is an 
area of caution.  In my view it is an area of caution that we 
will be able to dispense with in the future because the 
intrusiveness of the sample taking will be much less than it is 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have mentioned the Bernardo case.  That is either an 
easy case or a difficult case depending on how we look at it.  If 
we had had good effective DNA sampling at that time history might 
well have turned out differently.  I wish we could have done it. 
Maybe in the future with the new technology we will be able to 
make these kinds of changes and come out with better outcomes in 
the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flip side of the Bernardo scenario, because if the Bernardo 
case is easy there is another case that is harder, is simply the 
case where a Canadian who is innocent of the offence charged has 
a criminal record and is under this amendment asked or required 
to give up a small piece of his or her body so that the state may 
analyse and put it in a databank for public safety purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point because of the relative intrusiveness of it I 
believe there was a developing consensus in the Department of 
Justice that we would be reasonably well served by proceeding to 
construct a databank, a process, get the thing up and running, 
have it begin to work for Canadians, get the bugs out of it, 
ensure it is charter safe and make it work for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be disappointed as a parliamentarian if within the next 
two to four years we were unable to increase the frequency or 
amount of data sampling available under the Criminal Code perhaps 
in a manner that is suggested by this amendment today.  Were we 
able to do that I think it would enhance the safety of all 
Canadians in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be supporting both of the motions known as Group No. 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Motion No. 10 the member for Crowfoot appears to be taking 
the biblical role of Solomon.  We have heard much comment on the 
need of our police to take DNA samples at the time of arrest.  We 
have heard much comment concerning the invasion of privacy and 
the constitutional rights of the accused.  This amendment 
proposes to take DNA samples at the time of charge but they will 
not be analysed until the time of conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would satisfy our police who have been concerned about 
offenders skipping out through the loopholes presented by Bill 
C-3 without such an amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee review the government cited finances as a 
primary reason for not taking and analysing samples at the time 
of charge.  I will not comment on the government's concern over 
finances as compared to the safety of its citizens because I do 
not need to do so under these circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion gets around the financial question in that the 
expense only occurs once a conviction is registered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been much discussion over the constitutionality 
of taking DNA samples from those charged.  This amendment limits 
the application to only those charged with a designated offence 
and those who have previously been convicted of a designated 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament will be indicating to our courts that we see a public 
policy requirement to treat these types of individuals in a much 
stricter fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 permits the taking of DNA samples from 
incarcerated offenders who have been convicted of a designated 
offence and are serving sentences of two years or more for 
another designated offence.  This amendment broadens the scope of 
Bill C-3 in that it is not just limited to the offence of murder. 
The amendment will do much for victims.  It will solve and put 
closure to many unsolved cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should only incarcerated murderers and sexual offenders be 
subject to DNA sampling?  For example, if someone has been 
convicted of manslaughter and is serving a sentence of two or 
more years for another conviction of manslaughter, should we not 
be taking DNA to determine what other serious crimes they may 
have committed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the victims of these other crimes not be informed that 
the offender has been discovered through the comparison of DNA 
from the sample taken with the DNA profile in the crime scene 
index?  In that way the victim can put some sort of closure on 
the matter and have some peace of mind that the offender is 
securely incarcerated and not apt to attack again in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That concludes my comments.  I urge my colleagues in this place 
to support this important amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking 
the member for Scarborough—Rouge River and the member for 
Scarborough East who have worked with me over the past several 
months to try, after I believe three attempts, to come up with a 
modification to the amendment ourselves but were unable to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 10 and 11 are essentially the crux of the 
legislation and the most contentious.  Motions Nos. 10 and 11 
would do two things.  First, they would allow a police officer to 
take DNA samples for the DNA databank from a person charged with 
a designated offence who has a previous conviction for a 
designated offence.  Second, they would expand the retroactive 
scheme of the bill to capture offenders serving a penitentiary 
sentence for one of those offences previously designated offence 
convictions.  Both proposals, in my opinion and in the 
government's opinion, pose a very serious charter risk as has 
been debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the timing of taking samples, I would also like 
to point out to hon. members that the Criminal Code already has a 
provision which allows police to take samples at any time from a 
person they suspect of having committed a serious offence, with 
one proviso, as long as they first obtain a warrant.  That 
provision is in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights considered 
many of the proposals and amendments that are being debated 
today.  To allow the police to take samples of the DNA at time of 
charge was rejected at that committee. 
Another recommendation was to expand the retroactive scheme. To 
that end some changes were implemented by the committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from expert witnesses.  The members for Crowfoot 
and Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough referred to various opinions. 
I point out for the benefit of the House, as committee members 
will remember, that officials from the Department of Justice gave 
us opinions on the charter challenge possibilities.  We also 
heard officials from the ministries of justice and the attorney 
general of Ontario and the solicitor general of Ontario as well 
as officials from New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have claimed that they did not have ample time to 
question these officials.  On the contrary, all these people 
testified before the committee on justice.  Members had plenty of 
time to ask all their questions.  They may not always have liked 
the answers or the opinions but they did have time to consult 
them.  It was only after the justice committee presented its 
report to the Minister of Justice and the Solicitor General of 
Canada that the opinions of three highly respected judges were 
sought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the Reform Party and the chiefs of police decided 
they would exploit this stance on the part of the government and 
do everything in their power to make sure the government 
listened.  For the second time in my political career I will be 
subjected to another billboard campaign.  Again, for the second 
time in my career, I will explain to the citizens of my 
constituency who I am confident will understand that the federal 
government has acted with a very balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will respond to the member for Crowfoot because he quoted 
extensively from the comments of Mr. Newark who suggested that we 
had asked the wrong question of the three former justices.  In 
actual fact the three former justices were asked to provide an 
appreciation of the risk of a successful charter challenge 
pertaining to the taking of DNA samples at the time of charge 
without prior judicial authorization.  They were asked whether 
the legislation would likely be found to offend one or other 
charter provisions.  They were also asked if it could be saved 
under section 1 of the charter.  It seems to me those questions 
were very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association is now advocating the creation 
of a new police power to take bodily samples from an accused 
person who has previously been convicted of a designated offence 
simply on the basis of a police officer's belief that the person 
has committed another designated offence, without first going 
before a judge to seek the authority to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The claim that the judiciary of Canada impinges on the powers of 
parliament is not justified in fact or in law.  The courts 
perform their constitutional responsibility in reviewing the 
legislation to ensure the constitutional requirements are 
respected and to supervise the actions of the police in the 
enforcement of the criminal law and in the collection of 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 reflects clear statements from our highest court that 
the invasive nature of bodily searches which are an interference 
with bodily integrity and undermine human dignity demands high 
standards of justification.  Taking a sample on the off chance 
that a sample might link a suspect to another offence and the 
mere speculation that the accused may abscond do not meet these 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of recidivism must be respected especially with 
retroactive sampling.  The notion of recidivism can be used for 
the purpose of justifying to some extent the retroactive scheme. 
However, where used, the taking of samples for crimes committed 
before the coming into force of the bill is always on the basis 
of prior judicial authorization.  Possible recidivism is not a 
justification for excluding judicial supervision prior to the 
taking of the sample.  On the basis of the authorities it is of 
fundamental importance that the seizure of bodily substances be 
judicially approved before it takes place.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where there is an elevated risk of recidivism such as with 
dangerous offenders, repeat sex offenders and serial killers, the 
need for special measures to protect the public is justified.  To 
go further and take DNA samples from individuals who pose a low 
risk of recidivism or may not even be suspected of having 
committed another offence would place the constitutionality of 
the scheme in serious jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to state that in Motion No. 10 there seemed to 
be very little justification for taking the sample at the time of 
the charge because according to the motion it would only be 
analysed once the conviction were to take place.  The rationale 
for taking the sample would seem to be one for mere 
administrative convenience as opposed to what some members have 
been speaking on, to solve outstanding crimes.  It is my 
understanding that the sample would be taken and only when the 
person is convicted would it be analysed.  Therefore I do not see 
how outstanding crimes would be solved unless the person was 
convicted.  It is likely that a rationale of administrative 
convenience would not meet the court test of the highest 
standards of justification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the consequences if this motion were adopted. 
Let us say we did support the motion.  It is virtually guaranteed 
that notwithstanding the opinions we have had here, if we did 
approve the motion the challenge to the constitutionality of this 
provision would ultimately be heard by the Supreme Court of 
Canada.  Most members have spoken to that end.  The difference 
between our approach and their approach is they are willing to 
let it go to the supreme court.  Such a final hearing on the 
contrary would take several years.  During that time the police 
would take samples and subsequently have them analysed and if 
consequential amendments were made would have the results placed 
in the convicted offenders index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the supreme court were ultimately to determine that the 
provision was contrary to the charter and could not be saved 
under section 1, it would logically follow that all samples taken 
pursuant to the provisions would be found to be illegal seizures. 
The major consequence of such a finding would be that the 
evidence resulting from such seizures would be found inadmissible 
in court also.  This would mean that many individuals would have 
been wrongfully convicted.  As well numerous prosecutions would 
have to be halted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the profiles in the convicted offenders index of the 
people whose samples were taken pursuant to this provision would 
have to be removed from the data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally if the government were to adopt this motion 
notwithstanding that it has received overwhelming advice from the 
Department of Justice and eminent private sector counsel that it 
would be found to be contrary to the charter, such a fact could 
make the provision even less defensible in the eyes of the 
Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I have given various reasons why we cannot support 
the motion.  Members have mentioned that we should try to take 
into account the examples of Bernardo and Clifford Olson.  I 
believe that laws should be made for the benefit of all Canadians 
and not to circumvent or to try to trap one particular 
individual. We had that experience in the section 745 hearings 
when the Bloc Quebecois members voted against that provision and 
allowed Clifford Olson to have a hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we try to enact all legislation in that respect we will never 
get anywhere.  I believe that the government has come up with a 
very balanced approach which I ask all hon. members to approve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak to Motion No. 10 and Motion No. 11 in Group No. 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin with Motion No. 11 because it is the less complex of the 
two.  I indicate that I would speak in favour of Motion No. 11. 
It broadens and expands the provisions for the taking of DNA. The 
current legislation provides that a “provincial court judge may 
on an ex parte application take from a person who has been 
convicted of murder”.  The motion broadens that and I would 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to Motion No. 10 which as the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Solicitor General has indicated is a more complex and 
difficult piece to analyse.  I commend the hon. member for 
Crowfoot for bringing the amendment forward. From sitting on the 
justice committee with him, I know it is one which he struggled 
with. He has attempted to meet the criteria as set out in the 
objections that were raised to it. 
That being said, let us ask exactly what this motion does.  I 
think the hon. member has two concerns. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT83"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT83"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion provides for the police to take a DNA sample at the 
time of charging an individual who has a prior conviction.  To 
take that DNA sample, two things have to happen. There has to be 
a charge laid against the person and the person has to have a 
prior conviction for one of the designated offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to charge an individual, the police have to have 
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the individual 
has committed the offence for which he or she is charged. That is 
a safeguard in our system to stop the police who have tremendous 
power in this country from charging anyone willy-nilly. The law 
is clear.  The common law as it has evolved says that in order to 
arrest and charge an individual, there has to be reasonable and 
probable grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that allows the police to take a DNA sample with a 
warrant says that there has to be reasonable and probable grounds 
to take the warrant. They have to go to a judge and ask the judge 
if they can take a sample of any individual's DNA and to take 
that sample there has to be reasonable and probable grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the purpose of this amendment, if the person has 
already been charged, then presumably the police already have 
done the necessary groundwork to take a DNA sample.  With great 
respect to my colleague from Crowfoot, I think the purpose is to 
say what happens when the offender is charged with an offence and 
he may escape bail. That was mentioned by one of my colleagues in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Criminal Code bail provisions under section 515(10) 
provide for a bail hearing.  Most people should know this.  When 
someone is charged with an offence, they are to be released 
pending their trial unless the court has reasonable grounds to 
believe that the offender will escape so that they will not be 
dealt with according to law. There is a built-in protection to 
stop someone from leaving the jurisdiction under section 515 of 
the code to ensure that they do not escape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the scenario contemplated by my friend from Crowfoot in good 
faith, if the crown prosecutor has reasonable grounds to believe 
that the individual will escape custody so that his DNA sample 
will not be taken, then the prosecutor can raise that at the bail 
hearing to ensure that the judge remands that individual pending 
the trial.  There is a mechanism to ensure that the individual 
does not escape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other aspects of this piece of legislation and 
some other comments on this amendment which need to be addressed. 
The member for Crowfoot asked what the difference is in terms of 
taking a blood sample, in that we allow that intrusion to happen 
so why can we not do it with DNA.  There is an answer to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taking of a blood sample at the time someone is charged is a 
crucial piece of evidence because the blood sample will change as 
time goes on.  A person who is impaired at six o'clock in the 
evening and is charged with impaired driving may not be impaired 
at 12 o'clock the next day. The taking of the sample for a blood 
alcohol reading is crucial at that point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA sample does not change.  If we wait six hours to take 
someone's DNA sample, the reading of that sample is not going to 
change.  The reading of a blood alcohol level will change. When 
people ask what the difference is between taking blood at a 
particular time and taking the DNA sample, it is because the 
nature of the evidence is different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been provided with four decisions which have been 
referred to by members in this House.  One was solicited by the 
Canadian Police Association and three were solicited by the 
Minister of Justice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues have said that they know the three 
obtained by the solicitor general or the Minister of Justice 
reflect the government's concern and they question whether or not 
they come totally unbiased.  To be fair, we have to say that the 
opinion solicited by the Canadian Police Association was also 
directed and purchased by a particular organization to reflect 
its point of view and its argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is similar to two parties going into court.  One lawyer will 
put forward the argument for the client he represents and the 
other lawyer will put forward the argument for the client she 
represents.  We can always ask whether the arguments are tilted 
one way or the other.  Our job is to sift through those arguments 
and come to the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an easy motion to sift through.  Every member in 
this House has struggled with this, in part because of the 
lobbying of the police association.  I spoke with Mr. Newark just 
before addressing this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at those opinions for what they are.  Three of 
them say that this motion, the taking of DNA at the time of 
arrest or charge will not withstand the charter.  What does that 
mean?  It means that the taking of the DNA sample at that point 
in time violates the freedoms of the individuals of this country. 
It means that the state is operating in a most intrusive manner. 
The courts have said, and it is our job as parliamentarians to 
say, that the individual cannot be impeded upon by the state all 
the time without reasonable limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some colleagues in this House have taken umbrage at the fact 
that the supreme court is dictating to parliament.  The supreme 
court has an important role and that is to interpret legislation 
that is passed in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be absolutely realistic about the way things happen in 
this parliament.  I accept some of the arguments that say the 
supreme court is perhaps intrusive and perhaps invades some of 
the responsibilities of this House, but the supreme court is one 
of the very necessary checks in a checks and balance system for 
the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without substantial reforms to this House of Commons, and I say 
this without fear of contradiction in this House, the supreme 
court is the only check in this country on the power not of the 
government, but of the cabinet.  If we look at the way law is 
made in this country, the cabinet introduces legislation to a 
majority party in this House of Commons and it passes it.  We 
have seen that happen in the hepatitis C issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate is supposed to be a check.  We know what the Senate 
is.  The governor general is an archaic check.  The only check to 
the supreme power of the cabinet is the supreme court of this 
country.  Until we reform this House, that check has to stay to 
protect the privacy of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members have referred to Paul Bernardo.  If Mr. Bernardo 
were arrested and charged, the police would have the power needed 
to collect his DNA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great respect for the mover of this motion.  I understand 
why he wishes it to pass.  We have to look at the best interests 
of Canadians and stop the state from interfering in their

of safety and the utmost of protection for them to live a life in 
Canada without having to look over their shoulders, for them to

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion 10 will allow for the taking of samples at the time of 
charge from offenders with one previous conviction and retained 
for analysis on conviction.  Our original amendment introduced 
during clause by clause review was to allow for the taking of 
samples from all persons charged. Since this amendment was 
defeated we have put forward an amended version which addresses 
the concerns raised by the government members of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members cited finance and privacy concerns as the 
primary reasons why they would not expand the DNA bank and allow 
for samples to be taken and analysed at the time of charge rather 
than conviction.  Reform's amendment specifically addresses the 
issue of cost, proposing that samples be taken on charge but not 
analysed until conviction, therefore reducing the cost associated 
with the testing of samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well it addresses privacy concerns and concerns regarding 
individuals incriminating themselves.  It also satisfies the 
Canadian Police Association's concerns regarding offenders 
released on bail pending trial, i.e. skipping out. A previous 
speaker said that through a councillor going to a judge and 
pointing this out to him, bail could be denied but that is no 
assurance.  I have seen in the last five years some very unusual 
cases of individuals being bailed when there was really no reason 
that the courts should take the chance doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police believe that if an offender is guilty of a previous 
offence for which they have not been charged they may not appear 
for their trial if they realize that on conviction their DNA 
sample may be compared to DNA evidence left at the scene of an 
unsolved crime.  This amendment was recommended and thus fully 
supported by the Canadian Police Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment specifies that the offender must have been 
convicted of one previous offence.  Again this is to satisfy 
concerns regarding privacy and self-incriminating evidence. 
Government members of the committee said they would be more apt 
to support the taking of DNA from possible repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion goes a long way in correcting the massive flaw in 
Bill C-3 which is that it does not allow DNA to be taken on 
arrest except with a warrant.  I still cannot understand why 
these samples cannot be taken just as fingerprints are now or as 
blood and urine samples are taken in suspected cases of impaired 
driving.  I think public safety concerns are a lot more important 
than pure civil libertarian concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of playing an instrumental role back in 1995 
when the first phase of the government DNA testing plan was 
passed.  Bill C-104 allowed police to take samples without 
consent from individuals suspected of criminal offences, 
generally those involving serious violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sample taken from the suspect would be matched with samples 
from the crime scene to determine whether the suspect had 
committed the specific offence being investigated.  The 
legislation did not deal with the storage of the information or 
samples derived from testing. It provided a reasonable scheme to 
ensure that DNA samples were not taken from suspects 
unnecessarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the results that first phase of legislation had for Tara 
Manning's family.  I will never forget June 20, 1995 when the 
justice minister said that he was prepared to introduce 
legislation by the end of the week for the purpose of adding DNA 
testing to the Criminal Code.  This was a great day for victims 
because it provided a mechanism to answer many questions and for 
the police in solving crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet here we are working on phase two of the legislation and we 
hear arguments that a DNA sample is unduly intrusive compared to 
fingerprinting.  I have to agree with the words of Tim Danson 
from the <I>Globe and Mail</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high court has ruled that taking DNA samples as already 
allowed by law is not unduly intrusive.  The method of sampling 
consists of cutting a piece of a person's hair, rubbing a Q-tip 
swab inside the mouth, or taking blood by a simple pin device 
similar to that used by diabetics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the court has made it clear that privacy is far more 
affected when an individual is arrested, taken to court and 
forced to face the public and personal shame and humiliation that 
inevitably follow.  Privacy interests protected by the charter of 
rights and freedoms relate to a reasonable expectation of privacy 
and not privacy at large.  People who engage in criminal activity 
should expect some loss of privacy.  Their victims certainly 
have.  Perhaps the armchair constitutional academics should join 
us in the real world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree with that individual's statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Motion No. 11, which I support, it amends clause 
117 regarding who samples may be taken from.  It allows for the 
taking of DNA samples from incarcerated offenders who are serving 
sentences of two or more years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During clause by clause review we proposed that samples be 
taken from all incarcerated offenders who had been convicted of 
one or more primary designated offences, serious or violent 
offenders.  Our amendment was defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the bill allows the taking of DNA samples only from 
multiple murderers, sex offenders and designated dangerous 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that a very small percentage of offenders commit the 
majority of crimes and there remains a number of unsolved crimes 
in this country, there is a great probability that a number of 
persons currently incarcerated for one offence may be responsible 
for many more offences.  Without this amendment, the police will 
have many cases which remain unsolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support this motion.  However, it makes no sense to me 
why we have a databank that does not include samples from all 
convicted violent offenders.  The bill as drafted now allows for 
samples only from multiple murderers, sex offenders and dangerous 
offenders.  Two people who are exempt from this classification 
would be Clifford Olsen and Allan Legere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all killers should be obliged to provide the DNA 
databank with samples even though they were convicted years 
before the bank was ever imagined.  This is why this motion is so 
necessary and I hope government members will agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as if we are suggesting they adopt a proposal like 
that from New Brunswick which has been the first to publicly 
press for the use of DNA samples in cases of property damage over 
$5,000. That day may come, but as of now I think the least we can 
do is test those who are serving sentences for two or more years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason for the necessity to test everyone serving two 
years or more is that a disproportionately small number of 
offenders are responsible for a disproportionately large number 
of crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stats Canada reports that of the approximately 23,000 offenders, 
20% had served a previous federal sentence, 11% had served two 
previous federal sentences, 18% had served more than two federal 
sentences and 80% had previously been incarcerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth in these statistics is that the recidivism rate of a 
small number of offenders means that by taking steps to deal with 
this group alone would be effective in protection of the public. 
A recent CSC report confirms that those offenders detained for 
their entire sentence are less likely to recommit crimes than 
those released early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By taking samples of those serving two or more years, it would 
not only solve many unanswered crimes, it would also send a 
signal that if you commit more crimes, you will get caught and 
you will be punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a deterrent we need to get out to the probable or 
possible offenders of the future. Do not do it.  We will open up 
wide the use of DNA sampling and you will get caught and you will 
pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we refuse to accept that kind of legislation which would 
mean so much better safety for all Canadians throughout the land? 
Please support this amendment.  Without it, the bill is not very 
good. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did 
warn you that you would probably hear from me twice today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has argued it is far too costly to take DNA 
samples at the time of the arrest of somebody who has been 
previously convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It amazes me. It has indicated it will not support this 
amendment which would enable the police to take these samples at 
the time of arresting someone with a previous conviction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says it is too costly and yet it is prepared to spend perhaps 
hundreds of millions of dollars on registering the guns of 
law-abiding people like farmers who will never do anything wrong. 
It will not spend money on building a DNA bank which would solve 
crimes and therefore save enormous amounts of money in terms of 
property damage and personal harm done by criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the sense in wasting all that money on law-abiding 
citizens when there is absolutely no reason to do it and not 
spending the money where it is required in crime control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is happy to give the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage millions of dollars to blow away on a flag program and 
millions of dollars to throw away on a heritage calendar which 
mentions every ethnic religious holiday one can think of except 
for Christmas and New Year, but it will not spend the money to 
help build a DNA databank which would help us solve crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the 
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council which gives 
grants to professors which appear to be awfully like vacations 
but it will not give money to build a DNA bank that would help 
solve crimes for ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking at some of the grants of the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council.  There was one for a woman to go to 
a little island just west of Fiji, a tax haven island.  She was 
going for three years to study housing on this island.  It is an 
absolutely ridiculous waste of money for a person to be given 
money to do that under the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These organizations give away money to study the make-up of 
blueberry jam.  The member for Langley—Abbotsford has mentioned 
that one before.  What a lot of rubbish.  This is money just 
poured down the drain on useless, idiotic projects when we have 
here an opportunity to build a DNA bank that would actually make 
a difference.  It would actually provide a deterrent, would 
enable the police to actually solve crimes and would relieve the 
suffering of many law-abiding Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals absolutely love spending money on all sorts of 
social engineering but they hate spending money on crime control 
or solving crimes.  They are completely out of step with the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another aspect of this bill, the government constantly talks 
about the court test of the legislation.  It is so terrified of 
the court and what the court might do that it has become hog 
tied.  It is unable to produce reasonable legislation because it 
is so afraid of the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a clause put into the charter of rights called the 
notwithstanding clause and it was put there for a reason.  It was 
put there so that notwithstanding the rulings of the courts, if 
the government felt that a ruling had been made out of step with 
the will of parliament and the will of the people the 
notwithstanding clause could be used to correct that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of being so afraid of these judges who defy the will of 
parliament and the will of the people and spending enormous 
amounts of money on preparing bills to be charter safe, why not 
use the notwithstanding clause a few times and show the judges 
what we expect of them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can have the public confirm the decision of the government by 
putting it to a binding referendum on the public will so that the 
government then cannot act in a tyrannical manner.  If it does 
use the notwithstanding clause it will be endorsed by the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we continue down this road of constantly talking about making 
bills charter safe, we surely know from our own experience in 
life that for every lawyer who says they drew up a document free 
of challenge and there is no way anyone can challenge this, there 
is another lawyer across the street who says it is full of 
loopholes and can be challenged from every direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can have all the experts in committee who can make these 
suggestions on how we can make bills charter safe, but there is 
always going to be a lawyer out there who will study that bill 
and find some loophole or some clause where he can take it to 
challenge and with perseverance will mock it down.  It happens 
all the time.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we made it clear that we will no longer tolerate that 
as a society, that we need some crime control, and that if the 
judges will not help us with that project we will use the 
notwithstanding clause to ensure they carry out the public will 
and begin to reflect a little of what society wants instead of 
what lawyers want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the comments of the member for 
Scarborough—Rouge River when he spoke earlier that there is 
nothing to stop the taking of DNA samples under warrant, when we 
look at the amendment being proposed by Reform we could have this 
amendment and still have the taking of samples by warrant if 
necessary.  This motion gives an opportunity to begin building a 
DNA bank for repeat offenders so that we can solve some of the 
crimes they commit.  I cannot understand why anyone would oppose 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned again that they are worried about charter 
challenges.  Everything in this place is done worrying about what 
the courts might do to it.  It is just completely crippling us, 
preventing us from doing our job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us pass this motion.  Let us add it into the bill and let us 
worry about what the court does with it a little later. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Group No. 6. I compliment 
my colleague from Crowfoot on the hard work he has done on Bill 
C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially it deals with the timing of DNA samples, the taking 
of samples at the time of charging the offender and retaining 
them for analysis upon conviction.  It needs to be toughened up a 
lot.  Members from the other side have mentioned a number of 
times that it is expensive to do these tests.  What is the cost 
of not doing these tests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not find any evidence in Canada, but let us look at the 
evidence in the United States.  The United States has been much 
more aggressive than we have been in utilizing DNA sampling and 
DNA as a scientific tool in the fight against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent FBI statistics state that less than half of all rapes 
were solved by police and less than 10% took samples at the scene 
of the crime for use by the laboratories.  In only 6% of 250,000 
rape cases was DNA was actually recovered and tested. That points 
to a significant flaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at all the rapes convictions and take it as 100%, of 
those convictions only 48% or less than half was DNA collected 
and only in 27% was the DNA typed.  Less than a quarter of all 
the DNA that was collected, which is about 12%, was from those 
convicted.  That is a very small amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are our costs, society's costs, the police costs and the 
judicial costs in not utilizing DNA as an effective tool against 
crime?  We could think of all the time that would be saved if we 
could take samples from all those charged, charter challenges 
notwithstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one is innocent one has nothing to fear.  If one is innocent 
the DNA can be used to exonerate.  An enormous body of work, 
again from the United States and from the United Kingdom which 
has been even more aggressive than the States in utilizing the 
DNA databank, shows very clearly that DNA can be used as an 
effective tool to exonerate the innocent.  It is a double edged 
sword.  DNA can be used as an effective tool to convict the 
guilty and to make sure the innocent are not convicted.  We have 
had both cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the case of Paul Bernardo where lives could have been 
saved if the samples that were taken from Mr. Bernardo were 
analysed in a timely fashion.  Instead they were laid to languish 
in a laboratory and as a result at least two young innocent women 
were murdered and countless others were raped. 
We have also seen cases where the innocent would not have spent 
time in jail were DNA used as a tool to exonerate them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are interested in justice we will pass Group No. 6.  We 
will pass Motion No. 10 of my colleague from Crowfoot and will 
use it to make Bill C-3 a stronger bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other opportunities and other flaws that we can point 
to in using DNA.  The United Kingdom has been particularly active 
in the DNA database and in employing DNA science.  It is using 
something called STRs, short tandem strands of DNA that are more 
specific than the tools we are using today.  If we use STRs, the 
short tandem strands of DNA, it is a much more effective tool in 
making a stronger more specific analysis of the DNA at the site 
of a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at other flaws with respect to using DNA. 
Usually, as I mentioned before, not enough DNA is collected.  It 
is not collected in a timely fashion.  It is not collected at the 
scene of the crime and it is not processed in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those can be taken and used.  If they are used can we 
imagine the savings in money and in time in police 
investigations?  In the building and construction of a DNA 
databank we could have a mass of information that could be used 
to expeditiously convict a person guilty in the commission of a 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to learn not only from our experience in Canada which is 
in its infancy.  We also need to look at the United States and in 
particular at the United Kingdom which have led the way in using 
DNA as a scientific tool against the war on crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to look at the motions in Group No. 6, to 
utilize them and to adopt them to build upon Bill C-3.  It is 
also useful for us to look at Bill C-3 to make sure that DNA can 
be taken from all those who are charged for the reasons I 
mentioned before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, collect at the crime scene, use better specimen 
collection and preservation, and apply it not only to violent 
offenders.  Why do we not apply it to non-violent offences too? 
What is the problem?  If we are interested in the pursuit of 
justice, if we are interested in the pursuit of truth and if we 
are interested in making sure that the guilty are convicted and 
that the innocent are released, why do we not use the DNA 
databank for those individuals too? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of crime within our society is estimated at roughly $48 
billion a year.  What is the cost for us of not convicting the 
guilty?  What is the cost of having the guilty released and 
running amok?  All those things are important for us to take into 
consideration when we are trying to build Bill C-3 into a better 
bill for all individuals concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to deal with the charter issue.  It is 
important for us to look at the charter to make sure, when it 
comes time to revisit it, that the charter can be utilized and 
changed to ensure that good bills like a modified Bill C-3 are 
allowed to go through and that charter challenges do not get in 
the way of the pursuit of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many times we have seen situations where individuals who 
were charged with crimes, who were patently guilty, got off 
scot-free because of a charter challenge, a loophole that 
prevents the guilty from being convicted and put in a situation 
where they will not prey upon innocent civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I hope the government takes it upon itself to pass 
the motions in Group No. 6 to build a better Bill C-3.  We look 
forward to its responses in the near future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it has been a very interesting debate on DNA.  A lot of issues

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members who participated in this debate have serious 
concerns.  I share those concerns, but I believe the departments 
of justice and the solicitor general have done a very good job in 
listening to members, in particular members of the Reform Party, 
some of whom gave very well formulated and sound opinions and 
some of whom were off the wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I know there is a serious intent to ensure 
greater safety and security for citizens of the country by 
enabling us to target people who have the potential for repeated 
offences of the worst kinds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose often brings into the House examples of 
serious offences which need to be addressed.  It is very 
important to ensure in some way that multiple offenders never get 
out there again to continue those kinds of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who have demonstrated patterns of recidivism 
which are of serious concern to all of us.  The legislation and 
the changes that have been made to it answer the concerns placed 
before us in a most efficient and effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a conversation around the amendments found in Motion No. 
11.  I am sure members of the Reform Party recall the discussion 
around designated offences.  The issue of a designated offence is 
a very broad term.  Any designated offence is an even broader 
term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall for those people who feel we are avoiding the issues in 
any way, shape or form by buying into the amendment that has been 
suggested that if we were to suggest an acceptance of Motion No. 
11 we would be bringing into the prison system and into the 
taking of personal DNA, which is the most precious definition of 
who we are as a people, something that once out there in the 
public can never be recovered.  It is vital information.  If one 
has committed a B and E, has stolen a car or has broken into a 
shop, should we in those circumstances consider taking DNA?  I am 
not in agreement.  We were not in agreement in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member who did a very good job in defending his 
position in committee.  He is talking with the Parliamentary 
Secretary to Solicitor General.  I am sure they would both agree 
that this is not such a great idea.  All three of us would agree

Motions Nos. 10 and 11.  I thought I would not get the 
opportunity.  I thank the hon. member for her motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having listened to the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice I wonder who is running this country.  The 
parliamentary secretary gave very lucid arguments as to why we 
should not tackle the Supreme Court of Canada or put ourselves at 
risk of a showdown with the Supreme Court of Canada.  If in the 
end the court prevailed and decided we had taken the wrong 
approach, those convicted during a period of three or four years 
prior to having the legislation declared void would have to be 
turned loose because they would have been wrongfully convicted. I 
appreciate the argument and I would not like to see the guilty 
going free or conversely the innocent being convicted because of 
any error on our part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is a country of laws.  It is time we made it clear 
not only to the public but to ourselves that the House of Commons 
of Canada is the supreme legislative body of this country and 
that we do not have to cower in fear of what the supreme court 
may do.  We are trying to make predictions that the supreme court 
will disallow this legislation or that we think it will disallow 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you put three lawyers in a room and ask them for opinions on 
this or any other subject, you will get at least five opinions. 
Therefore we should not be cowering here.  If the House in its 
wisdom feels these are good amendments, which I believe they are, 
then this is the direction we should take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared with what was previously brought forward in committee, 
Motion No. 10 is relatively innocuous.  It states that samples 
can be taken on charge from previous offenders, not from just 
anyone who has been arrested.  This makes it unnecessary in the 
event that the charged person is exonerated of having to take 
special measures in order to rid the databank of the samples as 
can be done with fingerprints now.  If we go only for people with 
previous convictions then surely we do not have the problem of 
having samples in the databank from people who have never been 
convicted of anything because they are convicted before a sample 
is taken.  I think this makes eminent sense.  In my opinion there 
is no civil liberties problem involved in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question gets a little closer to the bone with the 
question of civil liberties, taking DNA samples from convicted 
people who are already in jail.  Again the social benefit of 
doing this in this case may outweigh the danger to civil 
liberties.  These are convicted criminals.  These are not people 
who have been pulled in off the street and hair plucked from 
their heads to see what their DNA is.  These are people who have 
committed serious crimes, designated offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people could very well have in the past committed violent 
offences, in particular rapes, for which they have not been 
caught or charged

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they are in jail and have already been convicted of a 
violent offence, does it not make practical sense to check to see 
if maybe the fellow being looked for during the previous five 
years might already be in custody?  I see no harm in this. There 
is no one in this House who is a stronger defender of civil 
liberties than I am. People who have known me here for the last 
few years I think will stand behind me on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a case where it simply makes sense to go ahead, take the 
sample and find out if somebody being held has committed some 
gross crime and if that is the case another charge can be laid 
and the fellow is kept in for a very long period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not buy the philosophy that we have to quiver and shake and 
say no, the supreme court may override us.  If worst comes to 
worst as I understand the law we could still use the 
notwithstanding clause to avoid having to turn a bunch of 
convicted felons loose.  I may be wrong on that.  Perhaps some of 
our legal talent could advise me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way I see it, that the notwithstanding clause 
could be used and therefore, contrary to what the hon. 
parliamentary secretary said, no one would have to be turned 
loose as having been wrongly convicted even if the supreme court 
did go against us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 12 would allow an individual who is 
charged with a criminal offence or who subsequent to that charge 
has been convicted of an indictable offence to voluntarily 
provide a substance of DNA for analysis and entry into the DNA 
databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this essentially enables an individual to do is give 
exculpatory evidence.  Once again it demonstrates that this type 
of technology is not only to be used by the state but can be used 
by an individual and it would entrench this in the bill by 
allowing them to voluntarily give their DNA for use in the trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose it could be argued that this would exist in any event 
if an individual wanted to do so and have the sample taken. 
Perhaps the funding is going to be a question that will 
inevitably be asked but this would include in the bill an 
individual's right to have their DNA considered by the state in 
the prosecution of a criminal offence.  We are talking about 
designated offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drafters of this bill in their wisdom have designated 
certain serious offences where DNA substances are very prone and 
very apt to be left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest this is a useful amendment.  It is one that in the 
past would have been useful.  The names Milgaard, Morin and 
Marshall come to mind with respect to how DNA did and could be 
used as exculpatory evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It again shows the scope of the use of this type of technology 
in our criminal justice system and it is a positive suggestion 
and one which the government and hopefully all members of this 
House will support.

</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA is going to be used more and more in our justice system.  It 
is inevitable.  It is technology.  It is going to serve a very 
useful purpose for those in law enforcement and for those 
involved in the justice system generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members would embrace this useful motion and would be 
supportive in their remarks and in the vote which will inevitably 
take place in the near future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the 
government had the courage of its convictions it would grant the 
police the power to take a sample at the time of charge if the 
individual has shown by his or her actions that he or she has 
been in this type of difficulty before and if necessary protect 
that right by way of the notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of my colleagues indicated, it is time to tell the 
Supreme Court of Canada that we want the will of the people 
expressed through legislation created by elected representatives 
of this country and not be afraid every time we attempt to do it 
that nine unelected individuals are going to strike down the will 
of the majority of the people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support this motion.  We think this is a good motion.  It 
does not hurt anyone.  It causes no undue problems.  It is of a 
voluntary nature.  The provision for this type of activity was 
originally left out the bill.  This motion would place it in the 
bill and recognize the right of individuals to volunteer samples 
for whatever purpose, but certainly for the purpose of 
exonerating them from offences they have not committed.  How many 
times have people volunteered for breathalyser tests?  How many 
have given samples of their blood, their scalp hair, their pubic 
hair in order to have that compared with samples found at the 
scene and to exonerate them? Other evidence has caused their 
arrest and charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked at the cases that have come forward, the Milgaard 
case, the Donald Marshall Jr. case, the Wilson Nepoose case and 
so on.  Those are only the ones we know about.  Yet we probably 
have 50 section 690 applications a year going to the justice 
minister asking for a new trial or asking for mercy based on the 
conviction these people are innocent.  This provides the means in 
this area whereby identification by way of DNA is allowed.   It 
provides a statutory provision for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support it and we congratulate the member for bringing it 
forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government does 
not support this motion.  We find it problematic because of the 
charter perspective.  It calls for placing in the convicted 
offenders index the DNA profile of persons charged with an 
indictable offence who have provided DNA samples voluntarily.  A 
person so charged is entitled to the presumption of innocence and 
may ultimately be acquitted.  Therefore an innocent person's 
profile should not be part of the convicted offenders index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another problem in that this motion has no provision 
for obtaining a person's informed consent to place the samples 
provided voluntarily in the convicted offenders index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion applies to any indictable offence regardless of 
whether it is a designated offence and is therefore likely to 
provide DNA evidence that would be of assistance in a criminal 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these serious difficulties I urge hon. members to 
reject this motion.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is absolutely crucial for the federal government to focus on 
children in the months and years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that well-developed children become successful 
productive adults who are better able to contribute to society's 
economy and to instigate a cycle of positive effects as they 
become parents and grandparents of the generations that follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society we need to continue to ensure that we are doing 
everything we can to help people carry out the most important job 
they will ever have and that is of a parent.  As a society we 
need to continue to ensure that we are doing everything we can in 
the first three or four years of a child's life, noting that they 
are essential to the child's long term development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know now just how valuable it is to get these first years 
right, but how damaging it can be for children when they do not 
get the help they need at an early age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society we need to continue to ensure that we are doing 
everything we can to prevent child abuse which is a crime with 
potential lifetime effects for the young victims.  One abused 
child is too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society we need to continue to ensure that we are doing 
everything we can to prevent child poverty.  Poverty affects not 
only a child's body but also their emotional and mental state. 
Poor children are more than twice as likely to suffer long term 
disabilities and other physical and mental health problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We at the federal level and indeed all levels of government need 
to work very hard to advance the cause of Canada's children.  We 
must do so knowing that there is growing recognition worldwide of 
the importance of early childhood development.  This is something 
we all have a stake in because it is all about the future of 
Canada.  Early child development is a powerful investment in the 
future both socially and economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the secretary of state responsible for children and youth 
what the government is doing to support our children.  What is 
the government doing to advance the national children's agenda? 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the member will recall, the 
Speech from the Throne acknowledged the importance of early 
childhood development. By investing now in the well-being of 
today's children this government is investing in the long term 
health of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal, provincial and territorial governments have been 
working closely for some time on collaborative initiatives aimed 
at helping children get a better start in life.  The community 
action program for children, the Canada prenatal nutrition 
program and aboriginal head start are just examples of highly 
successful programs already in place to help children in target 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that all Canadian children have the best opportunity 
to develop their full potential, we need a broader and much more 
comprehensive investment.  Early childhood development alone is 
not the solution.  A growing body of research tells us that we 
must look at the wide range of environmental factors that affect 
children's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Speech from the Throne announced the development 
of a national children's agenda.  Three levels of government are 
working together to develop a national strategy to improve the 
well-being of Canada's seven million children.  This agenda will 
give us the opportunity to integrate the sometimes fragmented 
efforts of the different levels of government avoiding overlap 
and duplication to ensure we get the most out of each dollar we 
spend on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national children's agenda is a long term action plan that 
requires a substantial investment of time and effort from all 
players. In the meantime we will live up to the commitment we 
made to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As announced in the 1997 budget, the Canada child tax benefit 
will come into force July 1 to help low income families. 
As announced in this year's budget, we will increase the Canada 
child tax benefit by an additional $850 million by the year 2000.

elimination of child poverty, to promote early childhood 
development and to lay a strong foundation for the future of 
Canadian children and Canadian society.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEALTH 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to expand on my question to 
the Minister of Health about the painful shortfall in federal 
transfer payments for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed an amendment to a bill that would have required the 
minister to report every year to parliament on whether transfer 
payments are adequate enough to meet the needs for health 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain why.  I received a letter from George Bell whom I 
wrote to the minister about but have still not received a reply. 
Mr. Bell waited six months before receiving diagnosis and 
treatment for a worsening nerve disorder.  Last fall the first 
doctor told him the pain and tingling in his arm would probably 
go away.  It did not.  The second doctor booked him for a 
diagnostic scan for which Mr. Bell had to wait a month.  After 
that Mr. Bell waited another month for more diagnostic services. 
His treatment only began recently and the surgery has not yet 
been scheduled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bell is a manual labourer who could not work because of the 
increasing pain in his arms.  The Workers' Compensation Board 
turned down his claim because it stated he was suffering from a 
degenerative disc disease that was not as a result of his work 
duties.  Mr. Bell has nothing to live on, is unable to work and 
is just now receiving treatment for his condition six months 
after he first approached a doctor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there are many people out there experiencing 
similar frustrations and lack of timely care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today researchers at the Université du Québec à Montréal 
released a study that showed that health cutbacks reduced life 
expectancy for men and women as well as infants.  The Liberal 
government cut $3.5 billion from health care over the past three 
years alone.  That represents a huge number of beds, a lot of 
medical equipment and hundreds and perhaps thousands of staff. 
That represents months of waiting for surgery and life 
threatening hours of waiting in emergency rooms. It is quite 
simply unacceptable.  This is not what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's answer is to introduce two tiered medicine 
where the rich can pay to jump the queue and the poor die on 
waiting lists.  This is also unacceptable.  This is not the 
Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now a private hospital is operating in Alberta contrary to 
the public administration principle in the Canada Health Act. The 
Liberal government is doing nothing about it.  The dollars of 
desperate and sick Canadians are going into the pockets of the 
owners of this private health operation instead of all those 
dollars being used for health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way of the future, unless we stop it, unless we can 
give Canadians a voice in our own health care system.  The 
amendment I proposed was a way to do that but the answer I 
received then from the minister was disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister's representative to respond to Mr. 
Bell and to all Canadians who have to wait unreasonable periods 
of time, often at great personal expense for medical treatment. 
Why does he not wish Canadians to have a voice in our health care 
system?  Why is he afraid of scrutiny of the current inadequate 
levels of funding for health care?  Why are people like Mr. Bell 
forced to wait six months for treatment and be unable to work and 
have nothing to live on in the meantime?  What answer does he 
have for Mr. Bell? 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the quality of health care 
available to Canadians is of utmost importance to the government. 
We know that high quality health care is a key contributor to a 
healthy population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply focusing on how much money is being spent on health care 
will not provide a real picture of how good the quality of care 
is and how well the health system is doing in achieving important 
health outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quality health care is also about the effectiveness and 
appropriateness of the care, treatment and services available to 
Canadians as well as providing those services in the most 
efficient way possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government recognizes the importance that evidence based 
decision making has for improving the quality of health care. For 
example, we have implemented the three year $150 million health 
transition fund to gather in collaboration with the provinces and 
territories evidence and test pilot approaches in the areas of 
pharmacare, home care, primary health care and integrated health 
services delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the government is spending $50 million over three years to 
examine the development of a health information system to ensure 
that those in the health system have the best information they 
need to provide quality care to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the 1996 budget allocated $65 million over five years 
for the Canadian health services research fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer provides the stability and 
predictability by ensuring $12.5 billion annually in cash 
transfers and total transfer entitlements that will gradually 
increase from $25.3 billion in 1997-98 to $28.5 billion in the 
year 2002-03.
