	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, on May 1st, 1996, the hon. member 
for Richelieu raised a point of order to argue that, contrary to my 
statement that remarks made outside the House are not necessarily 
within the purview of the House, the hon. member for Rosemont 
had been obliged in 1993 to withdraw remarks he had made outside 
the House. I explained that, as I recalled the 1993 case, it differed 
because the remarks made in that instance concerned the House 
directly. Nonetheless, I promised to review the matter and come 
back to the House, if necessary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am now prepared to respond to this point of order. Let me point 
out that the 1993 case is not analogous because the remarks in 
question were a direct attack on the Chair. What was at issue is that 
a member was reported in a newspaper article and had criticized 
the conduct of the Assistant Deputy Chairman of Committees of 
the Whole.
<P>
	Remarks critical of the speakership, be they uttered inside the 
House or outside the Chamber, particularly when uttered by a 
member of the House, are very serious and in themselves have been 
ruled to be breaches of privilege as per Beauchesne's sixth edition, 
citation 168(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reflections upon the character or actions of the Speaker may be punished as 
breaches of privilege. The actions of the Speaker cannot be criticized 
incidentally in debate or upon any form of proceeding except by way of a 
substantive motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When this matter was raised in the House in 1993, the hon. 
member for Rosemont was given the opportunity to respond and 
explain his comments. Speaker Fraser, having listened to this 
explanation and to remarks from all sides of the House, stated, in 
part, on page 17404 of the <I>Debates</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If we consider the words that were reported, we clearly have a prima facie 
case that affects the dignity of this House and our colleague, because our 
colleague is an officer of this House- like the Speaker, he is an officer of this 
House and an attack against the integrity of a person in that position is an attack 
against this House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Speaker ruled the matter to be a prima facie question of 
privilege. A motion was moved to refer the matter to the then 
Standing Committee on House Management for examination, and 
the motion was adopted. Two days later, the member for Rosemont 
rose in the House and withdrew his comments. From there, the 
matter was considered closed.
<P>
	There is no question that both sets of remarks, the remarks by the 
hon. member for Rosemont in 1993 and the remarks by the hon 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, two weeks ago, were made 
outside the House. The distinction to be made between the two, 
however, is not where the remarks were made, but rather that the 
remarks in one case were critical of the Chair and in the other case 
were not directed to the House or any of its members.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Richelieu for bringing this matter to 
the attention of the House.

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I give the annual statement on national security, I would like 
to express my sincere thanks to colleagues on all sides of the House 
for their expressions of support, encouragement and good wishes. I 
appreciate them very much, as I appreciate similar expressions 
from Canadians in every part of the country.
<P>
	I am especially touched by expressions of support and 
encouragement from people I likely have never met who have 
faced situations similar to the one I am facing and have surmounted 
them. Once again, my deep thanks to all these expressions of 
encouragement and support. I am deeply touched by them and I 
appreciate them very much.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to present to Parliament the fifth 
annual statement on national security and to table in the House the 
1995 public report and program outlook of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service. This document provides both 
parliamentarians and the public with a review of the current global 
and domestic security environment.
<P>
	Additionally, the program outlook provides information on CSIS 
resource levels for the current year and for the two next fiscal 
years. We are providing this information in keeping with the 
government's commitment to more openness and accountability.
<P>
	It is the view of the government that a well focused and effective 
security intelligence capability is vital in today's world. Let me 
review the efforts of CSIS to protect Canada's interest and, most 
important, to protect Canadians from threats to their safety and 
security.
<P>
	Today's security threats are multi-faceted. I say this because they 
are global in their reach and effect, they come from a variety of 
sources, not just a few states as during the cold war era, and they 
are targeted against a wider range of institutions.
<P>
	For example, today economic espionage is a real concern. So is 
the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry. 
Ethnic conflict and the collapse of states threaten international 
security and have numerous implications for a country such as 
Canada which is noted for its refugee efforts and peacekeeping 
contributions.
<P>
	Transnational crime was identified by leaders at the last G-7 
summit as a growing threat to the security of nations. I think the 
House is well aware that terrorism remains the primary concern of 
security agencies around the world. We know the terrorist threat is 
increasingly sophisticated and global in nature, with some 
organizations having transnational structures while some continue 
to be state sponsored.
<P>
	We must also face the reality of domestic extremism which has 
been manifested so tragically in the United States in the bombing 
of a United States federal building in Oklahoma City last year and 
in Japan with the poison gas attacks on Tokyo subways.
<P>
	In another act of domestic terrorism we were horrified late last 
year by the assassination of the former prime minister of Israel, 
Yitzhak Rabin, an act which has threatened the very delicate efforts 
which we hope will bring about peace in the Middle East and which 
contributed to the latest resurgence of violent outbreaks between 
Israel and Hamas in Lebanon.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	In another corner of the world we see the resumption of IRA 
bombings of civilian targets in Britain. The assassination of Prime 
Minister Rabin and the resumption of IRA bombings are examples 
of how promising political solutions to longstanding grievances 
can be jeopardized when terrorists strike.
<P>
	I want to confirm that Canada has been a keen and active 
participant in international co-operative efforts to combat 
terrorism. In June of last year the Prime Minister chaired the G-7 
summit in Halifax which placed international terrorism high on the 
agenda of discussion by world leaders.
<P>
	The heads of government agreed to share their experiences of 
and lessons learned from major terrorist incidents. As well, they 
agreed to strengthen their co-operation in all efforts against 
terrorism.
<P>
	Following up on this commitment, last December in Ottawa I 
chaired the very first ministerial level meeting of the G-7 countries, 
together with Russia, to discuss specific co-operative measures to 
prevent and investigate terrorist acts. The result of that meeting 
was a document known as the Ottawa declaration. It is a milestone 
in international co-operation and in the strengthening of our 
common resolve to defeat terrorism. I would like to briefly review 
the agreements contained in the Ottawa declaration.
<P>
	First, we all know of the existence of a number of international 
conventions that spell out concrete actions against terrorist acts 
such as hijacking and hostage taking. We resolved that greater 
efforts needed to be made to get all states to join in and implement 
these conventions by the year 2000. We agreed that this is the key 
to circumscribing the ambit of international terrorism and denying 
it sanctuary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2723"> 2723 </A></B>
<P>
	In this spirit, the ministers were unanimous in denouncing states 
that support terrorists. The declaration called on all states to 
renounce terrorism and deny financial support as well as the use 
of territory to terrorist organizations. Ministers also committed to 
action to inhibit the movement of terrorists and to develop 
measures to prevent falsification of travel documents.
<P>
	The Ottawa declaration was unequivocal on the need to bring 
perpetrators of terrorist acts to swift justice. We also agreed to 
increase our preventative efforts against terrorism in our aviation, 
maritime and other transport systems.
<P>
	One of the most important tools we have to counter terrorism is 
the sharing of information. We agreed, through the Ottawa 
declaration, to strengthen the sharing of intelligence in information 
on terrorism in a large number of specific technical areas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We were encouraged by the progress made in Canadian and 
multilateral efforts to combat terrorism, and we are proud of the 
significant accomplishment embodied in the Ottawa Declaration.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister stated to the participants of the March 
Summit of Peacemakers in Egypt, Canada is doing its part to fight 
terrorism and we are doing so in a way that is consistent with 
international standards of human rights and laws.
<P>
	He noted that Canada is pursuing the objectives of the Ottawa 
Declaration in every available international forum.
<P>
	Further progress was made on this front just last month, when 
Canada joined with twenty-one western hemisphere countries in 
signing the Lima Declaration, at an anti-terrorism conference of 
the Organization of American States.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Here at home we continue to monitor threats to security and their 
implications for Canada. We are concerned, for example, with the 
potential for foreign conflicts to spill over to Canada and threaten 
Canadians. Canada, by its very peaceful and democratic nature, can 
be attractive to terrorist organizations seeking sanctuary or funds to 
continue terrorism in other lands. CSIS identifies and investigates 
such groups. It acts as the linchpin in assuring effective 
consultation and information sharing with appropriate Canadian 
law enforcement agencies, including the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police and other police services as well as with its foreign 
counterparts.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The primary role of CSIS is to forewarn and advise. CSIS threat 
assessments provide timely information to the government 
concerning potential or imminent  threats. As well, CSIS helps 
keep terrorists and other dangerous individuals from entering 
Canada through its assistance to Citizenship and Immigration 
Canada in screening individuals wishing to enter our country.
<P>
	I mentioned that CSIS, while not itself a law enforcement 
agency, works in co-operation with the police, in particular with the 
RCMP. I should point out that the RCMP has an important role to 
play because of its extensive role in security enforcement under the 
Security Offences Act and in providing security to designated 
persons, federal property, as well as foreign embassies and 
missions here in Canada.
<P>
	Violence in the pursuit of political objectives has no place in 
Canadian society. While CSIS and the police have separate 
mandates, they are joined by a common mission which is to protect 
the interests of all Canadians. Co-operation and co-ordination 
between police and security authorities has proven successful in 
defining threats and getting the best possible intelligence on 
criminal activities of terrorists.
<P>
	Although since the end of the cold war espionage has changed its 
focus and its character, its intensity remains a concern to Canada 
and its allies. CSIS remains vigilant and active in discerning and 
investigating such threats to the security of Canada.
<P>
	Canada plays a prominent role in the world community. We all 
know well that in various areas of the world, the world community 
is fraught with strife and unrest. In this volatile environment 
persistent threats must be dealt with and new ones emerge almost 
daily.
<P>
	I want to conclude by reiterating that this government continues 
to put a premium on the need for reliable and timely security 
intelligence and security enforcement in order to protect the 
interests of all Canadians and of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like first of all to say how pleased I am to see that the 
Solicitor General is back. We were all very concerned about his 
condition during his absence, and we are pleased to see him back in 
his seat today, because he was sorely missed. This makes us realize 
how fragile a gift health is. As the hon. member for Laval Centre 
would probably say, we must be ever mindful of our health.
<P>
	I am somewhat torn between the pleasure of welcoming the 
Solicitor General back and the comments I have a duty to make, as 
a member of the official opposition, about the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service. Having participated in 11 elections, the 
Solicitor General will no doubt understand that, as much as I may 
admire his work, I must also do mine, hence the following 
criticism.
<P>
	Of course I agree with the statements of principle the Solicitor 
General made with regard to the role of the  Canadian Security 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2724"> 2724 </A></B>
<P>
Intelligence Service. I am also happy to see that the hon. member 
for Fundy-Royal agrees with my previous remarks. I hope that we 
can continue to see eye to eye.
<P>
	The trouble does not lie so much with what the Solicitor General 
said. We can of course readily share his views about Canada's best 
interests and threats to national security. On the subject of 
espionage, industrial espionage and new spying techniques, he 
expressed some interesting thoughts because, as he said, these 
problems have to be tackled.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	He talked about the worldwide nuclear threat arising from the 
break-up of countries possessing deterrent and even nuclear attack 
capabilities; that too is something that concerns us. The same goes 
for international terrorism using chemical weapons. The incidents 
in Oklahoma City or Tokyo and the assassination of Prime Minister 
Rabin in Israel were mentioned.
<P>
	But not a word was said about the role played by the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service at home, in Canada, and that is our 
main concern. Our main concern stems from the realization that, 
for all intents and purposes, the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service is out of control. It has literally become a state within the 
state.
<P>
	Who knows about CSIS operations? Perhaps a handful of 
officials at the Department of the Solicitor General, sometimes the 
Solicitor General himself. But it has become obvious since the 
beginning of the 35th Parliament, since I personally became 
involved in the work of the national security sub-committee, that 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service does not have any 
watchdog, inasmuch as the legislation provides for one, in the form 
of a review committee, which reviews whatever it is given to 
review.
<P>
	The Security Intelligence Review Committee, or SIRC-CSARS 
in French-is an organization that has demonstrated its utter 
inefficiency in carrying out the duties entrusted to it by Parliament. 
If the Solicitor General has privileged information from SIRC, he 
should pass it on to us.
<P>
	Since the end of 1994, almost two years ago, we have been 
working on the Heritage Front affair. This problem did not occur in 
Israel, Belarus or the Middle East, but here in this country. There 
are allegations that an extremist group may have committed illegal 
acts here in this country.
<P>
	For two years we have been bogged down in our efforts to enlist 
the co-operation of members of the famous SIRC or Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, who have appeared before us 
parliamentarians in the Sub-committee on National Security but 
who have been hiding behind their so-called immunity to refuse to 
answer the legitimate questions asked by members. This  ordeal 
has lasted for nearly two years. They laughed at us and refused to 
answer our questions, so that we have not made much progress so 
far. We, of course, had to make deductions rather than rely on 
honest, clear and precise answers to our questions.
<P>
	There is a problem in a democratic society when a review 
committee, an external committee like SIRC, sees parliamentarians 
as the enemy. Rather, those people should see us as those who are 
responsible for public administration and for monitoring them, and 
should give us all the information they have without arguing. 
Unfortunately, such was not the case.
<P>
	It is with sadness that once again this year I must point out that 
the membership of SIRC has not been reviewed. We as the official 
opposition, and the hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley on behalf of the Reform Party, had asked that SIRC be a 
reflection of the 35th Parliament. Who are the members of SIRC, 
the Security Intelligence Review Committee? Only people who 
represent or were appointed on the recommendation of the Liberal 
Party of Canada or of other parties that are not even recognized any 
more in this House, namely the Progressive Conservative Party and 
the New Democratic Party. Since the beginning of the 35th 
Parliament, no one has been appointed on the recommendation of 
the Leader of the Opposition or the leader of the third party. This is 
not normal.
<P>
	How can we trust an organization that deals in this fashion with 
national security issues that may have a direct impact on 
democracy in Canada? The level of confidence is extremely low, 
and perhaps even non existent. Psychologists refer to ``basic trust''. 
The basic trust is no longer there. The basic trust required for an 
organization to function properly is gone; it has been gone for a 
long time.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	It is imperative to amend the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service Act so as to change, among others, the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee and decide on its membership at 
the beginning of each Parliament, based on the will expressed by 
Canadians through their ballots. It is not normal to see an 
organization such as this one represent political parties that were in 
place previously, instead of reflecting the current situation.
<P>
	Once again, I urge the minister to consider this request to review 
the act. We will, of course, support the measures we have been 
seeking for a long time. I will continue to raise this issue.
<P>
	I also want to point out the lack of co-operation between the 
government and the parliamentary sub-committee on national 
security. Throughout 1995, and for a good part of 1996, we 
benefited from the contribution of the hon. member for 
Scarborough West, who was a full-fledged member of this 
committee. His help allowed us to make major progress on the 
Heritage  Front 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2725"> 2725 </A></B>
<P>
issue, concerning which we should normally table a report. In fact, 
we are meeting this morning at eleven.
<P>
	I urge government authorities, and particularly the Solicitor 
General, to reinstate the member for Scarborough West as a 
full-fledged member of the national security sub-committee, so 
that we can arrive at a decision. The member was a regular at the 
committee, as well as a leader in the search for truth that we were 
obliged to conduct by inference, since we had little information to 
go on.
<P>
	I also ask the government to follow up on the unanimous wish of 
this House, as expressed by the adoption of Motion M-38, on 
March, 21, 1995, more than a year ago. The motion, tabled by the 
hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River, asked that the 
operations of the Communications Security Establishment, the 
CSE, be reviewed by an independent body. The CSE was set up 
during World War II, by order in council and, today, its operations 
are not monitored by anyone, except the Prime Minister's office 
and, from time to time, the office of the Minister of National 
Defence. The time has come to act, since the House sent a message 
to that effect.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we should amend the Standing Orders of the 
House of Commons, to make the Sub-committee on National 
Security a standing committee. The same members could sit on this 
standing committee and meet throughout the duration of a 
Parliament. They could have a much broader power of inquiry than 
they have now, including the powers to call witnesses, to order the 
production of documents and to carry out in-depth cross 
interrogations, thongs we cannot do right now. Were are a bit like a 
paper tiger and have become a laughing stock.
<P>
	Moreover, all reports submitted to the Solicitor General pursuant 
to section 54 of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act 
should also be forwarded to the Sub-committee on National 
Security for examination, in camera of course. Granting us this 
power would go a long way in enhancing the role we have to play 
as parliamentarians. Such a committee would provide a very 
efficient service and help all Canadians to regain confidence in the 
parliamentarians they have elected to run the country.
<P>
	We have one last request for the Solicitor General. We would 
like the government, through the Treasury Board, to act as soon as 
possible in order to grant, as requested by the current director of 
CSIS the money needed to pay the bilingual bonus to RCMP 
officers transferred to the service when it was first established in 
1984, as well as to other employees of the service. In a letter he 
sent us last Friday, the Solicitor General said that in order to pay 
these bilingual bonuses cuts within the service would be needed.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The thing is, we should not have to cut the services CSIS needs, 
rather we must inject the money needed, as  was done in the rest of 
the public service, in order to pay a bilingual bonus to the 
employees who deserve it and are entitled to it.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence and your patience 
and for giving me 20 additional seconds to conclude.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Reform Party I would like to 
take this opportunity to welcome the Solicitor General of Canada 
back to the House. Our prayers have been and continue to be with 
him.
<P>
	I am sure the minister knows better than the rest of us that the 
demands of government and the House do not wait for any one 
individual.
<P>
	Today we have the annual national security address. As is 
tradition, the minister has reminded us of some recent terrorist 
activity: last year's bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma 
City, poison gas attacks on the Tokyo subways, the recent 
assassination of the Prime Minister of Israel and the resumption of 
IRA bombings in London. Terrorism remains a worldwide 
problem.
<P>
	In addition, the media is usually full of tragedies arising from 
conflicts around the world. Many of these conflicts from faraway 
lands have implications here in Canada. Be it the Middle East, 
Bosnia, Somalia, Sri Lanka or Punjab, conflicts in these diverse 
locations impact on the emigre communities in Canada. While the 
overwhelming majority of immigrants or refugees from these areas 
are intent on starting new lives in Canada, a small majority involve 
themselves in activities supporting terrorist groups.
<P>
	As the minister stated in his address, Canada has joined the other 
G-7 nations to deal with terrorism. A document known as the 
Ottawa declaration calls on all states to renounce terrorism and 
deny financial support, including the use of territory, to terrorist 
organizations. While the government has congratulated itself on its 
efforts in this regard, its actual commitment has been somewhat 
underwhelming.
<P>
	The minister boasts of the government's efforts to fight terrorism 
and to pursue the objectives of the Ottawa declaration. However, I 
would like to draw the attention of the House back to last year 
around this time.
<P>
	On May 4, 1995 I asked the Minister of National Revenue about 
the Sikh militant group, the Babbar Khalsa, having charitable tax 
status. The minister's response was: ``I would be grateful if the 
hon. member would provide that information so that investigations 
can be carried out rather than simply making allegations of the type 
she has made today''.
<P>
	I attempted to follow up this issue on June 5, 1995. On that date I 
provided the Minister of National Revenue with photographs of the 
founder of the Babbar Khalsa,  surrounded by weapons, and a

statement in which Talwinder Singh Parmar declared that if anyone 
wanted to commit suicide he should board an Air India plane.
<P>
	The minister's response was a lame attempt at humour, stating 
that he felt it was contradictory for the Reform Party to be against 
terrorism at the same time that it was opposed to Bill C-68. That 
was the government's response to fundraising for terrorist groups a 
year ago.
<P>
	Fortunately things have changed. The Prime Minister went to a 
conference in Cairo and suddenly the government is concerned 
about fundraising for terrorist groups. As well, we have a new 
Minister of National Revenue. There are grand pronouncements 
about the tough action the government will take to stop the support 
of terrorism in Canada.
<P>
	Finally, on April 13, 1996 the government buried a small little 
notice in the Canada Gazette. The item was that Revenue Canada 
has withdrawn the charitable status of the Babbar Khalsa. A year 
ago the government thought it was a joke. Now it realizes that the 
Reform Party's concerns were valid right from the beginning.
<P>
	I am sure the minister is aware that there are a number of other 
groups involved in this kind of activity. Last week we heard that the 
RCMP had arrested one of its former translators on charges of 
attempting to obstruct justice and perjury. According to a police 
affidavit this individual was hired by the RCMP to translate 
wiretaps in a major investigation into a Tamil-speaking Sri Lankan 
forgery and alien smuggling group.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately for the RCMP, neither the translator nor the 
Mounties initial background check mentioned anything about his 
membership in the terrorist group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam, also known as the Tamil Tigers.
<P>
	The police stated: ``It is our belief that he tried to infiltrate the 
RCMP while a member of a terrorist organization''. The Mounties 
are concerned that the translator may have been working on 
sensitive documents relating to his homeland and they are now 
going through a damage control exercise.
<P>
	Who would have thought that a translator in one of the solicitor 
general's agencies was actually working against the interest of his 
employer? It is important for the government to live up to its 
commitment to stop individuals living in Canada from supporting 
terrorists overseas.
<P>
	The government cannot just talk about taking a stand against 
these activities, it must act and it must be seen to be acting. 
Burying announcements in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> is not sufficient. 
Let those involved know that their activities are unacceptable, 
make them illegal and prosecute them.
<P>
	The minister says in his statement that he cannot canvas all the 
activities of CSIS and the RCMP in support of national security and 
I do not imagine that he would have.
<P>
	In the May 12 edition of the Vancouver <I>Province</I> we learn that 
CSIS officers in British Columbia have been questioning Tamil 
leaders to determine if they are raising money to support guerrilla 
warfare in Sri Lanka. The response of the president of the Eelam 
Tamil Community Association of B.C. was that while he owes his 
allegiance to the Tamil Tigers, his group raises money only for 
humanitarian uses.
<P>
	A number of terrorist organizations do have a faction that is 
involved in humanitarian endeavours, but how much money goes 
to humanitarian efforts and how much money goes to terrorist 
activities is impossible to measure.
<P>
	If the government is serious about the Ottawa declaration, and if 
it is serious about the summit of peacemakers that took place in 
Cairo in March, it must make clear to everyone that support for 
terrorism will not be tolerated no matter what disguise it tries to 
take. Any organization that targets innocent civilians is a terrorist 
group and must be dealt with as such. The government may have to 
offend some individuals and groups to make that message loud and 
clear.

table a petition that was sent to me by the workers of MIL Davie. It 
reads as follows: ``Since 1990, the federal government has not 
contributed a single penny to the unemployment insurance 
program, which is funded entirely by workers and employers. 
Following legislative amendments made in 1990, 1993 and 1994, 
benefits paid have decreased, which has resulted in a large surplus 
in the UI fund. That surplus will reach an estimated $7 billion by 
the end of 1996. Ottawa wants to reduce benefits paid by a further 
$2 billion a year and use the UI fund surplus for its own purposes. 
We say no to drastic cuts in the unemployment insurance program 
and ask the House of Commons in Parliament assembled to 
withdraw this bill''.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCEACT">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (for Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-12, an act respecting 
employment insurance in Canada, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
employment insurance system set out in Bill C-12 is not just 
another version of the old UI program. It is in fact Canada's 
employment insurance system for the 21st century. It supports the 
government's agenda for jobs and growth. It is a system that 
Canadians themselves have helped to define and shape for the 
future.
<P>
	As we have mentioned in this House before, we have had 
extensive consultations not only on Bill C-12 but on the whole 
question of social security reform over the past year and one-half. 
Over and over again Canadians from all walks of life, from every 
possible kind of business, occupation or organization repeated one 
message loud and clear: the best form of security is a job.
<P>
	We have listened to that message. Employment insurance first 
and foremost is about jobs. It is about jobs in a very simple and 
direct way. It will make it easier for people to work longer and 
encourage employers to keep people in their jobs longer. It will 
help employers hire more workers. It will create more work and 
more jobs for Canadians. It will help increase the earned income of 
Canadian workers. Every part of this bill is focused on that goal. 
Let me give some examples.
<P>
	With EI insurance premiums, the tax on jobs will be lower. The 
premium cut and reduced maximum insurable earnings will save 
workers and employers over $1 billion in premium payments in 
this year alone. Streamlined administration and reporting 
requirements will save employers another $150 million and some 
300,000 small businesses will get a special temporary rebate so 
employers can afford to hire more workers.
<P>
	This system will support job creation instead of perpetuating 
unemployment. Income benefits are structured to make it easier for 
people to work longer  removing the barriers that sometimes keep 
people from accepting the jobs they need. This system is pro 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2728"> 2728 </A></B>
<P>
employment and makes work pay. Active employment benefits are 
there for those who lose their jobs and need help getting back to 
work.
<P>
	We will be reinvesting $800 million in the tools which help 
people help themselves and create employment opportunities for 
Canadians. As well, we are investing another $300 million in a 
transitional jobs fund to kick start employment in areas of high 
unemployment. Some 15,000 jobs for Canadians will be created as 
a result of this initiative.
<P>
	When the measures described in this bill are fully implemented, 
there will be 75,000 to 100,000 more jobs for Canadians. That is 
just part of the story.
<P>
	Employment insurance is an integral part of the government's 
broader vision for jobs and growth in this country. It is a growth 
agenda that sees economic growth going hand in hand with the best 
social security system in the world. Our agenda is based on creating 
a healthy economic climate for growth. We brought inflation down 
to its lowest level in 30 years. We are meeting and exceeding our 
deficit reduction targets. Our agenda recognizes Canada can 
compete with the best in the world.
<P>
	Over the past 14 months the government's Team Canada 
approach to international trade has brought $20 billion worth of 
new deals for Canadian exports. Every $1 billion in exports means 
11,000 jobs for Canadian workers. It can be seen that our agenda is 
beyond all doubt working. More than 600,000 new jobs have been 
created in this country since November 1993.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	As jobs and our economy grow, we must ensure that our social 
safety net keeps pace. That is the fundamental message in the 
government's budget. We are taking action to ensure that 
Canadians can continue to rely on a strong social safety net that is 
affordable, effective and in tune with the future.
<P>
	The bottom line is clear. This government is totally committed to 
bringing Canada into the 21st century with a strong and growing 
economy and the best social programs of any country in the world.
<P>
	Bill C-12 is part of that commitment. We want to make sure that 
employment insurance is not only pro employment, but balanced 
and fair for all Canadians. That is why we have listened very 
carefully to the comments and advice from Canadians throughout 
the hearings on this bill.
<P>
	We heard tremendous support for an insurance system that is 
truly focused on jobs and employment. We also heard some real 
concerns that the system would not be flexible enough to reflect the 
real job opportunities that  exist in different parts of Canada. We 
listened to those concerns and we have taken action.
<P>
	We recognize the need for a number of important amendments to 
the bill. For example, people from all parts of the country, from the 
New Brunswick Federation of Labour to the National Action 
Committee on the Status of Women to the Kativik Regional 
Government argued that the method proposed for calculating 
benefits was too inflexible.
<P>
	The amended divisor used to calculate benefits fixes that 
problem. As a result, EI will be more responsive to monthly 
changes in local employment conditions. That is a change that 
makes sense. It is a change that deserves our support.
<P>
	Many groups, especially those representing the concerns of 
workers in seasonal industries and students expressed serious 
concerns about the effects gaps in work would have under the new 
system. Under the amended system, EI claimants will have a longer 
reference period to put together the required weeks of work and 
gaps will not affect the outcome. For example, a person who needs 
15 weeks of work to qualify can look back over 26 weeks and 
ignore up to 11 empty weeks if necessary. Again, this is a change 
that makes good sense.
<P>
	Many people were concerned that the intensity rule which 
reduces the benefit rate for repeat users would be particularly hard 
on the most vulnerable and those in most need. In the amended 
system, people who receive the EI family income supplement will 
be exempt from the intensity rule. This will safeguard a basic level 
of EI income for low income claimants with family 
responsibilities.
<P>
	We will also take steps to address concerns about potential fraud 
and abuse of EI with stiffer sanctions and penalties for claimants 
and employers who break the rules in order to get benefits they are 
not entitled to.
<P>
	In all of these cases, we have listened closely to what Canadians 
are saying. The employment insurance system will be better as a 
result. It will be more flexible. It will be fairer. It will meet our 
savings targets. It will focus more effectively on our number one 
priority which always has been getting Canadians back to work.
<P>
	Jobs, economic growth, a strong and affordable safety net: these 
are priorities every Canadian shares. They are priorities we are 
resolutely committed to as a government. Employment insurance is 
one part, an important part of the action plan Canada needs to 
achieve those goals and to move with confidence into the next 
century. I urge all members at the end of today to support this bill. 
The fundamental changes in it are going to be good for Canadians 
for years and years to come.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
begin by saying that today, May 14, 1996, the day Bill C-12 will be 
passed, unless the government finally comes to its senses, will be 
one of deep shame for the Liberal party.
<P>
	This party helped give Canada a social security system, not the 
best in the world, it must be said, no, because overall we are a long 
way from the social measures generally available in Western 
Europe, but in North America, our system was the envy of many. 
Increasingly, this party is aligning its social measures with less 
progressive measures in the United States.
<P>
	Bill C-12, this deceptively named act respecting employment 
insurance, is an attack on the unemployment insurance system so 
appreciated by most Canadians and Quebecers, as we were 
reminded by an Angus Reid poll at the very beginning of the new 
Liberal reign, when it was setting out on what looked like a reform 
of social programs, a reform to improve social programs. That was 
before the first budget.
<P>
	This Angus Reid poll said that 70 per cent of Canadians and 
Quebecers, almost 80 per cent in the case of Quebec, wanted to 
keep this unemployment insurance system, and at the same time 
feared that the announced reforms, despite all the fine talk, were 
going to hurt those in the greatest need. Canadians and Quebecers 
were right.
<P>
	Although it will not be pleasant, I would like to remind members 
that, in his maiden speech, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development said that what was needed was a particularly 
Canadian formula so that, when the social program reform had 
achieved its goals, Canadians would be proud to be Canadians. He 
repeated this expression ad nauseam.
<P>
	Well, what we can say this morning is that, far from being proud, 
Canadians must be worried, deeply worried, except perhaps for 
those who have a steady job, who are working over 35 hours a 
week. But all the others, Canadians and Quebecers must be worried 
and anxious to hear what form this new system will take.
<P>
	It must not be forgotten that this bill, which is supposedly about 
employment insurance, comes in addition to a so-called reform 
from 1994, Bill C-17. That was a bill implementing the first 
Liberal budget since their return to power. That budget, that bill, 
slashed the unemployment insurance scheme by $2.4 billion 
starting in 1995, of which $735 million were to be cut in Quebec, 
and $630 million were to be cut, starting in 1995, in the Atlantic 
provinces.
<P>
	The effects of this new reform are in addition to those of the first 
reform. Once again, the word reform loses its meaning. 
``Counter-reform'' would be more  appropriate, because in most 
people's minds, a reform is something that improves a situation.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	In the two cases in question, the reform is no improvement. Far 
from it, it brings cuts. It cuts into the only little bit of security some 
people in Canada can count on, those who are not so fortunate as to 
be among those who enjoy total security or who are rich enough to 
be able to depend on investment profits and do not need to work. 
For every one else, unemployment insurance represents a bridge, 
rather a narrow one sometimes, and one that is not as long as it 
might be, but a bridge nonetheless, between two jobs.
<P>
	These cuts will total $4.4 billion, if we add up the $2.4 billion 
and the additional $2 billion of this ``new'' reform. This will make 
the Liberal Party of Canada look good the next time they seek a 
new mandate. They will be able to boast to Canadians and to 
Quebecers ``Look, we have cut UI benefits by $4.4 billion since 
1995, and Quebec-I am using the department's figures here-will 
lose $1.271 billion''. Keep in mind, now, that this is the 
department's evaluation of the figures involved in the amendment. 
By the way, no one but the department has any figures, so we have 
to rely on them. According to the department's numbers, by the 
time the plan matures in the year 2000, the Atlantic provinces will 
be $806 million worse off than before, every year.
<P>
	Adding up the two-this is interesting since the Atlantic 
provinces and Quebec together account for about one third of 
Canada's population-we get $2.1 billion of the $4.2 billion. And 
if we look at the portion of the cuts affecting the Atlantic provinces 
alone, $806 million out of $4.4 is quite a chunk.
<P>
	These cuts in benefits will mean less money going to the high 
unemployment areas. This means that one of the objectives when 
the plan was created after the 1929 depression, which was to have 
interregional adjustments, has more or less come down to nothing 
now. In the case of Quebec, Quebecers will figure out what it 
means, at some point. In this case of the Atlantic provinces, I trust 
they will draw some political conclusions. In many cases, I think it 
will be a considerable shock.
<P>
	I speak as a Bloc Quebecois member, but on this issue, as on 
many others we worked in opposition on behalf of all of the people 
of Canada. What is unacceptable about this change is that 
Canadians and Quebecers see this as a significant alteration to what 
they consider the role of unemployment insurance to be.
<P>
	Instead of discussing the disappearance of this interregional 
adjustment-which academics are demanding, saying that there is 
none in such and such a country because their constitution does not 
allow it-the government has decided to forgo discussions, to hold 
no debate whatsoever, just chopping it completely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2730"> 2730 </A></B>
<P>
	Since this move on the part of the government was obviously 
in the books, when I was in Toronto during the initial consultations 
I asked representatives of unions whose membership were in high 
pay brackets whether they were not fed up subsidizing workers 
in the Atlantic provinces. They did not say: ``Yes, we in Ontario 
are fed up with paying for the Atlantic provinces''. People in 
Canada, and I think I understand, realize the need for support 
among the regions. I repeat, this is what the Bloc Quebecois is 
saying. This example, like others, illustrates that there were no 
major debates on this reform.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	This reform, with even its name looking like some sort of 
camouflage, means open season. Calling it employment insurance 
camouflages it. Instead of bringing the unemployed, particularly 
the unemployed in regions with high unemployment, closer to a 
job, this reform will move them away from one.
<P>
	As this is the first opportunity we have had the time to give a 
decent speech in this House, I will use it to point out that the 
official opposition was prevented from playing its role at each 
stage. Here again, I can understand. The government doubtless did 
not want Canadians to be informed. All the same, a survey in 
Quebec indicates that the people have not been fooled by what is 
going on. This will be the subject of my conclusion.
<P>
	I wish to speak to all of Canada. I want to say that the first 
reform hit the Atlantic provinces hard. The second one is going to 
be even harder to swallow. I keep saying that the regions with high 
unemployment will be the ones hit.
<P>
	I would like to quote the tourism and economic development 
minister of Prince Edward Island. The province has a population of 
about 170,000 and is well placed to observe its labour market. So 
what does the minister of economic development have to say? He 
says, on the subject of financial repercussions: ``The previous stage 
of the unemployment insurance reform, which surely was not on 
the same scale as the present bill, has already had a significant 
impact on our province. In 1995, with the rate of unemployment 
such as it was, a person who qualified after 12 weeks' work 
received benefits for 32 weeks, making a total of 44 weeks. There 
were still, however, eight weeks where the person received no 
income''.
<P>
	The first demonstrations in the Atlantic provinces were not 
against the new reform, but against the implementation of the 
previous reform, which hit them hard. As a consequence of this 
first so-called reform, people did not have enough weeks of 
unemployment insurance to get through the year. They had to turn 
to welfare, which is very complex, because, if you are on welfare, 
sad to say, it is very hard to return to work.
<P>
	What does this brief say? It predated the amendments, but if we 
take off a few millions, a lot of what it says is still true. It says: ``In 
Prince Edward Island, the net loss of unemployment insurance 
benefits will thus reach $24 million in 2001-2002''. So, if we take 
off the maximum, let us say $8 million-I am being very generous, 
very conservative-there would be $16 million less.
<P>
	The minister went on to say: ``The economy of Prince Edward 
Island is, nevertheless productive. We are tops in Canada in job 
creation and we cannot absorb such a loss''. In other words, for all 
the regions that are not the top job creators in Canada, this reform 
will be devastating in macro-economic terms. It will widen the gap 
between the regions where people are relatively well off and the 
regions where unemployment is high, despite the fact that jobs may 
be created, but where there is less industry or business.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I talked about the regions, I now want to talk about individuals. 
Added to the previous reform-which leaves many seasonal 
workers with too few benefit weeks, forcing them on welfare for 
the rest of the year-cuts provided for by the present reform create 
a desperate situation for some.
<P>
	The workers who came last week from the Gaspé and Magdalen 
Islands sounded desperate. They were talking about their region, 
saying that they will no longer be able to keep young people. They 
are the ones who are leaving and when young people leave, the 
regions fall apart. The same is true in every region with a high 
unemployment rate. When young people leave, fewer services are 
provided. There is a shift in demographics and soon, only aging 
people are left, villages and towns die. This is what people came 
here to scream and cry about, saying that it did not make any sense.
<P>
	When I hear one of my colleagues laughing I think that either he 
has no heart, which I do not believe, or he has not studied the 
impact of this bill. It saddens me because people are going to be hit 
hard. It will affect many people. The impact will be felt by many 
other than seasonal workers, in spite of the amendments and what 
the government is claiming. The amendments speak volume about 
the original bill.
<P>
	It will affect all workers in the tourism sector, all those for whom 
one hour of paid work means many hours of unpaid work. They are 
legions in our society. I am thinking about all adult education 
teachers, this is true in every region, and all those who, in cities, 
towns, and villages, entertain, educate or instruct people who, for 
one reason or another, need such training.
<P>
	Usually, they are paid by the hour, without any firm contract and, 
without any exception, they will find themselves in a very 
precarious situation. Women will also be affected. The Fédération 
des femmes said that, yes indeed, 5 per cent more women working 
part time  would be covered, but being covered means that they will 
be paying, but as far as being entitled to benefits, that is a different 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2731"> 2731 </A></B>
<P>
story. On the other hand this bill will be very harmful for 25 per 
cent of those who now work 15 to 34 hours a week.
<P>
	And I have not yet mentioned artists, artisans and all those who 
barely survive on government programs, as well as pilots and flight 
attendants. There would not be time enough, 40 minutes would not 
suffice to name all those who will be affected.
<P>
	It is a radical transformation we are witnessing here and that 
transformation is contrary to the intention which prevailed when 
the unemployment insurance program was created. I would like to 
quote part of the speech Prime Minister Bennett made, in 1935, 
when he first tabled that bill. He said: ``To meet new needs, we will 
have to modify our capitalist system-we were just coming out of 
the great crash of 1929-and make it into a more useful instrument 
for the people. You will be studying measures creating a global 
plan which will reduce the present social and economic inequalities 
and distribute the benefits of the capitalist system more equitably 
among the various classes of our society and among the various 
regions of the country''.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Since the 1971 reform, we have witnessed a continuing 
reduction of benefits. I must say that it started under the 
Conservatives and the most serious change was cutting the system 
off from the consolidated revenue fund. That was bad enough.
<P>
	Researchers came before us and told us that an unemployment 
insurance system has an important stabilizing effect and we realize 
that when we look at others around the world. It has an economic 
stabilizing effect benefiting society as a whole, and it also has a 
redistributing effect. Over time maternity benefits and health 
benefits were added to the system. They are now adding in this 
so-called reform training benefits, which will no longer be paid 
from the consolidated revenue fund, but by the unemployment 
insurance fund. When we consider all of this, we wonder, we do not 
understand why the government reduced the maximum insurable 
earnings.
<P>
	It is not difficult to understand. It means that from now on, 
workers who make over $39,000 a year, will no longer contribute to 
unemployment insurance after that limit. They will pay on the first 
$39,000, but nothing after that. This is totally illogical. This is 
exactly the reverse of what we are doing with income tax.
<P>
	With income tax, the more you earn, the more you pay. For 
unemployment insurance contributions, the more you earn, the less 
you pay. Companies which are able to pay salaries of $39,000 or 
more are the ones receiving this gift. A gift of some $500 million a 
year is not inconsequential. Which employees and businesses  will 
pay for the equivalent of this gift? Employees who work from one 
to 15 hours per week and small businesses.
<P>
	It is not surprising small businesses are against these provisions. 
They agree with the reduction of maximum benefits, and we can 
understand their viewpoint, since a social viewpoint is something 
else. But this reduction of maximum insurable earnings does not 
make any sense.
<P>
	Many researchers came to tell us as well that this did not make 
any sense. It does not make sense because it reduces the pool of 
contributors. It does not make sense either because, while the 
government is making a huge gift to big businesses-a gift that 
totally eliminates premiums when salaries are over $39,000-it 
reduces by 0.05 per cent the premiums of contributors as a whole.
<P>
	If we look at what this means in concrete terms, for a small 
business, it will mean about $7 less per month for each worker if 
his salary is $200, while the gift to big businesses is total 
elimination of premiums. That goes against common sense, as is 
the case for a major part of this bill.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, could you tell me how much time I have left?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Fifteen minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde: </B>There is so much I could say about this bill.
<P>
	Researchers came to tell us this is a leap in the dark, because if 
you ask one economist to examine the effect of this measure, he 
will tell you one thing, but if you ask another economist to examine 
the effect of this measure, he will tell you something else. At least, 
Mr. Audenrode of Laval University said clearly: ``It is not so much 
any specific measure that concerns me but the extent and 
complexity of the proposed reform. If one can easily imagine the 
impact of a specific modification to one aspect of a given system, it 
is almost impossible to imagine the consequences of a reform as 
far-reaching as the one being proposed''.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	He went on to say: ``I am unable to give you even an indication 
of what would be the impact of the proposed reform, and I honestly 
think that no economist can do so''.
<P>
	When I asked senior officials what they thought of that 
statement, they told me: ``We in the department have an enormous 
file but we, of course, built this proposed reform on an econometric 
model''. That is the problem. What is the hurry? Why take the 
chance of seriously hurting regions and people, when there is no 
hurry? Why is there no hurry? Because the $5 billion surplus that is 
forecast for the end of this year without the reform would be less if 
the reform goes ahead. It would go down to $4.5 billion, so there is 
no hurry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2732"> 2732 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance cannot say: ``Hurry, Hurry, Hurry. The 
deficit is at stake''. That is not true. This year, the reform will 
reduce the surplus by $1 billion. This figure comes from the 
Department of Human Resources Development itself. I even took 
the trouble of confirming it with the actuary, to make sure I was 
reading it right.
<P>
	On page 6.6 of the most recent summary of the unemployment 
insurance account, it says that, as expected, revenues from current 
contributions for 1996 amount to $19.801 billion. Note 2 adds the 
following that since premiums are collected on the basis of the 
maximum weekly insurable earnings-reduced without having 
passed any legislation to that effect-the government currently 
collects less money than what the act provides. Consequently, 
expected premiums should reach $18.806 billion, or one billion 
less.
<P>
	So, this year, the reform will result in a $1 billion shortfall. Why 
hurry to take such an enormous risk? As the researcher mentioned, 
it is a leap in the dark.
<P>
	He adds: ``All these financial estimates are made by applying the 
new parameters to existing patterns''. However, as he points out, 
these patterns will change. For example, I do not agree with the fact 
that people who currently work up to 15 hours per week are not 
covered by an unemployment insurance system. Yet, from now on, 
these people will have to pay premiums, unless they earn less than 
$2,000-and I will get back to this-but will not be entitled to 
benefits.
<P>
	What will restaurant owners do? It is true that a large proportion 
of their peak hours staff works less than 15 hours. We all know how 
things works in a restaurant. Albert the waiter gets a phone call: 
``Come. Stay home. The restaurant is full. It is quiet''. When 
restaurant owners will have to do all the related accounting, do you 
think they will continue to hire students? No. This is why the 
student federation asked for an exemption.
<P>
	We have to realize that even though those who earn less than 
$2,000 will get a refund for their premiums, this repayment will 
only take place the following year, when they file their income tax 
returns. Students can no longer get an exemption. Their tuition fees 
are increasing, but they will be deprived of an amount equivalent to 
the unemployment insurance premiums they will have paid. They 
definitely do not need that.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Behaviour will change. Some jobs will disappear. We can hope 
that weekly wages will go up, but one very important thing is that it 
will be at a cost. Why has the time not been taken? There is no rush. 
Or are they in such a rush to reduce benefits from $445, the present 
amount, to $413, which is what they will be when the new act 
comes into force.
<P>
	Are they in such a hurry that they must take the risk they are 
taking? Let us not forget that the unemployment  insurance system 
is the best way to stabilize the economy. What is stabilizing about 
it? The benefits, the premiums, play no small role, according to 
Peter Duncan, associate professor, Department of Economics, 
University of Toronto. It is an excellent stabilizer, better than 
income tax, much better than income tax. The benefits have a 
stabilizing effect. What does the government do? I repeat, it 
reduces benefits by $4.4 billion over a period of five years.
<P>
	Why is the government lowering the maximum insurable 
earnings. Many researcher said they were worried about this 
change. Is it because the government wants to leave the lucrative 
market of workers earning over $39,000 to the private insurance 
sector? is it because, as the deputy minister told us, of these $900 
million paid by workers and businesses for those earning between 
$39,000 and $42,400, a very large portion remains in the Fund?
<P>
	The deputy minister had the nerve to say that those earning over 
$39,000 were less likely to lose their job and that they would 
withdraw only $200 million of the $900 million paid. It is good that 
those who have higher and more stable earnings contribute to the 
general economic and financial balance, while at the same time 
paying their share for maternity leave, educational leave and so on.
<P>
	This unemployment insurance plan is the only mechanism 
carrying people over from one job to the next. With this bill, the 
government is making it twice as hard for those who are already on 
the labour market to qualify, and three times as hard for young 
people, women, immigrants, the sick and anyone who is not 
already on the labour market.
<P>
	Why make access more difficult? Why divide the applicable 
earnings by a fixed divider or by the number of weeks worked, 
which can only have the effect-the effect sought by the 
government, it said so itself-of reducing benefits? Why reduce 
benefits? Why reduce the number of weeks? Why make access 
more difficult when already less than 50 per cent of the 
unemployed are covered by this plan?
<P>
	Is it not obvious that this is messing up not only the stabilizing 
effect it has on the economy as a whole, but also whatever little 
protection enjoyed by those who are not rich or do not have the 
armour-clad job security public service employees have? It is the 
only protection they have; they have nothing else.
<P>
	As you know, between 25 and 30 per cent of all Canadian 
workers rely on the unemployment insurance system each and 
every year. This bill will affect millions of people.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Why is the government in such a hurry? Why did it gag the 
opposition as it did? We did not get to debate the bill in second 
reading. Six 10-minute speeches. We were  gagged at committee 
stage, and again at report stage. All the time we have for third 
reading is one day and, on the government's side, since they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2733"> 2733 </A></B>
<P>
gagging us instead of having the decency to let us speak, they are 
taking their sweet time. That is disgusting, because there is no rush.
<P>
	Why are they in a hurry? There is something fishy, do you not 
think? Why do you think they are in such a hurry to cut 
contributions and benefits, when all those concerned, all the groups 
at various levels are protesting and asking that they not go so fast, 
but rather take the time to consult them and to develop a real 
program? What is the rush? Why are they in such a hurry to cut $1 
billion in contributions? Why are they in such a hurry to see 
minister Martin reduce his deficit?
<P>
	Whether the reform takes place or not, next year more will be 
added to the $5 billion surplus already accumulated in the 
unemployment insurance fund. This can certainly not explain the 
government's haste.
<P>
	We must however note that, having done everything it could, up 
to and including using its parliamentary powers to the limit, the 
official opposition did not succeed in making government listen.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that there have been demonstrations like 
we had not seen in a very long time. These protestors, in Quebec 
and especially in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia-considering 
all the demonstrations, the 40,000 postcards we tabled, the 
petitions, the number of people who have expressed their 
opposition largely exceeds 100,000-succeeded in slightly 
softening the blow, because what was totally disgraceful has been 
slightly changed. However, the total package remains 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Throughout the day, my colleagues will focus on measures like 
this one. Indeed, those with two jobs will be able to take all their 
hours of work into account, but should be wary of voluntarily 
leaving one of their two jobs because they would then lose all the 
insurable weeks of work accumulated until then. This is a measure 
that totally contradicts the spirit the government claims is behind 
this reform.
<P>
	What is most dangerous and difficult is hearing hon. members 
opposite brag about this reform. What I understand, and what some 
are happy about, is that they managed to modify certain measures 
so that they are no longer totally disgraceful. They are quite happy 
with that, although the total package remains unacceptable. They 
could have carried out a real reform. They could have maintained 
the maximum insurable earnings or increased them. They could 
even have made a distinction between maximum benefits and 
maximum insurable earnings, as is done in the tax system and in 
other areas. It is not because people some will contribute more that 
they will be entitled to receive larger benefits in various areas. But 
they did not have the right to sabotage something Canadians and 
Quebecers care about, their security, which they are willing to pay 
for.
<P>
	The poll results that appeared in this morning's <I>Le Devoir</I> are 
extremely interesting, despite the trouble we had breaking through 
the sound barrier. To the question: ``Who will benefit the most from 
UI reform?'', 79 per cent of respondents answered ``the federal 
government itself''. To the other question: ``In the case of Quebec 
workers, would you like the UI program to be administered by the 
Quebec government?'', 74.5 per cent answered yes.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	People now understand that a true reform is possible and that, 
with this one, Quebec workers are being deprived of the 
much-praised ``Canadian spirit'' of sharing the disadvantages and 
consequences of unemployment.
<P>
	Quebec workers, like their counterparts in Atlantic Canada, 
understand that this reform will reduce interregional adjustments 
and impede efforts to reduce the gap between the haves and the 
have-nots. Quebecers value the system, as the poll showed, and I 
think that if we put the same questions to Canadians, we will get 
the same results: Canadians value the system. Quebecers value it 
and they feel the best way to avoid its deterioration is to take it 
over.
<P>
	Personally, I regard as a failure the fact that members opposite 
refused all discussion. They failed to save what deserved to be 
saved in this country we want to keep as a partner.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I was listening to the speeches of my hon. colleagues 
from the government and the Bloc, I was struck by the chasm that 
exists in our country. Essentially the Bloc looks at this legislation 
as a welfare scheme or as a guaranteed annual income, but the 
notion of employment or unemployment insurance is secondary to 
income support.
<P>
	The government, represented by the parliamentary secretary to 
the minister, the member for Kenora-Rainy River, who, on 
introduction of third reading of a bill of such import and 
magnitude, was exceedingly brief in his comments. He managed to 
say nothing in 12 or 13 minutes while the member representing the 
Bloc was able to say it in 40 minutes.
<P>
	This unemployment or employment insurance creature has been 
flopping around in the body politic for years and years. It took its 
early form, the revision of unemployment insurance, in the now 
famous Forget report. The Forget report, as everyone realizes, is 
collecting dust somewhere in the murky, musty archives of 
Parliament. Forget said it would not be a bad idea if unemployment 
insurance was just that. That was the idea behind employment 
insurance in the first place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2734"> 2734 </A></B>
<P>
	This new government decided that the cornerstone of its renewal 
of social programs would address employment insurance. It would 
do what it had to do and return unemployment insurance to its 
lofty ideals of being employment insurance.
<P>
	What do we have here? We have half a loaf. What we really have 
is an abdication of leadership, an abdication of responsibility, an 
abdication of the necessity on the part of people elected to 
Parliament to speak honestly, to lead, to do what is right for the 
country and for future generations.
<P>
	What is this all about? I can best describe this by referring to the 
most obvious change in this legislation. For years in Canada we 
have had unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance was 
supposedly insurance paid for by employees and employers to 
protect those who were without jobs on a temporary basis while 
they were looking for new jobs.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	What do we do? We change the name. Did we change anything 
else? Perhaps. What is the cornerstone? `Poof', we change the 
name from unemployment insurance to employment insurance.
<P>
	This name change is to put the emphasis where it should be, on 
employment, and `poof', magically all the problems are to 
disappear. Guess what? They will not disappear. They will stay 
right where they are, festering in the middle of the body politic in 
Canada because we are not addressing them honestly. We are not 
dealing with the real problems. All we are doing is skirting around 
the politically correct edges.
<P>
	Once again we have the opportunity to actually do something. 
Once again we do not. First and foremost, the responsibility for 
training, for unemployment insurance, is a provincial 
responsibility, not a federal responsibility. It should rest closest to 
the people. It should rest in the provinces.
<P>
	What is the responsibility of the federal government? The 
responsibility of the federal government is to look at our nation and 
ensure that where employment opportunities exist in one part of the 
country, it is possible for people to get there. We remove barriers 
for the movement of people. Jobs do not go to the people, people go 
to the jobs. Water does not run up hill, water runs down hill.
<P>
	During the course of human history, when has it ever worked that 
someone would reverse the natural dynamics of nature and have it 
work in the long term? That is not the way it works.
<P>
	Let me give an illustration. Over the past six or so years, 87 per 
cent of the new jobs created in Canada were created in the two 
western most provinces, British Columbia and Alberta. Yet those 
two provinces have only 22 per cent of the population.
<P>
	Ontario and Quebec combined in the same period created 14 per 
cent of the new jobs, yet they have approximately 67 per cent of the 
total population of the country.
<P>
	Let us figure this out. If British Columbia and Alberta over the 
past few years have created and accounted for 87 per cent of the 
new jobs created in Canada, and generally speaking Alberta and 
B.C. are not areas of high unemployment and therefore do not get 
the benefit and their citizens have to work longer in order to 
qualify, what is it about the current system enhancing a situation in 
which the provinces with the lowest rate of employment, the 
maritimes, continue to suffer?
<P>
	Are we creating dependence? It seems the evidence is very clear. 
It has been clear since the 1970s, since some muddled thinking that 
somehow we can evolve through a situation of the equality of 
circumstance. The bottom line is we have the equality of 
opportunity. Circumstance is earned. It is regrettable but true that if 
someone lives in a part of the country that does not have an 
employment base and has not had an employment base, it is very 
likely it will not have an employment base.
<P>
	If someone wants better for their children, it is evident the 
children or the family will have to make whatever adjustments to 
their lives are necessary in order to see that better future. That is the 
way it has been on earth since the beginning of time.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	How does one suppose we came to Canada in the first place? 
Does anyone believe my ancestors came from Ireland, Scotland or 
wherever because things were good? Of course not. They came to 
Canada for a better opportunity for themselves and their children. 
Why does anyone think people moved from one part of the country 
to another? It was for the opportunity for themselves and their 
children.
<P>
	While we try to create a situation in which water will flow up hill 
and we see from evidence that it does not flow up hill, we see that 
by creating dependence all it does is foster the need for more 
independence, why should we be surprised when we keep coming 
back to these same problems time after time?
<P>
	In his opening remarks the member for Kenora-Rainy River 
referred to the introduction of this act, changes to unemployment 
insurance, as part of the social program envelope. That is the 
problem. Employment insurance is not a social program. 
Employment insurance is no more a social program or should be no 
more a social program than automobile insurance is a social 
program; insurance is insurance.
<P>
	Employment insurance should be exactly that, employment 
insurance. The premiums should reflect the risk. The insurance 
paid should reflect the amount of money paid in and the period of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2735"> 2735 </A></B>
<P>
time over which that  money has been paid in. It should have some 
bearing somewhere on reality.
<P>
	If we are not using the unemployment insurance system for 
anything other than unemployment, how do we go about getting 
money to those Canadians who must have it? If that means we will 
have a guaranteed annual income, that we will call it welfare and 
that we have to do whatever we have to do but deal honestly and do 
it, that is how this debate should be framed and that is what we 
should be talking about.
<P>
	However, to put together a program called unemployment 
insurance which is paying out, as members from the Bloc have 
pointed out, this year alone about $5 billion more than is being 
taken in into general revenues, that is nothing more than a tax. That 
is a top line payroll tax that goes right into the federal treasury 
which is a job killer of the first magnitude.
<P>
	Why do I say it is a job killer of the first magnitude? It is because 
in my past and real life I am an entrepreneur. I have had to live with 
licence fee increases for the cost of being in business. 
Unemployment insurance has absolutely diddly squat to do with 
the profitability of a business. We are not paying these taxes based 
on how profitable we are. We are paying these taxes based on how 
many people we employ.
<P>
	In a certain circumstance where a business is barely hanging on, 
like that proverbial cod fish on the Grand Banks, by its fingernails, 
as many small businesses are doing on daily, monthly basis, when 
the cost of staying in business goes up because the government 
imposes yet another tax that has nothing whatsoever to do with 
profitability, what does an employer do?
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Employers look at the books and say this will end up costing us 
$30,000 a year in payroll taxes. For them to get $30,000 a year they 
will have to increase their sales. If they make a 5 per cent or a10 per cent profit on their bottom line, that means they will have to 
increase their revenue by 10 times or 20 times to accommodate the 
increased taxes. In many cases that does not work out to a 1 per 
cent increase in gross sales but to a dramatic increase in gross sales 
in order to get enough profit to trickle down to the bottom line in 
order to pay yet another tax.
<P>
	What do they do? They do not simply get up in the morning and 
say ``I see my costs have gone up and so I will raise my prices''. 
The trouble is they cannot raise their prices. Most businesses are 
not suffering from a lack of competition. There is no price 
elasticity in the vast majority of businesses.
<P>
	What happens? The only thing that can possibly happen. If their 
costs have increased by $30,000 they will have to reduce their 
expenses by $30,000. Can they reduce their rent? No. Can they 
reduce all the other fixed costs? No. What is the variable? 
Employees. Another full  time job is lost. They could have more 
part time workers. They are paying the payroll taxes but instead of 
having a 40 hour work week, everybody will get paid on an hourly 
basis for the hours they actually work. It is a vicious circle. There 
will be more part time employment.
<P>
	That this is not as obvious as the nose on the face of the 
government is a reflection that the vast majority in this place have 
never signed a paycheque. They do not have a clue as to how our 
economy works or why it works. That is what keeps getting us into 
this mess time after time. To take $5 billion a year out of the 
economy on a payroll tax so the government can look better on its 
deficit projections is wrong. It is wrong for the country. It creates a 
vicious circle. There will be less employment, not more.
<P>
	How does the current unemployment system work? Will this 
change anything? Many employees in the system do not look at 
being on unemployment insurance as a temporary transition 
measure. It is not considered wrong to use unemployment 
insurance as a transition method to go from one job to another. If a 
person does not like their job they will go on pogey until they get a 
new job.
<P>
	Employers use the system to lay people off. It is easier to say to 
someone ``we will lay you off. I do not want to fire you and have a 
confrontation. We will get busier again in the summer. Maybe we 
will hire you again and maybe we will not''.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance today is misused by employers and 
employees. People working on a full time basis in a job that does 
not pay significant income, which encompasses virtually all of the 
people in the service sector in our country, may find themselves in 
a catch-22 situation. They may be earning around $15,000 a year 
and paying unemployment insurance to subsidize those who work 
on a seasonal basis and may earn $30,000 or $40,000 a year.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	If someone is earning on a seasonal basis twice as much as 
someone working on a full time basis, is it appropriate for the 
lower paid person to be subsidizing the incomes of those higher 
paid people? It does not seem right to me. As a matter of fact, it 
seems kind of dumb to me.
<P>
	If unemployment insurance were put on the basis that had been 
envisioned, it would be insurance paid by the employee and a tax 
on employers. If the premiums reflected the use of the program, 
that is, the number of times people dipped in and came out of the 
program and how much they took out of it, it would be the kind of 
program it was intended to be.
<P>
	Another concern has been raised by the changes in the bill. How 
do Canadians who need to get into the employment base get 
training? Where does the money come from? As it stands, one 
cannot access programs delivered by UI unless one has an 
attachment to the  labour force. What about all the people who do 
not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2736"> 2736 </A></B>
<P>
have attachment to the labour force? How do they go about 
qualifying for these programs?
<P>
	We have to look at our responsibilities as a nation and figure out 
how we can best provide entrepreneurs and businesses with a 
population well educated and highly trained in a diverse range of 
skills. How best can this be done in harmony with the provinces? 
How can we address the needs of training, upgrading and the 
provision of skills to those Canadians most in need?
<P>
	I speak now specifically of persons with disabilities. They are 
totally left outside the loop on this. How can they be provided with 
the tools which will allow them to be trained and retrained in the 
workforce leading into the 21st century and what will be the nature 
of the work?
<P>
	We will have to decide whether we are going to address issues 
honestly. As the nature of work changes, the skill level required to 
be able to participate in a meaningful way and to make a good 
income is going to require consistent change, training and 
retraining. A good number of workers who through no fault of their 
own, or through misguided promises by people in political office, 
will find themselves on the outside looking in.
<P>
	As we look to the nature of work there will be fewer and fewer 
people making more and more money. The middle class will 
continue to erode and there will be a polarization, which is already 
taking place today, between the haves and the have-nots in our 
society. It is because of the changing nature of work.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	If we accept this premise to be true-there are those who would 
say that it is not true-then we will have to wrap ourselves around 
the notion that it is our responsibility to consider ways to ensure a 
minimum level of income for all Canadians. This would ensure 
dignity and provide a foundation so the immediately affected 
generation and future generations would not get caught in the spiral 
of ever-increasing dependency, of intergenerational dependency on 
others for their self-respect or their sense of well-being or their 
daily bread.
<P>
	We must have a country in which our interdependence is built on 
a foundation of independence. A foundation of independence 
cannot be established in a country that fosters the notion of the 
equality of circumstance.
<P>
	Our responsibility is to ensure that people have opportunity by 
providing education and training. It is up to the individual to make 
use of that education and the training. If individuals are not 
prepared or are incapable of doing that, then we would not have the 
equality of circumstance. The thinking of the sixties, no matter 
how utopian the ideal is, cannot be delivered. It is not honest to 
suggest that it can be delivered because it cannot. To my 
knowledge, never in the history of the modern world has any 
regime been able to deliver on that promise.
<P>
	I would like to reflect on the importance of this bill and how it 
made its way through the parliamentary system and on the effect of 
closure.
<P>
	Closure may have a more insidious potential in the body politic 
than just getting legislation through the House or just preventing 
members from having the opportunity to get on their feet and say a 
few words about it. It is my opinion that items such as this bill or 
anything which comes through the ministry that is responsible for 
this bill, which accounts for the vast proportion of all the 
discretionary spending on the social side of the envelope, is by far 
the most important side.
<P>
	Last week we dealt with Bill C-33 concerning sexual orientation. 
It was explosive. It was a sad day for many people on both sides of 
the House. It went through in very short order and now it is over 
and done with.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	However, the legislation we are talking about today really speaks 
to the kind of society we will have in a pluralistic sense. With this 
bill and others that come through HRD, we talking about how we 
can fashion a society that rewards entrepreneurship and initiative, 
but at the same time looks after those who are less able to look after 
themselves. That is the measure of a society. The worth of a society 
is measured by how it looks after the weakest, not the strongest.
<P>
	As these debates take place we must be cautious of what we are 
doing. The foundations put down today are the ones that will allow 
the economy to grow and prosper. It can be done, in my opinion, by 
ensuring that nothing robs individual Canadians of the 
responsibility, the ability or the desire to provide for themselves, 
their children and their future. As a society we should recognize 
our responsibility to the common good to look after those who need 
help and make the distinction between wants and needs. We look 
after those in need. Those in want must look after themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Madam Speaker, a point of order. I would like to let 
the House know that throughout the rest of the day on third reading 
of this bill, members on the government side will be sharing their 
time equally, 10 and 5.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss Bill C-12, the 
legislation to bring into being Canada's new employment insurance 
system.
<P>
	Of the many improvements brought about by Bill C-12, the most 
important is its impact on Canada's young people. Youth is a 
priority concern for the government's job and growth agenda and 
Bill C-12 neatly reflects that concern.
<P>
	The employment insurance legislation not only provides more 
effective treatment for young workers in terms of benefits, but also 
provides positive, active  measures to help young people get and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2737"> 2737 </A></B>
<P>
keep good jobs. For young people a great problem with the 
current UI system is that it often fails to recognize their actual 
working effort.
<P>
	UI measures work in terms of weeks which is a very poor 
measure of time spent on the job, particularly for part time workers 
and multiple job holders.
<P>
	Within the hours based system provided in Bill C-12, part time 
workers earnings are insured and four out of ten part time workers 
are under 25 years of age. Another inequity under UI has been the 
employer's tendency to limit part time employment to less than15 hours per week per person in order to avoid having to pay UI 
premiums. For many young people this has meant not only do they 
get less work, but that their earnings are not insured.
<P>
	Employment insurance eliminates this 15-hour trap. All hours 
will now count toward eligibility. More young people who enter the 
labour market after leaving school and who must rely on a number 
of small jobs to earn a living will now have insurable work.
<P>
	Further, an impact which particularly benefits young people is 
the fact that employment insurance also reduces the risk of workers 
developing a dependency on employment insurance. Far too many 
young people come into the labour market and end up on UI 
benefits before completing their education. Then they find 
themselves in another sort of trap where they work long enough to 
qualify for benefits then go without work for as long as the benefits 
last.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The new employment insurance system will discourage this 
behaviour pattern. It will in fact encourage young people to 
complete their education rather than dropping out to take short 
term, often low paying work that does not lead to career 
advancement.
<P>
	Higher entrance requirements under employment insurance 
encourage young people to develop a stronger attachment to the 
labour market. We have heard loud protests from the opposition 
about the concept of higher entrance requirements. Far from being 
draconian, these very measures have been recommended to the 
government by many many groups.
<P>
	For example, two recent reports were quite specific. The report 
of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
recommended longer qualifying periods to encourage young 
workers to remain attached to the workforce longer and to improve 
their career prospects. The working group on seasonal work and 
unemployment insurance also recommended stiffer entrance 
requirements for young people.
<P>
	In the process of designing this legislation, the government 
listened to the concerns of Canadians in all regions and all walks of 
life in more than two years of  consultations. Town hall meetings, 
seminars and policy workshops were held. Phone lines were 
opened and the Internet was put to work. Through these and other 
channels including open line radio shows, Canadians told us what 
they wanted. It was social security reform.
<P>
	The minister invited the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development to further examine ways to improve the 
legislation. More than 100 witnesses from across the country were 
heard and nearly 150 briefs were received, analysed, digested and 
studied very carefully by members of the committee. The purpose 
once again was to listen carefully to Canadians' views on fine 
tuning the employment insurance legislation to ensure that the 
system is fair, to be sure that the system is balanced and reflects the 
varying labour market conditions across the regions of Canada.
<P>
	In this process the work incentive provisions of the bill have 
been strengthened. Changes have been made to make the system 
fairer to youth, fairer to women, fairer to the low income families 
and fairer to workers in seasonal industries.
<P>
	There are other ways in which Bill C-12 will benefit young 
people. Contributions to EI for example will have minimal impact 
on young people. For instance a student working 14 hours a week at 
$7 per hour would pay less than $3 per week in premiums. The 
hours will now be insured which will help meet entrance 
requirements when entering the labour market full time. Premiums 
will be refunded to about 625,000 young people, 49 per cent of all 
of those who receive rebates. Of the total young people receiving 
rebates, 400,000 will be full time students.
<P>
	Again let us look at the benefit side. Total benefits paid out under 
EI will be less and benefits paid out to young people by the year 
2001-02 will decrease by 6 per cent. This is considerably less than 
the forecast overall decrease of 9 per cent.
<P>
	We should not forget that EI is a two pronged program: income 
support for the unemployed coupled with employment benefits to 
help people get back to work and to get productive work. Targeted 
wage subsidies for example will help young people who qualify for 
employment insurance benefits to get needed work experience to 
qualify for more stable or permanent jobs.
<P>
	The government has recognized the problems facing Canada's 
youth and has set in motion a process leading to a national youth 
strategy which will be announced this fall. The member for North 
York has been appointed chairman of the ministerial task force on 
youth which is now holding consultations to gather public input for 
such a strategy.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	The task force is now holding town hall type meetings across the 
country hosted by local members of Parliament and senators. Such 
a meeting is to be held in  my riding of Thunder Bay-Atikokan on 
May 23. In this way we can participate directly, solicit the views of 
our constituents and our young people and shape an effective 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2738"> 2738 </A></B>
<P>
strategy to permit youth to fulfil their vital role in our future asa nation.
<P>
	Bill C-12 and the government's initiatives for young people aim 
at giving young people hope, hope that they will be better equipped 
to take their rightful and productive place in the future of our 
country.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will have 
the opportunity to rise several times today to ask a question or 
make a comment.
<P>
	There is something bothering me in what the hon. member just 
said. Could he tell me how seasonal workers will benefit from the 
so-called training tools that he raved about at the end of his speech 
and that are supposed to be included in this bill?
<P>
	There seems to be an inconsistency in the member's speech. 
First, Quebec has always maintained that manpower training 
should come under provincial jurisdiction. Therefore, I cannot see 
how the federal government could boast about promoting 
manpower training. Second, I represent a region that relies heavily 
on seasonal industries. It is not our fault if the water is frozen in the 
wintertime and we cannot fish. The same logic applies if you plant 
or cut trees in the bush.
<P>
	These workers have noble occupations too. They do not need 
additional training to do their work. Sure, they learn and improve 
their skills every year, but this in itself will not extend their season. 
The purpose of training is to increase the work period. How does 
the bill before us, and on which we will vote this evening, benefit 
people from these regions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the interesting 
question the hon. member raised. The areas of concern he 
presented have been discussed time and time again. There is 
nothing new as far as the answers are concerned.
<P>
	We know that training is going to be the responsibility of the 
provincial governments. We know that the federal government will 
become a partner in any model the provincial governments 
develop. They will get the full support of the federal government.
<P>
	The federal government in this bill definitely recognizes the 
responsibility of the provincial governments in programs for 
retraining, for the development of new skills, for the development 
of new avenues of hope with our young people and even our more 
elderly people who are searching for new careers. There is 
provision in the bill for the opportunity to create new models for 
those in seasonal employment situations, whether it be a 
supplement or whether the  individual who is unemployed takes 
another type of job and receives a lower income which will be 
topped off with supplements.
<P>
	There are avenues available for the creative mind. All we have to 
do, and the bill permits us to do it, is sit down in partnership and 
come up with solutions in which all Canadians in these different 
situations will benefit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
a short question for the hon. member. First, I remind him that there 
are many people who are unemployed in this country, and many 
more, perhaps twice as many, who are on welfare. In the answer he 
just gave to my colleague, the member essentially said that the 
federal government should continue to do what it is doing, namely 
to dump its responsibilities onto the provinces and let them fend for 
themselves.
<P>
	The government wants the provinces to provide job 
opportunities to the unemployed and welfare recipients, through 
their programs. However, it reduces its transfers to the provinces 
by $7 billion.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree that the federal government should 
constantly offload onto the provinces the problems that it cannot 
solve?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Madam Speaker, it is no shock to me the kind of 
question that is being raised. The member from the Bloc party is 
advocating that all responsibilities should be passed on to the 
Quebec provincial government. Then when we do give more 
responsibilities to the provincial government we hear complaints 
that we are abdicating our responsibility from the federal level. You 
cannot have your cake and eat it too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, before I get into my own comments, I want to 
commend you on the many interventions you have made on this bill 
on behalf of the people in Madawaska-Victoria. I did not want 
that to go unstated.
<P>
	Every time I get up to speak to this bill and talk about some 
amendments we have proposed I seem to get distracted. I must 
admit to being distracted again.
<P>
	My colleague from Gaspé in putting a question to my colleague 
from Thunder Bay asked what this bill does for seasonal workers. 
Very specifically, the bill puts value on their work rather than on 
their week. Someone who works more than 35 hours a week 
benefits from this bill. Even the CLC, which has not been an ardent 
supporter of this piece of legislation from the beginning, 
acknowledged that.
<P>
	I am sure the economy in the riding of my colleague is not 
significantly different from that of the province of New Brunswick. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2739"> 2739 </A></B>
<P>
I am prepared to acknowledge and have  acknowledged weaknesses 
in the bill where they exist. However, I would also expect that we 
have to acknowledge the existing strengths in the bill.
<P>
	I believe the member specifically asked whether the government 
expected to extend the seasons. No. What we need to do is to 
extend the value of work. People who work 70 hours in a week 
because they work in a seasonal industry should get the benefit of 
those 70 hours of work. Those hours of work are very common in 
the kinds of industries in the communities we represent. With this 
bill, a 70 hour work week, based on conventional applications of 
UI, is worth two weeks. It is that simple.
<P>
	In my own constituency generally the result will be that someone 
will get in with one and one-half fewer weeks of work because the 
value will be on hours and they will get as much as two weeks more 
of benefit. I accept the fact that if someone has not been a part of 
the labour force it is going to be tougher. However, we have to 
recognize where the value is.
<P>
	I have mentioned the value of the shift from weeks to hours. In 
our case I believe that 85 per cent or 87 per cent of the labour force 
in the province of New Brunswick works more than 35 hours a 
week. That speaks to how many people will be advantaged by this.
<P>
	Another benefit is the low income supplement. Very specifically, 
if the family income is less than $26,000 the benefits that will go to 
that family will increase by up to 13 per cent. For a single person 
that will not happen and I accept that, but let us recognize the 
strengths in the bill where they exist.
<P>
	Finally, with the human resources investment fund, people who 
have not had access to programs before will have access to 
programs because there is a reach back. I am sure the member for 
Gaspé knows exactly what I am referring to. In the past, people 
who were not eligible for benefits were not eligible for the 
program. Now if someone has been on UI for the past three years or 
on sickness or maternity in the last five years they will be eligible 
for employment benefits. That is a significant improvement in the 
program.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I would like to get back to some of the comments by the member 
from Edmonton. He spoke of the need for an honest debate. He 
very nicely positioned himself and his party in terms of this debate. 
Basically he said if one cannot find work in Cape Breton or 
northern New Brunswick or in Quebec, move. They should where 
the work is.
<P>
	I find that an unacceptable solution. We have a larger obligation 
than that. I have a lot of respect for the member from Edmonton 
and we share similar views on many things, but we do not share 
similar views on that.
<P>
	He spoke of the need for a national guaranteed income. I have 
supported that concept for many years.  What would he say to those 
people who say a national guaranteed income will create 
dependency? Basically they will throw his argument right back at 
him on that question. I would not throw that argument back at him. 
I agree with those concepts. I agree we have a larger collective 
responsibility to each other.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to the fact that very often people take 
UI just because they do not like their job. It has been my experience 
that it is not the case. People on UI would much sooner be 
contributing premiums than drawing benefits. As an Atlantic 
Canadian, because from time to time that argument is thrown back 
at us, I take great exception with the suggestion that people for the 
most part are on UI as a choice. I do not know of very many people 
who would not prefer to pay premiums than draw benefits.
<P>
	There was a reference by the member about water running up hill 
and something to the effect that there is no point in trying to impose 
our political will on the natural order of things which would see 
Canadians move to those places where the jobs are and that is a 
natural law and cannot be affected. I draw a different analogy.
<P>
	Essentially what the member was saying was that people are on 
their own. Basically we have equal opportunity. They can go to 
school and they can do all of these things. Fundamentally when all 
is said and done they make their own way in this world.
<P>
	I see it as the same analogy as throwing a baby off a boat into the 
ocean as a way of teaching them how to swim. I do not see it that 
way. I accept the challenge of the member that we should have an 
honest discussion about this. I am certainly prepared to do that, for 
that is not the way I see a country proceeding in a civilized way.
<P>
	There was a reference to the fact that some parts of the country 
do not have the economic base. They do not have the jobs. They do 
not have the same economic viability as other parts. The reference 
was they never have, they do not and they never will. That is not the 
case.
<P>
	Our part of the country which right now benefits from these 
programs at one time had one of the most booming economies in 
the world. We joined Confederation. Early in Confederation our 
part of Canada was very affluent, very successful and by being part 
of the broader country and buying into national policies basically 
changed our trading patterns from north-south to east-west to help 
develop the country. Consequently we paid a price for that.
<P>
	For anyone to suggest somehow we are inherently non-viable, I 
have a great deal of trouble with that. It is very shortsighted. New 
Brunswick right now is on a bit of a roll. It is recognized in Canada 
for getting its act together. Its economy is starting to grow.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2740"> 2740 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	However, if the government moves too quickly on these 
programs it will close down the economies of the region. That is 
why I felt so strongly that we had to pursue the amendments we 
were able to accomplish. We cannot close down the economies of 
our regions by moving too quickly on these programs. That is the 
reason for the amendments.
<P>
	I thank those who have contributed to the honest debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
listening to the hon. member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury, 
who is true to form, since I got to know him in the human resources 
development committee, and I know that he was sincere in what he 
just talked about. He seemed even to move you, Madam Speaker, 
because the points he made related to an area that you come from 
too.
<P>
	In spite of all that he had a somewhat easier task today since he 
was speaking after a Reform Party member who was obviously 
attacking the unemployment insurance system head on. He found 
himself in a somewhat awkward position, almost in the opposition, 
and I would say to my hon. colleague from 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury that I think he would feel more at 
ease with us on this side of the House than on the other side.
<P>
	Things being what they are, however, he is still sitting opposite, 
on the government side. I know he made some efforts, and he put 
forward a particular amendment. I am giving him a chance to talk 
about his amendment because we are in the House and, after all, are 
here to inform people. I know beforehand what he will say. I know 
that the three amendments he put forward for the Liberals do seem, 
at first glance, to soften a little the blow of the $365 million cuts, 
but nevertheless the budget goal remains the same: to find $2 
billion.
<P>
	In order to compensate for the $365 million forgone because of 
his three amendments, the government will have to go after abusers 
and repeaters even more relentlessly, and the hon. member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury knows it. Abusers are abusers, and 
all members agree that abuse should not be tolerated. But repeaters, 
according to the government, will be those who are on UI for five 
consecutive 20-week periods. They will get a one percentage point 
penalty each time.
<P>
	People who will be affected are seasonal employees in the hon. 
member's area and in the Acadian peninsula we visited last year. 
People asked us not to do that. I remember it vividly. Both the 
member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury and I were deeply 
moved by these representations.
<P>
	Today is a sombre day, because this bill provides for $2 billion in 
cuts, even after amendments to soften the blow. Benefits will be cut 
because the basic principle is still there. The one-week waiting 
period has been abolished, but the reduced earnings week principle 
remains. That will encourage more people not to report those 
reduced earnings. Obviously, this is a golden opportunity for 
abusers.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member. He stood for the 
unemployment insurance plan, and he fought tooth and nail to have 
the minister make his bill less drastic. The hon. member managed 
to get a few amendments in to soften the bill's impact, but despite 
these amendments, this bill will take millions of dollars out of the 
economies of the maritimes and of eastern Quebec. Is the hon. 
member comfortable with this bill, sitting as he does on the 
government side?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
now sympathize with my friend from Edmonton when my friend 
from Lévis suggested I should be on the other side. We are always 
saying he should be on the other side. I have an understanding as to 
how confusing that might be.
<P>
	The shift from weeks to hours will be beneficial to our region. 
With our amendments to fix some of the mechanical problems in 
the bill I believe it will be good for our region.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	I recognize we will be taking a net $1.2 billion out of the system. 
I know the member is aware that there are many people who 
regularly draw benefits. I am not talking about fraud or misuse. I 
am talking about the fact that a program was put forward which 
allowed people who could not make enough money in a year to live 
on to supplement their income. That is what a part of the program is 
about. There are people who draw on the system who cannot make 
that argument. We may disagree on how many.
<P>
	As the member knows, $800 million is going back into 
employment programs which will affect the income levels of 
people in the system. Therefore I believe we can take $1.2 billion 
out of the system and not negatively affect the program.
<P>
	I have been engaged in the debate to make sure it happens at the 
top, not at the bottom. That is what the amendment is all about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank you for recognizing me on such a sad day. This is for the 
official opposition the last chance to rise in this House and speak 
against a reform that will affect all Canadians and all Quebecers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2741"> 2741 </A></B>
<P>
	A lot of things have happened in this House, including the 
unilateral patriation of the Constitution in 1982. Some of the 
members of government at that time are still here and are about 
to deal a severe blow to regions like mine. This will hurt not only 
my riding, but also all the workers who now have the chance to 
work. They stand to lose their jobs and be hard hit, if their 
businesses were to go through a rough patch or the economy were 
to take a downturn.
<P>
	It is with an aching heart that I rise today in this House to say 
again, loud and clear, what my constituents from the Gaspé area 
came here to say, last week, in front of Parliament. These people 
took a 32- hour bus ride at their expense, because the round trip 
takes 32 hours. They came here to ask very peacefully to meet with 
the Prime Minister in order to express their grievances, because 
nothing in this bill gives them hope for a brighter future after July 
1, the day on which this infamous bill comes into force.
<P>
	Where can we find the strength, maybe it is born of despair, to 
ask the government to understand their point of view and to 
postpone this bill, because I think this is the night we will be asked 
to sentence regions like mine to death? So, I rise today in a 
last-ditch effort.
<P>
	I will review all of the issues, one by one. First of all, I want to 
mention the title of this bill, which is misleading. They call it 
employment insurance, but nothing in this bill guarantees that jobs 
will be created. On the contrary, it is more like deficit insurance. 
The people on the other side have started to admit that they hope to 
get more money out of the unemployed and to be able to set aside 
$5 billion at the expense of the jobless. It is outrageous, it is a 
disgrace. Five billion dollars.
<P>
	There was a joke we used to tell when I was a kid. ``If someone 
steals some chips in a store, he is called a thief''. But if someone 
steals $5 billion, what is he called? A politician? I am not proud to 
be a part of Parliament on such a tragic day.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to mention three new irritants that will strike 
directly at people in the regions. I am talking about the eligibility 
rule, the rate of benefits rule and the intensity rule.
<P>
	What does the eligibility rule provide for? A minimum of910 hours of work. We talked about this throughout the debate, but 
each time, we were subjected to time allocation, that is, in other 
words, we were gagged. What does the 910 hours eligibility rule 
mean when one works in the regions and according to the seasons? 
It means twenty-six 35 hour weeks. To my knowledge, there are not 
many seasonal jobs that make it possible to work that long.
<P>
	And what of the rate of benefits rule? They try to make us 
believe that the irritants are now fewer. Does putting a plaster on a 
wooden leg reduce the pain? No, it  does not. The bill, as 
introduced in the House after prorogation, provided for the 
dividing of consecutive work hours. This is not true any more. Now 
the work hours will be divided by the higher of the following: with 
the unemployment rate in our region, 14 weeks, or if one is lucky 
enough to live in a region with a lower unemployment rate, a 
greater number of weeks or the period worked. But what is the most 
vicious, I would say, is that this will have to be within a 26 week 
period. This bill, once passed, will compel people to concentrate 
their hours of work.
<P>
	What will the construction worker tell me, in February, when I 
ask him to go over to my house to repair the door knob, while I am 
in Ottawa? He will tell me that he would prefer to see my door knob 
break in May because May is included in his 26 week period of 
work, and because he would then have the opportunity to group 
together his weeks and to concentrate his hours of work. This was 
just another example. Fishermen and lumberjacks are not the only 
ones who will be affected. This is an important point.
<P>
	The intensity rule is another measure that strikes directly at those 
who work in regions. In an effort to soften this intensity rule, i.e. 
the 5 per cent penalty, a limit was established and it was decided 
that those with family earnings that are less than $26,000 in total 
will be exempted from this rule. But I will come back on this issue 
later.
<P>
	How can someone who earns $26,000 and has a family of four 
believe that he will have a decent life? He will only survive. 
Therefore, I think the intensity rule will once again hit hard those 
regions that depend on seasonal work.
<P>
	It is sad, but I would like to remind our viewers that the official 
opposition, in spite of its goal to promote sovereignty, has tried by 
all acceptable and recognized parliamentary means available to do 
its job and represent the people, to support victims of the job 
shortage. But, every time we tried, we were prevented from doing 
so. Every time we tried, we were gagged.
<P>
	I tried in vain to extend a helping hand, to say that we need to 
build a partnership, that we need to build a relationship based on 
trust because I think the government needs the public's trust to be 
able to implement such changes. Unfortunately, the members 
opposite did not understand.
<P>
	It is appalling or, should I say, frustrating for a parliamentarian 
like myself who has tried to use all available tools. However, I 
would like everybody in this House to know that it is much more 
appalling and frustrating for the victims of the job shortage, who 
will see their benefits reduced as of July 1.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I fear the public's reaction. I am scared. I am even afraid, since 
we do develop relationships in this House,  that some of our Liberal 
colleagues will have a very hard time when they go back to their 
ridings after the House adjourns for the summer. Each one of these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2742"> 2742 </A></B>
<P>
members will have to face his or her constituents. I hope they will 
remember what happened on May 14. I sure hope so.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to tell the government that, if it wanted 
money, why has it not decided to get it from those who have large 
salaries? As mentioned by the member for Mercier a few moments 
ago, the maximum is being brought down from $43,000 to $39,000. 
I would like to add that, while we are doing our job, people are 
waiting.
<P>
	Why have MPs not been asked to contribute to the fund? Why 
have senators, who, I think, do not work much sometimes, not been 
asked? The government could have taken contributions from their 
salaries to give that money back to people who do want to work and 
who do not sleep on the job.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, Ontario 
puts a significant amount of money into the system. For every $1 
working men and women in Ontario put in, we receive 76 cents 
back.
<P>
	In 1993 Quebecers received $1.29 for every $1 they put into the 
system. Under the new EI system they will receive $1.32 for every 
$1 they put in. Based on how shameful the member feels it is, can 
he explain to me what is so disgusting that for every $1 Quebec 
puts in it gets $1.32 out of the system? Is that not fair? Is that not 
equitable? Is that not compassion?
<P>
	That is an important question to ask because coming from 
Ontario where we get only 76 cents for every $1 we put in, we think 
we are being very fair. We are trying to make the system work for 
other regions that are have not. I would certainly like to know the 
response of the member when we look at the raw facts and the 
numbers. From 1993 to 1996 the amount Quebec is receiving has 
gone up, not down.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate 
that on the last day, on a day I should perhaps call a national day of 
mourning for the people of one region, someone has the nerve to 
stand up in this House and provoke us by comparing people from 
different regions and making distinctions between people from 
Ontario, from Quebec and from New Brunswick. Does he mean 
that there are second class citizens in Canada?
<P>
	I can hardly control my anger, but my anger is nothing compared 
to what awaits them if they dare visit some parts of Canada where 
people believe that their occupation is a noble one. If those people 
are told that they must compare their situation to what Ontario 
got-Madam Speaker, how is it that when the Department of 
Industry allocates its research and development funds it is always 
the same who receive the lion's share?
<P>
	And they say that they paid to much in unemployment insurance. 
This is shocking and appalling. There are words that I do not want 
to use because I want to follow rules and because I want to be here 
to vote against the bill.
<P>
	Speaking about comparisons, we can say that we were had last 
Thursday. The Minister of Fisheries chose to publish his new fee 
schedule exactly at the time the Quebec government was bringing 
down its budget. Unfortunately, the parliamentary secretary did 
say: ``Yes, it is true that in Quebec you are going to pay a little 
more for the navigation aids that the Coast Guard will offer''. 
When time comes to do some Quebec-bashing, they do not 
hesitate, but they deny it. They do it when the media's attention is 
on something else in Quebec City. But when times comes to face 
the facts, they prefer to hide.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	How can we make them understand? I wanted in good faith to 
work here. I wanted to make them understand, but, on the last day, 
they want to make a comparison. If they want to compare apples, 
let then let us compare apples, but when we are speaking of money 
and remuneration like that, I wish they would put everything on the 
table. This is not the case presently. They are making comparisons 
about people who want to work but who, since there are no jobs, 
need that economic stabilizer that unemployment insurance is.
<P>
	I will conclude with the following point. Can you cut firewood in 
downtown Toronto? Can you fish lobster and other species in 
downtown Toronto? No. Tell us if we are not welcome there, and if 
that is the case, so long, folks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, from 
here on, all those speaking on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois will 
limit their speeches to 10 minutes.
<P>
	Following on my colleague, the member for Gaspé, I would also 
like to add the voices of the constituents of 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean to this debate. It is true that today is a 
sad day for all Canadians and Quebecers. It is also sad for the 
regions.
<P>
	This is the last time we will be able to express our views about 
this plan to reform unemployment insurance. I am therefore 
speaking from the heart, but I do not expect to be any more 
successful than my colleagues, who worked tremendously hard on 
the human resources development committee, in getting the 
government to budge. I realize that our cries are falling on deaf 
ears.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2743"> 2743 </A></B>
<P>
	I must simply say to you that there is no need to rush at this 
time. We could-and I implore the parliamentary secretary-we 
could take the time to review the whole issue of unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	For my region, it will mean approximately $25 million less in 
the economy annually. And yet, we still have the highest rate of 
unemployment in Canada, and have had for years. I must tell you 
that this reform is unfair towards a region such as mine.
<P>
	This is not what we need in the region. We do not need a blow 
like this. What we need is help finding a solution. People from my 
region are proud people who are not afraid to work. We want to find 
a solution.
<P>
	This reform is a direct hit on students, women, and seasonal 
workers. And yet, they made their opinions known, they were 
consulted, they even sent petitions here. What became of these 
consultations? All across Canada, these consultations were just a 
sham. No attention was paid to them, and why not? Because the 
reform was based on preconceived ideas, on false principles.
<P>
	They said to themselves ``Now then, we are going to reform the 
system, for too many people are taking unfair advantage. There are 
people who are cheating the system. We find it hard to understand, 
there are jobs out there but nobody to take them''. Instead of 
looking at this situation, the decision was taken to try to get at 
everybody, yet it is not true that everyone is out to cheat the system.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Moreover, at no time in the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development, and even less so publicly, has the 
government laid its impact studies on the reform out on the table. 
They have been incapable of telling us what the effects of the 
reform would be on students, on young people. There has been 
nothing to show what the effect will be on seasonal workers.
<P>
	It is only when the thing comes into effect that we will see that 
perhaps somebody has goofed, that this might not have been the 
way to go, but by then it will be too late. Far too many people will 
have had to pay, and to pay through the nose, for this unjust reform.
<P>
	My colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois have said that, yes, reform 
was needed, a review was needed, but the review needed to be fair 
and honest and to allow everyone to benefit from it. That is why my 
colleagues in the Bloc have moved amendments, amendments 
which I am not even sure have been looked at properly.
<P>
	I sat through six hours of the committee's meetings, and from 
what I saw, the folks across the way paid no attention to what my 
colleagues were saying. The apparent attitude was ``No problem, 
we will just wait and see how it turns out. We have a plan, and that 
is the way we will go''.
<P>
	I think that they are on the wrong track, for this reform does 
nothing more than to encourage people to hold down more than one 
job, and the jobs involved are mainly precarious ones. This reform 
will also bring pressure to bear on wages, not upward pressure, but 
downward. This gives you an idea of what can happen.
<P>
	Under the old system, seasonal workers, for example, had to try 
to accumulate the required number of weeks in order to become 
eligible. Under the new system, they will have to negotiate a 
number of hours of work with their employer in order to reach the 
required minimum. You can imagine easily what will happen in 
small industries, in small and medium size firms where there are no 
unions. This will cause serious problems between employers and 
employees. This will have a negative impact on the reform as a 
whole.
<P>
	This piling on of salaries will inevitably lead to the creation of 
``McJobs'' all over the place. They will say to someone: ``I offer 
you ten hours of work this week, but do not come in next week. 
Then the week after that you will again work ten hours''. This 
vicious circle will prevent many people from becoming eligible.
<P>
	The result will be that people will hold simultaneously an 
increasing number of jobs. One ``McJob'' here, one ``McJob'' 
there, a better one in order to accumulate a sufficient number of 
hours. This situation will lead to family unrest, since there will be a 
social impact, because of irregular work schedules for instance. 
This new work pattern or work schedules will force people and 
families to adjust. Children and the mother are often the ones who 
have to bear the consequences of such changes.
<P>
	Since you are telling me that my time is almost up, I will 
conclude by saying that this is a sad day, considering that we are 
going to vote on this bill tonight.
<P>
	I would like to tell you about three workers from back home who 
recently explained their situation to a reporter.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	These people said, and I will be very brief: ``Instead of taking it 
out on the unemployed, the government could come up with much 
more effective decisions. It could take the surplus from the 
unemployment insurance fund and try to create jobs, provide better 
training and so on, by creating legislation prohibiting overtime for 
example. Workers at Alcan have shown the federal government 
that, with less overtime, jobs can be created. In this case, the 
government must get involved, because the system has to get 
started.
<P>
	The workers at Alcan did it. More than 200 jobs were created, 
and that is not counting indirect jobs. Moonlighting as well must be 
monitored. The federal government missed the boat in failing to 
keep its promise to create jobs.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on third reading debate of Bill C-12, the 
employment insurance act.
<P>
	I feel most privileged to have worked on the human resources 
development committee examining the bill. I enjoyed the thrust of 
debate with members opposite as we strove to improve the bill for 
the benefit of all Canadians. I sincerely believe the bill and the 
process undertaken speak well for democracy.
<P>
	In my experience as a farm leader I appeared before many 
parliamentary committees and in my experience as a 
parliamentarian I have never seen such substantial changes made to 
a bill in the interest of the people from whom we have heard. 
Improving the bill to address the concerns of people is what this 
process was all about. It has been a very long process.
<P>
	The green book on social security reform was tabled a little over 
two years ago. When that paper came down I held a couple of 
public meetings. People were very concerned about the direction 
that might be taken by human resources development in terms of 
social security review. A committee went all across the country 
with members from all parties in attendance. The committee heard 
over 600 presentations. It heard a lot of concerns about the two tier 
system and where we might be going on UI. It came back with what 
I think was a wonderful report, on which part of this legislation is 
based.
<P>
	A seasonal industry task force was set up. Its report mentioned 
how important seasonal industries are, that seasonal industries do 
not work only during one season but create economies 
downstream. They create full time jobs in industries other than 
their own in terms of the products and services they need within the 
seasonal industries. Seasonal industries are made up of full time 
workers who are highly skilled and much needed in those seasonal 
industries. The government took that to heart and took those issues 
into account in terms of the preparation of the final stages of Bill 
C-12.
<P>
	When Bill C-12 was introduced I held public meetings in my 
riding, as did many of my colleagues. We expressed as members of 
the government our concerns internally and publicly on the bill. We 
said publicly that there was a problem in terms of some areas as 
they impacted on the seasonal industries, and we moved to correct 
those changes.
<P>
	We also recognized some very good points in the original bill. It 
is an hour based system. It gets rid of the 15 hour job trap. The part 
II benefits include $800 million for reinvestment in such programs 
as wage subsidies, earning supplements, self-employment 
assistance, job creation partnerships, skill loans and grants. Those 
are important points.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	I have made it clear from the very beginning that scrapping the 
bill was not an option. We are dealing with the realities of the turn 
of the century. We need improvements to the bill and we will try to 
achieve them. We must work as members of Parliament toward 
improvements. The former minister and the current minister agreed 
and showed an openness for change.
<P>
	We heard concerns. One was from Jacinta Deveau:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At a time when corporations are making record profits and yet still laying 
people off, now is not the time to start increasing qualifying times or decreasing 
benefits particularly for those people who must resort to applying for benefits, 
must do so for longer periods of time and in greater numbers; add this to the 
competition for fewer and fewer numbers of jobs sought only not by those 
people caught in the corporate downsizing and adjustment but those in seasonal 
and non-full time job occupations and you have a recipe for disaster in the 
Atlantic region generally and P.E.I. in particular.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We did not bury our heads in the sand when we heard that 
concern. Government members moved to correct that concern. We 
corrected it in several ways. That concern we corrected by fixing 
the gap and improving the divisor. We are certain the employment 
measures will move some distance to improving the job situation.
<P>
	We did not take the position to scrap the bill. We listened and 
moved to make improvements. That is very different from what I 
have heard from members opposite.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mercier, the critic for the Bloc, talked 
about the lack of debate. On the night of the filibuster those of us 
sitting on the government side wanted to debate the substantive 
issues to see if there were other areas of improvement. Is the hon. 
member asking us to do away with the employment measures 
which will help people to get jobs? Is the hon. member asking that 
we scrap the benefits for low income families? Is the hon. member 
asking us to go back to a system which had within it a 15 hour job 
trap that trapped mainly women in part time jobs? This bill 
improves that situation. Members opposite should recognize that.
<P>
	I will list some of the other improvements we have been able to 
accomplish through this debate. Members on the government side 
have fixed the gap, the dead weeks. We have managed by making 
amendments to the legislation to take out of the calculation base 
those weeks that would have been considered as zero earnings. We 
have fixed that gap to the benefit of seasonal workers and of 
workers generally.
<P>
	We have changed the divisor to make it more uniform across the 
country. It will be the regional rate plus a divisor of two. That does 
two things. It sets some stability and it ensures for business that 
there is an incentive out there for people to find work instead of 
simply going on UI.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2745"> 2745 </A></B>
<P>
	We have fixed the intensity rule to a great extent. We have 
ensured the intensity rule does not apply to low income families 
with dependants. There will be a method of receiving an intensity 
rule credit for those who work while on unemployment.
<P>
	This is in part based on the concerns raised by some of the 
people who have been demonstrating. In order to ensure that these 
good amendments that Liberal members have made are secure into 
the future, the power of a future minister to change the divisor by 
regulation has been deleted from the bill. In the future changes will 
be made in the House and not by the executive.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I am pleased with what has been accomplished. I will admit that 
one good amendment was moved by members opposite. We 
supported and it was incorporated in the bill. It goes to show what 
can be done if the opposition is more co-operative instead of saying 
``scrap the bill''. We really do not want filibusters. We have made 
great strides forward.
<P>
	The minister said that the bill is not perfect, that there are some 
areas of concern. However, as a government we do listen and we 
make changes to meet the needs of people.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to quote Alice Nakamura. I think she is 
right on target:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You have proven wrong all those who told me this reform effort was a waste 
of time. Bill C-12 tackles the serious problems with our present UI program, 
making use of the best available research about how our labour markets and 
social programs function. And it is a bill that pays careful attention to the real 
life problems of transition. It strikes a careful balance between the desperation 
of people who cannot find enough work and have depended on the income from 
UI benefits and the desperation of economic analysts who recognize the threat 
which trends in our present UI program pose for our economy and the future 
employment prospects for Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the member 
for Malpeque may have tried to console me a little bit by reminding 
me that the Liberal majority had approved an amendment 
introduced by the members of the Bloc. As the author of this 
amendment, I only want to point out that this amendment was 
about adding the two words community agencies, omitted by the 
Liberal majority, as entitled to federal grants in order to create jobs. 
I only wanted to ensure that they would not forget this important 
aspect.
<P>
	Despite this modest amendment, the only one they deigned to 
accept out of some fifteen that were moved, one fact remains. Since 
the member mentions it, I want to remind him that the Liberal 
majority introduced 42 amendments in Committee. Those 
amendments have been approved, of course, since they have a 
majority. Those 42 amendments were introduced in committee-I 
remember-by various Liberal members, sometimes by  the 
parliamentary secretary. When questioned on the substance of 
these amendments, I must say that, most of the time, in 75 per cent 
of the cases, it was public servants who answered. Why? Because 
these amendments were obviously written by public servants. What 
type of amendments were they? Technical amendments to reinforce 
clauses of the bill, whether some members like it or not, 
aimed-forgive my language-at catching more people 
red-handed and at reinforcing penalties against those who abuse the 
unemployment insurance system, but this is not said.
<P>
	They say that they have improved the bill. Granted, but they do 
not say that the objective was to eliminate such abuses. The three 
amendments improve the system, but the three amendments 
presented to the House could only be moved by the minister. 
Everybody in the House knows it, but it is something we have to 
say for the record because people outside the House do not know 
this. We, in the opposition, have been criticized for failing to 
propose any amendment. We were told that we were criticizing the 
bill but had no amendment to propose. There is a parliamentary 
rule that says very clearly that as soon as an amendment involves 
changes of a financial nature, it amendment must be moved by a 
minister of the crown.
<P>
	This is why the opposition could not move such an amendment.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	You will understand that, otherwise, we would have proposed 
quite a few amendments to eliminate the negative impact of the $2 
billion in cuts which come on top of the $5 billion in cuts made as a 
result of the previous federal budget and Bill C-17. I wanted to 
make this comment.
<P>
	Now, for my question. In her speech, to which the member for 
Malpeque listened, the member for Mercier reminded the House of 
a statement, to my knowledge the only statement, by the economic 
development minister of his own province, Prince Edward Island, 
who said how bad it was going to be for the economy of Prince 
Edward Island, which is a top performer in the area of job creation. 
I would say that in Prince Edward Island, apart for government 
services, jobs are only seasonal.
<P>
	There is no farming in winter. He pointed that out. Fishing too is 
only in the summer. And as far as tourism is concerned, people who 
like PEI come mainly in the summer. Does the member agree with 
the statement made by the economic development minister of his 
own province, who said that this bill was bad? Also, does he agree 
with the government's figures according to which, from now on, 
Prince Edward Island, with a population of only 170,000, will lose 
$11 million every year?

	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Madam Speaker, the member is just about 
filibustering. The amendments that we accepted concerning 
community organization were important. We saw them as such. 
They are two very important words.
<P>
	We did listen to the discussion of Bloc members opposite on the 
gap and we fixed it.
<P>
	I want to get to the point-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate. The hon. member for Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the government has made jobs and growth a 
priority. That is the underlying theme behind the reforms of the 
new employment insurance system. Coupled with this theme is the 
need to create a fairer and more balanced system.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington support the government's 
endeavours to encourage a greater effort to help find Canadians 
work and to achieve a system that is more affordable and easier to 
administer. They know that deficit reduction cannot be successful 
if it is accomplished solely on the backs of the unemployed. They 
also recognize the inefficiencies of the old system.
<P>
	Reforms to employment insurance are a part of the government's 
efforts to restructure the federal government. This is a unique time 
in our nation's history. The federal government is responding to 
communities like Guelph-Wellington that have told us to make 
the system fairer and more balanced.
<P>
	Let us look at the highlights of this legislation. Changes have 
been made to make the system fairer to youth, to women, to low 
income families and to workers in seasonal industries. Tough 
measures have been brought in to crack down on fraud and most 
important, work initiatives have been strengthened.
<P>
	I am not happy with the level of unemployment in Canada. Just a 
few moments ago I was talking to a colleague from Quebec who is 
also not happy with those levels.
<P>
	My own community's unemployment rate is approximately 8 per 
cent. I find that unacceptable. I know that people in 
Guelph-Wellington want to work. They want to provide for 
themselves and their families. From the outset I have encouraged 
the government to go beyond simply offering basic income support 
for people in my community who unexpectedly find themselves out 
of work. Unemployed Canadians must be given a better chance to 
get back into the job market.
<P>
	This legislation addresses the fact that not every worker in 
Canada has uninterrupted weeks of work to qualify for maximum 
benefits. In this regard I have worked closely with construction 
workers. The building trades, by the very nature of their positions, 
work hard.  The harder they work the faster they put themselves out 
of work. They have asked for changes to remove disincentives and 
changes to reward people for their work. They know that the 
previous system encouraged fraud and promoted the underground 
economy. Simply put, by encouraging people to work we can help 
drive the underground economy above ground. That is good news. 
It will encourage further government revenues and ensure that the 
workers are paid the wages that they deserve.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	This legislation also makes the system fairer to youth, to women 
and to low income families. We have moved to counting hours of 
work instead of weeks, a direction supported by the building trades. 
In my discussions with constituents it was clear that whether a 
person worked 15 hours a week or 50 hours, both were treated the 
same under UI. We needed to address the reality that Canadians no 
longer work a 9 to 5 day, Monday to Friday.
<P>
	Many of my constituents are holding down several jobs with 
different employers or work on contracts for periods of time. The 
one measure of work that means the same to everyone is the hour. 
The hour is the very same. The hours based system better reflects 
the new economy. It will insure a growing segment of Canada's 
workforce that currently has no protection whatsoever. With this 
important addition, 500,000 part time workers will have their work 
insured for the very first time, a move that will benefit woman and 
youth in particular. I hope that my Bloc friends will agree with that 
move.
<P>
	It means that women working part time or earning a living at 
several jobs will now qualify for maternity benefits for the first 
time, a move that will strengthen the value of family and work. 
This provision alone recognizes the importance of the household 
and the Canadian family.
<P>
	The legislation also includes a family income supplement for 
families with children earning less than $26,000. Certainly this is 
good news for families in Guelph-Wellington and across Canada.
<P>
	I appreciated the special significance of the seasonal industry. 
Under the hours based system 45,000 workers, who today cannot 
qualify for unemployment insurance, will now qualify to receive 
benefits. I am pleased to quote the building construction trades 
represented by the Canadian office of the AFL-CIO: ``We 
suggested a UI program where every hour worked and every dollar 
earned counted. The government has listened''.
<P>
	No discussion of employment insurance can be complete 
without paying some attention to the issue of fraud. Regrettably 
there are those who take advantage of our system. The vast 
majority of Canadians that collect unemployment insurance are 
doing so because they need some assistance while looking for 
work. They do not  want to be unemployed and they are anxious to 
return to work. They understand the dignity of work to which the 
Prime Minister so often refers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2747"> 2747 </A></B>
<P>
	This legislation sends a strong message that fraud will not be 
tolerated. This applies to both individuals and employers. 
Companies that knowingly defraud the system will face stiffer 
financial penalties. If the company cannot pay the price its 
corporate directors will be held accountable for the loss. These 
ideas are new and they are necessary.
<P>
	I continue to raise concerns brought to my attention by 
individuals, business people and unions. I am pleased that the 
minister has recognized a need to monitor these changes. The 
government will measure the impact of these reforms on Canadians 
workers, businesses and communities. The minister has 
acknowledged the need to see how Canadians are adjusting. 
Quality control efforts will mean that the employment insurance 
commission will make an annual report to the minister through its 
examination of how Canadian workers, communities and the 
economy are making the adjustment. I urge them to pay careful 
attention to the underground economy. We must continue to ensure 
that what we do does not encourage its growth.
<P>
	The government has listened and we will continue to listen to 
make a system that is fair and balanced, fair for users, fair for 
taxpayers and fair for business. Through these changes we have 
been responsive to the balanced approach of jobs and growth and 
deficit reduction. Unemployment affects all of us, everyone.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	We must continue to pay close attention to our core values as 
Canadians. These include fairness, balance and the dignity of work. 
Bill C-12 deserves our support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, our Liberal 
colleague showed us the true objective of this bill. It is called the 
employment insurance bill, but as you have seen, there was an 
underlying concern to all her comments; the purpose of the new 
measures is to fight against abusers or pseudo-abusers.
<P>
	The new Minister of Human Resources Development, when he 
first appeared before the committee, indicated that he wanted to 
ease the rules, but when he appeared the second time, told us about 
an extraordinary discovery he had made. He said there were 
approximately 120,000 cases of fraud in Canada. In fact, there are 
116,603. He was asked if that was an increase. No, it represents a 
decrease because there were 131,081 cases of fraud in 1991-92.
<P>
	I will be brief, Madam Speaker. Figures show that the last bill 
allowed the government to recover $272 million and they hope to 
recover an additional amount of $345 million with this new bill.
<P>
	But, out of those $272 million, figures submitted by the 
parliamentary secretary himself show that only $93 million 
resulted from real fraud. Three quarters of the remaining $179 
million were due to errors made by the unemployment insurance 
commission. These were errors.
<P>
	So instead of passing legislation that is an insurance plan 
designed at fighting fraud, the government should have drafted 
legislation to prevent errors, which sometimes cause serious 
trouble, because the commission can go back five years.
<P>
	Does the member agree that we should take more time and draft 
this bill in such a way that it will help public servants prevent 
errors, which most of the time are made in good faith simply 
because the legislation is not clear? Does she think we will improve 
the bill with last minute amendments? There were 42 in committee 
one evening. What does she think about correcting mistakes before 
we attack the pseudo-abusers, the pseudo-defrauders?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to address a couple 
of things the hon. member spoke about.
<P>
	One is the time it has taken the government to look at this bill. It 
has been close to three years now, since the beginning of the 
election. It is tremendous to recognize. I see the parliamentary 
secretary to the human resources minister. It is a tribute to him and 
every colleague who has spent the hours day and night looking at 
this bill to make sure that we addressed a lot of the concerns.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my speech, the building and construction 
trades are happy that we have looked at the hour measurement of 
time. That is what they asked for. They said that the government 
has listened. That is very important.
<P>
	Also, as the parliamentary secretary mentioned, this piece of 
legislation will allow Quebec for every dollar it puts in to get $1.32 
out. It does not take a mathematics genius to figure out that putting 
$1 in and getting $1.32 back for people who need this program is 
significant and important. To vote against a bill that does such a 
thing is a travesty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am not 
here to filibuster like my friend opposite.
<P>
	I was going to raise a point of order and suggest that if he wanted 
to speak again we would let him. Some of us could ask questions of 
him rather than having him talk for five minutes instead of asking 
members questions.
<P>
	However, I want to ask my colleague a question. The Bloc again 
has attacked the whole issue of the hours based system, which as 
the member has mentioned is supported by almost everyone who 
understands the system. I suggest that the Bloc does not understand 
the importance of going to an hourly system.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2748"> 2748 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The reason there is support is that there are 90,000 individuals 
who do not get UI today who under the new system which will 
consider claims on an hourly basis will be able to collect EI for the 
first time. Half of those workers are seasonal employees. I want to 
focus on the other half, part time workers. It hurts me to think the 
Bloc is not supporting this.
<P>
	There are 45,000 part time and multiple job workers. For the first 
time they will be able to collect EI under this new system. Why 
would the member think that any party, whether it is a party that 
wants to break up Canada, which spends more time trying to break 
up Canada than worrying about workers in its own province, would 
be opposed to something that is good for 27 per cent of the 
population who are part time workers?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, it is difficult to 
understand how any party, namely the Bloc, could vote against a 
bill that would increase the eligibility for part time and seasonal 
workers, that would help women, that would go to an hours bank 
and that unions and construction trades have asked for. They have 
asked for this piece of legislation. It is inconceivable.
<P>
	I hope Quebecers are watching this debate. Quebecers are going 
to gain so much from this. For every dollar that is put in, they will 
gain $1.32. This is very important. I thank my colleague for 
drawing attention to these points.
<P>
	We have to help women. We have to help part time workers. We 
have to look at this hour bank system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-12.
<P>
	It is amusing to hear the back and forth between the Bloc and 
Liberal members as they talk about the changes to unemployment 
insurance. It is particularly amusing to hear Bloc members 
complain about how much they will lose. I would ask them to 
consider how much they would lose if and when they decide to 
leave the country completely. It would certainly be a lot more than 
they could afford to give themselves considering the kind of 
financial shape they would be in on their own.
<P>
	I will offer some constructive criticism of Bill C-12. People 
across the country are very concerned about the whole issue of 
employment, without a doubt. There is no question it is one of the 
most important issues in the country today. The government spoke 
about it during the election campaign when it promised to create 
jobs, jobs, jobs. It is a commitment Canadians are waiting for it to 
fulfil.
<P>
	One of the main concerns we have with this legislation is that it 
goes in the wrong direction. Granted, it does not go as far as the 
previous legislation went in the wrong direction, but it is still going 
in the wrong direction. We have a concern about that.
<P>
	We say that we should not treat unemployment insurance as a 
type of social program. Unfortunately, the current legislation does 
exactly that. We say that it is bad for the country. We say it is bad 
for employment prospects for people. We say it is bad because it 
does not give people the type of hope they need and deserve. We 
are very concerned about that.
<P>
	It is time to change the complete direction of unemployment 
insurance, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. I will 
talk about why we want to go to a different plan by looking at the 
history of unemployment insurance in this country.
<P>
	Going back to 1971-72, that is when regionally extended 
benefits first came into being. I would argue it is not sheer 
coincidence that at the time those changes came in, unemployment 
began to creep up and up. Until about 1971 or at least the late 
sixties, Canada had about the same unemployment rate as the 
United States. It was very low, in the range of between 3 per cent 
and 5 per cent. Shortly after those benefits were introduced, those 
two unemployment rates began to diverge. The Canadian rate went 
much higher while the American rate stayed about the same.
<P>
	As the finance department has borne out, my point is that quite 
obviously when there are rich benefits which essentially reward 
people for remaining idle, we should not be surprised if people 
respond to those incentives by becoming idle. Do not be surprised 
if they do not run out and look for a job. Do not be surprised if they 
stay somewhere where there is no work. For me that is absolutely 
sensible. I am not at all surprised it happens.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I do not think we should be surprised when we bring in timid 
measures, such as we have today, that it will not really have an 
appreciable effect on unemployment. In fact, I do not think this 
legislation is going to create jobs at all. I would argue that this 
legislation will kill jobs.
<P>
	One of the concerns we have with this legislation is that 
premiums will have to be paid by part time workers. People who 
work less than 15 hours per week will be paying premiums, as will 
employers.
<P>
	Consider that one of the biggest job killers in the country today, 
which the finance minister has said over an over again, is payroll 
taxes. There are going to be payroll taxes for the very people who 
are feeling the pinch the most, those trying to get into the 
workforce. Young Canadians and very often women who work part 
time are the ones who are going to have their jobs threatened 
because the government is insisting on bringing in premiums for 
part time workers.
<P>
	The finance minister has said repeatedly: ``That is a job killer, 
that is a job killer, that is a job killer''. Of course it is going to kill 
jobs. Absolutely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> When did he say that?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2749"> 2749 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Hon. members across the way are asking when 
the minister said that. The minister has said it many times in this 
House. When the hon. member was a parliamentary secretary and 
sat closer to the minister he probably heard those things but now 
that he sits so far away perhaps it just does not get down that far.
<P>
	The fact is that payroll taxes kill jobs and hon. members across 
the way know it. Unfortunately, they are ignoring their own advice 
and are bringing in payroll taxes on people who are the most 
vulnerable in the job market today: youth and women who work 
part time. This bill is going to be a job killer.
<P>
	I want to draw attention to a television program that was on CTV 
a couple of weeks ago. The program spoke about the difference 
between the unemployment insurance systems in Canada and the 
United States. It considered two very comparable economies, those 
of New Brunswick and Maine. In both cases we are talking about 
economies with lots of seasonal work. In both places there is work 
in forestry during one period, work in fishing during another 
period, some construction work and maybe some type of handyman 
labour and those sorts of things. However, throughout the year 
there is not a lot of full time employment.
<P>
	It was very interesting that in exploring the differences between 
these two economies it was found that in New Brunswick there was 
a very high level of unemployment. However, in Maine which had 
almost the identical economy there was a very low level of 
unemployment.
<P>
	The reporter quizzed government officials and employers about 
the unemployment insurance systems. It was found that Canada's 
unemployment insurance system is much richer and provides much 
better benefits than the U.S. system. The result is that New 
Brunswick now has what I can only call structural unemployment 
as do certainly many other places in the country. In the United 
States, Maine has far less than half the unemployment rate for an 
almost identical economy.
<P>
	When the reporter asked some of the workers in Maine what the 
difference was, they pointed out that not only did they have very 
few benefits as compared to Canada, but the system was more 
experience rated. For instance, if employers laid people off they 
would pay higher premiums next time around. What happened is 
the employers kept people on even in their down periods because 
they knew that if they did not, they would pay higher premiums. 
This is not exactly a great revelation. It makes perfect sense to me 
but somehow that logic has escaped the government.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	It showed an example of a large department store in Maine 
where traditionally people would have been laid off in slow 
periods, but in this case they were painting, doing work around the 
store that as clerks they would not normally do because the 
employer did not want to  pay the higher premiums. The point 
being the current system rewards employers who lay off people. 
That is ridiculous. It makes absolutely no sense.
<P>
	Again I make the argument that although these reforms make the 
current system mildly better in so far as they do not provide a great 
a reward for laying people off, they still go in the wrong direction.
<P>
	It is time to separate the unemployment insurance system from 
the idea of a social welfare scheme. We need a true insurance 
system. That is the way we must go. If we did that we would not 
have nearly the problems we have today. If that were done we 
would have a system that would reward employers for keeping 
people on the job and a system which would reward employees for 
staying on the job even when it sometimes looks like it may be 
more profitable to collect from a social program.
<P>
	In this case if we had true insurance people would know that 
incentive has been removed and it would no longer be more 
profitable for them to go on to a government system. We very much 
disagree with the direction this legislation is taking.
<P>
	Clyde Wells, the premier of Newfoundland, pointed out the 
current system had created a generation which has become 
dependent on unemployment insurance. The situation in 
Newfoundland is interesting and in another sense it is tragic 
because there is a generation of people who have come to rely on 
unemployment. I hope it is instructive for people in this place who 
are trying to design new systems that will lead to more 
employment.
<P>
	The premier of that province acknowledged the system does not 
work. When we look at Newfoundland today and we see all those 
people who are on unemployment, has it not become obvious that 
no matter how good a hair dresser is in Newfoundland, no matter 
how much training they get, they simply will not get a job if there 
are no jobs available?
<P>
	The finance committee heard from a person from the Gaspé 
region where there is 33 per cent unemployment, a social tragedy in 
the Gaspé region. Has it not become obvious the current system 
does not work when there are levels of unemployment that high? Is 
it not obvious that when people are kept in one place because of a 
system perhaps they are being denied opportunity, denying them 
the hope they deserve as Canadian citizens? That is absolutely 
ridiculous.
<P>
	Clearly the solution is not in how we attempted to solve the 
problems of the past. That caused the problems. The solution is 
something different. It is time to move forward and get away from 
this system and go to a true insurance system.
<P>
	In the 1930s many people in Alberta had to leave the land. There 
are special areas in the province where people had to abandon their 
farms because there was simply no way they could grow anything. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2750"> 2750 </A></B>
<P>
They left because it did not make sense to stay anymore. They  
went where the jobs were. That makes absolute sense to me.
<P>
	However, the current system acts against that natural impulse. 
People naturally are drawn to where there are jobs. If we pay them 
to stay where they are, do not be surprised if they respond to that 
incentive. That is what this legislation does. It give them incentive 
to remain where they are. I do not blame the people for taking it. I 
blame governments for offering it in the first place. That is 
ridiculous.
<P>
	We have that problem in my part of the country as well. Perhaps 
it is not as pronounced as it is in some parts of Atlantic Canada or 
Quebec, but we have the same problem.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The point is, no matter where the incentive is offered, people are 
people and they will respond to that incentive. Let us not continue 
to hold people back. Let us not continue to stifle their potential. Let 
us create an employment insurance program that is truly an 
insurance program, that is experience rated, that rewards people for 
continuing to be employed, that provides a disincentive for people 
to give up their jobs.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of the government to create an 
environment for employment. One of the things the government 
decidedly has not done is create an environment for employment. It 
is little known but it is a fact that since this government came to 
power it has brought in revenue measures and tax increases 
amounting to over $10.5 billion. That is an amazing amount of 
money to take out of people's pockets. That kills jobs. That kills all 
kinds of opportunities for Canadians. That cannot continue.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite are concerned about this. They should 
be. It is killing jobs. The hon. member opposite is obviously 
concerned about $10.5 billion coming out of the pockets of his 
constituents and Canadians generally.
<P>
	The finance minister said payroll taxes kill jobs. I will expand on 
that. All taxes kill jobs. The more money taken from the taxpayers, 
the less they have to save. Those savings would ultimately go to 
creating new opportunities in the form of new business. The less 
money they have, the less money they have to spend on goods and 
services. Therefore there are not as many jobs for people in those 
industries. The hon. member opposite is complaining that his 
government is raising taxes. I do not blame him.
<P>
	The finance minister the other day said ``we did not raise any 
taxes in the last budget''. If we stick to the letter of the law he was 
right. He raised some after it. He raised all kinds of revenue 
through various measures which amounted to billions of dollars. 
The new GST changes will exact approximately $1 billion from 
people in the form of a new tax or the removal of the input credit on 
used goods, something that constitutes $60  billion to $80 billion a 
year in the economy. That will take money out of people's pockets. 
That kills jobs.
<P>
	There are all kinds of things the government can do to stop 
killing jobs and to start creating jobs. It has to stop raising taxes. It 
has to start moving toward a balanced budget, and not at a snail's 
pace. It has to announce a date. All the provinces have either 
balanced their budgets or at least have a plan to balance their 
budgets. The federal government has not even announced a date. It 
has not even acknowledged there is a problem.
<P>
	If people judge the strength of the finance minister and the 
government by their ability to wrestle down the deficit, these guys 
come in dead last. They are weak kneed. They cannot meet the 
challenges.
<P>
	We say to people to get on the government. Tell it that it has to 
balance its budget. Tell it that it has to start dealing with the deficit 
and debt.
<P>
	One of the things that has to happen when the budget is finally 
balanced is that the government will have to start lowering taxes. 
Ontario is lowering taxes. Alberta is lowering taxes. Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba are lowering taxes. All the provinces are lowering 
taxes. They are creating jobs. What is the federal government 
doing? It is killing jobs. It is raising taxes. It is destroying 
opportunity.
<P>
	The bill is only the tip of iceberg. Not only is the bill a bad piece 
of legislation, we say the government has not done the other things 
which need to be done to create jobs.
<P>
	We say to the government that its challenge is not to tinker with 
Bill C-12, its challenge is not to tinker with unemployment 
insurance, its challenge is to fix it. Quit fooling around and create 
an employment system which will actually provide incentive for 
people to go out and get jobs instead of killing incentive. The 
government's challenge is to balance the budget and to lower taxes. 
That is what Canadians want and that is what they deserve.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member was complaining about tax increases during previous 
federal budgets. He is right. We have eliminated some tax breaks 
and subsides to business.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	We responded to demands from Canadians for more fairness in 
the tax system and more balance. One in particular is generating a 
lot of revenue. The hon. member may remember that Canadians 
were quite incensed that at a time of a depressed economy, at a time 
of dropping employment the banks were recording record 
multi-million dollar profits. He may recall one of the tax increases 
of which he is complaining was a surtax on those very bank profits.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2751"> 2751 </A></B>
<P>
	Perhaps the member will remember as well the difficulties small 
businesses have been complaining about in their dealings with 
banks and service charges which consumers are complaining 
about. He may wish to tell Canadians whether the Reform Party 
does or does not support the surtax on multi-million dollar bank 
profits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her question. 
The member raised the issue of surtaxes on banks and in the same 
breath spoke of service charges.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member can tell me if she thinks the surtax 
raised service charges for small businesses or lowered them. Did 
the proceeds from that surtax get passed on to Canadian taxpayers 
or did they simply go to fund ever rising interest payments on the 
debt?
<P>
	In both cases the consumer got nailed. Those surtaxes came back 
to people in the form of higher service charges, higher interest 
rates. That is how the banks made up the difference. Because the 
federal government has been so slow to pay down its debt and 
allows anything that comes in in the form of revenue to simply be 
spent right away, we are paying more because it has waited so long 
to deal with the debt and the deficit problem.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There are a couple of minutes left and the hon. 
member can take another question after question period. It being 
about 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.

it is an honour to rise today and speak about a very gifted athlete 
who hails from Haliburton County. Lesley Tashlin will be 
representing Canada, as she has qualified in the 100 metre hurdle 
track and field event for the Olympic Games in Atlanta.
<P>
	At a recent outdoor meet in the United States Lesley beat the 
qualifying standard time and earned a place on the Canadian team 
for the summer Olympics. She was clocked at a personal best of 
13.04, beating the standard by one-tenth of a second, which in track 
and field is a large amount of time, and she is close to the world 
record of just under 13 seconds.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEREFORM">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REFORM</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to condemn the negative effects the unemployment insurance 
reform will have on women and young people.
<P>
	Statistics show it is women and young people who represent 
almost two thirds of part time workers. Therefore, they will be hard 
hit by the series of new measures.
<P>
	Here are some examples: the eligibility criteria are tougher, the 
benefits are reduced, the maximum benefit period is reduced, the 
claimant must contribute starting from the first hour, frequent users 
are penalized, the eligibility criteria for maternity benefits are 
tougher, and the list could go on and on.
<P>
	This reform demonstrates only one thing: the government's 
blindness, which shows through in its desire to cut, slash and 
destroy social programs. Making the unemploymed shoulder the 
burden of the deficit alone is repugnant, and unfortunately, that is 
what the proposed unemployment insurance reform will do.

honour for me to rise today to acknowledge the important work of 
the Elizabeth Fry Societies as they celebrate Elizabeth Fry week 
from May 6 to 12.
<P>
	The theme of their fourth national week is ``Alternatives to 
Incarceration''. The society and its 21 member societies hope to 
enhance public awareness and education about the circumstances 
of women involved in the criminal justice system.

reflect: that every individual is equal before and under the law and

	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to point out the extraordinary contribution 
made by a great man of international renown, Dr. Gustave Gingras, 
who passed away last week.
<P>
	A native of Montreal, Dr. Gingras founded the Institut de 
réadaptation de Montréal in 1949 and acted as its director general 
until 1977. Because of his reputation, people from all over the 
globe sought his advice. His expertise in planning rehabilitation 
policies was greatly appreciated.
<P>
	He was awarded many prizes, including the Order of Canada, the 
Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, the 
Canadian Centennial Medal, the Silver Medal International, the 
B'nai Brith Humanitarian Award and the Medal of Merit of South 
Vietnam. In 1982, he became a Queen's Honourable Physician.
<P>
	Among other works, he wrote <I>Combats pour la survie</I> and 
cowrote <I>Human Rights for the Physically Handicapped and Aged</I>.
<P>
	The nation has just lost an eminent citizen. To his wife and to all

Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Len Cardozo, a fellow 
Torontonian who unexpectedly passed away last week following 
injuries sustained in a car accident.
<P>
	Since his immigration to Canada from Pakistan in 1974, Len was 
active in many community groups and organizations in our city. 
Important, was a leader in the Goan community in Toronto during 
the past two decades, working to advance the integration of the 
15,000 Christian immigrant community from India and Pakistan.
<P>
	Len was a good neighbour, being active locally as a president of 
the Pelmo Park Community Association, a founding member of the 
St. Francis Xavier Credit Union, working on community relations 
with Humber Memorial Hospital, and president of the Canorient 
Christian Association helping new immigrants and seniors in 
Toronto.
<P>
	Len's passion was politics both federally and provincially, but 
his pride was working to encourage many Torontonians to attend 
the unity rally in Montreal last October, a high point of his political 
involvement.
<P>
	Len and his commitment to his community will be missed. He is 
survived by his wife Melba, four children and four grandchildren.

the Minister of Industry for following the lead taken by numerous 
NDP MPs and the New Democratic government in B.C. in calling 
for an inquiry into high gas prices.
<P>
	Two weeks ago NDP MPs from across the west called for a gas 
boycott as a way to end the high prices. Yesterday Glen Clark, the 
New NDP premier of B.C., established a commission of inquiry 
into gas prices. Premier Romanow also has supported this action 
against oil companies.
<P>
	If the minister is really committed to this inquiry, to this issue, 
give the Bureau of Competition real teeth in tackling the issue by 
setting up an energy price review commission which would act as a

	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Quebec has been involved in mining and mineral 
development for over 150 years. One of the first placer gold finds 
in Canada took place near the Chaudière River in the Eastern 
Townships, and although this find would now be regarded as minor, 
it led to the  production of thousands of ounces of gold between 
1862 and 1886.
<P>
	Quebec is not only the second largest mineral producer in 
Canada, but it has also spent the most on mining since 1992.
<P>
	All this work was not done in vain. Development of the gold 
mine in Louvicourt started last year, and several other mines will 
open in the future. The Grevet zinc and copper mine will open in 
June 1996, the Troilus gold mine early next year, and the Raglan 
nickel and copper mine in 1998.
<P>
	Between 1995 and 1998, $1 billion will be invested in mining in 
Quebec. Thanks to these new mines, the mining industry will 
remain a major contributor to the economy of Quebec and Canada.

	For them, the unemployment insurance reform is just the 
opposite of a magic solution to unemployment. While UI benefits 
provides economic stabilization to these workers, the proposed

<P>
	This survey shows how much opposition the unemployment 
insurance reform project has stirred up in Quebec. According to 79

reform, which they clearly see as serving only to help the federal 
government to reduce public spending.
<P>
	Moreover, in the same survey, three respondents out of four 
expressed the wish to see the Government of Quebec administer the 
unemployment insurance plan. This survey confirms what 
everybody knows already: the reform is not being made in the 
public interest but rather in an attempt to bring the federal deficit 
down. The public will never forget how fiercely the Liberal

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister, of course.
<P>
	By changing its strategy and joining forces with Guy Bertrand in 
taking a hard line against Quebec, the federal government is setting 
itself up for a confrontation not only with Quebec separatists, but 
also with federalists, because it is clearly aligning itself with the 
advocates of plan B, that is the plan to take a hard line with Quebec.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that the federal 
government's decision to get involved in the Bertrand case to 
establish the supremacy of law over democracy is tantamount to 
requiring Quebec to get the permission of all the provinces of 
Canada in order to act on a majority vote in a referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government meets its obligations. On behalf of the 
government, the Minister of Justice is defending the constitutional 
rights of all Canadians.
<P>
	The debate is currently before the courts and they will make the 
appropriate decisions. We will advise following these decisions.
<P>
	As Mr. Bouchard said on Monday, there is no way a government 
could not be involved in a case like this one. When I offered him to 
ask the Attorney General of Canada to stay out it if Quebec did 
likewise, they decided to introduce a motion providing specifically 
that, at some point, the Constitution of Canada would not apply to 
the people of Canada. It is the duty of the government to protect 
Canada's Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Prime Minister acknowledge that, by associating 
with Guy Bertrand, whose intention it is to subordinate the 
democratic decision of Quebecers to the approval of all the 
provinces, he is recreating the climate of confrontation he so 
skilfully created in 1982?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have nothing to add to what I said. It is the duty of the 
government to protect the Canadian Constitution and the vested 
rights of people of all parts of the country.
<P>
	As regards the referendum, we have taken part in referendums. 
We are talking about Quebec's Referendum Act. I have always 
said, and I have said so in the House of Commons a number of 
times: some people believe the country can be broken up by a 
single vote in a referendum. The CSN's constitution requires a two 
thirds majority to change something in it. The same is true for the 
FTQ, and apparently the constitution of the Parti Quebecois as 
well.
<P>
	We say that the laws of Canada must be respected, that there will 
be no unilateral declaration of independence and that international 
law, too, must be respected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the Prime Minister, who was ultimately responsible for 
the constitutional mess of 1982, aware that his strategy of isolating 
Quebec from the rest of Canada is not leading anywhere but to a 
constitutional crisis even more serious than the one we have been 
in since the imposition, 15 years ago, of a Constitution that no one 
in Quebec has signed?

<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois referred repeatedly to democracy. 
There have been two referendums where the people of Quebec have 
decided to remain in Canada. This is what we are asking 
for-respect of democracy.
<P>
	They do not want Quebec to be isolated, and this is my greatest 
wish. I want the premier of Quebec to respect the opinion of 
Quebecers who voted no in the referendum and who, moreover, in 
survey after survey say they would like the Government of Canada 
and the Government of Quebec to sit down together and find a 
solution. This is what we are trying to do.
<P>
	At the first ministers' conference in June, the federal 
government will be prepared to make many of the changes sought 
for years. When I propose change, the Bloc Quebecois does not 
want change. They are not honest enough to say that their only 
concern is separation. Obviously, I will always be against 
separation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, if we follow the Prime Minister's logic, Quebec ought to 
ask all the provinces in Canada for permission to determine its own 
future. Just imagine. The refusal of a single province, 
Newfoundland for example, could block the will of the majority of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	My question is as simple as can be. Is the Prime Minister aware 
that, with his new provocative constitutional strategy, he is seeking 
to encroach on Quebecers' right to decide their future for 
themselves, their fundamental right?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have no objections to hearing what Quebecers want. 
We have had two referendums. We have been involved in them, I 
personally in both. But there is one reality: both times the people of 
Quebec came out in favour of remaining in Canada.
<P>
	But, like the Parti Quebecois, the Bloc Quebecois refuses to 
acknowledge this expression of Quebecers' will. They do not want 
to accept the choice of the people. Saying they are not pleased with 
the outcome, they want to start all over.
<P>
	This is not a hockey playoff here. It is not three out of five, or 
four out of seven. The will of the people must be respected and the 
will of the people is that they want us to have a renewed federalism, 
and this we are prepared to do. It is our hope that the Bloc 
Quebecois, like the Parti Quebecois, will be prepared to help us 
renew Canadian federation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all of Quebec, federalists and sovereignists alike, is hit 
head on by the government's plan B, its hard line of confrontation 
with the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister claim that, for him, the 1982 
Constitution-one that was never signed by Quebec, 
remember-can take priority over democracy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, if you want to talk about the supremacy of 
democracy, start by respecting democracy after two Quebec 
referendums.
<P>
	Instead of using a straight question, there was a so-called 
winning question, yet even with that they lost. That is the 
democratic reality. What the people of Quebec want, like 
Canadians at this time, is for us to work together to renew the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	I have referred to this in my speech. We will be making 
considerable changes, and I trust the Bloc Quebecois will at least 
be objective enough to look at our proposals. Of course they will 
never be satisfied, since they want separation, but that is not what 
Quebecers want.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if he thinks that food inspection is going to unite the 
country, the Prime Minister is living on another planet.
<P>
	If one picks through the various announcements that come from 
the government, there are about five things in things in this 
supposed package. There are the proposals for administrative 
disentanglement. There are some token decentralization proposals. 
There is the veto proposal, the distinct society proposal and limited 
curtailment of federal spending powers.
<P>
	If that is all there is, then the Prime Minister has misread the 
fundamental desire for substantial change in the rest of the country, 
just as he misread the desire for change within Quebec prior to the 
referendum.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister not offer Canadians and the provincial 
premiers something more substantive for revitalizing the 
federation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I gave a long list. I mentioned the spending powers of the 
federal government.
<P>
	We have quite a project and a plan when I compare it with the 
plan of the Reform Party. Probably the desire of the Reform Party 
is to be left with no Canada. For me, I want a government in Ottawa 
that can operate for the benefit of all Canadians and give enough 
autonomy for the provinces to make sure that they serve their 
citizens in the way they should.
<P>
	I have a long list. I have discussed it with the premiers. I hope 
that everybody will look at this list seriously. If everything is 
rejected before negotiations start, we will go nowhere. It is why the 
Reform Party is really going nowhere these days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister says to the premiers in June what he 
has just said to this House, if that is all he has to say about 
revitalizing the federation, he should call off the conference 
because it will be counterproductive.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister again: Can he produce a substantive 
national unity plan prior to the June meetings with the premiers and 
if he can, will he table it and present it in this House?
<P>

<P>
	We learn today that apparently at least five soldiers from the

or even try to stop the massacre. Worse yet, we learn that after 
these events, these soldiers apparently even obtained promotions.

who did not even have the decency to try to stop the torture and 
assassination of a Somali youth, received promotions in the 
Canadian Armed Forces?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

passed by Parliament in 1952, all the power over promotions, up to 
and including the rank of colonel, was delegated by order in 
council to the chief of the defence staff, not the minister.
<P>
	This minister, as other ministers, does not interfere in the 
promotion process in the armed forces.
<P>
	I understand that a number of promotions were held in abeyance 
while various legal proceedings were taking place. Subsequently, 
some of these promotions have been allowed to proceed while 
others are still in abeyance, which is in accordance with normal 
procedure.

whether they are of violence or security aspects, are under total 
review. We are waiting for the report and recommendations from 
the committee. We will ensure that all those recommendations 
which have been reviewed will be in place.
<P>
	In addition, over $400,000 in improvements has been approved,

gender. Warden Jan Fox believes that no female criminals are 
dangerous and that women commit crimes only because they 
themselves are victims.

best approach in addressing a very special need that women have. 
This need has been identified  both by the task force in 1989 and by 
the recent Arbour commission.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the division of the plan was for 16,100 tonnes; 77.5

strike to which the hon. member refers and 22.5 per cent went to 
the small inshore fishermen. The difficulty is that the midshore 
crabbers are not happy with 77.5 per cent. They want 100 per cent.
<P>
	If there are insensitivities in this plan and if there are any 
injustices to plant workers, it is not by this House, it is not by the

would want to join with me in applauding the fact that over the last 
18 months we have seen a steady increase in grain prices around 
the world. These grain price increases are accruing to the benefit of 
our farmers in Canada.
<P>
	With respect to the marketing system, the hon. gentleman knows 
full well that a process has been under way in Canada for many 
months, beginning last year, continuing through the winter and 
coming to fruition in June. It is through the auspices of the western 
grain marketing panel. It will allow all farmers who have different 
perspectives on grain marketing to bring those perspectives 
forward and to have them debated and discussed in a logical and 
orderly manner.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. gentleman would not want me to pre-empt the 
opinions of farmers who have contributed to this process. I would 
remind him, quite contrary to his precipitous advice, that 130,000 
farm families depend upon the viable marketing system for their 
product.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe the 
minister should be known as the minister of procrastination.
<P>
	Alberta farmers have already spoken on this issue. They have 
decided by plebiscite. The minister's refusal to act is costing 
farmers about $2,500 a truckload when they so desperately need 
the money for planting.
<P>
	When will the minister stop working against farmers and act on 
their democratically determined wishes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is an interesting 
contradiction in what the hon. gentleman is suggesting.
<P>
	The member is obviously an opponent of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. He is obviously requesting this government to take a course 
of action that would diminish the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Interestingly enough, in conjunction with our red book in 1993, we 
indicated support for the Canadian Wheat Board. If we were to do 
what the hon. member is suggesting, we would be violating one of 
our election campaign commitments. It is interesting that 
Reformers seem to be prepared to invite us to do that when in 
another context and in such a sanctimonious way they invite us to 
adhere to the red book promises. Will they make up their minds?

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The government's policy has driven the unemployment rate up 
and the Governor of the Bank of Canada has told us why: interest 
rate policies have kept the economy in a low growth vice to the 
point where we are on the verge of a catastrophic deflation.
<P>
	In opposition the Liberal Party condemned the job killing 
policies of former Bank of Canada Governor John Crow. Is it not 
time the finance minister ate some crow, admitted that he has been 
supporting the same job killing policies and instructed the Bank of 
Canada to work for sustainable economic growth, not against an 
imaginary inflation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
the time the citations the member sets forth were made, we were in 
opposition and Canadian interest rates were substantially higher 
than the interest rates in the United States.
<P>
	Today as a result of the actions of this government, Canadian 
short term interest rates are substantially below U.S. interest rates. 
They are almost 400 bases points or four percentage points below 
those of a year ago.
<P>
	Also, employment is on the increase as a result of the actions of 
this government. Unemployment has dropped down from 11.5 per 
cent to 9.4 per cent. In the last four months the country has created 
over 160,000 new jobs. That is a fundamental difference between 
today and then.

	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	This week having been proclaimed national mining week, the 
keep mining in Canada lobby has produced a provocative 12 point 
plan for mining in our country.
<P>
	Will the government be acting on this 12 point plan and what 
will it being doing to further promote mining in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 12 point plan is 
substantially consistent with the government's current objectives 
and responsibilities.
<P>
	The government is acting in areas of federal jurisdiction to 
strengthen Canada's mining industry. Canada remains one of the 
best places in the world for mineral investment. We estimate that 
49 mines may open over the next two years.
<P>
	In addition, I am very pleased with the industry's involvement in 
Canada's second annual mining week currently taking place. It is 
through partnerships like this that we raise the awareness of mining 
to Canadians everywhere in the country.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCEACT">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-12, 
an act employment insurance in Canada, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak on one of 
the most important pieces of legislation on the agenda of the 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2764"> 2764 </A></B>
<P>
	The government in its commitment to Canada said new 
employment insurance legislation would be law by July 1 of this 
year. I begin my remarks by encouraging hon. members to give 
swift passage to the bill so that Canadians can begin to quickly 
benefit from a more fair and balanced regime, one that removes 
the inequities that have characterized the current unemployment 
insurance system.
<P>
	The new proposed EI system follows more than two years of 
consultation with Canadians in all walks of life. I held four town 
hall meetings in the fall of 1994 to get the input of people in my 
riding. Because of this public input, the new employment insurance 
bill will help unemployed Canadians get jobs. It will strengthen 
work initiatives, ensure fairer treatment for all workers and help 
workers adjust to our changing economic climate by investing in 
back to work benefits. It will save Canadian taxpayers $1.2 billion 
by the year 2001.
<P>
	I will concentrate now on the benefits to a large group in my 
riding, the part time workers and multiple job holders. As amended 
by the standing committee, the new system is simpler, more 
modern and fairer. At the centre of the new approach is the method 
of qualifying for EI based on hours of work rather than weeks. A 
week is a very clumsy measure of a person's work. Using it to 
calculate unemployment insurance credits is neither accurate nor 
adequate.
<P>
	For the current unemployment insurance purposes, a week is a 
week whether it contains 15 hours or 70 hours. This fails to 
accommodate the reality of today's labour market where more and 
more people are working part time and holding more than one part 
time job.
<P>
	In the current system a person needs 15 hours of work in any one 
week to qualify for UI. Less than that and the person is out of luck. 
Over time this has led to a situation in which some employees hire 
a person for less than 15 hours a week in order to avoid UI 
premiums.
<P>
	I have heard from many constituents in my riding who have 
suffered due to this barrier. A worker with less than 15 hours per 
week, even working year round, could not qualify for UI. Neither 
could a person holding two or three small jobs which may well be 
the hour equivalent to a full time job.
<P>
	For example, someone holding down three part time jobs 
requiring 14 hours per week, totalling 42 hours, does not qualify 
for UI benefits. On the other hand, a person with a single 42 hour a 
week job does qualify. This is double jeopardy for part time 
workers and holders of multiple jobs. They have difficulty getting 
more hours of work because of the 15 hour ceiling imposed by 
employers. What they do get does not qualify them for UI benefits.
<P>
	By counting hours per week, the new employment insurance act 
brings forward these inequities and treats them on a fair and
<P>
equitable basis. EI also provides better  rules for setting the level of 
benefits for part time workers. Current UI benefits are based on 
total earning weeks prior to job loss. The new EI system will use 
average earnings over a fixed period before job loss. The period 
will vary with the unemployment rate in each region. Benefits will 
be based on the average weekly earnings figure, with the result that 
all earnings in the fixed period will count toward benefits. That is a 
fair system.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	With amendments introduced as a result of the standing 
committee review, the gaps in income will be taken into account 
through an improved method of looking back 26 weeks prior to the 
claim. Furthermore, regional differences in employment conditions 
will be taken into account by a new divisor that is two weeks more 
than the minimum entrance requirement for the region.
<P>
	These measures link benefits more directly to earnings than the 
current UI system. They provide greater incentive for workers to 
seek additional work.
<P>
	Bill C-12 benefits part time workers and multiple job holders in 
several fundamental ways. The higher a worker's earnings in the 26 
week period prior to unemployment, up to an annual ceiling, the 
higher the benefit regardless of the work pattern. Total earnings in 
that 26 week period prior to unemployment from all jobs, including 
part time jobs of less than 15 hours per week, are included. Extra 
work during the fixed earnings period, even at lower wages, will 
add to average earnings and therefore benefits.
<P>
	The effect of all of this is that under EI 2.4 million people who 
are now part time workers will have their earnings insured, 
compared with the current 1.9 million. No less than 500,000 
additional part time workers will have their work insured for the 
first time. Some of these workers will have to pay premiums for the 
first time as well. It is estimated that 76 per cent, some 380,000, 
will have their premiums refunded.
<P>
	As a group, fewer part time workers will pay premiums: 1.7 
million under EI compared with 1.9 million under the old UI. 
About 300,000 part time workers now paying premiums who earn 
less than $2,000 per year will have their premiums refunded. That 
is significant. For the remaining 1.6 million part time workers who 
now pay premiums under the UI system there will be a reduction 
from $3 to $2.95 for every hundred dollars of insurable earnings. In 
all, part time workers as a group will pay a total of about $6 million 
less in premiums than they do today.
<P>
	Bill C-12 provides an employment insurance system that 
matches current economic realities in Canada. Employment 
insurance will continue to provide income support for 2.4 million 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2765"> 2765 </A></B>
<P>
unemployed Canadians. Employment insurance matches the 
varying labour  market conditions across the country. Employment 
insurance treats all workers fairly and realistically measures their 
work in calculating benefits. Employment insurance encourages 
workers to add to their hours and incomes and discourages 
dependency on income support.
<P>
	The new system's active employment measures will contribute 
to getting the unemployed back to work and will contribute to job 
creation and growth. Employment insurance requirements will be 
much simpler for employers to administer.
<P>
	Having contributed for 32 years to this program, I know it needs 
to be changed. The members of our party and I are prepared to 
support this legislation. We must move quickly to assist the 
taxpayers of Canada so that $1.2 billion will be saved by the year 
2001. Members have every reason to pass the bill into law without 
delay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the 
hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain was in Prince Edward 
Island with the committee studying youth last weekend. We were 
most fortunate to have him with us. When he was there he was also 
talking to quite a number of islanders. Could he tell us the 
islanders' views on the new EI legislation? I will give the member 
a little background. Earlier this morning the hon. member for Lévis 
left a mistaken impression of what the minister of economic 
development for P.E.I said at committee.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	I quote for the benefit of both the hon. members for 
Souris-Moose Mountain and Lévis what the minister of economic 
development for P.E.I. said: ``We were never afraid from a Prince 
Edward Island perspective to change the existing system. We have 
gone through that a number of times''.
<P>
	He went on to say: ``I do hope you have some influence on 
government members who sit on the committee as well, because I 
think it is very important that you take the opportunity to hear from 
some people within the seasonal industry''.
<P>
	He concluded by saying: ``We in Prince Edward Island certainly 
support the government's move to address the situation you 
identified. You have the support of the Government of Prince 
Edward Island and, I would assume, of all the political parties in 
Prince Edward Island''.
<P>
	Based on the hon. member's assessment, does he believe that the 
people at the meeting in Prince Edward Island view the changes 
made as being very positive and forward looking, contrary to what 
the member for Lévis tried to indicate earlier?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question of the hon. 
member for Malpeque.
<P>
	Let me assure the member that the people on the island and 
across eastern Canada support the initiatives put forward. If anyone 
understands the problem, certainly it would be the people on the 
island.
<P>
	They are prepared to change and they are looking for the 
leadership that the government, through the minister and the 
committee, can provide. They understand that change is inevitable 
and that change will accommodate those people who have been left 
out the system through some of the inequities of the past. If a 
person works 15 hours a week, those 15 hours should be recognized 
as a contribution.
<P>
	I thank the member for raising this question. From time to time 
there are errors in quotations that are read. I am happy that the the 
minister of economic development for P.E.I. came before the 
committee to clarify the issue. Workers are able to see the positive 
initiatives and recognize that those people with less than 15 hours 
of week can accumulate those hours. They will recognize that 
through EI benefits they will be treated fairly by the system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very 
brief. By inviting his colleague to corroborate his comments, the 
hon. member for Malpeque tried to correct an impression. Even 
though I do not have the blues in front of me at this time, I 
remember full well the answer he gave to one of my questions. I 
asked him what he meant by talking to other Liberal members to 
convince them to ease up a little because, as he said, the changes 
were a little too fast.
<P>
	I will ask the hon. member a very simple question to give him an 
opportunity to answer. Does he, who represents a riding in Prince 
Edward Island, agree that his fellow citizens are losing $11 
million?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understood the first part of the 
question.
<P>
	When we are going through with the changes to this bill, in 
summary for all Canadians whether they are from the riding of the 
hon. member or from Prince Edward Island, I think he will find that 
the legislation will deal fairly with all those people who had been 
left out of the system.
<P>
	Will there be enough money for everybody? Yes, there will. Just 
the idea of reducing the payment feature from $3 to $2.95 is 
significant. Women who had been left out of the system because 
they had to work at a number of small jobs are now going to 
become part of the process. I believe the government is to be 
commended. I am sure the legislation will receive support across 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-12 is not just about modernizing an outdated unemployment 
insurance system. It is about  jobs. It is about creating new 
opportunities and a climate for job creation. It is about helping 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2766"> 2766 </A></B>
<P>
unemployed Canadians find jobs. It is about breaking through the 
status quo, helping young people, women, displaced workers 
across the country get back to work quickly and back in control of 
their lives. It is about the government's number one priority: 
investing in Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	In the last four months, employment jumped by 91,000 jobs, the 
largest quarterly growth in two years. Since November 1993, more 
than half a million jobs, 596,000, have been created in the country. 
Our job strategy is working. Employment insurance is a key part of 
this strategy. The cornerstone of employment insurance is set out in 
part II of Bill C-12, the new employment benefits.
<P>
	We are making active pro-employment measures an integral part 
of the insurance program. We are saying that employment 
insurance should not just be about passive income support for the 
unemployed. It should help break down the barriers that keep the 
unemployed from working. It should help to make sure that people 
who lose their jobs get the help they need as they try to adjust and 
adapt to a fast changing economy. It should make sure that as our 
economy grows and changes, people get the type of assistance they 
need to adjust.
<P>
	Employment insurance will do this by focusing on what works, 
the things that really make a difference for people looking for 
work; by working together, building bridges between different 
levels of government, business, communities and service 
organizations; by clarifying the federal government's role in the 
labour market and creating new flexible arrangements with the 
provinces and territories to harmonize the delivery of the proposed 
employment benefits with provincial programs.
<P>
	Let us look at how these points are addressed in Bill C-12. The 
bill defines in the clearest and simplest way possible the objective 
of active employment benefits: helping people find and keep 
employment.
<P>
	Employment benefits are focused on results and they will be 
managed by results. Only one rule really matters: getting people 
back to work. This rule is enshrined right in the legislation in 
section 57(1)(f). We are simplifying the maze of federal 
employment programs into a much simpler, more flexible set of 
tools that have been tried, tested and proven to get results.
<P>
	For example, wage subsidies work. They encourage employers 
to hire an individual who is likely to face long term unemployment 
or barriers to employment. Under past programs people who 
received these subsidies were able to get an average of 16 more 
weeks of work, increase average annual earnings by close to 
$5,000, eliminate almost four weeks of social assistance, and all 
this at a cost of just $3,000 per participant.
<P>
	Targeted earnings supplements work. They help make work for 
unemployed workers who need help getting  re-established in a job. 
Self-assistance employment works to help unemployed people 
create their own work and in the process create work for others as 
well.
<P>
	Our experience to date shows that these new entrepreneurs earn 
$142 a week more than non-participants, claim 92 per cent less UI 
than comparable workers and are 30 per cent less likely to use 
social assistance. On average, each participant who starts up a new 
business for themselves also creates another job for someone else.
<P>
	Job creation partnerships work. Under this benefit, unemployed 
workers are encouraged to earn income while developing new 
skills and acquiring valuable work experience. This type of 
employment benefit not only improves an individual's future job 
prospects but helps to develop and diversify local economies.
<P>
	We also know that skills work. The best ticket to a job for any 
Canadian is having the skills required for today's economy. Where 
provinces agree, a fifth employment benefit, skill loans and grants, 
will be offered, allowing unemployed workers to pursue skills 
training. These grants and loans will be focused on individual 
choice and responsibility rather than government directed training.
<P>
	We also recognize that training and education are provincial 
responsibilities. Therefore, skill loans and grants will only be 
implemented in a province with the agreement of that province. In 
fact, one of the strengths of Bill C-12 is that it clarifies, more than 
ever before, federal and provincial responsibilities in this area. It 
commits the federal government to working in concert with 
provinces to help workers find jobs.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The federal government through formal agreements with 
provinces will ensure that the needs of the unemployed are 
addressed and that the employment measures allow them to return 
quickly to the workforce. This is an unprecedented gesture of 
openness and flexibility that proves federalism is a dynamic, 
evolving system that can change to meet the needs of real people.
<P>
	Ultimately Bill C-12 is about building bridges, breaking down 
the old barriers that stopped us from working together in the past, 
and breaking down the barriers which keep Canadians from 
working. Results are what really matter to Canadians, no matter 
what level of government delivers the employment benefits and 
measures. Flexibility, accountability, co-operation and partnerships 
are the key to getting results.
<P>
	Employment insurance allows new partnerships to develop and 
evolve for the future. It will lead to more effective labour market 
programs, better matched to local labour market realities. It will 
focus all resources and energies on the real challenge at hand; 
helping Canadians find and keep employment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2767"> 2767 </A></B>
<P>
	We will be investing some $800 million of the savings we will 
achieve with this legislation into active employment benefits. With 
the current $1.9 billion already budgeted for employment services, 
this means a total of $2.7 billion to actively help unemployed 
people get back to work.
<P>
	That investment will pay off by helping up to 400,000 Canadians 
each year and creating more than 100,000 new jobs. In addition a 
$300 million transitional jobs fund will create thousands more jobs 
in high unemployment areas. Those are the kinds of results we 
need. That is what employment insurance should be all about, 
helping people who lose their jobs get back to work as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	This is a top priority for the government and for all Canadians 
across this country. Working Canadians want more than rigid, 
bureaucratic programs and an outdated UI program designed to 
preserve the status quo. Canadians want jobs. They want a system 
that gets results, an employment insurance system for the 21st 
century. They need a modern, active, effective employment 
insurance system defined in this legislation and I recommend this 
bill to the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was prepared to 
make a 20 minute speech, but I am told that we are now limited to 
10 minutes, so I will outline 10 ideas. The first one that comes to 
mind is self-evident. For me, today is an ill-fated day, a sad day, 
because it is the third and last reading of Bill C-12 on 
unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
	It is sad because this reform brings with it $2 billion in cuts, in 
addition to the $5 billion in cuts prescribed by the first federal 
budget and Bill C-17 on unemployment insurance, let us not forget.
<P>
	These cuts are in addition to the others. Let us not forget either 
the 3 million people who, at one time or another in the past year, 
qualified for UI benefits. Everyone will be hit by cuts of at least 10 
per cent.
<P>
	But it is also sad for democracy, because if there is an important 
bill now under consideration, it is this one, which affects 3 million 
people. If there is an important bill that has been introduced by this 
government in the course of this Parliament, it is this one.
<P>
	What did the government do with its most important bill? It tried 
to cover up by setting an agenda throwing as little light as possible 
on this bill.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I sat on the human resources development committee. We talked 
about a comprehensive social program reform which included an 
unemployment insurance reform component. We toured the 
country and 80 per cent of the people told us they were against this 
reform. We tabled our report in February 1995 and waited a very  
long time, until after the referendum. Seven or eight months went 
by before this bill was finally introduced in the House of Commons 
on December 1.
<P>
	Why December 1? Because it was Christmastime. They were 
hoping that the bill would go through unnoticed, but it did not. 
Demonstrations were held all over the place, particularly in the 
Atlantic provinces and Quebec. But reaction to the proposed 
reform was not as strong in some regions, for instance the Quebec 
City and Chaudière-Appalaches region. At first glance, the news 
does not seem to have cause much of a stir in that region.
<P>
	But that is because a gag order was imposed on us, as the 
government repeatedly tried to prevent us from speaking up, 
starting at the first reading stage. Then second reading was skipped 
altogether and the bill underwent prestudy in committee, where 
limitations were put on the scope of the committee's work. Only 
twice since Confederation has a gag order being put on a committee 
and its work curtailed.
<P>
	At report stage, the House was again gagged and now, at third 
reading, debate is limited to just one day. But the day was carefully 
chosen to coincide with juicier political events, or at least so they 
seem. First, there was Bill C-33, a bill on discrimination against 
homosexuals. That is an important issue, I agree. What do they do? 
They make this debate coincide with all the debates in Quebec and 
elsewhere around Mr. Bertrand's case, intended to draw media 
attention to an important issue indeed, namely the Canadian 
Constitution and the law Mr. Bertrand wishes to have invoked to 
prevent Quebec from achieving sovereignty. The bill before us is 
important, but set against this political backdrop, it is 
overshadowed.
<P>
	I mentioned petitions. Some can be entertained by the House 
while other are not in order. Yesterday, I was in Beauce, a quiet 
region boasting the largest concentration of small and medium size 
businesses in Quebec, with more than 500 businesses, and I was 
handed a petition signed by 2,142 citizens circulated by a coalition 
for social fairness. Unfortunately, they forgot to specify to whom 
the petition was being addressed, by saying: ``We pray that the 
House of Commons will withdraw the bill''. They were opposed to 
the bill, but they forgot the words ``House of Commons''. 
Therefore, the petition is out of order, but I pledged to give it to 
whom it may concern, so, at the end of my speech, I will deliver it 
to the office of the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
because this is very important.
<P>
	This morning, I tabled a petition signed by MIL Davie workers, 
who were hit very hard. As you know, MIL Davie is the largest 
private company in the Quebec City region. I looked at the impact 
the bill would have on these workers. Assuming that, this year, the 
unemployment rate and the number of jobless remain the same as 
in the last five years, the impact will amount to $884,280. This is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2768"> 2768 </A></B>
<P>
just for these workers. However, after five years, because of the 
recurrent effect, the shortfall  for these workers from the Lévis 
region, who have to feed their family and buy goods and groceries, 
will be close to $1.4 million. People seem to forget this.
<P>
	Last year, 59,000 people received unemployment insurance 
benefits in the Quebec City and Chaudière-Appalaches region. 
These benefits totalled $586,064,393. This is a lot of money. Using 
the percentage set by the government itself for the purpose of the 
reform, that is 10 per cent when fully implemented, it means a 
shortfall of $58 million, almost $60 million, for the Quebec City 
region. This will have an impact on corner store owners, but also on 
automobile dealers.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	It will have an impact on everyone, not just the families affected. 
For the province as a whole, the total economic impact of this 
reform when fully implemented will be an annual shortfall of $534 
million, or a 10 per cent reduction.
<P>
	When Liberal members rise in this House, I systematically ask 
them if they realize that this annual shortfall will amount to $105 
million in Newfoundland, $116 million in Prince Edward Island, 
$63 million in Nova Scotia, $72 million in New Brunswick. In 
Quebec, as I said, the shortfall will be $534 million per year, in 
addition to some $700 million lost through Bill C-17. In other 
words, the Liberal government will deprive Quebecers of an annual 
amount of $1.2 billion in the coming years. The annual shortfall 
will be $380 million in Ontario, $31 million in Manitoba, $26 
million in Saskatchewan, $93 million in Alberta, as for British 
Columbia-I heard the hon. member for Medicine Hat, a region of 
Alberta close to B.C.-it will be $240 million.
<P>
	So, based on the government's own figures, we are talking about 
a total of $1.56 billion. Observers say that, on the contrary, it is 
over $2 billion.
<P>
	There is also an impact on industries, some of which are more 
affected than others. In forestry, 14 per cent less; in agriculture, 12 
per cent less; in manufacturing, 9 per cent less; in construction, 9 
per cent less; in transportation, 8 per cent less; in the hotel industry, 
8 per cent less; in mining, 7 per cent less; in government services, 
because of cutbacks, 7 per cent less; in real estate, 6 per cent less; 
in business, 6 per cent less; in finance, etc., 5 per cent less, and so 
on. No sector will benefit from the reform.
<P>
	What is scandalous about this is that members across the way got 
themselves elected under the leadership of the present Prime 
Minister, the very one who wrote a letter on March 26, 1993 
denouncing as scandalous the bill the Conservatives wanted to 
pass. He objected, he found it unjust. I say to him, that this bill he 
presented before the House is also unjust, regressive and poverty 
creating.
<P>
	And if they think that it is only the Bloc Quebecois that is against 
this bill, the results of a survey appeared in <I>Le Devoir</I> today,
<P>
indicating Quebecers' views on the issue. The article is entitled: 
``75 per cent of Quebecers for patriation of unemployment 
insurance''. But they are against the effects of the measures 
announced.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebec is here to represent the interests of Quebec and 
also, as the official opposition, of all Canadians. And we feel we 
have people's support.
<P>
	The member for Mercier gave the Minister of Human Resources 
Development 40,000 protest postcards from people throughout 
Quebec. We do not feel alone. The newspaper says that the member 
for Mercier found a closed door. The minister was not there, just as 
he was not there last week for people who had travelled 14 hours by 
bus to meet with him here in Ottawa. No minister wanted to meet 
with them. No minister, not even the Prime Minister, wanted to 
meet with them.
<P>
	All this is to tell you in the few minutes I have that Quebec, and 
not just Quebec, but people from the maritimes, as well as 80 per 
cent of people who submitted briefs were against UI reform.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to begin with, I have a comment on what the hon. member across 
the floor has just said.
<P>
	I would like to comment on employment insurance and women. 
The bill before the House this afternoon is one which eliminates the 
15 hour-week gimmick. In order to avoid having to contribute to 
unemployment insurance, certain employers keep their part time 
employees under 15 hours a week.
<P>
	The new system, based on hours worked, will eliminate that 
invisible limit. In the new system as well, employers will have 
fewer reasons to limit their part time workers' hours, because all 
hours worked will be insurable under the system.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	It must be remembered also that women make up the bulk of 
such workers, 69 per cent in fact. When it comes to women and 
employment insurance, we wanted to extend the protection offered 
to all part time workers. It must also be kept in mind that of the 
270,000 women working part time in Canada, only 204,000 will be 
entitled to a refund of their contributions.
<P>
	It is also worth mentioning that many women in this country 
hold down more than one job. They do so simply because they are 
not eligible for employment insurance, since they work fewer than 
15 hours a week.
<P>
	Another important point is that the monies paid out in 
employment insurance support measures will assist more than 
180,000 women here in this country to find work.
<P>
	My question is as follows. The hon. member opposite has made a 
comment about this bill being regressive in  nature, and about its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2769"> 2769 </A></B>
<P>
creating joblessness. Does he not recognize that this bill represents 
a certain equity toward women?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the contrary. The member's timing is 
perfect. I know that, in a speech she will be making soon, the hon. 
member for Québec will have the opportunity to give him this 
information. It is true that the majority of unsure part time 
jobs-70 per cent-are held by women, but some are also held by 
young people. What should be remembered is that, in theory, they 
will be able to qualify, but in practice, exactly the opposite will 
happen.
<P>
	I will explain to the member who usually understands things 
pretty well. This is what will happen. It is true that some employers 
did as the hon. member said, but there will be a change of 
behaviour on their part. Before, they did not pay premiums for 
employees who worked 15 hours or less. Now that they will have to 
pay premiums, what will happen? They will prefer making 
permanent employees work overtime instead of paying premiums.
<P>
	It must be remembered that the bill is a bit like Robin Hood in 
reverse. This bill lowers the ceiling of insurable earnings from 
$42,380 to $39,000, so that employers will be inclined to ask those 
employees to work overtime and there will be less work for part 
time employees. This is the opposite of what was intended.
<P>
	As for the statistics, according to projections made by a number 
of experts in the field, 25 per cent of women working part time for 
more than 15 hours per week will be dropped from the system 
because the number of hours is being raised. In order to qualify, a 
person in my region would now have to work 17 hours and a half 
per week for 26 weeks. Before, the number of hours required was 
much less.
<P>
	People are being eliminated. At least 25 per cent of people are 
going to be dropped from the system. Only an additional 5 per cent 
will be covered. The difference then is minus 20 per cent. This are 
real figures, these are the department's figures. These are not 
made-up figures, they are not juggled up. These are the figures 
from the department.
<P>
	If this bill is so good, how is it that, last Sunday, the Fédération 
des femmes du Québec, said-after a thorough study-that it was 
discriminating against women and young people? They even 
wondered if they should not go to court to condemn the 
discriminatory nature of this legislation, given that the two groups 
most affected by these changes are the women and young people.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, although 
I was born in the Saguenay region, I am the member for Québec. I 
am happy to be able to express my views on this bill again today. I 
can say that I am happy to be able to express my views on this bill, 
but I am not  so happy about what this government is getting ready 
to vote on.
<P>
	Let me tell you why I am not so happy about this bill. This bill 
will penalize a great many people in my riding. I am thinking, for 
example, of the artists, the women and the people in my riding who 
are currently unemployed. Some of the people in my riding live 
below the poverty line; in some parts of my riding, 50 per cent of 
the population live below the poverty line.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	So I can say that artists and seasonal workers in my riding, 
including those working in the tourist industry, will be penalized by 
this bill.
<P>
	I am also thinking of the young people and women in my riding. 
I know that there are many single mothers and young people in my 
riding who are currently unemployed.
<P>
	This bill also creates overlap and duplication, despite the fine 
promises in the throne speech. As recently as yesterday, Mr. 
Chrétien, the Prime Minister said that he might take steps to end 
federal encroachment in areas of provincial jurisdiction. More fine 
promises. They made a commitment in the throne speech, but they 
do not even have the courage to do so in a bill like the one now 
under consideration.
<P>
	I am not happy either about the criteria being tightened. Yet, the 
government is able to keep $5 billion in the UI fund, even though it 
no longer pays a single penny into it.
<P>
	I think this is a bad bill that will penalize a lot of people. It does 
not take into consideration the labour market reality, the economic 
situation and the fact that jobs are precarious. This bill also 
completely disregards the Quebec people's desire to repatriate 
manpower training.
<P>
	According to a SONDAGEM survey just released 75 per cent of 
the people want Quebec to administer the unemployment insurance 
program. Seventy per cent were of the opinion that occupational 
training should also come under provincial jurisdiction. That is not 
coming from us, but from the people, who happen to think like us. 
This government does not respect the wishes of Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Neither do you, my hon. friend 
opposite. But when you speak, I listen to what you have to say.
<P>
	This is a bad bill because it will make the number of welfare 
recipients swell in Quebec and perhaps in Canada as well. This bill 
does not take this reality into account. In fact, the President of the 
Treasury Board boasted that, when the Quebec government brought 
its budget down, the federal government would be able to say that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2770"> 2770 </A></B>
<P>
only the  Canadian government can provide the required social 
safety net.
<P>
	That is what makes me say that the number of welfare recipients 
in Quebec will swell as a result of this bill. Who will bear the brunt 
of this? The provinces of course, and Quebec in particular. 
Especially since cuts have been made in the Canada social transfer 
as well. Some may have forgotten, but I will repeat it for the benefit 
of those listening to what I have to say, cuts to the Canada social 
transfer will also reduce funding for welfare.
<P>
	This is a bad bill because it will drive people down poverty lane 
even faster than before. It is a punitive bill, penalizing the 
unemployed. They are being made to pay for the fact that jobs are 
precarious. I will tell you why in a moment.
<P>
	What a shame that I do not have more than ten minutes to speak 
on this bill, because many people will be penalized by a great many 
aspects of this bill.
<P>
	At the same time, the bill gives presents to certain people: 
employers and those employees who hold a job and earn more than 
$39,000. These employees will no longer have to pay premiums, 
which would otherwise amount to $900 million. What impact will 
this measure have? Employees earning $39,000 will work overtime 
because no employer will want to hire part time or occasional 
employees for whom they would have to pay employer 
contributions to the UI fund. This is therefore a bad bill.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I am going to tell you why it is a bad bill. It is bad because 77 per 
cent of women have part time jobs and 31 per cent of these jobs are 
held by women working fewer than 15 hours. We know that, with 
this bill, those working fewer than 15 hours will have to pay 
premiums, but will not be able to qualify.
<P>
	It is a well known fact that one way of governing is to go after 
the public for more money. It is therefore a bad bill because women 
earn $25,000 and less. It is a bad bill because they will double their 
hours of work and those working part time will not be able to 
qualify.
<P>
	When women who have children or leave the labour market for a 
prolonged period want to return on a part time basis, they still have 
to put in much more time and will still not be able to qualify.
<P>
	Although the Secretary of State for the Status of Women has told 
us that this is an equitable and inclusive bill, the tightening of 
criteria leads us to expect the contrary. Fewer people will qualify, 
and they will receive much less money and many fewer weeks of 
benefits.
<P>
	A UN rapporteur said that violence is a social problem rooted in 
the inequality between the sexes. I bring this to your attention 
today because I know that the government has boasted that it has a 
strategic plan on equality between the sexes and that this plan will 
be  implemented in all departments. I think that they have got off to 
a bad start. The Minister of Human Resources Development is 
passing a bill that will run counter to the economic interests of 
women.
<P>
	I also wanted to point out that artists in my riding will suffer. In a 
letter addressed to this same Minister of Human Resources 
Development, the Conseil de la culture de Québec said that it was a 
bad bill because artists' work is seasonal and this will aggravate 
their economic conditions. There will therefore be an important 
loss of income for dancers, given the contractual and seasonal 
nature of their work.
<P>
	Why? For three reasons: eligibility is based on the number of 
hours worked; the length of the benefit period is linked to the 
weeks immediately preceding the last week worked; and an 
intensity rule has been added. We know that when women and 
seasonal workers, including artists and people working in the 
tourist industry, apply repeatedly for unemployment insurance, 
because of the precarious nature of their employment, they will 
lose 1 per cent a year over five years.
<P>
	If this is a good bill, why did 40,000 people sign a petition 
condemning it? Why did the Fédération des femmes du Québec and 
other groups representing women in Canada condemn this bill? 
Why did 75 per cent of those who submitted briefs to the 
committee with suggestions for this minister and the people who 
are going to pass this bill today say they were against it?
<P>
	It is a pity, and I hope that this government will pay the price one 
day.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I note with 
interest that the hon. member for Quebec does not mention in her 
remarks that part II of the bill lays out very clearly the five major 
employment tools that will be used with the consent of the 
provinces, in this case the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	I want to ask her a very specific question relating to seasonal 
workers and part time workers. The member has said over and over 
again that part time workers are worse off.
<P>
	Under this bill, some 18,000 people in Quebec who fall outside 
the old UI system will now be eligible for unemployment insurance 
under this system. For the first time in the history of this program 
these people will qualify because they are part timers. They are 
women, students and low income Canadians. If a person is working 
part time, they are not making a whole lot of money. These folks 
are eligible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2771"> 2771 </A></B>
<P>
	Why does the member continue to say that this bill excludes 
people under the system when the facts show that 18,000 
Quebecers will benefit, going to the hourly based system from the 
week system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see that my colleague, 
who is preparing to vote in favour of this bad bill, has not got a very 
accurate handle on the reality of part time work. Let me take the 
example of someone who holds down two part time jobs in order to 
qualify and then finds this is no longer possible, because the hours 
do not suit, or because, if a woman, her household duties do not 
allow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> That's the best you can do?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> You asked me a question and I am 
going to answer, but listen. I will speak up a bit. These people will 
not be able to qualify because they will have dropped one of their 
two jobs. That is the McJob syndrome. It is quite obvious that the 
hon. member has a full time job.
<P>
	Let me tell you that a number of people in Quebec and, I am 
happy to say, elsewhere in Canada have objected to this bill, 
specifically as it relates to part time workers. It is obvious that the 
hon. member has not had to live with such working conditions on a 
daily basis, and his contempt and lack of understanding are equally 
obvious.
<P>
	When 75 per cent of people have come out against this bill, I 
think some of them must be right. Therefore-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. member's time is 
up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, begging your 
pardon, but my colleague from Québec has not had her ten minutes, 
for I stopped at ten minutes to the hour. Moreover, and I do not 
know if you will accept this argument, she was constantly heckled 
by the parliamentary secretary, who showed his contempt for the 
unemployed, the victims of unemployment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the time was already 
several minutes past the limit. If the House is unanimous in 
extending her time, that can be done, but it is the unfortunate duty 
of the Speaker to cut people off from time to time. I have not done 
the calculation, but I believe enough time has been allowed for 
asking and responding to the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this debate is proving to be about how the different parties in the 
House see the future.
<P>
	It shows this government is putting even more tools in place to 
help Canadians get the jobs of today's economy as part of its 
commitment to a productive jobs strategy.
<P>
	It shows we have found an appropriate middle course in this key 
labour market area between the unrealistic claims of the official 
opposition, and the narrow policies of the third party.
<P>
	It shows this government is committed to a respect for, and 
partnerships with, other governments that will work far better than 
the old top-down solutions. We are determined to work with others 
to do more to put unemployed people back to work.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	In my comments in this debate, I want to focus on what these 
factors mean in Quebec. There are two main issues: training and 
employment benefits and measures. I will address both.
<P>
	The federal government understands that its strategy to foster 
economic growth and job creation depends on having a highly 
skilled, mobile and adaptable workforce. Employment insurance 
provides, through partnership with provinces and the private sector, 
a range of active employment measures to help unemployed 
Canadians find and keep work.
<P>
	We want them to have access to effective re-employment 
measures-ones that get people jobs quickly. Ones that reduce 
future demands on income benefits under employment insurance.
<P>
	The goal is to provide practical, proven measures that will help 
Canadians get back to work quickly, and keep working. The old 
system is not good enough in today's economy. Quebec shares 
these interests. On November 27, 1995, the Prime Minister stated 
our intention with complete clarity.
<P>
	Let me remind the House of his words when he spoke about 
employment insurance. ``The Government of Canada will propose 
an approach that respects provincial jurisdiction and 
responsibilities in the fields of education and labour market 
training. Accordingly, the government of Canada will withdraw 
from labour market training, apprenticeship programs, 
co-operative education programs and workplace based training. It 
will no longer purchase training courses, either directly or 
indirectly, from provincial establishments, either public or 
private''.
<P>
	Our government repeated this commitment in the throne speech 
of February 27. It promised once more that it would gradually 
withdraw from this sector within three years, so that there will be a 
smooth transition for all those involved. I fact, we will bring that 
process to a conclusion much sooner if this is what the provinces 
want.
<P>
	This was not a hollow commitment. It is backed up by the 
approach to active employment benefits in Bill C-12. To hear some 
hon. members talk, one would think they still do not know this. 
One would think they had not read the bill. Let me help them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2772"> 2772 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, this bill expressly limits the federal capacity to 
implement the skills loans and grants employment benefits to 
those provinces in which that government agrees. If Quebec says 
no, then there would be no such activity for employment insurance 
clients in Quebec.
<P>
	Part II of Bill C-12 also commits the government of Canada to 
work in concert with Quebec and other provincial governments on 
the design, implementation and evaluation of employment 
measures for employment insurance clients. Those measures 
include wage subsidies, earnings supplements, self employment 
assistance and job creation partnerships. We want to develop 
flexible new arrangements for the delivery of employment 
benefits.
<P>
	That flexibility extends to the use of provincial programs to 
assist employment insurance clients. What does this mean? Quite 
simply, it means that the Quebec government could deliver any or 
all of these employment benefits to employment insurance clients. 
It could do so through its own existing programs, with support from 
the federal government, as long as those programs meet the 
objectives set out in part II of this bill and are broadly similar to the 
measures outlined in the legislation.
<P>
	Federal guidelines will be followed in the deveopment and 
implementation of the employment measures: harmonization of 
programs to prevent overlap and duplication, programs that reduce 
dependency on income benefits, and emphasis on personal 
responsibility, co-operation and partnership, flexibility to allow 
local decision-making, and a framework for evaluating results.
<P>
	The key, of course, is results, that is getting Canadians back to 
work quickly.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	We believe that our approach based on partnership with 
provinces will ensure that every dollar spent, is spent in a way that 
is linked to local labour market priorities. We believe it will ensure 
value for the money we spend to help our clients improve their 
employability.
<P>
	In Quebec, as elsewhere, we are determined to translate these 
commitments and objectives into results. This government is doing 
so by negotiating a series of labour market agreements with 
provincial governments. These arrangements could vary from 
province to province to meet local circumstances and needs.
<P>
	We are putting turf wars behind us-and concentrating on 
getting Canadians back to work. And, let us be very clear about 
this, the federal government has responsibilities. It cannot ignore 
them.
<P>
	It has a responsibility to the millions of workers and employers 
accross Canada who fund the employment insurance program and 
who share the risks of unemployment in a way that works for 
Quebecers' advantage.
<P>
	It has a responsibility to manage this program in the best 
interests of the Canadian economy and a labour market with 
national elements and needs. It has a responsibility to this House to 
be able to track and provide it the information it needs on activities 
under this act.
<P>
	It has a responsibility to ensure that every dollar that is 
earmarked for the employment benefits of employment insurance 
clients is used for precisely that purpose and used effectively.
<P>
	In general, the conditions that I have mentioned are simply ones 
that recognize that EI contributors from across this country are 
entitled to expect results and to get their money's worth.
<P>
	New agreements would ensure more effective help for the 
unemployed, reduce overlap and duplication and promote 
coherence and harmonization in federal and provincial programs.
<P>
	Let me quote Mr. Ghislain Dufour on this issue: ``In this regard, 
our federation of employers welcomes the reform proposals to 
harmonize federal and provincial programs and to allow provinces 
to make administrative arrangements with the federal government 
in order to administer these programs fully''.
<P>
	Mr. Dufour recognizes this is a good opportunity for both levels 
of government. Part II respects the legitimate constitutional 
jurisdictions of each government, and is fair and reasonable.
<P>
	The door is open to an agreement that can move both 
governments closer to our shared goal of better employment 
opportunities for people in Quebec. Bill C-12 will put that process 
fully in motion. I urge the members of the official opposition to 
support this opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my colleague's speech with interest and 
surprise, especially since, this morning, the daily <I>Le Devoir</I> 
published the results of a poll on Quebecers' opinion of the 
unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
	Let us look at a few results. The first is that 75 per cent of 
Quebecers support moving the unemployment insurance program 
to Quebec. Those opposing the reform account for 59.8 per cent; 
those in favour, 27.5 per cent. Some 79 per cent of Quebecers 
believe the reform will benefit the government first. The reduction 
in benefits to the unemployed is opposed by 72.3 per cent of 
people, and the reduction in the benefits entitlement period is 
opposed by 66 per cent.

	How can the member ask the opposition to support the 
government's motion, when it is very obvious that it goes totally 
against the grain of all the people of Quebec? There is a clear 
majority. Furthermore, 73 per cent of people have heard about the 
reform.
<P>
	We cannot assume today that this is the opinion of professional 
agitators. We cannot assume either that we are talking about 
experts in negotiations or union people. This is the public opinion 
of Quebecers in general, who are concerned about this issue, who 
have analyzed the reform, who have looked into the possible 
effects of the reform, who have seen that the reform will penalize 
seasonal workers and who are totally opposed to it.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Had the same poll been taken in the maritime provinces, I think 
that the Liberal members who are all set to vote for this bill would 
see the major impact it will have on the results of the next election. 
All the members from the maritimes who got elected on a platform 
of ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' and who, today, will vote in favour of this bill 
will come up against the same kind of disapproval on the part of 
their voters as the one clearly identified in the poll taken in Quebec.
<P>
	That being so, I would like the hon. member to tell us why we 
should implement a reform that will only have adverse 
consequences, resulting in drastic changes to regional economies, 
when no buffers have been put in place. There are no measures 
designed to boost the economy and to diversify regional 
economies. It is a bit like this guy who drove an old car that burned 
much more oil than it should have and decided to stop adding oil in 
the motor instead of having the motor fixed. This is exactly what 
will happen to regional economies with this bill.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell us what good he feels will 
come from this reform that all Quebecers have rejected?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. He may surprised to learn that I am among the 75 per cent 
of Quebecers asking that responsibility over manpower training be 
handed over to Quebec. I am proud to be one of them and proud as 
well of this employment bill. That is why I urge opposition 
members to vote for this bill.
<P>
	Regarding manpower training, that is exactly what the federal 
government intends to do within the next three years, as indicated 
in part II of Bill C-12. If the Quebec government wants these 
powers to be repatriated even faster, I submit that it should enter 
into negotiations with the Government of Canada, and I am sure 
that we will agree to negotiate and that these negotiations will 
certainly be carried out in good faith.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-12, 
an act respecting employment insurance in Canada, be read the 
third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to speak on third reading of this important legislation. I 
begin by congratulating both the current and former ministers of 
human resources development and their parliamentary secretaries 
for bringing this legislation forth and for steering it through the 
House.
<P>
	I congratulate the officials in the Department of Human 
Resources Development for preparing such detailed impact 
analysis and explanations of these measures. I also commend the 
members of the parliamentary committee which reviewed the 
legislation as well as those who participated in the social security 
review the committee carried out in 1994 for their sustained hard 
work in developing these reforms.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As far as opposition members are concerned, I would like to 
acknowledge the contribution of Bloc Quebecois members, 
especially the hon. member for Mercier, the hon. member for Lévis 
and the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. While 
they opposed this bill, they played their role as opposition members 
with diligence and professionalism, thereby contributing to the 
enhancement of the reforms in question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to mention as well the exceptional work of the members 
from Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Etobicoke-Lakeshore, 
Halifax West and Malpeque whose amendments to Bill C-12 
dealing with the fixed divisor, the intensity rule and the problem of 
discontinuous weeks have greatly improved the bill and the new 
employment insurance system.
<P>
	When the former minister of human resources development back 
in January 1994 unveiled the government's intention to proceed 
with a comprehensive review of Canada's social security system no 
one expected it would be easy to achieve these reforms. It would 
have been difficult at any time but all the more difficult when the 
fiscal climate required that fewer, not more, resources were 
available to put into the revamped social programs.
<P>
	This made the choices more difficult but the need to get the 
programs right and the need for reform all the more imperative, 
especially in view of the dramatically  changed situation that has 
taken place in Canada since many of these reforms of the program 
were put in place.
<P>
	Central to the reform agenda was the need to modernize and 
renew the unemployment insurance system. Since it was 
introduced in 1940 as a system of short term protection against job 
loss, UI has evolved to become the central pillar of Canada's social 
security system and for many people in seasonal industries in 
Canada a regular component of their family income.
<P>
	Unfortunately there has also been growing evidence that UI has 
become an obstacle to job creation. Not only has the level of 
premiums needed to finance UI benefits been a drag on small 
businesses' ability to create jobs, but the level of benefits have 
created distortions in the economies of communities most in need 
of job growth.
<P>
	Observers have argued that UI has hindered mobility, 
encouraged excessive patterns of short term jobs followed by UI at 
the expense of more stable employment relationships and has 
discouraged young people from acquiring the skills they need to 
function effectively in the changing economy.
<P>
	Yet while there has been much evidence provided to demonstrate 
the UI program has inhibited job creation and has pointed to the 
direction for reform, it is much harder to prove in advance that 
altering the program will lead to the jobs the people dependent on 
UI want. This has always been the dilemma facing UI reform. 
Faced with this dilemma, the government's approach to reform has 
been sound. The changes in Bill C-12 are designed first and 
foremost to foster a more supportive climate for job creation.
<P>
	The new employment insurance system recognizes there are 
great variations in the ability of regions in Canada to create jobs. 
Hence it does not try to impose a uniformed system on all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Instead of generating savings by restricting access to the 
program, as the government might have done, the EI system 
broadens access to the program. Not only will more people be 
covered under EI than under UI, they will have access to a range of 
income and employment support available even beyond the 
duration of their benefits. This is because of first hour coverage and 
that hours replace weeks as the basis for determining eligibility for 
EI benefits.
<P>
	With an hourly based system, many part time workers who were 
unable to qualify under the old system will be able to earn the right 
to draw EI benefits. As well, it will be easier for seasonal workers 
who often work long hours during a short period of time to qualify 
for EI benefits.
<P>
	It will not be possible to get the same level of benefits with the 
minimum amount of work to qualify under EI as it has been under 
UI. Maximum benefit levels will be lower under the new system. 
However, the new system  protects those on lower incomes who are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2775"> 2775 </A></B>
<P>
unemployed through a number of measures, including the family 
income supplement which will guarantee that individuals who are 
unemployed can received up to 80 per cent of their earnings 
replaced through the new system.
<P>
	As well, the amendments to the initial employment insurance 
legislation in committee have improved the fairness in this system. 
For example, the amendments dealing with the fixed divisor and 
the problem of discontinuous weeks now changes the method of 
calculating the level of benefits in order to minimize the adverse 
effects of the problem of discontinuous work in terms of the level 
of benefits.
<P>
	The amendments proposed to deal with the decline in benefits 
under the intensity rule also minimized the impact of that aspect of 
the program to those on higher incomes by protecting those who 
fall under the family income threshold stipulated by the program.
<P>
	The monitoring function, which is an essential feature of the 
implementation of this legislation, will ensure the government 
follows very carefully the progress of implementation of this 
reform and also that we monitor carefully how the impact of these 
changes will affect those Canadians, particularly those in high 
unemployment areas. The central purpose of the legislation is to 
foster a job creation climate, which is what we want to see as a 
result of the implementation of these reforms.
<P>
	Many Canadians, including those most closely associated with 
this debate, are tired of reform. They want stability in these 
programs. They want this talk of reform to stop. They want to get 
on with their lives. They want to think of something else. They 
hope that as this bill heads to the Senate we are nearing the 
beginning of the end.
<P>
	I share their fatigue but I do not believe we can stop yet. We still 
have a lot more work to do when it comes to reshaping Canada's 
social security system for the 21st century. We are not at the 
beginning of the end, to quote Churchill, we are more like at the 
end of the beginning.
<P>
	The employment insurance system which Bill C-12 describes is 
an important start toward creating a new system for the 21st 
century. It has some very important features to it which represent a 
significant improvement over the existing program, but I still 
prefer to see it as an important start and not as the final word on this 
program.
<P>
	This may seem premature since Bill C-12 is not even passed yet. 
However, in the time that remains I want to speak about the future 
and what is next on this agenda.
<P>
	No one doubts we are living in an era of profound social and 
economic change and uncertainty. Peter Drucker calls it the age of 
social transformation. The consequences of the information 
revolution have penetrated every facet of our lives and in a few 
short  years have dramatically altered the pace and depth of change. 
Nowhere is the upheaval more pronounced than in the world of 
work.
<P>
	Whether one is a qualified pessimist such as Jeremy Riffkin, 
who predicts massive unemployment and growing income 
inequality because of the displacement of workers due to this 
profound change, or whether one is a qualified optimist such as 
William Bridges, who sees opportunities for growth, creativity and 
freedom in the new post-job economy, one thing seems clear about 
the future. The requirements for success in the world of work as we 
approach the 21st century are different than they have been for the 
preceding one.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	Individuals have to be flexible, willing to make lifelong learning 
a fact of life, willing to accept a greater degree of instability and 
uncertainty in terms of their jobs and be much more innovative and 
entrepreneurial. These are the characteristics that make the 
difference.
<P>
	The employment insurance system must do more than simply 
provide income protection against job loss. It must be a support to 
individual Canadians.
<P>
	Under the unemployment insurance system which was 
developed in the 1940s the reality of the world of work was much 
different. Unemployment insurance was meant to provide basic 
short term support to individuals waiting for their temporary 
unemployment to change, knowing their skills were essentially the 
ones they would need for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	The new world of work is much more complicated. The new 
employment insurance system has to be designed to respond to the 
growing changes taking place in Canada if it is to work with other 
policies of the government to create a strong economy and to 
support individuals in that economy.
<P>
	Employment insurance represents an important advance in the 
thinking of the support of the unemployed. Increasingly, 
individuals need support to keep them moving through a series of 
changing job situations. New skills, attitudes and flexibility need to 
be acquired. These are the realities of the world in which we live, 
realities we as a government must find a system which will enable 
individuals to produce.
<P>
	UI and now EI is a national program. It should remain a national 
program. Reforming this pillar of Canada's social security system 
should not be seen, as it has too often been, purely in defensive 
terms, but as a fundamental positive exercise in nation building.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, 
but his time has expired.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2776"> 2776 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso for his good words for  committee members. I 
think that we did do some very serious work while conducting 
hearings across Canada.
<P>
	My first question for the hon. member is this: Are the results we 
see today in this bill in line with what we heard at those hearings?
<P>
	Does having an intensity rule that will reduce seasonal workers' 
benefits among the wishes expressed during those consultations? 
Did any of the people who testified say anything to that effect? Did 
the committee on seasonal workers, which was set up by the 
minister, not tell us that seasonal workers were in no way 
responsible for the negative impact on their jobs, that it was not 
their decision to be unemployed, that there were simply no jobs 
available? I would like the hon. member to answer these questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
even though the bill does not necessarily reflect all the 
recommendations heard by the parliamentary committee while 
conducting hearings across Canada, I can say that the restructuring 
of this program was a basic desire expressed by the witnesses we 
heard.
<P>
	Moreover, one of the things we heard-and this is a very 
important contribution the committee made to this debate-is that, 
in any UI reform, people would prefer that the government broaden 
coverage and ensure that more people have access to the program, 
rather than restrict access and increase benefits.
<P>
	I must conclude, but there are many other lessons that we could 
have taught the committee and to which I could refer to in 
describing this bill, but I think the hon. member has a good idea of 
what I mean.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be sharing my time 
today with the member for-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me. I am sorry, I thought the 
member was getting up on questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Debate only. The two deputies could have 
had more time in that case.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this minor procedural imbroglio allows me to put another 
question to the hon. member. We are indeed making a major change 
for the 21st century, a change that will affect the whole economy, 
including the labour market.
<P>
	Does the member feel that the changes made take into account 
the new reality of temporary and precarious employment, of how 
people will find work in the future? Unemployment insurance is 
meant to provide an income between jobs.
<P>
	Are there not many measures in the reform that divert from its 
intended use the money in the UI fund? When workers and 
employers pay unemployment insurance premiums, is it not 
primarily to allow those who are between jobs to have an income to 
maintain their lifestyle, to make it through a period of 
unemployment? Under the reform, a lot of the money will be 
allocated to programs that maintain duplication with existing 
provincial initiatives, including in the manpower training sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will be brief. This is essentially the point I wanted to make. Given 
the new reality, and we do not know it completely yet, in the 
unemployment sector, an income support program for the 
unemployed must do more. Such a program must of course provide 
an income, but it must also help people move from one job to 
another and constantly renew their skills, working capacity and 
employability, so as to best meet future labour market 
requirements.
<P>
	Otherwise, our program will always be misdirected and it will be 
increasingly at odds with the needs of Canadians. This is why we 
have launched the process. We are starting with this reform. We 
will continue to have to change it, to improve it, but we are starting 
with a system that will be more flexible and that will better meet 
the needs of the 21st century. This is why that reform is so 
important.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Peace River has 
indicated that he wishes to share his time with a member of another 
political party. Is there unanimous consent so he may do that?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to share my time with the member for Saskatoon-Clark's 
Crossing, to give as many people as possible the opportunity to 
participate in this important debate.
<P>
	This debate is on the reform of the unemployment insurance 
program, a reform that has been anticipated for some time by 
Canadians. What Canadians want from an employment insurance 
program is some certainty that the program will provide help for 
those people who are unemployed through a time of crisis in their 
lives for a short period of time until an adjustment can be made to 
find a new job and make those adjustments.
<P>
	Unfortunately, that is not what we have in this program. We do 
not have equality. We have different terms for different parts of the 
country. There are something like 62 different regions that all have 
different criteria. Some people are upset about that. They are upset 
that the same terms and conditions do not extend from one side of 
the country to the other. They are also concerned about the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2777"> 2777 </A></B>
<P>
dependency. I will talk about that in  a moment. I believe they are 
concerned about trying to reform the unemployment insurance plan 
into a plan that conforms more to a true insurance plan in the 
future.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I want to speak about the regional inequities in this bill. 
Everyone wants fairness. I believe it was the member from Kenora 
who responded earlier when a Bloc member suggested that the 
people of Quebec were not being treated fairly in this legislation. It 
was astounding to hear the member from Kenora say: ``We are 
being fair. We are giving $1.33 back for every $1 contributed by 
people in Quebec''. That says a lot right there.
<P>
	A dollar for a dollar. It seems that all parts of the country should 
be treated equally and the same standards should apply to all.
<P>
	One part of the country is doing quite well, a lot of new jobs are 
being created. In the last six years 87 per cent of all new jobs 
created in Canada were created in Alberta and B.C. At the same 
time, through this bill we are trying to encourage people to stay at 
home in parts of the country where there is a net job loss and a low 
possibility of any jobs in the future. That flies directly in the face of 
common sense.
<P>
	My grandparents and my mother lived about 40 miles south of 
here around 1912. They moved to Alberta, to new opportunity, to 
new farmland that was available. People have been mobile in this 
country for many years. It seems that is part of our Canadian 
society. We move to where the new jobs are. People generally do 
not want to collect unemployment insurance. They want 
opportunities.
<P>
	In the Canada Employment Centre in my riding there was a time 
when we experienced about 4 per cent unemployment. As my 
colleague from Medicine Hat explained, this means no 
unemployment. It is only indicated because of the way we built this 
institutional reform into our unemployment insurance in 1971 
when the Government of Canada became involved.
<P>
	Last year, at a time when there was essentially no unemployment 
in my riding of Peace River, I met with a number of contractors. 
They said that they were having trouble getting trades people, yet 
the unemployment centre will not advertise Canada wide. We had a 
lucrative situation.
<P>
	There were plumbers, for example, in Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland who wanted jobs. They did not want to collect 
unemployment insurance, but there were no jobs available in their 
provinces. They were not even made aware of the opportunities in 
other parts of the country. The Canada Employment Centre was 
advertising in Edmonton and Calgary for the Grand Prairie area. 
Both areas were running quite well; there were no unemployed 
people. Therefore, they could not get experienced trades people. It 
was an intolerable situation.
<P>
	Alberta and British Columbia are experiencing strong growth 
with many jobs being created. Out of the 443,000 jobs that have 
been created in Canada in the last six years, 345,000 have been 
created in Alberta and B.C. The largest four provinces in Canada 
have created 101 per cent of Canada's jobs which means that the 
rest of Canada has been losing jobs. We know where those areas 
are. Yet the reforms proposed by the government still encourage 
people to stay at home in those areas of net job loss to collect 
unemployment insurance. It is shameful.
<P>
	The country has been broken into 62 regions. In Nova Scotia 
there are five regions with different unemployment criteria. That is 
simply not acceptable. We need national standards that are agreed 
to by all provinces.
<P>
	I will take a moment to talk about dependency. That is an 
unfortunate part of the unemployment insurance program, 
especially since 1971. That is when the federal government 
intervened. It used a regional fairness scheme to try to engage in 
social engineering.
<P>
	We are sending the wrong signals to Canadians. We are sending 
the signal that dependency is okay. We now have up to second and 
third generation families that have just graduated into this cycle of 
collecting unemployment insurance. Yet at the same time, parts of 
the country are crying out for workers.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	What incentives are being offered which create this dependency? 
Twelve weeks to qualify in much of Atlantic Canada and in 
Quebec. It is 18 weeks in the rest of the country. Is that fair? Should 
a worker who is unemployed in my riding be treated differently 
from somebody who is unemployed in Newfoundland or Quebec? 
They should not. This creates that same dependency. People will 
stay at home and collect unemployment insurance.
<P>
	This is not a true insurance plan. We need a plan which is 
administered by employees and employers. They would soon sort 
out the people who are ripping off the system. Their premiums are 
being used to finance people who are abusing the system.
<P>
	Abuse is a very common factor in unemployment insurance. 
Payroll taxes reflect this. Employers and employees have had to 
pay higher amounts in the past several years which has resulted in a 
slush fund that the government will be using to buffer the deficit. 
Employees and employers are being asked to help pay down the 
deficit. That is unfair.
<P>
	Payroll taxes in Canada are very high. Up until about 1971 you 
could take the unemployment figures from the United States and 
Canada, plot them on a graph over many decades and see that they 
were almost identical. In the bad times and in the good times the 
chart would show that unemployment figures in the United States 
and Canada were almost identical.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2778"> 2778 </A></B>
<P>
	What happened in 1971 when the federal government intervened 
and became involved in the unemployment insurance fund? There 
has been a consistent spread of about 4 points in the last 25 years 
between Canada and the United States. Unemployment in Canada 
is always higher. That is the result of the institutional 
unemployment which has become part of the system because of 
these generous benefits.
<P>
	We need national standards. We need a plan which is run by 
employees and employers. It could be done on a provincial basis 
which would enable it to be responsive to local needs.
<P>
	The other part of the bill which really bothers me is that over two 
million part time workers will have to pay unemployment 
insurance premiums. These people have a tough time making ends 
meet to begin with. Often they are working at minimum wage. Now 
we are asking them to pay an unemployment insurance levy as 
well. I believe that will have the opposite effect. It will put many 
people in the position where they will say: ``Why should I work? I 
may as well sit home and collect unemployment insurance''.
<P>
	We are moving in the wrong direction. What the people of 
Canada want is real reform of the unemployment insurance system, 
not something which is regionally based, not something which is 
unfair. They want all Canadians to be treated equally. They want to 
stop the abuse of the unemployment insurance system. They want 
to be generous enough to say to those people who are unemployed: 
``Yes, we are going to look after you through that time of your life 
when you are unfortunate enough to be unemployed''.
<P>
	Canadians are generous. That is why we pay our unemployment 
insurance premiums. We do not pay our unemployment insurance 
premiums so that individuals can live off the system from one year 
to the next. It becomes an abuse program which does not do much 
for our self-worth. I believe that most people need to work and to 
feel they are contributing to society.
<P>
	We are not stopping the cycle of dependency which was started 
over 25 years ago. We are sending the wrong message to 
Canadians. I am opposed to Bill C-12. I will be voting against it. If 
we ever have the opportunity, we will make this a true insurance 
program. I look forward to that opportunity.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I found my colleague's speech most interesting. Although 
I am not in agreement with a number of his points, he has raised a 
fundamental question.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	We are told that people must stay home and wait for work. 
Should they not be mobile across Canada? To that,  I reply that 
people are not just economic beasts of burden. They are not just 
consumers, they are human beings with families who have lived in 
a region for several years, often several generations. They have the 
right, in my view, because that was how Canada was developed in 
the past, to economic development tools allowing them to develop 
their region. There is no region in Canada where employment 
cannot be developed, no region that cannot be helped to turn itself 
around, develop and take pride in its development.
<P>
	The approach suggested by Reform members is essentially to go 
back to the situation that existed before 1935. In this connection, I 
would like to quote Prime Minister Bennett, who said at that time: 
``During the years of anguish you have just experienced-he is 
speaking about the Great Depression-you have seen the great 
weaknesses and abuses of the capitalist system. They have led to 
unemployment and misery. In order to meet the new needs, we 
must reshape the capitalist system so that it serves the people 
better, and distribute the benefits more equitably among the various 
classes and regions of the country''.
<P>
	When governments decided to distribute the benefits, was it not 
more with the idea of allowing a program that had shown its worth 
to be a good economic regulator and to ensure that individuals 
could develop in their own regions?
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that it is true that Quebec has long 
received more unemployment insurance than it paid in premiums, 
but that was linked to unemployment. Last year, in 1995-96, it was 
not one and a third dollars for a dollar, but a dollar for a dollar that 
was spent.
<P>
	In the end, will the position that the hon. member is defending, 
which is to take away from the unemployment insurance system 
any role as regulator, not have a negative effect greater than the 
possible benefits to Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome that comment. This 
gentleman has identified an issue I want to explain.
<P>
	I believe that when people are unemployed temporarily or on 
welfare, it is incumbent upon the people of Canada to look after 
them during a temporary time in their life and to make those 
adjustments. What bothers me is when it becomes a way of life. I 
do not think anybody wants that because it is not very good for the 
people involved.
<P>
	I want to address the regional issue. If an area is not doing very 
well, we have to look at the reason. It is the job of the government 
to create an environment for business in order for people to invest 
in the economy and get it going. That has not taken place. For 
example, if we were to ask small businesses why they are not 
expanding they would tell us that the high cost of doing business  
and the high payroll taxes are deterrents. The fact that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2779"> 2779 </A></B>
<P>
government is spending $10 billion more just on interest this year 
than it did when I was elected in 1993 tells us something.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada is a perfect example of why we have to move 
forward. Prior to Confederation, Atlantic Canada had its main 
business contacts in the New England states. It was a good 
relationship, one which was north-south, a natural trading corridor. 
After Confederation that was changed. More east-west flow was 
encouraged. High tariffs encouraged more east-west flow of goods 
and trading. That was detrimental to Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Under free trade we now have the opportunity to say to Atlantic 
Canadians that we will open some doors for them in the future so 
that they can become real partners in Canada. It is incumbent upon 
the Government of Canada to remove impediments to trade and 
allow areas like Atlantic Canada to fulfil their true potential. I 
believe they have lots of potential.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before going on with the debate, it is my 
duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Mackenzie-railways; the hon. 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead-disability tax 
credit; the hon. member for Davenport-health.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking the member for Peace River 
for sharing his time with me, particularly as we do not agree very 
much with regard to this question. I will make three points with 
regard to the changes to the unemployment insurance regulations.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	First, in quite an outrageous way the government is taking 
according to its numbers $1.1 billion out of the fund. It is taking 
that money from employers and employees. By other calculations 
there will be as much as $4 billion taken out of the fund. It is not 
the government's money; that money belongs to employees and 
employers. They are the ones who contributed. The government 
has no moral right to take that money from the fund.
<P>
	Second, I would like to comment on the continued attack by the 
federal government on the unemployed. One bank president this 
past week indicated that the country's real rate of unemployment is 
13 per cent. Changes to the UI bill continue the attack on the 
unemployed rather than the attack on unemployment.
<P>
	Had members on the government side been on the opposition 
benches when the bill was put forward, as they were prior to 1993, 
not only would they have  spoken against it, they would have voted 
against it. They would have been outraged at the contents of this 
legislation.
<P>
	Third, there are procedures in the bill, so-called active programs, 
which are designed to provide unemployed Canadians with the 
needed skills and opportunities to return to the workplace. The way 
these programs are designed is almost perverse. Quite clearly no 
attention was paid to the successful active programs which are 
component parts of the UI programs in Europe, particularly in 
northern Europe. If attention had been paid to those programs, 
these active measures would have been designed entirely 
differently. It is almost as if the intent is to make sure these active 
programs do not work.
<P>
	Earlier today I heard some talk about the consultations which 
took place. It is really a sham to talk in terms of consultations. It is 
all very well to have large meetings and for them to go on and on. 
But if the government does not listen to what anybody says and in 
particular does not listen to what the critics say, those are not true 
consultations. That is what happened.
<P>
	There is absolutely no doubt that the proposals put forward by 
the government were originally proposed by the previous 
Conservative government. They follow on step for step with those 
policies. We know that in 1993 the government changed but the 
bureaucrats and the policies did not change. There is a continuation 
of the Conservative agenda.
<P>
	These revisions mark the ninth time since 1975, the fourth time 
in the 1990s, and the second time since 1993 that unemployment 
insurance has been systematically attacked.
<P>
	By the end of 1997-98 there will be a surplus of $9.4 billion in 
the UI account. This is money which properly belongs to the 13 
million workers who contributed to it, not to the government which 
is taking it away to pay for its own fiscal mismanagement.
<P>
	In 1971, 96 per cent of those who were unemployed were 
covered by the unemployment insurance program. In 1990 it was 
87 per cent. By 1995 under these rules it was only 52 per cent. By 
January of this year it was 46 per cent. At the present time only 42 
per cent of unemployed Canadians are covered by the 
unemployment insurance provisions. By the time this process all 
works through, less than 40 per cent of the unemployed will be 
covered. We will be down to levels lower than some of the United 
States. This is a continuation of the attack on the unemployed, not 
on unemployment.
<P>
	These changes will have devastating effects particularly in 
Atlantic Canada, the north and high unemployment regions. It will 
have devastating effects on low income families. It will push more 
and more of those individuals and families below the poverty line.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2780"> 2780 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me quote the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development when he talked about UI cuts by the previous 
Conservative government which were far less severe than these: 
``I totally disagree with these amendments. The kind of legislation 
being brought in by this Minister of Employment and Immigration 
makes Margaret Thatcher look like Mother Teresa by comparison. 
All it does is simply put the squeeze on the people least able to 
protect themselves''. Those words speak for themselves. It is no 
wonder that Canadians have trouble recognizing any integrity in 
government at this time.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	The government says that unemployment insurance is a problem 
for the following reasons. It says that it creates disincentives to 
work and therefore constitutes a cause of rising unemployment. It 
argues that unemployment insurance actually discourages the 
search for work. It argues that the program fosters a dependency in 
some regions and industries. It argues that the payroll tax that 
finances UI has its own ``perverse effect on job creation which has 
contributed to Canada's rising core rate of unemployment''.
<P>
	The very studies the government ordered from experts in the 
field to address unemployment insurance refuted every single one 
of the criticisms the government had against unemployment 
insurance. The studies presented by the government to support its 
own claim made it clear that the great majority of unemployment is 
involuntary and the result of a shortage of jobs and hours of work 
relative to the demand of work. In other words, people do not 
choose to be unemployed. Those who are unemployed should be 
offended by a government which suggests that they might.
<P>
	Quite plainly, the focus of the studies is that it is the lack of jobs 
rather than the lack of incentives to take paid work which 
constitutes Canada's high rate of unemployment. The studies also 
point out that premiums are an appropriate way of funding 
unemployment insurance. All the evidence suggests that the total 
costs are borne by workers, not by employers and that it is not a 
significant deterrent to work, as the Minister of Finance likes to say 
it is.
<P>
	The reasons for attacking unemployment insurance are refuted 
by those who conducted the studies on behalf of the government to 
presumably provide evidence for the need for the attack. It is a 
continuation of the Mulroney agenda, the Mulroney cuts. I have 
been here since 1989. This is the fifth time I have seen the same 
agenda set out.
<P>
	The main problem we are facing here and why this government 
likes to attack, as its predecessors did, the unemployed rather than 
unemployment is that there is no clear vision, no clear industrial 
strategy, no clear economic strategy, no vision of where this 
country could and should go. We all know the famous words of 
Yogi Berra, if we don't know where we are going, we might  end up 
somewhere else. What is happening is Canadians are ending up 
somewhere else without the job security they need.
<P>
	In closing, there are two clear failings with regard to the 
so-called active programs the government has put forward. One of 
the things it likes to do and one of the things it should do is provide 
information on available jobs across the country. It should also 
provide for employers an indication of what skills unemployed 
Canadians have so that there can be a more appropriate match of 
skills and jobs.
<P>
	The government should have looked at the system in Sweden. In 
Sweden all employers are required to register every job which will 
last for longer than 10 days with the appropriate government 
department. Employees are also required to register with that 
department. Ninety per cent of job vacancies in Sweden are 
covered by the program. If one wants a job that is where one goes.
<P>
	To not have any requirement on the part of employers means that 
any attempt to bring employers and employees together will surely 
fail. Why would we have a system like that? Why would the 
government not have learned from a very successful system?
<P>
	Germany is another example. Potential workers at risk of 
unemployment are identified ahead of time so that some 
preventative measures can be taken. Why do we not have that kind 
of system in Canada?
<P>
	In closing, we can have all the active programs we like, but if we 
do not have a strategy and a vision for full employment, Canadians 
will continue to be unemployed in unacceptably high numbers.

this is a question many Canadians are asking.

It continues to get worse.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the same vein, I 
see that the Reform member has shared his time with an NDP 
member coming from the same region.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member whether this points to a new 
association between the Reform and the NDP around social 
programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
doubt it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the hon. member's presentation. The member from the Reform 
Party, the hon. member from Saskatoon and I are all from western 
Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party spoke about equity and fairness and pointed 
out, rightly, job growth in western Canada. I would like to ask the 
member from the NDP whether he agreed that weeks worked to be 
eligible for unemployment insurance in Manitoba ought to be the 
same as other areas in western Canada, for example, in Alberta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the real point is not the specific rules and regulations with regard to 
the details of employment insurance. The real point is how do we 
ensure that Canadians who are unemployed find work. We cannot 
do that with a program such as we have here because it is not part of 
an integrated program which puts jobs at the top of Canada's 
priorities.
<P>
	Only if we commit ourselves fully to a fuller employment 
economy will we be able to do that. Then we do not have to ask the 
question training for what. We do not have to ask what premiums 
might be charged around the country because we can find ourselves 
moving toward a real economy with job growth in it.
<P>
	Saskatchewan, with the lowest unemployment of any province, 
has a partnership approach to government, business communities, 
everybody working together for the aim of creating jobs in the 
economy. That is what this government should do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the chance to speak to Bill C-12 and to comment on how the 
changes being put forward will improve the climate for doing 
business in Canada.
<P>
	The simplified new approach to the calculation of premiums and 
the streamlining of the reporting process this legislation puts 
forward will substantially reduce the administrative costs and 
paper burden associated with the old UI program.
<P>
	This is especially important to small business. We have heard 
often from the business community, especially from the small 
business community, about the high cost  of administering the old 
system of UI, the so-called UI paper burden.
<P>
	It is fair to say there has been a good deal of paperwork 
associated with administering that antiquated plan. Under the 
current UI scheme employers have to keep track of employee 
earnings by week. They need to make sure, for example, the weekly 
earnings, dollars earned, are above the weekly minimum set by UI 
legislation.
<P>
	If the earnings are too low, the employer must also check to see 
whether the hours, the time worked, exceed the weekly minimum. 
The employer must also check to see if employee earnings are 
more than the weekly maximum.
<P>
	Once all these tests are applied, the employer then must calculate 
the premium payment for each employee and the corresponding 
employer's premium payment. Does it sound confusing? 
Obviously.
<P>
	In some cases this complicated system has to be repeated 
through each and every week for each and every worker. Imagine 
the administrative complexities here, even for a small business, to 
keep people on staff to do these very tedious jobs.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The new system will do away with this complicated process. 
Premium payments will be calculated beginning with the first 
dollar earned and there will be no minimum hours or dollars to 
qualify. It will be easier for the employee to understand as well.
<P>
	As it is now, it is difficult for an employee to know if the 
employer has made accurate premium calculations unless the 
employee goes through the same complicated record keeping 
exercise and keeps a cumulative personal record of UI premium 
payments.
<P>
	A system based on first dollar premium payments for those 
making less than $2,000 to have their premiums refunded will be 
simplified, straightforward and easy to keep track of. At the same 
time as we are simplifying the process we are extending it so more 
workers will be covered, and that means more businesses, 
especially small business, will now be included in the plan.
<P>
	Concerns have been raised about the potential impact of these 
changes on the payroll costs of small business, particularly in the 
service sector where many part time workers who had previously 
been excluded from UI would now be eligible under the new 
program. Here are some answers to the concerns.
<P>
	Under the new plan about two-thirds of the small businesses 
currently contributing to the UI program would pay less or the 
same as before. If premium rates are reduced, as we hope they will 
be when the first dollar coverage kicks in, that number would go up 
so that about 77 per cent of the small firms would pay less or about  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2782"> 2782 </A></B>
<P>
the same as before. This would still leave 23 per cent that might be 
subjected to an increase.
<P>
	The aim of the legislation is to improve the system, not to raise 
the payroll costs for small business. The bill includes a transitional 
premium refund plan, a plan which will provide small businesses 
that face premium increases of more than $500 in 1997 and 1998 
with a refund. The maximum refund will be $5,000 per year. It is 
estimated this will provide transitional relief to about 300,000 
small businesses whose employees will now be participants in this 
EI program.
<P>
	Thus we believe the bill strikes a reasonable balance between 
opening up the employment insurance system to the tens of 
thousands of part time workers who will now face the 15 hours per 
week constraint to developing the necessary earnings history to 
qualify for benefits and adding incrementally now to the cost for 
some employers.
<P>
	We also believe the streamlining and reform of the old UI system 
and the many cost savings and reductions and the paper burden that 
will result will be very welcome in the business community.
<P>
	These reforms will also produce significant administrative 
efficiencies in cost savings for the Government of Canada. As 
many as 2,000 employees of the Department of Human Resources 
Development are now involved in handling the administration for 
the existing record of employment forms. If the forms are 
simplified and the reporting process streamlined there will be 
substantial efficiencies to be gained from the simpler, easier to 
administer system in government as well.
<P>
	The second major area of opportunity the bill opens up relates to 
enhancing the employability of workers through the employment 
benefits in part II of the legislation and the act of employment 
benefits in particular. From the perspective of the business 
community this is an important part of the legislation, for it will 
help to better integrate the needs of workers and employers in order 
to create meaningful employment experiences.
<P>
	These measures will reinforce the value of work. The 
employment benefit measures are designed to strengthen the work 
incentive and to help employers and workers alike adjust to 
economic changes and take advantage of new opportunities.
<P>
	For example, benefits in the form of wage subsidies will 
encourage employers to hire people who need experience on the 
job but who cannot make a full contribution to the enterprise 
immediately. This will allow employees to bring new people on 
board and let them grow into the job without being an undue 
economic burden.
<P>
	Targeted earning supplements will be available to top up wages 
of eligible workers as an incentive for them to  take paid 
employment, even low paid employment, instead of insurance 
payments. This will help address the concerns we have heard that 
small business often finds itself competing with UI employees.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	It is important to note on that score alone that a recent survey in 
Atlantic Canada found that 45 per cent of the employers in that 
region voiced their concern that they were competing with the 
Government of Canada insurance system and felt they could offer 
jobs to Atlantic Canadians if there were changes made to the 
underpinnings of the system.
<P>
	The new legislation will allow us to continue to pursue job 
creation partnership programs in co-operation with the provinces, 
local communities and business organizations in order to create 
jobs consistent with local economic development objectives. We 
already have some good examples of highly effective job creation 
projects with partners in the private sector. We know this approach 
is needed and will work.
<P>
	The new employment insurance plan will be good for business. 
So do many of the business people we heard from. The Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business indicated to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development that employers are 
supportive of the overriding purpose of the bill to help encourage 
unemployed Canadians to get meaningful employment. The 
present UI system is more of a disincentive for people to get back 
to work.
<P>
	The Business Council of British Columbia sees Bill C-12 as a 
more positive initiative. The president of the Quebec Chamber of 
Commerce believes a streamlined program will be a more effective 
program. The executive director of the Canadian Council for 
Human Resources in the environmental industry has said the new 
employment insurance strategy working with the national sectorial 
council has the potential to help Canadians find and keep jobs.
<P>
	That is what the government wants to do, help Canadians find 
and keep jobs. The new employment insurance legislation is an 
essential and integral part of that new vision leading into the year 
2000.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Provencher has made much of the fact that businesses and 
employers would, in his opinion, benefit, since two thirds of 
businesses would find themselves paying lower premiums.
<P>
	I would like to ask him two things. First: Is he aware that the bill 
calls for employers whose workers abuse the system, in other 
words where there is fraud, to have to pay twice as much in some 
cases, and even three times in others, in the way of penalties? As a 
corollary to that: Is he aware that even the volunteer administrator 
of a not  for profit organization could be considered guilty of fraud, 
should an employee cause some problem, some irregularity with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2783"> 2783 </A></B>
<P>
the government? Is he aware of the new and much stricter 
mechanisms for employer penalties in this connection?
<P>
	Now, to the second aspect of my question. He has spoken of 
simplified procedures. I would just correct one thing. He has 
referred to how wonderful it is that students will be able to get a 
refund of up to $2000, whereas at this time they do not even have to 
contribute. I do not see where the improvement lies, when they will 
have to wait nine months to get any money back.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his rather 
lengthy question.
<P>
	With respect to fraudulent claims, discussions with my 
constituents in Provencher regarding both employer and employee 
contributions allowed me to conclude quite categorically that 
whether it was farm people who hired part time workers to work for 
them in the summertime who might claim unemployment 
insurance following that, or whether it was people in the northern 
part of the riding in the forestry industry, both the employers and 
the employees, indeed all Canadians, are concerned about the 
fraudulent use of taxpayer dollars.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	The other point I would like to make very quickly to the member 
is with respect to job creation. Even in his own province, the 
member might want to look at the self-employed component of this 
job creation package and the fact that many of the women who find 
themselves unemployed in the province of Quebec may find a 
venue through that system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if my hon. colleague from Provencher would 
agree with my colleague from Peace River that there should be 
some kind of incentive to relocate if there are jobs available.
<P>
	I had to relocate to start farming. If I had not relocated, my boys 
would not have been there to farm today. Therefore should we not 
have some kind of incentive to relocate if the possibility is there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the package the government has 
presented there is a measure or measures which would allow for 
transition payments. I believe there was a considerable sum of 
money allocated to that process where workers who are changing 
jobs and getting into new job areas would find some monetary 
benefits in this package.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me begin by stating my support for Bill C-12 as it now 
appears before the House.
<P>
	With this legislation, the government has lived up to its 
commitment to reform the unemployment insurance system and 
bring in a fair and balanced regime that accommodates the needs of 
Canadians in all regions.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, I was pleased to take an active part in the 
amendments to this bill. I wish to compliment not only the 
government and the minister for their approach, but also two of my 
opposition friends for encouraging and pushing us in the direction 
in which the explanations and the discussions have helped to 
improve this process.
<P>
	The minister, in appearing before us, invited us to make 
suggestions for improvements. I am pleased that he has been 
responsive to the amendments that were put forward: the divisor 
used for calculating benefits; the question of gaps in earnings; the 
so-called intensity rule governing reduced benefit rates for past 
claimants. These have all made the bill a far better one. I encourage 
all opposition members to support this final decision.
<P>
	I want to focus on three areas that I think are important at this 
time to bring before my friends in this debate. Bloc members 
charged that higher entrance requirements for EI will make it 
tougher for women who are re-entering the job market and force 
them on to welfare.
<P>
	In setting the record straight, let me say that it is true that women 
are more likely to be new entrants or re-entrants to the labour 
market. However, new entrants and re-entrants will now need 910 
hours of insurable work to quality to benefit. However, if they work 
at least 490 hours in their first year in the labour force they only 
require a minimum of 420 to 700 hours to qualify the following 
year.
<P>
	The government recognizes how difficult it can be for a woman 
to jump back into the job market after taking time out to raise a 
family. That is why it has extended access to EI's employment 
benefits to any Canadian woman who has collected maternity or 
parental benefits over the past five years.
<P>
	Employment benefits will help women boost their earnings, 
contribute to their job stability, forge new trails in new and 
emerging sectors. These benefits will be delivered in the woman's 
own community. They will encourage other women to participate 
and take into account the needs of the local workforce.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	Child care support will be available to women who are taking 
part in these employment benefits. Under EI's hours based system, 
many women with part time jobs or several small jobs will be able 
to qualify for maternity benefits for the first time. Women will still 
need only 700 hours to qualify for special benefits such as 
maternity benefits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2784"> 2784 </A></B>
<P>
	Not only will EI enhance employment opportunities for women, 
but it will actually create work. EI reforms are expected to 
generate between 65,000 and 115,000 new jobs funded by an $800 
million investment fund. On top of that, modernization will create 
150 jobs and a transition job creation fund is expected to provide 
work for 15,000 more Canadians.
<P>
	The Canadian workplace recognizes the importance of women's 
participation and the EI legislation reflects the realities of this 
modern system. One of these new realities is that women are 
working part time. In fact, women currently make up 70 per cent of 
Canada's part time workforce. Under EI they will be covered from 
the first dollar earned for the first time.
<P>
	Women also make up a slight majority of those holding multiple 
jobs. Again, under EI many will be insured for the first time. While 
more women will be insured, many others will have their 
premiums refunded. About 700,000 women who earn $2,000 or 
less a year will receive a refund, including 495,000 who premiums 
today.
<P>
	The government has also implemented special measures to help 
offset the impact of the reform on low income claimants, many of 
whom are women. Benefits for single parent families, most of 
which are headed by women with incomes below $26,000, will 
actually increase by about 13 per cent on average under the new 
system. Benefits to low income families with children will go up 
by 12 per cent on average.
<P>
	The family income supplement will boost the weekly earnings of 
many low income families. It will provide an average of about 
$800 to each family with an income below $26,000.
<P>
	The new rules also mean that low income women will be able to 
increase their weekly income without jeopardizing their EI claim. 
The increased earnings exemption will mean women are able to 
earn up to $50 a week or 25 per cent of their earnings, whichever is 
higher, while on claim. This means that EI not only encourages 
work efforts, but also enhances women's employability.
<P>
	I have a few points on the issue of young Canadians. Some Bloc 
members have charged that higher entrance requirements for EI 
will doom young Canadians to living off welfare and moonlighting 
at night. The truth is that new entrants, many of them youth, will 
now need 910 hours of work to qualify for benefits.
<P>
	The entrance requirements have been raised for a very important 
reason. We want to discourage young people from becoming 
dependent on a handout. We want to encourage more young people 
to stay in school instead of dropping out early to take unstable jobs. 
Too many young Canadians use up their UI benefits without 
upgrading their education or acquiring new skills. They  are stuck 
on a hopeless treadmill, one of short periods of work alternating 
with UI claims.
<P>
	Evidence shows that some young people are drawn into the job 
market before they finish their education due to easy access to UI. 
In fact, the working group on seasonal work and unemployment 
insurance stated: ``Something has to be done to stop young people 
from leaving school to take advantage of the specious, short term 
benefits of UI to the detriment of their future and their career 
prospects''.
<P>
	Increased entrance requirements will ensure that youth will 
develop a stronger attachment to the labour market. It will ensure 
that young people stay in school to get the skills they need for the 
jobs of the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	It is true that high entrance requirements will affect some young 
workers, but they will also allow many youths who work part time 
or who earn a living at several small jobs to insure their work for 
the first time. It is estimated that 39,000 of them who cannot 
qualify for UI today will qualify for EI benefits.
<P>
	These reforms are primarily designed to actively help people 
find and keep stable employment. This includes young people. EI's 
active employment measures will help young people gain the skills 
they need for the changing job market.
<P>
	These are some of the reasons for my colleagues to be convinced 
that this is good legislation. This is legislation that needs to be 
supported. I call on all members, despite the discussion and the 
arguments, to support Bill C-12.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. 
member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore well, having been on the 
human resources development committee with her for the past two 
and half years, ever since the Liberal government was elected.
<P>
	I know how sensitive she generally is, and I know she feels a bit 
uncomfortable when she comes back to the House to tell us what 
we have heard several times in committee from the mouths of staff 
members of the Department of Human Resources Development. I 
would ask, on another level, how she felt as a woman who has 
always shown sensitivity and humanity, after hearing the testimony 
of the Fédération des femmes du Québec and other organizations 
representing women across Canada, who told us that this 
unemployment insurance reform made no sense, because it would 
penalize women.
<P>
	Yes, with the hours principle, some 5 per cent of women will 
perhaps be able to take advantage of unemployment insurance in 
future, but 25 per cent will be excluded. The hon. member knows 
the reason: many who used to need 15 hours of work per week or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2785"> 2785 </A></B>
<P>
less will now need many more hours to be eligible for UI. In my 
region in particular, people will have to work a minimum  of 26 
weeks, at seventeen and a half hours a week. What is more, they 
will all have to contribute, but will not all be able to draw benefits.
<P>
	The situation is so bad that the Fédération des femmes du 
Québec is contemplating going to court to raise the issue of 
discrimination against women, to prevent the act from being 
implemented. The same thing goes for young people.
<P>
	I have trouble recognizing my colleague's usual character when 
she takes such a position, when she finds it normal to be harder on 
young people who have never yet drawn any benefit from 
unemployment insurance. Now she is letting herself be influenced 
by the arguments of the department's employees, who told her 
young people are potential cheats, potential abusers of the system.
<P>
	I am appealing to her sensitivity, I am appealing to her 
sympathetic ear as a member of the human resources development 
committee, where 75 or 80 per cent of the men and women who 
came before us in the last two and a half years told us this was not 
acceptable. I am trying to find out, and I really do wonder, if she 
feels right about her party's line.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have great admiration for the 
member who just spoke and with whom I have worked for the past 
couple of years.
<P>
	The member knows that I took very seriously the arguments he 
brought. I went back and spent a good deal of time with my 
colleague and others in looking at the parts of the bill we 
considered to be difficult. We looked at parts of the bill we 
considered would disadvantage several individuals. We put 
forward amendments to assist and to make the bill a far better bill.
<P>
	The member also knows that it was not without deep 
consideration of all concerns: the hours, the dollars, the situations 
of people in various regions of the country, that I arrived at the 
point where I was satisfied that we were doing what would be in the 
best interests of all Canadians in every region by amending certain 
parts of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is the last time I will rise in this House on this bill. We 
have followed it in committee for nearly two years. We have tried 
to make the government aware of the Canadian reality. Rather than 
get into technical arguments, I would ask the Liberal members to 
consider the upcoming vote and look at the effects on Canadians, 
the people of the maritimes, of Quebec, Ontario and especially 
northern Ontario, and western Canada and even the major centres. I 
will explain.
<P>
	This bill on unemployment insurance reform is a sort of model 
for society the government wants us to choose. It has decided to kill 
off the old model of Canada where some things worked and other 
things did not work so well, but the desire to ensure that each 
region received equitable amounts, at least in terms of 
compensation for economic development, is gone. The government 
decided to do away with this sort of development, and now we have 
this bill before us today.
<P>
	I am going to give a more down to earth example, which seems 
to me to be very close to the truth. As you know, the economy in 
our regions is a bit like a second hand car that uses up a lot of oil. 
Its motor does not work well, because the oil evaporates too 
readily. Usually, you put oil in the engine to keep it running, and, at 
some point, you decide to have it repaired so that it will then work 
properly.
<P>
	For the UI reform, the government decided that even if the 
engine was using up too much oil, the solution was to quit topping 
it up and after that the engine would repair itself. We know very 
well that it does not work like that. Regional economies, the 
economies that depend on seasonal industries, are economies that 
need diversification.
<P>
	That was proven by the human resources development minister's 
committee on seasonal workers, as well as by the demonstrations 
seen by the human resources development committee. It was also 
proven by people in the last consultation on the bill itself, when 
people from the Gaspé Peninsula, as well as other areas, gave us 
examples where there were 50, 75, 100 applicants for one job. So, 
people want to work and see their economy develop, and that raises 
serious questions about an inequitable principle, an unacceptable 
principle in the present system, which is to decide from the outset 
that people are taking advantage of the system.
<P>
	This bill assumes guilt on the part of the people using the 
unemployment insurance system. It considers that they must be 
punished to set them back on the straight and narrow. This 
approach is difficult to understand coming from the present 
government, because when it was elected it told us that it would 
make employment a priority, and came up with the slogan: ``Jobs, 
jobs, jobs''.
<P>
	It therefore proposed a model of society that was completely 
different from that of the former Conservative government. If we 
had the present reform before us and it was the former 
Conservative government that had introduced it and been elected, 
we could say that Quebecers and Canadians had chosen this kind of 
government, that that was what they wanted, and we would act 
accordingly. But no, we have before us a government that was 
elected on a completely different philosophy than that in the bill.
<P>
	Today, it is abdicating completely the responsibility of a party in 
power, which is to do what it was elected to do.  This government, 
particularly the members from the Atlantic provinces, will have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2786"> 2786 </A></B>
<P>
some terrible political fallout to contend with if they vote in favour 
of this bill.
<P>
	Allow me to quickly quote several excerpts from a letter signed 
by the present Prime Minister on March 26, 1993, when the 
Conservatives were taking measures far less harsh than those 
contained in this bill. Among the points made in the letter-and it 
is the present Prime Minister, who was Leader of the Opposition at 
the time, speaking:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I can assure you that the Liberal Party shares your concern about this attack 
against the unemployed. We do not believe either that the recent superficial 
amendments will change the fundamentally unfair nature of these measures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Do you not find that this bears some resemblance to the three 
little amendments we have had tabled before us just now? The 
Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition at the time, goes on to 
say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Instead of getting to the heart of the problem, it goes after the unemployed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	In closing, he says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You can be assured that the Liberals will continue to call on the government 
to withdraw this unfair bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This may be the most serious effect of this bill.
<P>
	It is true that it penalizes the regions and the workers. It is true 
that there are regional economies in danger of destruction. It is true 
that people are made out to be nothing but economic agents.
<P>
	They are telling us mobility is necessary. That the fact that you 
have been in the same community for generations does not give 
you the right to stay there, the right to demand development of the 
economy in your area. No, you have to go where the jobs are. That 
is what the government is saying. The most serious point is that it 
casts doubt on the credibility of elected officials. The fact of being 
elected with a mandate and failing to fulfil it gives politicians today 
a standing of 4 per cent in the polls. And this is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	It is true that there are major negative consequences. This 
applies to regional economies, but also to the major centres. In the 
next few years, the labour force will move out of the regions, 
including those people with skills in the tourist industry, who will 
not be able to accumulate the number of hours they need to be 
eligible for unemployment insurance. The race for hours will be on. 
People in the labour force will move to the major centres, empty 
the regions of valuable resources and put unacceptable pressure on 
the work force in the major centres. The negative effects of this will 
be significant.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance system is the best economic 
regulator during a recession. My greatest fear is that, in the next 
recession, we will be dealing with economic situations similar to 
those of the 1929  depression, where people were literally dying of 
hunger because there were no social programs.
<P>
	These programs were set up. They realized that the 
unemployment insurance system at least made it possible to avoid 
the long term effects of the recession. A person receiving 
unemployment insurance benefits continued to contribute to the 
economy and remained a consumer. This will no longer be the case. 
These are the major changes.
<P>
	These are the negative effects of this choice of society, the 
choice of the path of neo-liberalism that disregards the need, in a 
country like Canada, for stop gap and economic assessment 
measures making for a better society.
<P>
	When you vote shortly, give some thought to what will happen to 
our regional economies if you know people who live in Shediac, 
Bonaventure, Charlottetown, the Gaspé, in Nouvelle, in Gaspé, in 
any of the regions and areas. What will happen to a labour force 
that for a number of years has been working in seasonal industries, 
which takes workers who will not be able to work the entire year? 
We are going to put them in unacceptable situations where they will 
have to go on welfare.
<P>
	All this in a society where there is an unemployment insurance 
system that will generate systematically this year, next year and in 
other years a surplus of $5 billion. Is this in keeping with the values 
for development we sought for Canada in the past 20, 25 or 30 
years? Are people going to want to continue to live in a country that 
sets all these values aside? I think the answer is very clear to 
Quebecers.
<P>
	The Liberal government will have to bear the responsibility for 
its decision. This is not only an unfulfilled commitment, but a form 
of disregard for democracy. Who are the real decision makers? 
What made them create a system like this one?
<P>
	Why do members who were elected on their promises to work in 
good faith to promote full employment, to use human potential so 
their constituents can be happy in their own environments, 
suddenly all clam up two and a half years later? They are not saying 
a word on these issues and are no longer making any suggestions so 
that these results can be achieved.
<P>
	How come no one told us to set goals in the fight against 
unemployment, as we did in the fight against the deficit? How 
come? These are fundamental questions to ask ourselves as they 
are to be found not only in this bill, but also in other government 
measures.
<P>
	There are two types of decision makers. I think the basic flaw in 
this reform is the link between the UI system and the fight against 
the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	To have unemployment insurance claimants pay premiums is 
one thing. They paid them in the past and  could have been asked to 
keep on paying them. But the government stubbornly insists on 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2787"> 2787 </A></B>
<P>
drawing $5 billion a year on a fund basically intended to support a 
person's income between jobs. UI claimants are being penalized 
and made to feel guilty for using the unemployment insurance 
system to offset those negative aspects, where the government 
failed to take its responsibility.
<P>
	Concerning the $5 billion put to the somewhat artificial use of 
covering the deficit, the preferred approach would have been to 
say: We will take a closer look at government spending on items 
such as embassies or national defence to see if we could not save 
more on those items. We will settle once and for all the whole 
manpower issue and stop wasting $250 million a year in 
duplication with the Quebec government alone.
<P>
	Had they dug deeper in that area, we would not have had to take 
actions such as defending, as we are doing now, a reform that is 
indefensible on the basis of its economic objectives. The $5 billion 
surplus generated by the system is being sunk into in a bureaucratic 
machine and conditions created where the money will not be put to 
productive use. Why not have decided to put this money back in the 
economy to foster job creation instead of reducing employees and 
employers contributions?
<P>
	We are told that, for every penny by which employer 
contributions are being reduced, approximately 12,000 jobs could 
be created across Canada.
<P>
	When will the bureaucratic machine generate such interesting 
things? We have to realize that the government no longer has any 
money to spend in areas that are under provincial jurisdiction. It no 
longer has the money required to be involved in these areas, and it 
can no longer borrow on foreign markets. The only thing left is the 
cash cow that the unemployment insurance system has always 
been. The government is relying on a fund in which it does not put 
one penny. Indeed, all the money in the UI account comes from 
employers and workers.
<P>
	But the government will not let them manage their $5 billion 
surplus. It will not tell them: Employers and employees, you will 
decide what to do with your surplus. Are you going to build a 
reserve for bad times? Are you going to reduce premiums? Are you 
going to invest the surplus in other ventures? Are you going to 
increase benefits for those in more difficult situations? This is your 
money. You do what you want with it. We will simply make sure 
that it is properly spent. But no. The government does not say that.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, the opinion of Quebecers regarding 
these measures should not come as a surprise. According to a poll, 
75 per cent of Quebecers feel that the whole issue of 
unemployment insurance management should become the 
province's sole responsibility. Moreover, 59.8 per cent of 
Quebecers oppose the UI reform, while 27 per cent support it. As 
well, 79 per cent of them think it will primarily benefit the federal  
government, not workers and employers. These people clearly 
understand the point I made earlier.
<P>
	They clearly understand that it is strictly a deficit-related issue. 
The government is holding employers and employees hostage.
<P>
	Quebecers clearly understand, since 72 per cent of them oppose 
a reduction of the benefits paid to the unemployed, while 66 per 
cent oppose a reduction of the benefit period. It is good to see that 
Quebecers have clearly understood the negative impact of this 
system.
<P>
	There are other indications of that, including the fact that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development received 40,000 
postcards from people asking for the withdrawal of the bill and the 
patriation of the manpower sector. The fact that 40,000 people took 
the time to send a postcard is a clear message in itself. It is a 
message to federal Quebec Liberals, but the message would be the 
same in the maritimes if the same poll was conducted there 
tomorrow.
<P>
	I will conclude by quoting a Quebec poet, Gilles Vigneault, who 
wrote a line in a song that perfectly applies to the current Liberal 
government, and particularly to the Prime Minister: ``By 
generating such winds, you prepare quite a storm''.
<P>
	The storm will come from the young people and those you will 
oblige to work 910 hours, 26 weeks of 35 hours of full time work, 
in order to become eligible for unemployment insurance, instead of 
300 hours. It will come as well from seasonal workers whose 
benefits you are cutting, event though they paid for these benefits. 
For each 20-week period of unemployment insurance, they will 
lose 1 per cent of their benefits. We will be the ones who will have 
voted for this bill, on behalf of all those who will have to live with 
it.
<P>
	It will also affect owners of small businesses. In a region such as 
mine, there will $10 million less in the economy. This is therefore 
very significant. I think this bill must be roundly criticized. There 
is still time to defeat it, and I think the same message as was sent to 
the Conservatives over the closure of the post offices should be sent 
to the Liberal government. The Conservatives thought they were 
right and the people were wrong. The government is doing the 
same thing and, if it does not change its mind, the people will judge 
it the same way.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-218, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Young 
Offenders Act (capital punishment), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, when I think of how Canadians must view 
this debate tonight, I am embarrassed to be an MP, a supposed 
representative of the people, a servant of the public. Since the death 
penalty was abolished in 1976 this is the third time it has been 
debated in Parliament.
<P>
	Nothing has been resolved. Throughout the past 20 years the 
number of Canadians who support the reinstatement of capital 
punishment has consistently hovered around 70 per cent but MPs 
have steadfastly refused to represent their constituents on this 
issue. They have voted on the basis of their personal opinions or 
with the blessings of their political masters.
<P>
	In my own riding 85 per cent of constituents who responded to a 
1994 survey said that they wanted the death penalty reinstated. My 
efforts to carry out the wishes of my constituents and 70 per cent of 
Canadians were blocked by the Liberal dominated subcommittee 
responsible for deciding which private members' bills would 
become votable. The subcommittee decided that Bill C-218 was 
not worthy of three hours of debate and a free vote. This topic gets 
one hour and then it is dropped.
<P>
	Ideally the people should finally get their say on this issue in a 
binding national referendum which would be held at the time of the 
next federal election. That is the position of the Reform Party of 
Canada and that is a policy I fully endorse.
<P>
	However, the Prime Minister and the justice minister have 
already indicated that they have no intention of allowing this issue 
to be decided by average Canadians. My hon. colleague from North 
Vancouver presented a motion in September 1995 to enable 
legislation for a referendum on capital punishment. Again, 
government members refused to make the motion votable.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	A free vote on a private member's bill would have been the next 
best thing, particularly if it were a truly reformed free vote in which 
all MPs could accurately represent the wishes of the majority of 
their constituents rather than voting their own conscience in spite 
of how their constituents may feel.
<P>
	After tonight Canadians will remain frustrated with the 
government over this issue and they will be forced to continue 
watching criminals get away with murder. That is a sad statement 
on the job performance of MPs.
<P>
	This bill is not just about capital punishment. The reinstatement 
of the death penalty is but one of many substantial and necessary 
steps Canadians have been demanding to better deal with 
murderers in our society. This bill was about plugging the leaking 
holes in our justice system.
<P>
	We see murderers who show no remorse for brutally slaying 
their victims. They show no potential for rehabilitation and instead 
languish in jails at the taxpayer's expense. Worse yet, when they 
are released and paroled we are expected to welcome them back 
into our communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2791"> 2791 </A></B>
<P>
	We have had to swallow our disgust as some of these released 
murderers murder again or commit other violent crimes. We see 
16 and 17-year olds with little respect for the law receiving slap 
on the wrist sentences for murder.
<P>
	Two weeks ago in Prince Rupert, B.C., three teenagers received 
jail terms ranging from only seven months to two years for the 
clubbing to death of a fisherman known as the Gentle Giant. I do 
not believe that any Canadian is prepared to let these preventable 
crimes and miscarriages of justice continue.
<P>
	Politicians and academics are fond of quoting optimistic crime 
rates when they argue against capital punishment. That is pointless. 
Canadians know their streets are more dangerous today than they 
were 20 years ago. Statistics do not always tell the entire story.
<P>
	As members of the House are sure to mention, it is true that there 
has been a slight decline in the murder rate since the death penalty 
was abolished in 1976. However, the last execution in Canada took 
place in 1961, 15 years before. The murder rate almost doubled 
during those 15 years. The murder rate is still 50 per cent higher 
than it was when that last sentence of death was carried out.
<P>
	Some members across the floor have argued that the 
sensationalism surrounding a handful of murders is driving the 
demand to improve the justice system. Sensationalism? How can 
the efforts to prevent murder, even just one murder, be called 
sensationalism?
<P>
	We must use these tragedies as a guide to help us make 
fundamental changes which would prevent further anguish. This 
government uses prevention to justify implementing a useless 
bureaucratic gun registration, but refuses to even consider what the 
people are really crying for: punishment that fits the crime.
<P>
	In a further example of hypocrisy the government embraces the 
policies of the Canadian Police Association when it concerns gun 
control, but ignores a strongly worded resolution by that same 
association which calls for the reinstatement of capital punishment. 
There were 107 police officers killed in the line of duty between 
1961 and 1994.
<P>
	Even after years in prison and the efforts of an army of 
psychiatrists and social workers, we cannot rehabilitate a violent 
murderer who has no remorse. In this case the punishment must fit 
the crime. In the case of first degree murder, 70 per cent of 
Canadians believe the punishment should be death. This sentiment 
is not a matter of vengeance but a prevailing need to send criminals 
the message that society is not prepared to condone or excuse 
sadistic premeditated murder.
<P>
	I do not claim that the prospect of death will deter others sick 
enough to consider committing murder, but at least we would not 
have to support a murderer for 15 to 25 years. Lethal injection may 
not provide any deterrence whatsoever but it would certainly 
eliminate repeat offenders.
<P>
	According to the 1994 report of the auditor general it costs 
approximately $48,000 per inmate per year in a federal prison. 
While we are supporting an incarcerated murderer it is possible 
that he will become increasingly dangerous with the onset of 
resentment and bitterness over his years of imprisonment. Even 
convicted murderers have expressed that death could be a more 
humane alternative to a lengthy incarceration.
<P>
	In 1982, one-third of the 300 convicted murderers in Canada said 
that they would prefer the death penalty over life in prison. In 1983 
a convicted murderer in Saskatchewan formally requested the 
death penalty by lethal injection on the basis that his life sentence 
was cruel and unusual punishment. His request was denied by the 
court.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	In this debate we cannot forget the inevitable release of 
murderers. How do members feel about the possibility of Paul 
Bernardo some day being their next door neighbour? Canadians do 
not want criminals who are guilty of torture, rape and first degree 
murder back on the streets to kill again. They have good reason to 
worry.
<P>
	Between 1986 and 1995, 133 convicts released from prison for 
first and second degree murder returned to our communities and 
committed crimes again. These included 87 violent crimes and sex 
offences and 10 murders. Two convicted murderers who had 
escaped murdered again. How does one explain to the families of 
those victims that 12 murderers were given the opportunity to 
strike again? How can anyone possibly defend our justice system to 
the family of just one of those victims?
<P>
	Let us take a look at the so-called rehabilitation of convicted 
murderer Allan James Sweeney. He was convicted of murder in 
1978. Following his 1984 release on day parole, the taxpayers who 
paid for his expensive jail stay were horrified that his freedom 
resulted in the rape and stabbing death of a 21-year old Ottawa 
halfway house employee.
<P>
	What about the impressive rehabilitation of Jean-Guy Chantal? 
He was paroled in 1984 after serving 17 years of a life sentence for 
a 1967 murder. Three years after his release he beat a Montreal 
janitor to death with a pool cue and a paint can. These are just two 
tragedies that could have been prevented if our justice system had 
served our best interests.
<P>
	In the event that a convict guilty of first degree murder were 
successful in appealing a death sentence, this bill would have at 
least ensured that they stayed in jail. That would have meant no 
possibility of day passes.
<P>
	That is no consolation for the families of Wanda Woodward and 
Vital Piquette. They were murdered in  1987 by Daniel Gingras, a 
convicted murderer who used his birthday present, a one-day pass 
from an Edmonton prison, as his opportunity to murder again. He 
had been under the supervision of his social worker, a man half his 
size who he overpowered and tied up before he escaped to roam 
freely for nearly two months. Gingras should never have been let 
out of jail in the first place. It is too late to protect Woodward and 
Piquette but it is not too late for all the other potential victims.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2792"> 2792 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill would have made capital punishment the mandatory 
minimum sentence for adults convicted of first degree murder. For 
those who believe this is extreme and that life in prison is adequate 
punishment for these murderers, I ask them to examine the extreme 
nature of the lenient section 745 of the Criminal Code. Incredibly, 
it allows convicts the right to shorten their life sentence. Even if 
they are ordered to serve life in prison, all convicts can have the 
length of their sentence reviewed by a jury after serving only 15 
years. If successful, they can apply for parole.
<P>
	Of all convicts who have applied under this provision since 
1987, only 13 applicants have been denied an early release. That is 
a frightening prospect when we consider that even serial child 
killer Clifford Olson becomes eligible to apply for early release on 
August 12.
<P>
	The justice minister says that he is in favour of keeping section 
745 in all forms. He finds this loophole is acceptable despite a 
petition from 16,000 Canadians asking the government to repeal 
section 745. This is another example of how this government is 
sticking its head in the sand and refusing to carry out the wishes of 
Canadians.
<P>
	While we mend the punitive aspects of our justice system, we 
must not forget to address the grey area of the criminal population 
known as young offenders. Currently, a young offender convicted 
of first degree murder faces just 10 years as a maximum prison 
term. That 16 or 17-year old is perfectly aware of their actions and 
can easily understand the difference between right and wrong.
<P>
	Many people think we should focus on rehabilitating and not 
punishing these youths. I disagree. There must be a balance. How 
will a youth who has already demonstrated disdain for justice ever 
take it seriously if they are not held accountable for their actions?
<P>
	Between 35 and 65 kids, most of them older teens are charged 
with murder every year. Youths aged 12 to 17 were accused of 10 
per cent of all homicides committed between 1983 and 1992. As 
with older criminals, they also need to know that their actions are 
not acceptable in our society.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	This bill would have seen a 16 or 17-year old serve a life 
sentence for first degree murder. Furthermore it would have 
ensured that this age group served at least  seven years for second 
degree murder. For those under 16, first degree murder would have 
carried a minimum sentence of 10 to 15 years while second degree 
murder would have meant imprisonment for five to seven years. 
Note that the key word here is minimum, not maximum.
<P>
	I recognize that in advocating capital punishment serious 
consideration must be given to ensure that an innocent person is not 
put to death. Both law and science have progressed significantly in 
the past 20 years. A mechanism proposed in this bill would have 
given the jury the option of recommending clemency so only those 
guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt would be put to death.
<P>
	The appeal process proposed was thorough and fair. A 
conviction could have been appealed to the supreme court on the 
basis of both fact and law. This means that legal arguments could 
be used as sufficient grounds for overturning a conviction. More 
important, the facts and details surrounding the murder case could 
be re-examined to determine if the conviction was valid.
<P>
	The investigative tools and techniques of modern science 
certainly diminish the ambiguity of guilt or innocence. DNA 
testing has been proven to be a powerful means of identifying those 
who may have committed serious crimes. Bill C-104 which passed 
unanimously by this Parliament in June 1995 makes it easier for 
authorities to obtain DNA evidence through hair, saliva, blood and 
skin samples from a person who is reasonably believed to have 
perpetrated a crime.
<P>
	Those opposed to capital punishment would have us picture in 
our minds a row of convicts hanging in the gallows. That is 
sensationalism. Lethal injection of sodium thiopental ensures a 
quick and painless end and does not turn the culmination of a tragic 
chain of events begun by a brutal murder into a media and public 
circus.
<P>
	I am advocating change in the justice system as an average 
Canadian, one who sees criminals coddled and protected while 
their victims are denied their basic right to safety. Reinstatement of 
capital punishment along with other measures such as a victim bill 
of rights as proposed by my colleague from Fraser Valley West 
would go a long way toward restoring some of the public's lost 
faith in our judicial system.
<P>
	There are avid supporters of our rehabilitation programs who 
believe we can help these lost souls through counselling or 
training. Of course this is the same program that was allocated an 
entire chapter by the May 1996 auditor general's report listing a 
range of inefficiencies.
<P>
	Canadians want to see murderers be adequately punished for 
their crime. Canadians do not want a murderer out on the streets to 
kill again. They have grown weary of watching teenagers laugh at 
our laws. They are sick and tired of paying for failed rehabilitation. 
They do not want to accept that murderers may never serve their 
full sentences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2793"> 2793 </A></B>
<P>
	This government says tough luck for Canadians. The justice 
minister and his government like the status quo. Who cares what 
Canadians think? Canadians are being denied the right to vote for 
these changes in a national referendum and now their 
representatives, members of Parliament, are being denied the right 
to vote on their behalf.
<P>
	Canadians want capital punishment reinstated. Poll after poll has 
overwhelmingly shown this. When capital punishment was 
abolished in 1976 it was given 98 hours of debate. In 1996 this 
debate tonight warrants one hour. One hour.
<P>
	If the reinstatement of the death penalty were given fair attention 
and due consideration by Parliament, there would be no backing 
down. Canadians would have demanded that this bill be passed. 
Given the tremendous support of Canadians for the reinstatement 
of capital punishment, and because it is the duty of MPs to 
represent their constituents' interests in the House, I seek the 
unanimous consent of the members present to make Bill C-218 
votable this evening.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to make this a 
votable item?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hear at least two members saying no. 
Therefore, there is not unanimous consent. We will proceed with 
debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
bill introduced by the hon. member for Prince George-Peace 
River is a bill to restore the death penalty. Under this bill, all cases 
of first degree murder committed by an adult would be punishable 
by death, while the sentence for second degree murder would 
remain imprisonment for life, although the terms of release would 
be stricter.
<P>
	In addition, the Young Offenders Act would be amended to 
provide for a sentence not exceeding 25 years for first degree 
murder and not exceeding 10 years for second degree murder.
<P>
	This reopens the debate on capital punishment. As you know, 
this issue has already been debated at great lengths in this House. 
Let us start by asking ourselves if new developments justify 
throwing back into question the existing provisions of the Criminal 
Code?
<P>
	Has the number of murders increased in Canada? The latest 
statistics published by Statistics Canada in <I>Juristat</I> actually show a 
6 per cent drop in the number of homicides in 1994, the lowest 
number in 25 years. The 596 reported homicides represent a 34 per 
cent reduction  over 1993, that is to say the third consecutive 
reduction from one year to the next.
<P>
	The lower number of homicides committed in 1994 is mainly 
explained by 30 fewer homicides in the greater Montreal area. That 
is also why the number of homicides recorded in Quebec has gone 
down by 33 over 1993. In the case of the other provinces, only New 
Brunswick and Alberta have seen an increase in their homicide 
rates in 1994. Murders committed with a firearm continued to 
account for about one third of all homicides.
<P>
	On the basis of the statistics, I do not think that there are valid 
reasons for looking at this issue all over again. Life imprisonment 
with eligibility for parole after 25 years is a sufficient sentence. 
There is nothing to prove that capital punishment could save lives. 
On the other hand, the risks are greater that an innocent person 
could be sentenced to death. That is essentially my position.
<P>
	Let us look again, if we could, at the main argument advanced in 
favour of capital punishment. Proponents of capital punishment 
think that it is a more dissuasive measure than life imprisonment.
<P>
	We must, however, point out to them that for some people, such 
as fanatics and those acting on impulse, no sentence will be 
dissuasive. There was even an overall drop in the murder rate in 
Canada after capital punishment was abolished. Studies done to 
date indicate that the death sentence is no more dissuasive than the 
prospect of life imprisonment. The prospect of losing one's 
freedom for the rest of one's days is dissuasion enough.
<P>
	It is through better control of firearms and alcohol consumption, 
greater attention to mental health, and a more effective battle 
against poverty and unemployment that we will cut down on the 
number of murders, far more than through bringing back the death 
penalty. There is no foundation for the belief that the death penalty 
will cut down on the number of murders.
<P>
	Recently, in Senneville, near Montreal, a police office was killed 
while on duty, as he was about to arrest a driver for an infraction of 
the highway safety code. The murderer is still at large. Might the 
death penalty have prevented this tragedy? There is no reason to 
think so.
<P>
	Still relying on data from Statistics Canada, in 1994 one police 
officer was killed in the line of duty, compared to two in 1993, one 
in 1992, and three in 1991. For the tenth year in a row, no federal or 
provincial correctional worker was murdered in the performance of 
his or her duties.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps the most valid argument against capital punishment is 
the risk of killing innocent people. No system can guarantee the 
infallibility of a ruling. There were cases in the past in which 
people were killed by mistake and, despite all the guarantees 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2794"> 2794 </A></B>
<P>
provided by our  modern system, the risk remains. A witness may 
be mistaken or lie under oath.
<P>
	Our legal system is based on the credibility of witnesses. If all 
murderers were like Paul Bernardo and provided videotapes of 
their crimes, it would be different. In recent years, however, some 
people such as David Milgaard, Donald Marshall and Guy Paul 
Morin were wrongly convicted of murder. If capital punishment 
were still legal in this country, these three men would have been 
dead and buried a long time ago. The state would have become a 
killer without being able to correct its actions. We learned that, in 
the last two centuries, 343 people were wrongly convicted of 
murder in the U.S.
<P>
	Of course, some cases, like the rape and murder of children, like 
the Bernardo case, are revolting. We must, however, keep in mind 
that not all murder cases are so shocking. It is not because of a few 
unusually revolting cases that we must take an extreme position 
that would apply to all cases of first degree murder.
<P>
	Other factors such as the eventual rehabilitation of murderers 
argue against capital punishment. Commuting a death sentence to 
life imprisonment by order in council, as is proposed in the bill 
before us, would open the door to arbitrary decisions and would 
result in a loss of respect by the public for our judicial system.
<P>
	The bill also proposes to give the judge who sentences a person 
to death the power to make a recommendation in favour of royal 
clemency, or to postpone the execution of the sentence for any 
reason and for an indefinite period. It is obvious that even the 
sponsor of the bill has doubts about the merits of the death 
sentence.
<P>
	The amendments proposed by the Reform member for Prince 
George-Peace River also seek to amend the Young Offenders Act 
to impose longer sentences in the case of a murder committed by a 
juvenile. The bill provides for a sentence of 15 to 25 years in the 
case of a person convicted of first degree murder who is 16 or 17, 
and a sentence of 10 to 15 years in the case of person under the age 
of 16. The current maximum sentence is 10 years for all minors. In 
the case of a person convicted of second degree murder, the bill 
proposes a maximum sentence of 10 years and a minimum one of 
five years. The current act provides for a maximum sentence of 
seven years.
<P>
	Current prison terms were just lengthened in December by this 
House. They better reflect the representations made to the standing 
committee on justice. Prevention and rehabilitation are much more 
effective, particularly in the case of minors, and the emphasis must 
be on adequate public awareness measures.
<P>
	In short, I am completely against this bill, which would bring us 
back 20 years. I urge members of this House to do like me and to 
vote against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-218, which is 
sponsored by the hon. member for Prince George-Peace River.
<P>
	Bill C-218 seeks to impose the death penalty for first degree 
murder committed by a person 18 years of age or more and it seeks 
to change the prison terms for first and second degree murder that 
can be imposed on persons under the age of 18. In my remarks 
today I wish to speak on two aspects of this bill: first, the wisdom 
of reopening the debate on capital punishment for murder, and 
second, the suggestion that there should be increased prison terms 
for murder for persons under the age of 18.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	The issue of capital punishment has been thoroughly explored at 
the national level. After debating the question a number of times 
between 1966 and 1976, the House of Commons adopted a bill 
abolishing capital punishment in 1976.
<P>
	The most recent extensive debate took place less than 10 years 
ago in 1987. The subject of debate was a government motion. It 
called on the House of Commons to support, in principle, the 
reinstatement of capital punishment and to establish a special 
committee to provide recommendations on two aspects: first, on 
the offences that should carry the death penalty; and second, on the 
method or methods that should be used to carry out the sentence of 
death. In a free vote, and after debating the question at length in the 
House of Commons, members of the House of Commons voted 
against the motion and, therefore, against the reinstatement of 
capital punishment in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	It is notable that in the time since this was last discussed in the 
House, capital punishment has not been an issue of great national 
importance. The hon. member is introducing this bill now, 
notwithstanding the fact that in 1994 Canada recorded its lowest 
murder rate since 1969.
<P>
	In 1975, just before capital punishment was abolished for 
murder, the homicide rate in Canada was 3 per cent. In 1987 when 
the last major debate on this subject took place, the rate was 2.4 per 
cent. The homicide rate for 1994 in Canada, the last year for which 
it is available, was 2 per cent. These numbers show that not only 
has the murder rate not gone up since the death penalty was 
abolished, it has actually gone down. This is hardly justification for 
seeking a debate on the death penalty.
<P>
	While Canadians are rightly revolted by murder, which receives 
the most severe sanction under the Criminal Code, the case has not 
been made effectively to demonstrate that the current law has failed 
to punish murders adequately and requires change. In my view, the  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2795"> 2795 </A></B>
<P>
death penalty exceeds what is necessary to achieve various 
legitimate sentencing objectives.
<P>
	The onus is on those who would want to change the law in such a 
fundamental way to make a compelling case. I am not persuaded by 
the arguments being made.
<P>
	I also oppose the death penalty on practical grounds, moral 
grounds and conscientious grounds. I believe that effective 
arguments can easily be advanced to support this position. Such 
arguments have been made in the House over the years.
<P>
	Since the 1987 debates, however, two significant cases have 
come to light: the wrongful convictions for murder of Donald 
Marshall, Jr. and Guy-Paul Morin. If capital punishment had been 
in effect, they may not have had a second chance at life. This is why 
I oppose the death penalty on very practical grounds.
<P>
	If we as legislators were to support the death penalty, would we 
or a member of our families be willing to be that first mistake? I 
think not. That is why I am very opposed to capital punishment.
<P>
	Our system of justice, while it does a good job, certainly is not 
perfect and mistakes happen. When concerned with the life of an 
innocent individual, we cannot afford to make that mistake.
<P>
	The issue of capital punishment is both a moral and a personal 
issue. It is also a matter of how we see ourselves as a country and as 
a people. To return to capital punishment in Canada would be to go 
against the grain internationally. The trend in the world is to 
abolish the death penalty. To support a return to the death penalty 
for murder would be a retrograde move.
<P>
	We see in the neighbouring nation to the south the presence of 
the death penalty. Has that done a thing to stop crimes of violence 
in that country? No, it has not.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	I want to turn my attention now to the proposed increased prison 
terms for murder for persons under 18 years of age. It is quite 
surprising for the hon. member to bring forward these proposals at 
this time when new sentencing and parole eligibility periods for 
youth convicted of murder came into effect less than six months 
ago, on December 1, 1995.
<P>
	A youth who is 14 years of age or over at the time of the 
commission of the offence of first degree murder or second degree 
murder may be transferred to adult court. Depending on whether 
the youth is found guilty in youth court or in adult court, different 
sentences and parole eligibility regimes apply.
<P>
	If convicted of murder in adult court, the youth will be sentenced 
to life imprisonment. In such a case, the parole eligibility period 
was formerly set by the court at between five and ten years. Since 
December 1, 1995, a 16 or 17-year-old youth convicted of first 
degree murder must serve at least 10 years before being eligible for  
parole. A 16 or 17-year-old youth convicted of second degree 
murder must serve at least seven years. A youth aged 14 or 15 who 
is convicted of either first or second degree murder in adult court 
must serve a period of time between five and seven years inclusive 
as set by the court before being eligible for parole.
<P>
	For convictions in youth court the maximum penalty for first 
degree murder has been increased from the maximum of five years 
to a maximum of ten years. The penalty for second degree murder 
is now seven years. Sentences for both first and second degree 
murder in youth court have a maximum custodial portion and a 
maximum period of conditional supervision within the community.
<P>
	The House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs is currently studying issues related to youth crime, 
the youth justice system and matters concerning the operation and 
implementation of the Young Offenders Act. We should wait for 
the report of the committee before amending further the Young 
Offenders Act. We should also wait until we have an opportunity to 
assess the recent modifications to that act.
<P>
	In addition, further input on the Young Offenders Act will be 
provided by the federal, provincial and territorial ministers task 
force on young offenders which will be forthcoming soon.
<P>
	I cannot support this bill because I do not support the 
reinstatement of the death penalty. I believe the proposed 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act have been made and any 
addition or changes to that act prior to further deliberations by the 
committee and before the input from the federal, provincial and 
territorial justice ministers' committee would be premature and 
ill-advised.
<P>
	I do not support the bill. I would like to thank the House for the 
opportunity to participate in the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a privilege to speak to Bill C-218 which introduces once again the 
concept of the death penalty.
<P>
	I commend my colleague from Prince George-Peace River for 
the courage to once again introduce this matter even though 
members opposite do not have the courage to put it to a vote in this 
day and age.
<P>
	One of the questions that comes to me is why once again is it this 
party which is bringing forward issues that are relevant to 
grassroots Canadians. On the death penalty all we are looking at is 
a debate and a vote. Why is it necessary to fight like we did for 
victims' rights? Why are these things necessary? Why is the 
government not running with these kinds of issues and dealing with 
them?
<P>
	I was reading a book put out by Amnesty International the other 
day entitled <I>When the State Kills</I>. I will read an excerpt because it 
may give some the understanding of exactly what is on the minds 
on this side of the House. It  states: ``The important point is that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2796"> 2796 </A></B>
<P>
every person can improve himself and should be given the 
opportunity to do so, however serious his mistakes have been. The 
reason for this is that deep down inside each human being there 
exists the potentiality of development towards the highest good. A 
death penalty would totally destroy that potentiality''. Think about 
what it says. I would repeat this part: ``The important point is that 
every person can improve himself and should be given the 
opportunity to do so however serious his mistakes have been''.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	I can provide a litany, as my colleague from Prince 
George-Peace River has, of mistakes. I do not know how one 
could say that Wayne Perkin made a mistake by bludgeoning 
Angela Richards to death, stabbing her 26 times. It happened in my 
community. He had made that same mistake a couple of years 
before. He got out on parole and made the same mistake again.
<P>
	These are not mistakes. They are cold calculated problems. It is a 
human deficiency. They are animal instincts. For the life of me I 
cannot understand how the concept of mistake gets into it. We must 
deal on a better level than this.
<P>
	Some comments have been made by members opposite in their 
speeches that I must address. Their comments emphasize exactly 
some problems in their logic. The Bloc member said that according 
to current statistics homicides have gone down in all categories. 
The Liberal member also said that we have the lowest murder rate 
in years, and that the number of murders has actually gone down.
<P>
	I could give them a good idea why that has happened. I was at a 
victims rights rally this past Saturday and talked to a lady named 
Leona. Leona and I have talked a number of times. She has been 
through hell and back. I will give the House an idea of why the 
statistics show that the murder rate-murder one in particular-has 
gone down.
<P>
	I will read exactly what Leona said in reference to Bobby 
Gordon Oatway. Members may remember his name was brought up 
recently. He was to be let out on parole in my colleague's riding. 
The inhabitants screamed about that and they tried to let him out in 
Abbotsford in my riding. We got on that, so they flew him to 
Toronto and there he resides.
<P>
	Leona said: ``I am a victim of this man and can tell you more 
about him than most. He is one of the most dangerous kinds of 
pedophiles there is. For about 10 years of my life this man raped, 
beat and sold his child victims. One of the men he sold us to''-she 
was one of them-``was Clifford Olson.'' I am sure most of you 
know about Olsen.
<P>
	``We have suffered every form of abuse imaginable. Mr. Oatway 
changed his name in prison. His name was  Robert Gordon Stevens. 
When I was a young child and in my teens I was forced to witness 
several child murders committed by Oatway and a few deaths 
caused by Olson. We were forced to help bury the bodies of his 
victims. As one of Oatway's victims I fought this man every step of 
the way to try to protect the other children from the rapes and 
beatings and horrifying deaths which I was forced to witness''.
<P>
	She talked in this letter about how she tried to express exactly 
what was going on and how no one would listen. She continued: 
``The rapes I was subjected to, the numerous times I stepped in to 
try to prevent another death, the blood I have on my hands, the 
young children's bodies I have cradled as they lay there dead in my 
arms, it is all so horrifying and I was not the only one. There were 
many of us who suffered this horror. These murder charges have 
not and will not be brought against Oatway because I am classified 
as an unstable witness due to the horrors I have seen''.
<P>
	``There were originally 41 counts against Oatway when the 
charges from me were stayed, which left only 19. After all 
witnesses had testified crown counsel and Oatway struck a deal. He 
plead guilty to seven charges. Those were one rape, two bestiality, 
two buggery and two assaults against adult women. He was given a 
total of 10 years''.
<P>
	This is a man who has murdered children. This is a man who 
should have had murder one. This is a man who should have been 
given the death penalty. Why the statistics go down on these 
fellows is that lawyers and judges take over. They reduce murder 
one and murder two to manslaughter and to things called buggery, 
assault and bestiality. That is why the statistics are going down. It 
has become a game of lawyers and judges. They plea bargain case 
after case.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	I have more. I have been there. I was at a funeral yesterday 
which involved such an issue. They say homicides have dropped. 
Outside the House there is a monument of RCMP officers who 
have been murdered in Canada. Roger Pierlet is on the monument. I 
met Roger Pierlet's brother and sister in my riding. They asked me 
to go to a hearing of John Harvey Miller who, with Vincent 
Cockriell, shot this RCMP officer to death in 1974.
<P>
	They were both sentenced to hang until the Liberal government 
took away capital punishment. Then they were committed to life 
imprisonment. Cockriell got out about seven months ago. So much 
for life. So much for the family. So much for the considerations. 
Cockriell is now apparently scheduled to go to the university 
college in the Fraser Valley. I have to wonder what is wrong in this 
country. Death meant death, but it does not any more. It means 
ending up in the Fraser Valley college.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2797"> 2797 </A></B>
<P>
	The statistics say murder is going down, but it is not. The 
problem is there is not a government in this country with the 
courage of the convictions of its electorate. That is unfortunate. 
It is unfortunate that we could not convince the government 
tonight to vote on such an important issue. It would find, like 
many in this country feel, the death penalty is a necessary 
deterrent and could be a positive thing, not a negative thing.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to watch members of the Reform Party, the less 
civilized ones, trying to turn the clock back some 300 years. They 
do not seem to realize Parliament and Canada several years ago, by 
way of an historic vote, decided to eliminate once and for all the 
death penalty.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Was it a free vote?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Yes, it was a free vote.
<P>
	In Canada we can confidently look at statistics as they are and 
we can confidently look at the reality which surrounds us in 
everyday life. I would like to make two brief points because of the 
time limitation.
<P>
	Contrary to what the previous speaker said, statistics are a reality 
that cannot be denied. Statistics are there for guidance. If the 
statistics are not liked by certain members of the Reform Party, that 
is too bad. Statistics demonstrate not only in Canada but also in the 
United States that the murder rate and crime rates are down. That 
may not be good news politically for the ambassadors of bad news, 
but nevertheless that is a fact.
<P>
	There is proof on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean that capital 
punishment is not a deterrent. This evidently has some difficulty 
penetrating into the consciousness of some Reform members. It is 
not a deterrent and it has been proven in jurisdiction after 
jurisdiction. There is one just south of us which can demonstrate at 
any time on any day that capital punishment does not deter crime. 
That has been established over the last 60 years in a number of 
nations so much that progress on this matter has been achieved 
exactly as a result of these findings in recent decades.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	For the state to have capital punishment is tantamount to giving a 
bad example. We want society to behave in a positive manner with 
respect to life. We want the state to promote that concept. We want 
the state to do whatever is in its power, on behalf of the population, 
to ensure life is protected.
<P>
	If that premise holds, as most of us believe, then we cannot have 
the state commit murder. We cannot have the state using violence 
on people. We cannot have the state adopting double standards. 
This is another point which is so difficult for some Reform 
members to understand and accept. The state has to give the right 
example. The state cannot use violence by snuffing out life.
<P>
	This is an important watershed on this issue, in addition of 
course to other considerations, which we all well know, of 
misjudgments of people who were condemned and whose life was 
taken away and whose innocence was proven decades later. The 
records are full of those cases as well.
<P>
	Apart from that aspect, it is well known, an established principle, 
that if the state is to give the example that the population must 
follow, the state cannot be seen as being the one that commits the 
action of taking away the life of an individual. Some criminologists 
have claimed in their findings that imprisonment for life is a very 
serious and heavy punishment for any human being, the removal of 
liberty, freedom and being able to enjoy the things in life that a free 
individual can.
<P>
	It is clear some Reform Party members have difficulty 
understanding the validity of statistics. They do not exist for them 
because they do not confirm their biases. That is too bad. Reform 
members have difficulty in understanding that capital punishment 
does not work as a deterrent. I invite them to visit countries where 
capital punishment still exists and see what they have achieved in 
terms of reducing the crime rate. It has not made one indent.
<P>
	A concept which is perhaps too far reaching for the Reform 
members to grasp is that the state must give the example it wants 
the public to follow.
<P>
	For all those reasons it seems this motion ought to be defeated. I 
am sure that if it ever comes to a vote it will be. We cannot turn the 
clock back 300 years. We have moved into an era in which we have 
developed values and appreciation and in which we have learned 
from past mistakes.
<P>
	We crossed this threshold a few years ago after a very lengthy 
debate and a very close vote; by eight votes. However, it was done 
and Canada is committed to being a country in which the death 
penalty no longer exists. We want to make sure that for the next 
millennium this matter will never be considered seriously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this for a few moments.
<P>
	I really started to realize more and more what the problem is 
when it comes to this place and it was expressed by the previous 
speaker. When someone stands in the House and gives us messages 
about why we should not have capital punishment, they are telling 
70 per cent of the population of Canada that they do not know what 
they are talking about. Once again the old attitude comes out that 
we in Parliament know best, not the 70 per cent or 75 per cent of 
Canadians calling for this through polls.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	The previous speaker spoke of statistics. The polls are saying 
there is a very high percentage of Canadians who want capital 
punishment.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2798"> 2798 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals have the gall to sit in the House and send a 
message out across the land that they are the intelligent ones, they 
are the smart ones, they know best and the ordinary taxpayers do 
not know what is good for them, and so they will decide. This 
will not be a votable motion.
<P>
	Then I hear the member for Kingston and the Islands shouting 
thank goodness the bill is not votable. I have to agree with him. 
They are probably glad it is not votable because once again they 
would have to vote against the wishes of the people in their ridings 
and they would not want to do that too many times. They have 
already done it so many times we cannot count them all. That it is 
okay, do not listen to the people, do what you want to do. That is 
the part that bothers me more than anything else.
<P>
	People are saying what they want from this place. Canadians 
want a fundamental responsibility that has been here for ages, to 
provide legislation that shows responsibility to protect the lives and 
property of its citizens, a fundamental request from Canadians. The 
least we can do in the House is come up with legislation that 
reflects the wishes of the people who pay the bills, the taxpayers of 
Canada. That would be a novelty.
<P>
	Look at Clifford Olson. He killed once and for that one death he 
could have got life in 25 years. He killed twice and that was free. 
The third time was free. The fourth time was free. The fifth time 
was free. He killed 11 times and all the rest were free. He only had 
to kill once to get the sentence he got.
<P>
	Lo and behold, a few years back the miracle workers on the other 
side of the House provided a clause that said even Clifford Olson 
could apply to get out in 15 years. I do not believe that sits well 
with the people of Canada. That is the mentality that goes on over 
on that side of the House. That kind of mentality is what the 
Canadian people are sick and tired of.
<P>
	Canadian people would like us to send a message to the Paul 
Bernardos, the Karla Homolkas and the Clifford Olsons of this 
country that if you hunt and you capture and you abuse and you kill 
another human being, the Government of Canada in the name of 
justice and those innocent victims will hunt and capture you. If 
authorized to do so after a fair trial by a court of law, we will take 
your life, not in the name of revenge, but in the name of justice and 
as a deterrent to future such acts by others. That is the statement we 
need to send from the House of Commons to the people of Canada 
and these types of Bernardos, Homolkas and Olsons.
<P>
	I would like to be invited by any of those members to go to 
their riding to debate this topic. Let us see if they can stand in 
front of their people and do that. Likewise, I invite them to come 
to my riding and convince my people this is not good for them. 
They will not do that. It is more fun to sit in here and heckle and 
not vote on it.
<P>
	I fail to understand why we have a committee in the House of 
Commons that determines which bills are  votable and which are 
not. There are criteria clearly laid out as to what makes a bill 
votable. When that criteria is 100 per cent met, I do not think the 
personal feelings of any individual from any committee should 
interfere with making an item votable. I have a hard time 
understanding that. Yet this government, which has the control of 
the committees, lets the personal opinion of people override the 
rules that are in place as to what makes an item votable.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	Once again, it does not make sense. The little dictatorship runs 
on and on and personally, I am really tired of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know that time is short and I have just a couple of 
minutes but there is a question I would like to ask the Liberal 
government representatives opposite. Have they not stopped to 
realize for one minute what the main criteria of government is? It is 
for the safety and well-being of its citizens. It is not for the criminal 
citizens in this country; it is for the law-abiding citizens. But not 
according to this government and its ministers who say that the 
first commitment with regard to crime has to be for the 
rehabilitation of the criminal. That is the government's priority.
<P>
	I am hearing that our first concern has to be the rehabilitation of 
the criminal. If that is not the most sickening thing I have heard as a 
priority for any government of any country, I do not know what is. 
The government has thrown out, totally discarded the main reason 
we have government in this country: the safety and well-being of 
the law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	The government, as my hon. colleagues have been saying since 
this debate began, seems to have gone totally the other way. We 
have heard about Mr. Olson. We have also heard from some of the 
victims' families who have to suffer with this every day.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to tell the hon. member that the 
time has expired. Accordingly, the matter is dropped from the order 
paper.
<P>
