<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope reached out and touched the lives of millions of people, not only as the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church for 26 years but as a simple human being who lived through remarkable times. In his youth, the Pope challenged Nazi fascism during the occupation of his beloved homeland of Poland, and later he played a key role in the fall of communism in that country with his support for the Solidarity movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Toronto the Pope inspired the ecumenical work of the Scarborough Mission to reach out to people of all faiths and cultures. As one of those involved in the ecumenical work of the mission, I can attest to the fact that these efforts of the Pope have been quite successful locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that all members of the House, along with all Canadians, wish to extend our condolences to the Vatican, to Catholics and to people all over the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring to the Liberal government's Bill C-17 to decriminalize the possession of up to 30 grams of marijuana or roughly 45 to 60 joints. The  intent of this legislation obviously is to decriminalize the occasional use of marijuana. I do not know what the government is smoking but 30 grams of marijuana is a little more than occasional use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decriminalization sends the wrong message to young people; that is, marijuana is not so bad and it is okay to experiment with this so-called soft drug. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that if the bill passes it will lead to both an increase in demand and production of marijuana and criminal activity. If grow ops are a problem now, just wait and see what happens if Bill C-17 becomes law, assuming of course the government lasts long enough to bring the bill to a final vote.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, Eric Watson of Debec was in a horrific snowmobile accident late at night. He spent that night, one of the coldest of the  year, outdoors, and suffered severe frostbite and hypothermia as a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors questioned whether he would survive. He did not just survive, he thrived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to survival was not easy. Mr. Watson, an avid hockey player, had to have his right leg amputated at  10 inches below the knee.  Even as he recovered in the hospital, he told doctors he would play hockey again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not just playing hockey, he is excelling at hockey. Mr. Watson recently earned a spot on Canada's National Amputee men's hockey team and will travel with Team Canada to Italy for the World Amputee Olympic Games in 2006.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate Eric Watson for turning a tragic event into a great achievement for himself and our country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During nearly 30 years, he worked for the sports service at the CEGEP in Victoriaville. This former football player with a heart of gold was an icon on the local sports scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was committed to the development of young people and wanted as many student athletes as possible to be able to pursue their sports dreams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Paré was also active in the  union of non teaching professionals at the Victoriaville CEGEP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired for a mere 18 months, he had continued his community  involvement with many groups, including the Vulkins and Vicas football teams, the Warwick golf club, the    recreation issue table of the  Arthabaska RCM and the  sports and recreation regional unit for the Centre-du-Québec region, to name but a few.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These students from my riding of Nunavut travelled thousands of miles from above the Arctic Circle to visit southern Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students from both communities were  thrilled by the Parliament Hill tour, and I appreciated the opportunity to showcase to them the wonderful building and institution in which  I have the honour to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student exchange programs are important tools for students to learn about Canada and about each other's culture. We northerners love to share the beautiful part of the country in which we live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students of Akwesasne will soon go up to Resolute Bay to learn first-hand about Inuit and a chance to be in the Land of the Midnight Sun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exchange is an experience of a lifetime for both groups and I know they will treasure the memories for the rest of their lives.</p>

This is the third edition of this event designed to instill in Quebeckers a love for lifelong learning and  to develop learning opportunities for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive activities are scheduled as part of this week of recognition, the success of which will be ensured by 17 regional issue tables bringing together hundreds of partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, 1.5 million adults are striving to pursue continuous training or working on furthering their education.  The importance of the Quebec Adult Learners Week rests in acknowledging their efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current context of plant closures, manpower retraining is paramount, and Quebec wants the emphasis to be on continuous training.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now hope that the federal government willfollow suit by moving forward with the transfer to the provinces for manpower training. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Gionet was born in St. Paul, Middle Caraquet, New Brunswick. He followed in his father's footsteps, farming and  fishing until he joined the army at the age of 20. After the war, Mr. Gionet married Lauza Hébert, with whom he had nine children. One of them, Armand, was killed during the second world war.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembrance Day was always extremely important to Mr. Gionet, who attended the ceremonies each November 11 until he turned 101. In 1998, he also took part in a trip to mark the 80th anniversary of the war to end all wars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of all the hon. members and all Canadians, I extend my sincere condolences, in this Year of the Veteran, to the family and friends of Mr. Gionet. He will not be forgotten.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team leader, Dan Miller, has led a number of these trips to help those in need in very impoverished areas.  The team of five adults and six teenage girls raised the funds for their trip and were very involved in all aspects of the construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to helping to build the orphanage, the team helped replace  the roof on a local church and ran a one day youth camp for the local children.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While their trip lasted 14 days, the efforts made in Paraguay will have a lasting impression on the orphans for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with great pride that I recognize Dan Miller, Jason and Sarah Burt, Nathan and Amanda Westendorp, Alexandra Foster, Erica Jones, Jillian Grant, Amanda Cramer, Erin Wiley and Laura McGill for making such a tremendous difference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global reality for women and children  is that issues concerning their health are a low priority and Canada's Liberal government is no exception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent UNICEF report on child poverty, Canada ranked a shameful 19 out of 26.  This confirmed what we already know; that the government has completely failed to live up to its 15-year-old commitment to eliminate child poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another report by the United Nations reveals that in the past decade the number of women living in poverty continues to increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty is the number one determinate of ill health.  If mothers are living in poverty then their children are living in poverty.  It is that simple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a timely opportunity to remind the government of the commitment made over 25 years ago to achieving the level of 0.7% of Canada's gross national income on development assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians proved once again that they are ahead of government when responding to the tsunami crisis  both in compassion and in generosity. Canadians would want their government to be showing moral global leadership in the face of 1.1 billion fellow human beings living in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony Blair has shown that leadership pressed by the British people. Germany is expected to announce soon a commitment to reach 0.7%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government wastes enough money in its operations to be able to afford this  and development assistance has now evolved to be very effective and accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should honour its commitment to 0.7% now with a set timetable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moved to see how even in death this man of God can evoke such an outpouring of love. During the 26 years of his pontificate, he attracted the largest crowds in human history and was encountered by more people than any man or woman who has ever lived.  He did so because he was an icon of self-giving love and a constant and courageous voice of moral clarity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every field of human endeavour, in  every language and on every continent, he preached and lived the fundamental Christian truth about the human person:  that every human life, from the moment of conception to natural death, is created in the image and likeness of God and therefore possesses an inviolable dignity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He preached this truth in the face of the inhuman ideologies of what he called the century of tears.  In the face of the terror of Communism and Nazism, he relentlessly defended the freedoms of conscience and religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a man whose memory we will always hold dearly.  Requiescat in pace. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unbelievable, and all the more so when we hear allegations implicating the Parti Québécois.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very interesting hearing the leader of the Conservative Party talk about national unity because in 1994 on the eve of the 1995 referendum in the province of Quebec, when federalists of various stripes and when federalists of the Liberal Party were working hard to keep the country together, he was giving speeches saying he did not care whether Canada ended up with one national capital or four national capitals.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the Bloc members because they are separatists. They want to destroy the country, but I cannot understand for the life of me why the Conservatives support the Bloc in commenting on testimony and wanting to have an election based on testimony, not on the facts, not on Gomery's report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to get to the bottom of this.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he finally realizes that the Bloc and the separatists are hellbent on destroying Canada, perhaps he should reconsider his party's support of the Bloc's daily commentary on allegations before Gomery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, perhaps if he really realizes that the Bloc is hellbent on destroying the country, he ought to support federalists in the province of Quebec and support this government as we get to the bottom of this issue, so that we can defend the reputations of all Quebec federalists.</p>

Yesterday, thanks to the finance committee initiative, four independent experts revealed that the government once again lowballed the size of this year's surplus announced in the budget just six weeks ago by over $3 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the government persist in attempting to mislead the public about the size of the surplus?

If he was pointing in a particular direction, and I am afraid I did not get to see which direction he was pointing in, it appears it was at someone in the House. It may have been heavenward, but I cannot imagine that the hon. member for Medicine Hat would go that far.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, through the WTO negotiations, we are insisting that there has to be an appreciation and a recognition of sensitive products. Individual countries must have the flexibility to deal with those products in the ways that makes most sense for individual countries.</p>

I have risen many times in this House on this petition.  This petition is completely different from the ones I have just tabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petition is on the proposed LNG terminal in Eastport, Maine.  This is a very controversial proposal to build an LNG terminal in Eastport, Pleasant Point, Maine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may ask why would petitioners be petitioning the Parliament of Canada on a proposal in the United States.  The reason is that this proposal to build this plant has been turned down in the United States in a number of areas up and down the New England coast. They have now identified an area in Maine which can only be accessed, believe it or not, by going through Canadian waters.  These waters are very dangerous and include  the  very narrow  Head Harbour Passage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners want the Government of Canada to say no to the transport of LNG tankers through that passage simply because of the dangers that Canada would be exposed to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners are asking the Government of Canada to do the very same thing it did approximately 30 years ago when it said no to the passage of tankers through Head Harbour Passage for at that time the construction of an oil terminal.</p>

We as parliamentarians should listen to what the people have to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to present two petitions both on the subject of marriage with different aspects and which have been signed by a number of Canadians, including from my riding of Mississauga South.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the first petition, which has to do with the definition of marriage, the petitioners want to raise for the attention of the House that the institution of marriage is between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others and it is the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament. They ask Parliament to pass legislation to recognize the institution in federal law as being the lifelong union of one man and one woman because there is no definition in current federal law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second petition has to do with the notwithstanding clause and is signed by a number of constituents. The petitioners want to draw to the attention of the House that the majority of Canadians believe that the fundamental matters of social policy should be decided by elected members of Parliament and not by an unelected judiciary and that it is the duty of Parliament to ensure that marriage is defined in Canada as Canadians wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, therefore, call upon Parliament to take all legislative measures possible, including the invocation of section 33, known as the notwithstanding clause, to ensure that marriage is preserved and is defined as one man--</p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1203123"></A><a HREF="#Int-1203124"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1203106"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-30 fulfills a commitment by the Prime Minister to delink compensation for parliamentarians and judges and to allow parliamentarians to receive salary increases in line with those of Canadians in the private sector.</p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentarians, under the proposed legislation, Bill C-30, would receive salary increases adjusted yearly according to what is called the major wage settlement index. This is a highly respected index used by governments, businesses and unions.  It is published annually and measures the annual salary increases negotiated by collective bargaining for private sector units with 500 or more employees.  Accordingly this index represents more than 800,000 private sector employees in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members will have noted during report stage of this legislation, our colleague from Prince George—Peace River indicated that the official opposition supported the bill because future salary increases would be tied to those in the private sector.  He called this initiative commendable.  I thank him and his party for their support of the legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the member for Timmins—James Bay told the House that his party, the New Democratic Party, found the index fair and supported the bill as well.  I also thank them for their support of what we believe to be fair and reasonable legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has been recognized as a fair and reasonable  way to deal with the salaries of parliamentarians.  I believe that when we vote on this legislation, we will find it receives the very broad support of members of the House.</p><A NAME="Int-1203281"></A><a HREF="#Int-1203343"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1203250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, as the parliamentary secretary noted in his brief remarks  a moment ago, I have indicated that the official opposition will be supporting Bill C-30  and, I might add, we have always maintained  that we should not place ourselves in an ongoing conflict of interest by having to debate and decide our own remuneration. Indeed, this bill's predecessor, which linked us to the judges' remuneration, was actually the reason that the House went down that road before.  This is a fairer way to go about setting our remuneration and I indicated that during my remarks at report stage as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was indicated, Bill C-30 proposes to amend the Parliament of Canada Act and the Salaries Act to establish a new method of indexation of salaries and allowances for members of Parliament and ministers.  It  will come into effect from April 1, 2004. Salaries and allowances will no longer be adjusted by reference to the increase in the annual salary of the chief justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, but rather in accordance with the index of the average percentage increase and base rate wages for each and every calendar year resulting from major settlements negotiated with bargaining units of 500 or more employees in the private sector in Canada, as published by the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original objective for linking compensation for members of Parliament to that of the chief justices, which is determined by the Judicial Salary and Benefits Commission, was to discontinue the practice whereby members themselves legislate their own compensation. However when the commission recommended an 11% increase in pay, an unjustified increase I might add, the government changed its position that compensation for MPs should not be linked to judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that point, I think the general public will recall the debate that took place just before and during last spring's election campaign. We and others raised the issue of the impending judges' increase which would have the ripple effect on our remuneration as well. To the government's credit, at that point in time it agreed with us and said that an increase of that amount would be unacceptable.  Therefore last fall it brought in Bill C-30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bill was introduced  it created a public issue regarding compensation for judges as well.  While the government has indicated that amendments regarding compensation for judges is forthcoming, we believe, and I have stated it repeatedly, that the government ought to have accompanied Bill C-30 with that, since it was the 11% pay hike proposed for judges that triggered the need for a new method to determine compensation for members of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The link between compensation for judges and compensation for members of Parliament and the excessive pay hike proposed for judges led to the need for legislative change. Bill C-30 solves only half the problem by establishing a new mechanism for MPs only, leaving judges with a process that provides them, potentially, at least at this point, with that 11% pay hike, which is almost four times the Canadian average increase in wages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Conservative Party calls upon the government, as we have in the past, to forgo the 11% pay hike for judges and immediately introduce legislation to establish a new mechanism for compensating judges similar to what has been proposed for members of Parliament in Bill C-30. That would ensure that significant salary compensation adjustments would only occur when it can be demonstrated that responsibilities have changed accordingly.</p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the compensation of parliamentarians is the perfect subject when it comes to grandstanding.  We have had proof of that here in the comments made on this by the Prime Minister of Canada, which once again reflected his attitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just heard the Conservative House Leader say that it is not right for MPs to determine their own remuneration.  That is true, and that is why a committee on the modernization of Parliament, which was struck in January 2001 and made up of the parliamentary leaders, reached the following conclusion: we should stop discussing whether MPs ought to vote on their own salary increases.  After that came the idea of linking increases to those given to judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is decided in an independent committee that judges get a salary increase, by that very fact, due to their linking, the MPs also get an automatic increase under this legislation, not because they have taken any action themselves.  We cannot decide to raise our pay 25% or 30% simply because we have had no increase for the past seven or eight years.  That is totally unacceptable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want this to be clear: the Bloc Québécois is opposed to Bill C-30, as it is to any increase in MPs' salaries.  We want to retain the status quo.  We want to continue to receive the fair and proper salary we are currently receiving.  This is where the hypocrisy lies in the mechanics of Bill C-30, which disengages us from the judges' salary increases, although this has been settled since June 2001.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying principles behind the linking with judges' remuneration were as follows: Is it normal and acceptable for the Prime Minister to earn the same amount as the highest official he appoints?  Is is normal and acceptable for an elected representative to earn less than a public servant?  Take the example of a minister, who is earning less than a deputy minister.  Is that acceptable?  No it is not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first principle was established by the House leaders of all the parties, the leader of the Conservatives, the hon. member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country; the former Liberal House leader, the hon. member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell; the NDP House leader, the then hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona; and my colleague, the Bloc Québécois House leader. The basic principle was that the Prime Minister should earn the same salary as the highest ranking official he appoints, not a penny more, not a penny less. Who is the highest ranking official appointed by the Prime Minister? It is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a position currently held by a woman. That was the first principle.</p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, do we agree that a minister should earn a certain percentage less than the Prime Minister? The answer is yes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, is it normal for an MP with no ministerial responsibility to earn half the Prime Minister's salary? It was established that, yes, this is normal and the ministers' salaries should be somewhere between the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that we do not discuss our own salary increases, there is an independent committee in charge of reviewing judges' salaries. As an aside, I do not want anyone watching to think that the Bloc Québécois wants to be mean to the judiciary. The Bloc Québécois is a party of law. It has enormous respect for the courts, judges and their decisions. People should not think the Bloc Québécois wants to be mean to judges. On the contrary, we think that instead of elected representatives voting on their own salary increases, those increases should be tied to salary increases for judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have Bill C-30 and the Prime Minister takes a cheap shot at parliamentarians. I am going to make a non-partisan comment on that unfortunate remark.  I think that, basically, we parliamentarians take our jobs to heart.  We take it to heart that we need to properly represent those who trusted us enough to elect us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask each of the 135 Liberal members over there whether they think they earn their salaries, whether they are doing their jobs and deserve what they are paid?  We have had some informal discussions and many of the members of the Liberal caucus do not agree with the comment, the mean-spirited, partisan and vengeful comment, made by the Prime Minister, who is incidentally a millionaire.   He owned a shipping company and some of its ships were under foreign registration in order to escape having to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.  It is easy for the Prime Minister to make comments like that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the reasons that we in the Bloc Québécois cannot agree with this bill.  It delinks MPs'  salaries from judges' salaries, yet that question was settled back in January 2001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why reconsider that decision in Bill C-30, when it was made with the unanimity of all the parliamentary leaders?  Does denying work that has been done correct the democratic deficit?  Does it mean that all consensual decisions reached by the parliamentary leaders before this PM was here no longer count?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does parliamentary consensus only date from the arrival of this Prime Minister?  I regret to say this, but we do not need any lectures on morality from this PM.  I am certain, I repeat, that many of the 135 Liberal caucus members across the way agree with me.  I even know that they told their caucus that this was not right. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may seem to be repeating myself, but it is to be sure there is no ambiguity.  The Bloc Québécois does not want to be mean to judges, nor to the workers who will serve as reference points for this new legislation if it is passed. That is why we are saying that, if they want to delink us from the judges, they ought to maintain the salary.  If the present salary is not maintained, then the link ought to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what lies behind this?  The independent committee on judges' remuneration has set the increase for the next four years at approximately 10.8%.</p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim was to avoid having to respond to those who might say: “That makes no sense.  The MPs have just voted and given themselves 10.8% over four years based on the cost of living index.”   If we do not think this 10.8% makes sense, we need only say: “It is true it makes no sense. While it may make  no sense for parliamentarians, it makes no more sense for judges.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying that a woman cannot be just a little pregnant.  Either she is pregnant or she is not.  The government should clue in.  If it makes no sense for parliamentarians to be paid this—the government has an obligation to be consistent—the government should set the same criterion for the judges.  If a 10.8% increase makes no sense for parliamentarians, it does not make any more sense for judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, logically speaking, as parliamentarians—this is what the Bloc would like, and we made our position very clear on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, where we opposed all government amendments to this bill—we should just reject Bill C-30 and have a policy of no salary increase. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite right that the increase according to the former bill linked to judges would have been around 10% plus over four years, which is 2.5%. But the proposed increase linking it to an industrial wage index is already giving us about 2% for the current year and presumably will be 2% and 2% plus over the four years, which will almost be 10% if the level of inflation stays the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The differential between the link to the judges' salaries and what is being proposed is actually quite small. It is not 10%. It is the difference between  the average industrial index over the next four years compared to 10%. Perhaps the member would like to comment.</p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2001, when we adopted the principle of linking the salaries of MPs and judges, the consensus was that the Prime Minister should earn as much as the highest official he appoints, namely the chief justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to get into mathematical formulae because, first, math is not my strong suit and second, I do not want to confuse the public. However, if, based on the industrial index that will serve as the  reference for Bill C-30, this results in  a maximum increase of 8% for the next four years instead of 10.8% spread over the same period, this means that at the end of that four-year period, starting in 2005-06, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada will earn more than the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This violates the principle. This means that, ultimately, the Prime Minister will earn less than the highest official he appoints. I am not defending the Prime Minister and his salary increases. He has no need of his salary. With all the perks he gets, he does not need his salary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is about the principle and we fight for principles. After four years, the chief justice will earn more than the Prime Minister and that makes no sense.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1203527"></A><a HREF="#Int-1203556"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1203491"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, my question is quite simple.  It relates to my very brief remarks on third reading of Bill C-30 today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main contention that my hon. colleague from the Bloc has, for which there is some argument to be made, is that the Prime Minister should not be making less than the people he appoints, especially the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my remarks, I put forward an idea that I believe would certainly be supported by the majority of people in Canada, and not only the majority of people in Canada but also the majority of people in Quebec.  That idea is that  members of Parliament should not be in a position where they get what I think would widely be viewed as an exorbitant raise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no increase in our responsibilities, why should we be getting 2% per year, or 10% per year, or 10% over four years, or 11% or whatever it is, if people out in the real world are getting substantially less? That is the whole point of tying our future salary increases to this index of the average increase that Canadians will be getting in what I refer to as the real world outside this place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, my contention is that the government should have brought in amendments to the Judges Act to ensure that the judges would likewise be tied to that same index.  I still believe the government should bring forward those amendments  to do away with the commission that sets the salary and compensation for judges and should likewise tie the judges in Canada to this same index that Canadians in the real world face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that not solve the problem? I know that my hon. colleague is really anxious to get up and have his say on this, but why that would not solve the problem?  Instead of raising our compensation, our remuneration, up to the 11% that it is rumoured we  would get if it goes ahead and stays the same way, why not bring  judges  down to the same salary increase that real Canadians out in the real world get?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that it is a perfect bill for grandstanding. We will be marching here on Wellington Street holding signs that say, “Do you think MPs earn too much?” We will take a poll of the people who sit in the galleries. We will hand out sheets asking, “Do you think MPs earn too much? They should work for nothing.” It sets the stage for grandstanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will bring up some bad memories for the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River. When the members of the Reform Party were sitting here, Preston Manning sent out a memo objecting to the large number of Christmas lights on Parliament Hill. He said it was costing the taxpayers too much in electricity. Of course, that was popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bloc Québécois was the official opposition, he said that Stornoway should be transformed into a bingo hall. But as soon as they became the official opposition, they jumped on Stornoway. Preston Manning once said that the free lunches, which  make us fat—look what it has done to me, with the lunches we eat in the lobby—cost the taxpayers too much. But when the lunch comes, the Conservatives eat it. We could say that is not logical because it is the taxpayers who pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I say it is a fine bill for grandstanding, and I say with respect that my colleague from Prince George—Peace River has done just that.</p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1203612"></A><a HREF="#Int-1203639"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1203556"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Saint-Maurice—Champlain, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, it is not the first time that I have been involved in  a debate on members' salaries.

As the hon. member said, this issue always leads to some grandstanding. We can have anyone say just about anything  on MPs' salaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the hon. member. At some point, we have to find a basic principle, so that we stop talking about our salary. This does not make sense.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask him if he thinks this is simply some kind of political pettiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to deal with a journalist's question by saying “This 10.8% increase over four years does not make sense. We will cancel it”.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The House resumed from March 23 consideration of the motion that Bill C-23, an act to establish the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development and to amend and repeal certain related acts, be read the third time and passed.
</p><A NAME="Int-1203756"></A><a HREF="#Int-1203895"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1203735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Van Loan (York—Simcoe, CPC): </b>Madam Speaker, this bill is a worthy symbol  of the Liberal government. The Department of Human Resources and the Department of Skills Development were separated a year and a half ago and Parliament is being asked to approve it only now. So much for treating Parliament with more respect and solving the democratic deficit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the bill simply because there is little point in opposing it, but let us consider what is missing. At a time when students are struggling with rising debt and Canada's economic competitiveness is lagging, the bill ignores the real issues while focusing instead on changing names on letterhead and reorganizing bureaucratic organization charts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill ignores the priorities that should be the focus of the government's attention in HRDC  or, as it is to become, HRSDC. Perhaps it already has become that because the government, it seems, even if we were to oppose it, would declare, as it did with the foreign affairs and international trade departments, that it does not matter what this House says, it will divide it anyhow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government is focusing on that kind of bureaucratic shuffling as the matter for us to attend to, there are other issues that should be attended to that are not. Our economic competitiveness is suffering while Canada's training strategy is woefully lacking. Students  are increasingly in debt. Employment insurance is still not resolved as an issue. Skills training, critical to economic growth and prosperity, is lagging and is ignored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have dreams for a better Canada, to have brighter futures through education, to enjoy the fruits of their labour through lower taxes, to live in a country that is free from corruption, to have a competitive economy  and to have the opportunity to improve their quality of life through advancement and improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However where are we under the government? Canada now ranks 15th in the world economic forum's global competitiveness rankings. Canada used to be ranked 4th, back when the Prime Minister was finance minister. From the 4th spot to the 15th spot in competitiveness  is the track record of the government while it is focusing on bureaucratic shuffles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same report from the world economic forum, Canada dropped on the technology index from 2nd place to 13th  place  and   dropped to 15th place in the business competitive index in 2004. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago  Canada was fifth on Transparency International's clean government index. That is an index that measures perceptions of how corrupt a government is in a country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today Canada has plummeted from 5th spot to 12th spot on that clean government index, and that was even before the Gomery commission started doing its work and hearing evidence. I do not think that this year's ratings are something to look forward to for Canadians. Perhaps in training the government might think of having a little more training in ethics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declining support for education and productivity is affecting our quality of life. In 1993, when Brian Mulroney retired as Prime Minister, the United Nations human development index ranked Canada the number one country in the world to live. By 2003, Canada had fallen to eighth place on that index. Simply put, taxes are too high in Canada. They are killing the incentive to be productive and they are making it difficult for hard-working families to invest in their futures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, Canada has the fifth highest income tax as a percentage of GDP of all the OECD countries. Since taking office, the amount of income tax revenue that the government takes in has almost doubled, increasing by 80%. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993, Canada has been tied for the lowest productivity growth in the G-7 and Canada's productivity has fallen to 84% of that of our American neighbours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Bill C-23 doing to handle this competitiveness gap, this productivity gap that's emerging, the declining standard of living? What is it doing to really help Canadians acquire better skills so we have a more educated and better equipped workforce to compete in the world? Nothing. Nothing in the bill addresses any  of those priorities, which are the real priorities of Canadians and should be the real priorities of this government and the human resources department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In skills training, what has the government done? Direct funding to colleges has been cut to the tune of 80% since the Liberals took office. Colleges are the best proven providers of workforce training. In fact, of those who graduate from the community college system, over 90% end up in jobs where they are contributing right after graduation.  This is  a 90% success rate.</p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when we look at the training programs in the human resources department, the evidence given by the minister at committee on estimates showed  that less than 50% of those who graduated from   the human resources EI training programs   found work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community colleges have a 90% success rate and the government cuts their  funding by 80%. The EI training program has  a 50% or less success rate and  the government begins to funnel money into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear to me that the way of approaching training in this country is very poorly equipped for the challenges of our current economy. It  is one that does not recognize success and one that in fact recognizes  and reinforces failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is  no focus in the bill on what is needed to stimulate economic growth and productivity through skills training, which  leads me to post-secondary education.  What has been the case for post-secondary education in Canada? Under the present  government we have not seen a serious effort to recognize that post-secondary education is critical to the success of our economy and to   our workforce to helping young people achieve their dreams for a brighter  future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest rates on student loans,   loans that are given to people who are trying to advance themselves and improve themselves, things we should be  encouraging people to do,   are at prime plus 2.5% to prime plus 5%. That is what the government is charging people who have taken out student loans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even bad risk lenders get around prime plus 1% from a bank or prime plus 2%. Why is the government running the student loan program as a profit making centre? Clearly there is no interest in being serious about support for post-secondary education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we still do not have a dedicated transfer for post-secondary education even after the Liberal government   cut program funding to colleges and universities in half  since taking office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we seen on employment insurance? Only thanks to the fact that this is a minority Parliament have we seen any action at all. It was only by attaching an amendment to the throne speech to deal with the flaws in employment insurance that the opposition parties finally forced a reluctant Liberal government to act on the matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What action have we seen? Sadly, very little. Currently,  EI has a $46 billion surplus that has been effectively stolen from workers and  diverted into other priorities, other than what they had contributed to. This is $46 billion of workers' and employers' premiums that have been taken away from them.  It is another regressive tax by the government applied to things that  do not do anything for economic growth and prosperity, that  do not help workers and employers and that  do not create jobs. It is   a tax that is slowing the economy and creating a drag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we get? We get a government that says it is doing something but it is still dithering. Virtually no changes have been made to the employment insurance system.  In everything the government does it simply goes  through the motions and dithers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is not taking action and through the bill what is it doing? It is simply reorganizing organization charts, printing new letterhead and sending out for new business cards because we are changing the name of the department. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the real priorities are ignored by the Liberal government.  It is unable to stop overtaxing through its unreasonable employment insurance premiums. It is unwilling to make training relevant, to create a competitive economy and to increase productivity.  It is unaware of the need to lower ridiculously high student loan interest rates. It is unremitting in its refusal to establish a dedicated transfer for post-secondary education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the bill does nothing for Canadians other than create a bureaucratic shuffle to support a cabinet shuffle in an effort to shuffle the scandal ridden HRDC name into the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the bill even on the table? It is very simple. It is because the government wants to get rid of the odour of the HRDC scandal.  That is what prompted the name change in the first place. That was an example of how the government could not manage the people's tax dollars and, in fact, took those tax dollars and diverted them to other improper, inappropriate partisan purposes.  Does that sound familiar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does nothing to benefit Canadians from the actual changes in the operation of government. It is only a public relations exercise to get rid of that HRDC name that is now so scandal tainted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  it will not work because the one thing   we can count on in the Liberal government is that as one scandal gets left behind, do not worry, there is another one coming along pretty soon to take its place.</p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1203895"></A><a HREF="#Int-1203931"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1203756"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague for his support. I do not look forward to the occasion when he will oppose us on some legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can all use statistics and I think constructive criticism is what this place is all about. I do not want to go through the various items that he put forward in great detail.  I would point out however that   the expression “brain drain” here in Canada, which only a very few years ago was a very common expression, brought great fear that we were losing talent from this country far more than we were bringing it in.  We do not hear it anymore and I believe one of the reasons for that  is the action taken in several of the areas that my colleague talked about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is with regard to post-secondary education.  I think if he did the calculation, he would discover that the moneys being spent now by the federal government are getting into the order of magnitude of the amount of money being spent by all the provinces combined in the area of post-secondary education which is traditionally viewed as an area of provincial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have greatly regretted, and I must be very careful how far I go on this, the fact that on a number of occasions, when the federal government has done something positive in the area of post-secondary education, various provinces have clawed back and have not followed-through.  So, I have some empathy with at least one of the things that he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member to comment on the origins of the legislation.  First, it is true that it sounds like a bureaucratic exercise, but in fact, it is an attempt to deliver better, and they should be delivered better, the sorts of services and programs that he has such great concern about.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the new streamlined department will do that more effectively for years to come.  However, the idea did not come from the government. It came from a standing committee of the House which unanimously recommended that the old department be divided.  The House and members of all parties supported the recommendation.  It was not something that the government initiated.  It was something that the House of Commons recommended and is being followed-through on by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he think that he should have gone  against the views of his party in committee and in the House of Commons at the time when this recommendation first appeared in this place?</p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1203931"></A><a HREF="#Int-1203960"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1203895"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Van Loan: </b>Madam Speaker, unlike my friend from Peterborough, I am handicapped by not having been here when the parliamentary committee dealt with that matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, having been a concerned Canadian like so many others, I recall what happened to the HRDC department.  I recall the scandal, the concern, and the conclusions that people drew, that it was a department that was out of control, that could not be managed, that was behaving entirely not in the best interests of Canadians, and that something had to brought to bear.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the fact that there would be a unanimous decision of a Commons committee that a department, so discredited by a scandal, required reform and change is not surprising at all.  In fact, I can understand entirely that there was a serious need for reform.  I hope that reform is taking hold and that it spreads to other parts of the government.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen ample evidence that perhaps that kind of reform in cleaning up of departments is not as contagious as we might like it to be in the government, but to me, it is not at all surprising.  I indicated that our party supports the legislation.  We do not oppose it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just that when we have so many things that are crying out to be addressed in this country to make our economy more productive, to improve our skills training, to make us more competitive, and to give us a workforce that can really compete where people really can advance themselves, where they can really live richer lives, that we spend our time on these kinds of questions, and these kind of basically bureaucratic internal department reorganization questions instead of focussing on those real priorities of Canadians.  That is what troubles me so much right now.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1203960"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204184"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1203931"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on this important issue: the creation of a new department called the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development. Obviously, the legislation creating this new department will ultimately split the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development into two departments. One of them will be called the Department of Social Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming weeks, this new legislation to create a new department will be discussed and debated, as will the legislation before us today, called the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Act, minus a portion of its budget and some of its responsibilities, which have been transferred to the Development of Human Resources and Skills Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois believes that the creation of this department will result in greater infringements in other areas of jurisdiction, not because of the creation of this department but because of the second part, which will be called the Department of Social Development Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That department will truly interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction relating to social affairs. Also,  the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development has failed to respond to criticism from Bloc Québécois about issues such as the power of the employment insurance commission. Furthermore, the Bloc's calls for changes to employment insurance have been ignored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This department will continue to administer the employment insurance fund. It is well known that this fund has a $46 billion surplus, which the government used to eliminate its deficit. So, instead of going to the unemployed, this fund went to fattening up the government, which is now flush. It is flush for other reasons too. I am referring to the fiscal imbalance. There is more than one surplus in the Liberal government's coffers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, we do not believe in the spectacle we are seeing today. I know  this department wants to project the image of a government concerned with the quality of life of its citizens and interested in helping them more on a daily basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain why the government wants to pass this new Human Resources and Skills Development legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 12, 2003, when the Prime Minister was being sworn in and introducing his new cabinet, he divided the former Human Resources Development Canada into two departments—as I was saying earlier—the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development and the Department of Social Development. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague from the Conservative Party was saying earlier, these departments already exist and today's bill is merely a formality. These departments have been operating for a year now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The press release issued by the PMO on December 12, 2003, included reasons justifying this division, the purpose of which, according to the government, was to strengthen our social foundations. </p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That same day, December 12, 2003, with the announcement of the creation of these two new departments, the office of the leader of the official opposition in Quebec issued a press release stating that the official opposition was unreservedly opposed to the establishment of a new Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, a Department of Social Development and a cities secretariat. These structures are useless to Quebec. They reflect the federal government's interference in Quebec's jurisdictions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new department created by the Prime Minister on December 12, 2003, includes more than 14,000 public servants responsible for managing $20 billion to strengthen the social foundations of Canada, build a 21st century economy and ensure Canada's role in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Human Resources and Skills Development no longer comes under the former Human Resources Development Canada, but is its own department, which also coordinates the activities of the Minister of Labour and Housing, and the Minister of State Human Resources Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, it is clear to us that the government intends, in fact, to manage all social development issues, to better manage our social foundations and better support the population. Finally, in the last election, this government did not understand the impact of its interfering attitude and encroachment in fields of jurisdiction. Quebec elected a strong majority of Bloc Québécois members in the latest election. Since 1993, this government has still not understood that the time  has come to stop its practice of strangling the provinces as they try to cope with serious responsibilities for providing  people with services they are entitled to expect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, students recently went on strike. They were demanding the right to continue receiving bursaries. We can easily see that Quebec's educational institutions are under-financed as well and that, since 1993-94, the federal government has been totally stingy in its transfer payments to provinces. It cut off funding to the provinces and solved the deficit problem here, in the federal government.  However, it reaped the surpluses from the employment insurance fund, with  the fiscal imbalance and the propensity to grab funds that rightfully should go to the provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Human Resources and Skills Development says that: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again we see that, if the government really knew what the labour market needed, it  would not be writing such hollow phrases that mean nothing, with goals that will not be met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now studying the EI employment programs. We are well aware that there are serious shortcomings in the implementation of these programs in Ontario and British Columbia.  They are not suited  to the needs of those who want to return to the labour market. We are well aware that the funding is often inadequate. There is no continuity in the federal government's commitment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore have serious questions to raise. We know that all kinds of  dirty tricks are being used to get us to understand better suited strategies, but still, they must meet the needs of the institutions and agencies working to get people back into the labour force. </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this bill, it is clear that the federal government's attitude is contrary to what has been requested. Very early on, in 1993, we could see that the Bloc Québécois was the one demanding that provincial jurisdictions be respected, so that the provinces could better provide for their   people. Now, public discontent is high in the other provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the federal government's arrogance and how it distributes this money, it is as if it owned the money, as if the government were generating and printing it. One would think the government was doing the people favours. Instead, it should respect the fact that, through their taxes, the taxpayers are allowing it to   redistribute the money among the people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore oppose this bill because it falls short of our expectations in terms of improvements to the overall EI system. Again, it is clear that  the quotes I read, which are from the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, are nothing but hollow words. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois  asked that $1.9 billion be reinvested in support for workers who lose their jobs, to improve  employment insurance fund eligibility coverage. This would allow coverage to rise from 55% to 60% of   salary, at an increased cost of $1.2 billion to the EI fund. Everyone is affected. There is only  55% coverage, and it has    dwindled over the years. That is how this extravagant $46 billion  surplus came to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have liked the eligibility threshold to be brought down to 360 hours, from the current 910 or 700 hours. We would have liked a return to a threshold that is much more flexible and suited to the reality of the labour market in certain regions. It is clear that, unless       confronted with job loss, there is no feeling of sensitivity from this government. We are talking about 90,000 unemployed people who are affected   by the high threshold for eligibility to benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have liked the benefit  rates to be based on the 12 best weeks. Again, improved EI benefits could have been provided to  470,000 unemployed persons, at a cost of  $320 million to the fund.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we would have asked for a maximum of 45 to 50 weeks of total EI benefit coverage, amounting to $11 million, and an increase in the  maximum insurable amount from $39,000 to $41,000.   That is an additional $245 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have added these amounts up for a total of $1.9 million.  Did the government have the means to pay this money out to those who had lost their jobs, to provide insurance for these people who had contributed to the employment insurance fund, in order to get better benefits for a longer period?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly these expectations were not met, because the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development proposed a mere $360 million in reforms, below the expectations of the Bloc Québécois.  We know full well that $46 billion is there.  This money accumulates year after year in the employment insurance fund.  The government puts billions of dollars annually back into the employment insurance fund.</p><A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the federal government's little stash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than meet these expectations, the government could have repaid the debt to those who have contributed to the employment insurance fund.  The federal Liberal government seems to have forgotten that this debt is outstanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could have begun repayment gradually.  Of course, no one expects the government to put the $46 billion back in the employment insurance fund and to increase benefits overnight.  Still, the return of $10 billion in annual payments of $1 billion might have been a possibility,  employment insurance benefits might have been improved.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of contribution to the employment insurance fund currently at $1.95 could be increased by 3 cents.  That way half of the $1 million could have been used to meet expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc has not proposed all these improvements to the employment insurance fund to improve its image.  We have been in touch with the people.  We have tabled 12 bills on this in the House.  Since 1993, the Bloc Québécois has been calling on the government to improve the employment insurance fund, which is a public disgrace.  People are now much more aware of the   impact of an arrogant federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provinces are on their knees before the federal government to get more in transfer payments.  The same thing happened with equalization payments.  We are waiting for the government to move.  It moves at its own pace, but arrogantly.  For example, when a province is on its knees begging from the federal government, often some slight concessions are made to ease things. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they want is to create a new department, a department with a social mandate, but such a department will not meet the expectations of the most disadvantaged members of society, the most vulnerable, the ones who are losing their jobs.  It is not true that there is a job for everyone today.  It is time to stop playing ostrich; some regions do not have economic activity 52 weeks a year.  Adjustments have to be made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is mention of the desire to adapt to the labour market.  Employment insurance must be properly administered.  It is a program paid into by its contributors, with not one cent in the EI fund coming from the federal government.  We know there is a surplus.  I can understand that they want to keep some money in reserve in case there is a deficit in the EI fund.  That is understandable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, considering that the employment insurance fund generated surpluses in excess of $46 billion, one wonders about the federal government's will to adequately support workers. They are the ones who need this insurance money to meet the needs of their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also has a huge impact on regional economies. Indeed, these people and their families spend increasingly less in their communities, because they do not have the money to  meet all their needs, whether it is food or  housing  needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affordable housing is another issue which I did not raise. During the election campaign, the federal government promised to invest an additional $1.5 billion to help those who cannot find adequate and safe housing. There again, the Liberal government did not meet expectations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the government is creating a social development department. We will discuss this at some other time. Today, I wanted to deal strictly with the employment insurance account. However, I am aware that there are other areas where the government boasts about wanting to meet public needs. But in fact, it does just the opposite. The government would rather use that money to increase its visibility in the provinces. The federal government also wants to establish contacts with community networks to show that it is the one, and not the provinces, that has the  money. This raises the whole issue of fiscal imbalance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government denies the following.</p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact,  71% of Quebeckers and 65% of Canadians now understand what the fiscal imbalance is all about. The fiscal imbalance is created by a situation where the federal government has too much money in terms of its responsibilities, while the provinces have less money because their taxation rate is greater than their responsibilities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank hon. members for listening to my comments. I will get back to the establishment of the new department of social development.</p>

Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker,  I always appreciate my colleague's remarks.  I do appreciate the time she puts into our committee work, both  in connection with Bill C-23 and in other matters, many of which she discussed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are debating Bill C-23,  legislation which redesigns a federal government department. The member  from the official opposition who spoke made the point that it was a  bureaucratic exercise. I do agree  that it is, but  I disagree with him in that I think it is a very important bureaucratic exercise, one which will ensure that all Canadians get better services from the newly designed department. I can give one simple example. The privacy provisions in the legislation which replace four or five different privacy codes and  which protect Canadians who are involved in employment insurance, Canada student loans or whatever it is, are better. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say to my colleague from the Bloc that in  Bill C-23  we are discussing the redesign of a department. I would repeat that  the standing committee  recommended this some years ago, and the House of Commons  unanimously supported the report of the committee to redesign this particular department, and the   Bloc supported that. We are carrying through with something the Bloc wanted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bureaucratic exercise. For example, my colleague mentioned provincial jurisdiction. There is no change in provincial jurisdiction. We have divided one department and created two more. The legislation does not affect the relationship between the federal government and the provincial governments at all. It is simply the same jurisdiction, the same services, but delivered in a different way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think through Bill C-23 that there is any impingement on provincial jurisdiction. It is simply better delivery of the same services in the same way as before. That is very important, in part because unanimously the House, including the Bloc, supported it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member mentioned EI. I know she is passionate about EI, but under the Standing Orders when a committee is given a bill to study, such as Bill C-23, it cannot increase expenditures associated with that legislation. It simply cannot. It cannot say that it will change the department, it will redesign the department, and by the way, it will add a billion dollars to EI or whatever it is. I know my colleague knows this, but I want her  to comment on that.  It is not possible through our process to change the things she was describing through Bill C-23.</p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

When one does not have the will, one surely cannot do anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were a deficit in the employment insurance fund, I might understand that the government did not have the means. However, it has $46 billion, which was taken from the employment insurance fund. Moreover, less than 50% of the unemployed  draw EI benefits. Consequently, the government could have made an extra effort. This is a futile exercise that was presented by the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development in terms of the assistance that  people had every right to expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they do not get assistance from the employment insurance fund, where do you think that people get assistance? When their head is in the sand, they get assistance from the provinces through welfare. When people want to receive welfare benefits,  they must be at the end of their tether. Consequently, they must have no money in their pockets or in the bank. At that time, they can go on welfare. This is putting people up against the wall.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why are we opposed to this bill? Because this is a very different situation: the splitting of a department in two. The second department will be called the Department of Social Development.  One of our reasons for   opposing the present bill is that we are against the establishment of such a department. Our expectations with respect to the employment insurance fund were not met. We know full well that the Canada Employment Insurance Commission is another small group. It will be continued and shall consist of four commissioners to be appointed by the governor in council.   The four commissioners shall be the deputy minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, who shall be the chairperson of the commission; an associate deputy minister, who shall be the vice-chairperson; a person appointed after consultations with organizations representative of workers and another person after consultations with organizations representative of employers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois was calling for something else, to better reflect the reality. We asked that the commission in question be comprised of the following members: the chairperson of the commission, the two deputy ministers or associate deputy ministers from Human Resources. Where it differs is that we called for seven employer and employee representatives.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted a more open commission, one that is not internally managed and that is more transparent. In fact, upon taking office, the prime minister himself said he wanted more transparency and that he would be more responsive. Again, the government   showed bad faith and, true to itself, it is continuing to do so with arrogance, claiming all powers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot give our support this time, because this is a very different situation from the one when the other bill was passed.  </p><A NAME="Int-1204236"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204252"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204207"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate my colleague from Québec for her excellent speech on this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like her to remind us that, apparently, some negotiations went on concerning this human resources department. However, we must never forget that the departmental concept that is proposed, particularly the Employment Insurance Commission, is the same as the one that was managing the former Department of Human Resources, where, believe it or not, $1 billion disappeared. That was the human resources scandal, because this money has not been found. This is the reality. The government was unable to find the billion dollars and is proposing  the same structure to manage the employment insurance fund, that is, the structure that lost $1 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the government is trying to lead us to believe that it is effectively dividing the department and that, consequently, everything will be better. No, it will not be better. This is why the Bloc Québécois opposes the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like my colleague to explain to us quite gently and calmly what the Bloc wants: the money that must go to the provinces should go to the provinces and the rest should go to the unemployed and   be managed by employers and employees sitting on one committee. This is quite simple. </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1204252"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204271"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204236"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Christiane Gagnon: </b>Mr. Speaker, I believe I was sufficiently clear. We want employees and employers to sit on this commission too. I do not understand this government's refusal to allow the contributors to sit on the commission. I cannot understand this business-as-usual attitude. This government has not learned a single lesson, even after the unemployed came here to testify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois shook things up with regard to the EI  fund. The Bloc Québécois did the work in an effort to improve the fund, and we said they had the means. However, all that time, the Liberal Party denied having several billion dollars—$46 billion—in surplus funds. That is astronomical. They are clearly arrogant since  they have continued to say, year after year, that they had the money. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the former Prime Minister, Jean Chrétien, saying in the House, “We will show the provinces that we can maintain the social programs”. I understand why he was able to say that, given the fiscal imbalance, slashed transfer payments to the provinces and, later, the employment insurance fund. I can understand why the federal government, which is swimming in surpluses, can be so arrogant and can force the provinces  to their knees. More than ever, we demand that   the EI fund be opened up to its contributors and that the government stop considering itself the beneficiary of this fund, which belongs to those who contribute to it. </p><A NAME="Int-1204271"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204293"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204252"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Saint-Maurice—Champlain, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, the time remaining to me will only permit me to get a start on what I want to say.  I can, however, take the time to congratulate my colleague from Québec on her excellent and instructive speech.  It is important to keep in mind just how inefficient the government over there is, and how lacking in imagination and honesty.   It was very kind of her to give the figure for the EI surplus as $45 or $46 billion, but in fact it has reached $54 billion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is taking possession of money that does not belong to it, and doing it with a smile.  If the man next door to me did that, he would end up in jail. Yet they are doing it with a smile.  Over the last ten years, the government has also pocketed $3 billion  belonging to seniors.  They want retroactivity, and are told it is not possible.  Retroactivity is possible when the government is owed money, but when the government is the one owing, there is no retroactivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes into the fund, but that is not the right word for it—since, according to some, the fund does not exist—but it does go somewhere, under some government budget heading.  They brag about it, calling it good administration.  I find it incredible that departments and structures are being created rather than helping those who are suffering from poverty and giving money back to those who are entitled to it. There have been 49,000 new jobs created in the federal government  over the past five years.  If you assume the value of one job and all the employee benefits to average out at $100,000 a year, we can imagine that this is money that was not used to help people who are living in poverty and suffering, or given back to the unemployed or the elderly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from February 25 consideration of the motion that Bill C-236, an act to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (student loan), be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-1204300"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204361"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204293"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Nathan Cullen (Skeena—Bulkley Valley, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on behalf of my colleague and the NDP with respect to this important bill on students loans and bankruptcy, Bill C-236. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, I would like to start with a few shocking numbers. In the House we have heard a number of times the current government of the day talk about how well it has done on behalf of students, particularly post-secondary students. The reality in terms of the numbers is otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Liberals took power, we have watched $4 billion cut out of core funding for post-secondary institutions and the average increase in student debt over that period rise by 110%.  The average debt for students leaving with bachelor degrees is now at $25,000. For students obtaining more than bachelor degrees, it is close to $100,000. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These numbers tell me there is a situation of dire need for university students leaving and entering post-secondary institutions.  I use this strong language of dire need because these people often represent  the greatest hope for our country in terms of their ability and capacity to formulate part of our economy, the investment the country needs to make consistently for Canada to become the world leader,  as the government would pretend us to be.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to post-secondary institution funding, the numbers speak for themselves.  Taking $4 billion out of core funding over the period the Liberals have been in office and then calling it a success story is an absolute embarrassment. It is a shame that the bill is even necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have now introduced legislation that suggests the way students can get out of bankruptcy is if they die.  It is most commendable on their part, but they should not be congratulated at all for their cynicism and approach in dealing with student debt and poverty. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They refuse to invest in education.  The numbers will roll out and the Liberals will talk about how wonderful they have been contrary to the real and anecdotal evidence we see by the number of students leaving university or being barred from them.  It is representative of a lack of courage on behalf of the government to tie any investments they have made in post-secondary institutions.  The money is passed to the provinces and in some cases they have been able to defer their contributions, leaving universities in the same dire strait.  That has caused tuitions to go up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the NDP government in British Columbia left office, the Liberal government  that took over immediately lifted the freeze on university tuitions.  This caused tuition fees to escalate and put them beyond the reach of many ordinary Canadians and their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to be leaders in the world and we use that language often in the House.  Yet by not investing soundly in post-secondary education, it leaves us behind the rest of the world, a world which knows that advanced technology and education will be the coming economies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at the numbers presented to me in terms of the debt load of students who are leaving university.  These moneys go to our financial institutions, primarily the large  banks, rather than go to where the economy  needs that investment.  The banks have been reporting record profit quarter after quarter.  They are doing exceptionally well.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure a lot of tears need to be shed for the banking institutions.  They have done well and no one should condemn them too much, given what they have produced in economic joys for their shareholders.    With regard to investing, the question becomes this.   Is the money better placed in the private banks and taken out of the hands of students so when they leave post-secondary education, they are required to pay these loans, which students are exceptional at doing? </p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we compare it to the corporate sector's ability to pay back and not default on loans, students have been consistently reported as good risks, if we can use that term. These students are no longer able to invest, put a down payment on a home, or purchase a car, when they are leaving their student life with a crippling debt. In the past 13 years the average student debt has gone up by $1,000 per year, every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, if such a similar increase and rapid expansion in debt were placed on our business community, the cries would be loud and far-flung across the House, but because it is students, there seems to be some notion that we can tolerate something like a 110% increase in tuition fees during the life of a government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to college, as many members of the House did. I had an excellent experience which afforded me better opportunities to seek good, sound, and well paid employment, yet I left with a burden of student debt that inhibited my ability to contribute more to the economy. It held me off for a number of years before I could start up my own private business and take an incurred debt and risk that is needed for just about every business venture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people ask why we should change the Bankruptcy Act when most Canadians, particularly most students, that enter into a loan arrangement with a bank have all the intention of paying that loan back in good faith. Students will often do whatever they can by just about any means necessary to pay these back. We need, in this House, to dispel the myths that students are bad investments or that they are at great risk of defaulting on loans when the numbers are absolutely showing the opposite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to recognize the contribution that universities make across this country to their local communities and that those students make to the local communities as well. We must truly see them in terms of an investment, no different than the investments that we consistently find room to make in terms of the auto sector, large industries, or border security.  All of these investments that we seem to come to the conclusion are sound investments for the prosperity of this country, yet, the government continues to dither on promise after promise made to the people of Windsor to improve their border situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the government and the Prime Minister, and the former finance minister, understand the principle of investment.  The Prime Minister understands that lowering the costs for business that he previously ran by moving it offshore was a sound and wise move for the profitability of his business. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet. when we talk about the investment needed for students in this country, the House stalls and stutters, and pretends to pat itself on the back for issuing such ideas as small investment in students that may be born today that will achieve a $5,000 perhaps $7,000 grant available to them 18 years from now. At the current rate of increase in tuition, putting it out of the hands of most ordinary Canadians, what will that look like 15 or 20 years from now? What will the proposal that the Liberals have brought forward actually do for students? I hesitate to think that it may get them through their first semester, if that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 the Liberals changed the act to say that Canadians cannot receive bankruptcy protection for student loans until 10 years after they complete their studies. This is unfair. This special treatment of students is the absolute opposite of the message that this government should be sending to our young people. Our message should be that we trust them, that we believe in them, and that we are willing to invest in them. Surplus after surplus has shown up for the Liberal Party because of its miscalculations on the budget. The Liberals are exceptionally skilled at missing the mark over and over again, regardless of how many economists they bring on board. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in all of these surpluses and particularly this surplus year, the Canadian Federation of Students, and other advocacy groups for students, found the budget not only wanting and lacking but an absolute failure when it came to investing in students. Even in the face of a huge surplus beyond everyone's expectations and combined with all the rhetoric that we heard during the last election, and consistently in the House about the need to support students, there is still a continued cynical lack of support for students by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate this bill. It is a strong bill. We look for the bill to be supported throughout the House.</p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1740)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I must say that the Bloc Québécois is in favour of Bill C-236. It is thus in favour of reducing from ten to two years the period of time during which a former student cannot be released, through bankruptcy, from the reimbursement of his debts relating to student loans. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislative change will specifically assist the least  fortunate among former Quebec and Canadian students and will restore a balance between the moral duty to reimburse the state for the loans and the right to be  released from their debts through bankruptcy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois considers that the ten year period, which affects only former students, is too long and is thus a discriminatory measure that is uncalled for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is aware that bankruptcy must not become an easy way for students to be released from their debts. However, it is unfair to deny this relief to former students who are really in need.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of the fiscal imbalance created by the federal government that Quebec and the provinces now have to increase tuition and change the bursary and loans programs. These measures have a direct impact on the level of student debt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing former students to clear their student debt by declaring bankruptcy does help the least fortunate Quebeckers and Canadians, but does not provide a sustainable funding solution for the post-secondary education system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government's lack of vision and willingness to significantly increase education transfers is a clear indication of how much it prefers visibility measures such as the millennium scholarships over truly beneficial measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing the timeframe in which a former student cannot declare bankruptcy to clear their debt would help reduce the financial pressure on the poorest in our society, people who, upon finishing school, do not find gainful enough employment to pay back their loans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in Quebec—by virtue of a social choice that distinguishes us from the other Canadian provinces—the average student debt is less than in the other provinces, this does not change the fact that some students are burdened by debt they are unable to pay off. The proposed measure would allow students to benefit, with a very reasonable limit, from the same right as other people, and that is to clear their debt by declaring bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-year period proposed in Bill C-236 is short enough so as not to hurt lower income former students. There does need to be a certain period where the student must try to make arrangements to fulfill their financial obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to point out that student debt is a major contributing factor to the drop in Quebec's birth rate. Debt overload discourages thousands of Quebec students from starting a family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has two major flaws. First, it does not include any measure to hold students responsible for fulfilling their financial obligations and using their loans appropriately. Obviously, students are not irresponsible and there is no reason to believe they do not manage their money as well as other individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, measures to raise student awareness of the use of loans and of repayment terms would have added value to what Bill C-236 proposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the bill is not providing any real answers to the underfunding problem of post-secondary education systems. The fiscal imbalance that is continuing to choke Quebec and the provinces is the primary reason why students get into debt. A substantial increase in direct transfers to Quebec and the provinces is the best way to  curb student debt and ensure quality education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1990s, federal transfers for post-secondary education have dropped dramatically. Even the Canadian Association of University Teachers came to the conclusion that the weakening of the provinces' ability to fund post-secondary education is primarily due to the reduction in federal transfer payments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the member for LaSalle—Émard became Minister of Finance, Ottawa paid 1.7¢ on every dollar of revenue into the transfers for education and social services. When he left his position, nine years later, Ottawa was paying only 1¢ on every dollar of revenue. This represents a 40% decrease. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal contribution to total expenditures in education and social programs is now less than 12%.</p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1745)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois wants the issue of fiscal imbalance resolved, which would mean a substantial increase in funding available to post-secondary education. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the consensus of the provincial premiers, the Bloc Québécois wants federal funding to be 25% of the total expenditure on education and health care by 2009-2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Quebec system of education is short of resources as the result of cuts in transfer payments, a lack of funding, a shortage of teachers and so, despite the monumental efforts of the Government of Quebec with the meagre resources at its disposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec, the FEUQ, and the Canadian Federation of Students are also critical of the federal government's refusal to increase transfer payments for post-secondary education by $4 billion to offset the cuts during the 1990s.  This money would have allowed Quebec to expand its manoeuvring room in order to reinvest in universities, and the rest of Canada to reduce tuition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I want to reiterate the Bloc Québécois's support for this bill so students can start their working life in a respectable fashion, and I invite the other parties to support it.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1204388"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204438"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204361"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker,  Bill C-236 proposes a substantial change to the existing rules respecting the treatment of student loans in bankruptcy.  It is therefore essential that we do a thorough assessment of the proposals that are being made to make a proper determination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present rule is that an individual  who goes bankrupt cannot have his or her student loan debt discharged unless at least 10 years have passed since he or she was last enrolled.  This is in sharp contrast to the rule applicable to the debts which are typically discharged nine months after assessment in bankruptcy has been filed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10-year rule was introduced in 1998 following a period in which losses to the Canada student loans program through personal bankruptcies had risen greatly.  Many of these bankruptcies were occurring shortly after the individual left school.  This type of behaviour represented a risk to the viability of the Canada student loans program.  Indeed for the 1995-96 year alone, the fiscal cost of bankruptcies involving student loans totalled more than $100 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then the cost of bankruptcies has been reduced dramatically.  In 2000-01, the last year where complete data is available, the cost of bankruptcies to the Canada student loans program  was only $5.8 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While curbing the potential scope of abuses under the bankruptcy system, the government proceeded with vast improvements to the financial assistance to a student under the Canadian opportunities strategy, including improved access to the Canadian studies grant program, the investment of $2.5  billion in Canada millennium scholarships, a tax credit on student loan repayments,  extension of interest relief periods, and the  introduction of the debt reduction in repayment measure. These measures have been designed to provide students in financial need with viable alternatives to declaring bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the interest relief program it is now possible to go five years after leaving school without being required to make a payment on a student loan.  During that time the Government of Canada bears the cost of interest on that loan. In 2001-02 over 140,000 Canadians took advantage of these generous provisions at a cost of $77 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, for borrowers  who  still experience financial difficulties after interest relief measures have been used up, there is then an actual debt reduction mechanism available allowing the borrowers  to permanently dispose of over $26,000 in student loan debt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also stress that the government has stayed on top of this issue.  It has responded to the concerns regarding these support measures.  In the last three years alone the budgets have contained measures to extend relief or to make relief measures more accessible to people experiencing hardships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some may argue that students are unfairly singled out, it is clear from these details that the Canada student loans program is quite generous to those legitimately facing financial problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also respect the fact that student loans are made available based upon  a  drastically different basis than a consumer loan.  There is no examination of credit worthiness of the borrower.  No collateral is required.  The loans are interest free during the study periods.  The schedule of repayment is flexible and accounts for the financial situation of individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these mechanisms available, there is some question as to the need for further relief through the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  It is reasonable to assume that any provisions for discharge of student loans must show coordination between the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the provisions of the Canada student loans program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-236 creates unnecessary overlap  between the relief  provisions of the Canada student loans program and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that there are relief measures available short of bankruptcy. Should those not be used as the first step?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the bill therefore does not reflect existing relief measures, preferring rather to simply dismiss the debt when other options exist.  This poses a very real risk to many students who take a few years to truly develop their full earning potential. It is at that point that their ability to pay becomes more certain and a fuller assessment of the appropriate relief can be made. The bill before us would bypass the measures in place to assist borrowers in favour of walking away from the debt entirely.</p><A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-236 would result in substantial financial cost to the government. In addition to loans financed directly, there are risk shared loans which could affect a large number of people as well. These risk shared loans are funded directly by financial institutions with a risk sharing mechanism which brings in government. The change proposed would likely require contractual agreements and additional compensation to those lenders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the effect only at the federal level. Provincial student loans programs are also captured by the present rules so any change would result in any further levelling of costs there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to tell  members of the House that in keeping with the ongoing improvements that have been made to this program, we are reviewing the bankruptcy discharge provisions in the existing legislation. This follows on consultations across the country  held by Industry Canada with the participation of a wide range of stakeholders, including student representatives, as well as a more recent report on solvency law issues by the Senate Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. That report recommended a reduction in the discharge period to five years and perhaps less in cases of hardship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building on this input, officials of both Industry Canada and HRSDC are now examining the many comments and the existing provisions to ensure the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Canada student loans program are properly integrated and reflect a fair and reasonable standard of discharge for student loans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the government wants to stress that the period of discharge of student loans must properly take into account measures under the Canada student loans program, the relief available, the continued Liberal access to loans and the costs associated with bankruptcies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, Bill C-236 does not do that. As a result, it fails to provide a fair and reasonable alternative to current provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act pertaining to student loans. The government cannot support Bill C-236.</p><A NAME="Int-1204438"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204451"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204388"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's South—Mount Pearl, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker,  after listening to the representative of the governing party, I must say that I am surprised that the Liberals are going to further study the issue.  What else is new?   The government  cannot make a decision on it so it will study it and somewhere down the road it will make a decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not good enough. Despite what the member says, despite the minuscule changes that have been made to assist students, many students in the country are coming out of post-secondary education institutions with a millstone around their necks, with extremely high debt loads which they just cannot handle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer certainly is not bankruptcy. In very few cases students have to resort to declaring bankruptcy;  I understand it is somewhere in the range of 2%.  To hear people talk one would think that if we allowed students to declare bankruptcy, there would be a lineup, that they would get a student loan, get an education and declare bankruptcy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students get an education.  They understand  the implications of declaring bankruptcy.  They understand the onus on them to repay their loans. Consequently, the only time we see bankruptcy happen is when there is severe strain on the student.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the member is willing to move to two years to five years. If that is the case we certainly have no problems agreeing with that piece of legislation and will support it. The student could then  assess his chances in the future. Some people who have a post-secondary education do have a hard time  finding  worthwhile employment. Sometimes it depends on the geography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great country of ours  is rich in resources and  has tremendous potential. The government should  realize that in order to develop this potential and turn the economy of the country around,  we need people to do it.  We need people with an education.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is not cheap.  I hear too many people say that tuition is not that bad.  It varies from province to province.  Tuition in my province probably is one of the cheapest, fortunately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us whose children are in post-secondary education, or have been recently, know that education in this country is not cheap.  It is not just the tuition.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some  students live near the university or the post-secondary institution and can walk to school,  come home for dinner  and stay under their parents'  roof where mom and dad pay the bills. Those  students  have the family car to go to  after hours activities.  In those cases  the cost  to a degree is borne by the parents. In those cases   the students would not have a heavy debt load, but the costs of books and tuition are heavy enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students from the rural areas have to come in to the university or post-secondary centres. They need to get  an apartment, which has to be furnished. They need to buy    food,  to arrange travel not only back and forth to the institution, but also back and forth to home. Throw in all the other costs besides and it more than doubles the cost of their education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge anybody to add up the costs of  educating an individual who comes from an outside area. If that person can be sent to  university for less than $15,000 a year, that student is eating a lot of Kraft dinner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is not free; it is not even cheap.  What are we doing?  The government has done absolutely nothing to improve the accessibility to education.  It turns people away from getting an education.</p><A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming out of post-secondary education with a debt load is one thing as long as the student gets a good job, and most people who come out of post-secondary institutions usually do get good jobs.   They will eventually surface, but students come out with a millstone around their neck. Their hands are tied for years.   That house, that car, all the things that young people need and would love to have, need to be put aside because of their debt load.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorrowful thing, the worst part of it all, is the young person who looks at the cost of education, whose family perhaps cannot assist their children because of the cost of education and because of the economy in many of our rural areas. This also applies to many urban families.  He or she knows that even if they borrow the maximum student loan, it does not cut it.  There is a gap. If that gap cannot be filled there is one option and that option is for them not to go to school at all.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our young people, realizing the burden they will put on their families, realizing the debt load they will face themselves when they get out,  or realizing that in most cases halfway through they will have to call it quits, realizing all of this, they do not go.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the investment we as a country have to make in people who cannot find long term employment.  Let us look at the social costs, the unemployment insurance costs, the social welfare costs and the social housing costs.  Let us look at the other related problems.  Sometimes when people get frustrated their mental and physical health deteriorate so there are health care costs as well. I could go on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge anybody to compare two young people, one who gets an education, even with some debt load, and one who does not get an education.  The individual with the education contributes for the rest of his or her life by paying taxes, buying furniture, buying houses and buying cars, which in turn creates more employment and pours more money into the government as a result of their taxes. That individual is  contributing to society, while society, in most cases, has to look after the person  who does not get an education.   It is a no-brainer.  We invest a little up front to help a student get an education or we pay a heavy price down the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for the government to wake up. Instead of making excuses on an issue like this, on helping a student get out from under this cloud of bankruptcy, the government should be putting its money where its mouth is. If a modification were made to the bill to move it to five years as a test for now to see how that would work, that would be quite reasonable and it is something we could support.</p><A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1204451"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204479"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204438"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on Bill C-236.  The member for Halifax should be commended for once again championing a cause that I think often gets lost in the wilderness, as it has with this government in particular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is related to fairness, equity and justice.  That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about students being treated differently from other segments of society.  The member for Halifax has eloquently pointed that out in her bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to read the preamble to the bill so that people understand both what we are talking about here and also the modest changes we are looking at, which are so important.  The summary of the bill states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This enactment amends the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to reduce, from ten to two years after a bankrupt leaves school, the period of time during which an order of discharge does not release the bankrupt from the reimbursement of his or her student loan.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Halifax essentially summarizes it with the following statement, which is very good.  This is what the member said in the chamber:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>It is a tragic irony and it is heartbreaking. It is so important for the discrimination that now exists in our insolvency legislation to end as it relates to students. That is what we are talking about today. Others who become bankrupt, whose circumstances beyond their control have driven them into the situation of financial disaster where bankruptcy is an option, are eligible to apply for bankruptcy protection after two years. However, the government has removed that protection from the student population who have indebted themselves because of the inadequacy of the student aid programs in the country and particularly because of the withdrawal of any meaningful support from the federal government. They are in the position where they are not eligible for such bankruptcy protection for 10 years.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are talking about here is allowing a fairness to re-emerge that was taken away and stripped from students.  It was stripped from them by this government.  The government has chosen other options on where to put the money of this country, money that could have gone to education and thus avoided a bill of this nature coming forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that there are 18 other OECD countries that have free post-secondary education and tuition.  I do not know whether Canada will eventually get there, but certainly right now we do not have to continue to throw the entire debt for education onto young people, especially in a free market system that makes it difficult for them to actually get sustainable employment to pay off that investment and also start a family, live in dignity and save for their future retirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell members that when I first came here in 2002, after being elected in a byelection, a reporter came to my house and interviewed me about a number of different things.  The reporter asked me what I was going to do with all the money I was going to be making.  I said that the first thing I would do is pay off my student loan.  That is what we did over the next couple of years.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I are a typical family.   We have two children and we were late in our thirties when we paid off our student debt.  We delayed having a family because we wanted to feel some type of economic security.  We slowly fixed up our house, but at the same time we paid incredibly high interest rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to note that the interest rates this government takes off the backs of students are terribly high and unacceptable.  It is predatory behaviour and the government should be ashamed of it. Let us think about the fact that people can get a car loan for zero per cent and furniture loans for zero per cent while this government charges prime plus 5%.  It is scandalous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what happens to those who have invested in their education, those who are trying to pay back their loans responsibly and do not want to go into bankruptcy. The previous speaker touched on a very important point, that is, as educated people they do not want to leave the victory of post-secondary education and obtaining a degree and then have to capitulate to a very humbling and troubling chapter in one's life, that  of declaring bankruptcy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody wants that.  Nobody wants that  on their credit rating.  Nobody wants to go to their family and say that they cannot pay back their loan, that they borrowed money to be successful.  They do not want that. People want to be able to reasonably pay back the investment, not only for themselves but for their country and the investment it made in them, so that we can all be successful. This predatory interest rate leads to the bankruptcy issues and puts people into desperate situations.  It is unacceptable.  </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1805)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also hurts our economy. It is great for the banks and great for the government. They make out all right. There is no problem there.  But in my hometown, for example, an auto industry town, this debt load delays purchases of new vehicles. The auto workers pay a lot of money in taxes. They put a lot of money into the  United Way. They put it into sending their kids back to school. They contribute to the community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, ironically, it is  this government that wants to do a voluntary emission standard for the auto industry. One of the most important things we can do right now is get some of the oldest vehicles off the road and the newer ones on the road. That will lower Kyoto emissions. It will do both: create jobs and lower Kyoto emissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the government do? It hacks away at students because it can. The government continues to treat them as serfs instead of valuing what they have done and helping them contribute into a formula that means success for all of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unbelievable that a person can get a house loan at a rate that is lower than that for paying back a student loan. Where is the responsibility of the government  to take action where it can, with the stroke of a pen? This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently had a meeting at our local college. College students are funded at a level that is different  from the level for university students. It was interesting, because the message from the minister of community and social services, a Liberal in Ontario, was that the colleges had  better talk to the federal government because it has the surpluses and Ontario has less money. Ontario has a $23 billion deficit in terms of transfer payments. That was Ontario's solution at the time: to send it back here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the federal government do in the last budget? It had almost $5 billion in corporate tax cuts. It was no problem at all to do that. The government found the money. The Prime Minister said during the last election that he would address post-secondary education and that gap. What has he done instead?  A vote? No, they are  Liberals, they say they are closer to the New Democrats and scared of the  Conservatives, but what did he do when he got here? There was another corporate tax cut. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another corporate tax cut, but what do students get? If a student is deceased, the government will no longer let the collection agencies go after the deceased. It will forgive the debt at that point. If a student is deceased and owes money, he or she will not have to pay back the student loan. Congratulations, I say, what a significant achievement for post-secondary education. I am sure it matches election rhetoric. Promise made and promise broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing to our young population is unacceptable,  especially when they need more education than ever before and there is a changing market in front of them. They often have to return to school before they can even pay off the investment on  their original education. They are expected to pay for that, not their companies or anybody else, when they have to go back to get those re-qualification credentials for changing standards because of downloading or other governments adding different layers of responsibility for employment through legislation. They have to pay for that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ends up happening is that people come out of school later. They have a higher debt load. They marry later. They have kids later. They defer buying a home until later. What will be really critical later on for the young people of today is that they will have less pensionable earnings and savings because they cannot get by as it is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are stopped from  buying a house earlier. They are stopped from putting money into their retirement savings plans. They are less likely than ever before to find a company to be with for a good portion of their lives and thus have pensions that will be sustainable.  It is a real problem. We are deferring all of that until tomorrow. We are putting it on the backs of today's youth because this government cannot make modest changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving the bill forward in the House of Commons today would deal with the more desperate cases. We could say to young people that they could start their lives over again. Nobody wants to go through the personal humiliation of admitting that  they have to start over in what they want to do with their lives  and they cannot pay back what has been given to them. They do not want to do that.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I encourage all members of the House to support the bill, because it is the one thing we can do to give young people something to get them back on track. They can be great contributors to Canada, put their education to better use and be more productive citizens for the long haul.</p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1204479"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204497"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204451"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Roger Valley (Kenora, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act is one of Canada's key marketplace framework laws promoting both economic and social stability.  Indeed, it is unique in its dual economic and social orientation encouraging commerce and entrepreneurship while ensuring that vulnerable individuals have a means of dealing with unmanageable debt. The statute has been crafted to reflect the balance between these orientations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act balances the risk between creditors and debtors in determining how shortfalls will be allocated and setting out the circumstances under which a fresh start is warranted. It encourages the payment of debts while allowing well-intentioned but unfortunate debtors a means of eliminating their debt loads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been argued in the House that former students face crushing debt loads without the recourse to bankruptcy offered to other debtors.  It is argued that individuals with student debts are unfairly hampered by the bankruptcy system, forced to live with debt levels that would otherwise qualify for bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that these arguments present only half the picture.  It is true that student loans are not easily discharged under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act  but bankruptcy is a last option, not a first option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before condemning the rules and changing them, we must understand the rationale for their creation. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act was amended in 1998 after careful consideration by Parliament to stem the increasing option of declaring bankruptcy rather than paying student loans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years leading up to the amendments, losses to the Canadian student loans program due to bankruptcies were becoming unsustainable. For the fiscal year 1995-96 alone the cost of losses due to bankruptcy was more than $100 million. Losses of that magnitude threatened the viability and the continued existence of that program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at the statistics suggest that bankruptcy was being treated as a first option by student loan holders.  Many of the bankruptcies were filed shortly after the former student left the school and before any effort was made to repay the loans. Bill C-236 would encourage a return to this sort of behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act was changed in 1998 to discourage students from taking the plunge into bankruptcy but it does not work in a vacuum.  It works in tandem with the Canadian student loans program which is constantly being improved.  For example, in the recent budget the government announced plans to improve the debt forgiveness provisions applicable to students who face the most serious hardships, including those who suffer permanent disabilities, while repaying their loans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada student loans program has evolved to ensure the mechanisms are in place to help individuals in financial distress, including interest free periods and debt forgiveness.  Student loan debtors do not have to resort to bankruptcy. They can look to the student loans program and seek relief there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bankruptcy is still available for people in need.  Individuals with student  debt can opt to seek bankruptcy protection and have their non-student loans forgiven. This combined with the interest relief and debt forgiveness provisions of the Canada student loans program is sufficient to allow must students with debt troubles to become financially stable and capable of paying their loans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone suffers from continued hardship and remains unable to pay his or her loans, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act allows a person to obtain a discharge on hardship grounds. To obtain such a discharge, the person must have demonstrated good faith in dealing with the loans and that the financial hardship will likely continue over the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be certain, obtaining a hardship discharge is not easy but it should not be easily obtained. Student debt holders must not be encouraged to opt for bankruptcy until the option for bankruptcy is the only possible route.  They should take advantage of the  protective measures offered by the student loan program and attempt to pay their debts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is economically responsible behaviour and it is socially responsible behaviour. It is economically responsible because it ensures that those who benefit from the loans make reasonable efforts to pay them back and socially responsible because paying one's debts back is a good thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments ensure easy access to loans in order to allow people to pursue a goal of education but we must not forget the taxpayers ultimately pay the cost of losses due to bankruptcy. Student loans are funded through tax dollars. Allowing easy access to bankruptcy and making that option more attractive than repaying loans unfairly increases the burden on the taxpayer. </p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1815)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easier access to bankruptcy, as contemplated by Bill C-236, also poses a threat to future students. We have seen what easier access to bankruptcy did in the past, leading to massive losses to the student loans program and threatening its continued existence. The program is an essential one, designed to benefit Canadians today and in the future. If people are allowed to abuse the system, taking money out of it without any repayment, the system will not likely be sustainable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it fair to allow former students to take the easy way out at the expense of taxpayers? No, it is not. Allowing students to pursue bankruptcy as an option only two years removed from school is an unsound prospect. It does not encourage former students to pay their debts or to use the debt repayment portion of the Canadian student loans program. It does not provide sufficient time to assess whether the individual will be able to capitalize on his or her education and earn a good living, nor does it provide time to accurately assess whether the individual will be able to pay back the money borrowed from the taxpayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is not free. It is a valuable resource and one that must be worked for and respected. Loans are provided for prospective students with the understanding that they will be repaid. The student loans program provides people with the time to start their post-study lives and build their careers before requiring them to pay the interest or repay their loans. We should encourage people to use these methods rather than opting for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act should not happen in a vacuum. It should be handled as part of a comprehensive reform that is capable of ensuring continued balance within the statute and its relationship to other statutes. Changing this provision would throw off the balance and create disharmony between it and the Canada student loans program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is currently reviewing the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and is preparing legislative reform options. The issue of student loans is being carefully considered and should be handled in the context of a comprehensive reform rather than a stand alone item. The government cannot support Bill C-236.</p><A NAME="Int-1204497"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204499"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204479"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would be  happy to make closing remarks, but I was wondering, in view of the fact that there are five more minutes,  if I could   ask the hon. member who   just spoke  a couple of questions.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would have asked  the member from Kenora who just presented his comments is why he insists upon viewing the problem that our students face, with crippling debt and  skyrocketing tuitions, as a problem that should be characterized, as he did, as students who borrow from the taxpayer and  then do not adequately honour their debts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That absolutely sums up what is so utterly and  totally bankrupt, both financially and morally, about the Liberal government's approach to post-secondary education funding, in particular to supporting students and  making it possible for them to pay their tuition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any modern industrial society that does not understand that post-secondary education is an investment in the future is doomed to be a society that lives up to its potential, never mind being able to compete with all the other industrial nations that do  invest. In fact most OECD countries have tuition free post-secondary education systems because they understand the value. They understand the difference between a loan from the taxpayers and an investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want  to thank all members who participated in the debate. I do not have time  to review all of the comments but  I want to thank my colleagues, the member for Skeena and the member for Windsor West who, I think, are the two youngest members of our caucus, but  am not sure about that. They understand perhaps better than some of us who have been around a little longer how really serious this problem is for their generation and the students coming along behind. They are at  that stage in their life when they are busy getting on with it and when they see others coming along behind them who find that they are crippled with debt, they understand what it means. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students are forced to drop out of school or are not able to attend  a college  and university in the first place. If they do get there, the quality of their educational experience is eroded because they have to struggle with part time jobs in order to put food on the table. In this day and age, imagine what a commentary this is on how pathetic the government's commitment is to post-secondary education funding when students have to spend time organizing food banks on college and university campuses these days. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was disappointing, after listening carefully, to hear the  comments made by government members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get into that, I   also appreciate the fact   that both of the other opposition parties definitely  understood  the severity and the magnitude of the problem that faces  today's post-secondary education students.  I  welcomed their  indication that they were prepared to vote to see that this bill goes before committee. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to use my final moment to plead with government members  to say that this is not a bill that pretends to solve all the problems. It does not propose a comprehensive solution to what has been 13 years of problems created by the government by the systematic erosion of funding and the failure, even in the most recent budget, to return post-secondary core funding to the level that it was in 1993 when the Liberals came to office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the bill would  not solve all the problems. It deals  with a very narrow particular problem, a problem of last resort   for students who say that  they do not know what else to do but to declare bankruptcy under the terrible financial circumstances they find themselves in.</p><A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turn to that and find they are actively and aggressively discriminated against by a perverse change in the law introduced by the government in 1998 because it said that students were going bankrupt left, right and centre. Would one not think that would have been the canary in the mine syndrome to tell the government it should stop heaping the debt on students, which causes them to have to contemplate bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know my time is up, but I plead with government members to send this to committee so we can improve upon it.  It is not cast in stone.  We have indicated that  we are prepared to look at some flexibility, not to say it is absolutely two years or nothing.

I asked her to explain the government's plan to deal with the problem of people running the border into Canada in their cars and even on foot.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question itself was not critical of the government.  It was not overtly partisan.  It is a question that concerns MPs from all four parties, including the governing party, whose ridings lie along the U.S. border. It addressed an issue that has been frequently reported on in the newspapers for months. I posed the question with the safety and security of border guards as my paramount concern. Of course the integrity of the border is also a national security issue and, therefore, of major concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should note in addition that as co-chair of the all party border caucus, my goal is to contribute to the work of the Canadian administration on border issues, not to bash the administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a clear gesture of goodwill and to elicit a helpful response, I sent the Deputy Prime Minister advance notice of the question so she would have an opportunity to inform the House as to how this obvious and alarming problem would be dealt with in the coming weeks and months.  I believe  anyone who heard the Deputy Prime Minister's answer would say that she did not get to the heart of the matter. She was unable to explain what specifically was being done to crack down on those running the border.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fairness, the minister was unable to provide her full reply in the House at that time.  Her assistant was gracious enough to provide the balance to me, and I would like to quote the relevant portion of that response for the record.  She stated:  “The CBSA (Canadian Border Services Agency) takes any allegation of potential breach of security very seriously and investigates all allegations.  We have also invested $125 million in federal funding to establish RCMP-led Integrated Border Enforcement Teams along the Canada-U.S. border to harmonize border security efforts of Canadian and U.S. law enforcement”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, let me be clear that the RCMP integrated border enforcement teams are a long overdue and necessary element of border security.  I do not think anyone questions that.  However, those teams are not operating full time at numerous border crossings right across Canada, where people are running borders in their cars. They are not operating full time at the Peace Arch crossing in my riding where people are simply walking across the border within sight of the border posts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not fault the integrated enforcement teams for that.  That is simply not their mandate. Who is supposed to deal with these violations?  The border services guards cannot.  They have no authority to apprehend anyone more than 100 feet away from their posts.  They are also unarmed. Protocol requires that border services call in the RCMP to apprehend the border runners.  However, even if the police can respond within minutes, the runner is often long gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim that the CBSA investigates all such allegations may be true, but what can it do about the problem?  What good is an investigation if there will never be a resolution to the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I ask my question.  We have a growing problem.  What specifically is the minister planning to do about border runners?  At this point, the government has four minutes to respond, and I would hope the minister will take this opportunity to share what plans there are to deal with this growing problem.</p><A NAME="T1830"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1830"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1830)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1204555"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204577"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I rise to answer the question raised by the  hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Cloverdale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Deputy Prime Minister already indicated in the House, there are actually two components to the member's question. The first deals with the safety of the Canada Border Services Agency's officers on the front lines and the second is about port runners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure members  that the government is committed to the safety of our front line officers.  Their safety and security are our highest priority. A positive and safe work environment protects employees and leads to enhanced security measures and service delivery.  To that end we have completed risk assessments in all customs locations.  The “Job Hazard Analysis -  Working Alone Strategy” was commissioned in part to look at ways in which the agency could improve working conditions for its employees and improve security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot discuss the specific criteria used to determine the level of risk for each site because it would compromise the safety of employees and the security of the agency's operations. I can assure members that the agency's front line officers have all the training and the tools they need for their safety and security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job hazard analysis strategy is a work in progress and has been in development for some time.  The agency is working on this matter with the union at the local and national levels and has shared the strategy with them through the national health and safety policy committee.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in the recent budget, considerable funding has been allocated to matters of security.  The additional funding will make it possible to provide training and protective tools and to take other steps to reduce risks for officers working alone.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact in budget 2005, $433 million was allocated to the Canada Border Services Agency over five years to build capacity and further enhance the safe and efficient movement of goods and people across our borders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention that over the past four years the government has spent over $9 billion on enhancing the security of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant investments have been made to facilitate the flow of goods and people across the Canada-U.S. border while keeping it closed to criminals and terrorists. The Canada Border Services Agency has worked closely with the United States and our law enforcement partners to ensure that the border remains secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also invested $125 million in federal funding to establish RCMP led integrated border enforcement teams along the Canada-U.S. border to harmonize border security efforts of Canadian and U.S. law enforcement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address the second issue, that of border runners, to which the hon. member referred in his question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring the security of our borders is the CBSA's number one priority.  We share the longest undefended border in the world. The Canada Border Services Agency works closely with its counterparts in the United States to make sure that the border remains secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All persons wishing to enter Canada are obligated to stop and report to the CBSA.  Anyone who does not is liable to a fine and/or imprisonment under the Customs Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year approximately 71 million persons were processed by the agency at land border ports of entry.  The vast majority of people  and  businesses comply with the law and we work hard to facilitate compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency works  hard with local law enforcement. We continue to see this as a priority area.</p><A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1835)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1204577"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204583"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Russ Hiebert: </b>Mr. Speaker,  I will try not to be  too partisan here, but I have to express my disappointment with the response we were just given.

I hope that next time the member will provide more substance.</p><A NAME="Int-1204583"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204587"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1204577"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Roy Cullen: </b>Mr. Speaker, I guess the member realizes that we have a border of some 8,000 kilometres between Canada and the United States. I suppose the member's solution would be to have customs officials or RCMP every few hundred yards or so. He realizes that is not feasible, possible or realistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I mentioned,  in the recent budget  the Government of Canada announced an investment of $433 million over five years in additional funding to support the Canada Border Services Agency's operations.  The funding will enhance the agency's capacity to manage the access of people and goods to and from Canada, and to ensure the safety and economic prosperity of all Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health and safety of the Canada Border Services Agency officers continue to be of paramount importance to the agency and to the Government of Canada.</p><A NAME="Int-1204587"></A><a HREF="#Int-1204583"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>The motion to adjourn the House has now deemed to have been adopted.
