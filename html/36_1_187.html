</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the

<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present two 
petitions today signed by a number of Canadians, including those 
from my own riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition has to do with human rights.  The petitioners 
would like to draw to the attention of the House that abuse of 
human rights continues to be rampant around the world in 
countries such as Indonesia.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also point out that Canada continues to be recognized as 
the champion of human rights internationally.  Therefore the 
petitioners call upon Canada to continue to condemn human rights 
violations and also to seek to bring to justice those responsible 
for such abuses.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>THE FAMILY

<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the second petition is probably one of my favourite petitions. 
It has to do with the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for pre-school children 
is an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also point out that the Income Tax Act discriminates 
against families who choose to provide direct parental care to 
pre-school children, the chronically ill, the aged or the 
disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore call upon parliament to eliminate such 
tax discrimination and to provide incentives and tax breaks for 
families who choose to provide direct parental care for 
pre-school children, the chronically ill, the aged or the 
disabled.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK14">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 18 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly a pleasure to talk about the pay-more, get-less 
budget of this year.  I really want to touch on three things. 
First, I would like to talk about what I found out from my 
constituents this past week, having a week to talk to so many of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to talk about some young people who took 
out their paycheques, looked at the reductions on them and 
started to ask some pretty serious questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I would like to talk about where Canada really sits in 
the world and what is happening to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to talk to four different service clubs, 
to a high school, to a senior citizens' home, to a couple of town 
hall meetings and to a chamber of commerce.  Pretty well 
everywhere I went I found a major concern about taxes, about 
health care and a real disappointment that here it is again:  we 
are paying more, we are getting less, our health care system is 
in crisis and yet we are being asked to pay more and more taxes 
year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also talked about the dollar and how the dollar was not 
worth what it used to be.  They talked about how concerned they 
were about their jobs, about their initiative and the destruction 
of that initiative by a budget such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian productivity is suffering and has been on the decline 
now for some 30 years.  That is a message to which certainly the 
government has failed to react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the loss of brain power.  Young people are saying “If 
it does not get better I will have to leave this country”.  I 
can identify with that, having had three of our family leave this 
country for that reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a son who teaches at Princeton.  He was a Rhodes scholar 
who could not get a job in Canada.  I have a daughter who is an 
architect in Norway.  She could not get a job in Canada.  I have 
a young daughter who was recruited to Holland.  She was offered a 
scholarship because she could not get one in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are finding.  That is the kind of thing we heard 
from the young people in high schools and colleges as we 
travelled the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about paycheques.  What are we getting from the 
deductions on the paycheques?  Again it is pay more, get less. 
We have less health care.  We have an EI system that is just not 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people are saying that they cannot even make a claim. 
They are asking what the EI deduction is for. 
The average employee is paying $350 per year more than what this 
system needs.  The employer is paying $500.  There is a huge 
surplus which is thrown into general revenue and 40% or less can 
actually collect EI payments.  They know that and they are upset 
by it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada pension, 9.9%:  It has gone up in the last two years and 
will go up for the next three.  That was socialism of the 1960s 
and the state centred system that was to provide everything to 
everyone.  Young people are saying they do not trust that system 
will be there for them and that the costs are just too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as income tax is concerned, it is pay more and get less. 
With bracket creep 2.5 million more Canadians will be in a higher 
tax bracket.  This mainly affects low and middle income people, 
and that is most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that young people see no hope in the country. 
Small businesses see no reason why they should grow and provide 
jobs.  There is no incentive because of a budget like the one we 
have just seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to concentrate on our position in the world.  Where 
are we in the world?  I have been fortunate to have been 
travelling for close to 40 years.  I have travelled to just about 
every country in the world.  This past year I have been in 
countries like China, India, Pakistan, Paris, London and and 
Norway.  Everywhere I go I get the feeling that Canada is falling 
behind.  Canada's influence is not what it used to be. We are in 
trouble, no matter how we look at it from an international 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I spent two days at the OECD in Paris asking what 
was wrong with Canada, what was happening to the country we are 
so proud of and want to see prosper?  They said, if they had to 
summarize it, that there were three issues.  One was the debt. No 
country can have a debt to GDP ratio like Canada has and expect 
to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we cannot have taxes like we have.  We cannot have 
corporate and personal taxes at the level we have in Canada and 
expect people to have initiative and expect productivity to 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, and most important of all, we do not have a plan.  Our 
government does not know where it is going in three months, in 
three years, in thirty years.  There is no plan.  The government 
goes from pillar to post and we get a budget like the one we are 
talking about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result our dollar is dropping.  As a result our percentage 
of the world GDP is now 2.3%.  Twenty years ago it was 5% of the 
world GDP.  That is a dramatic decline in Canada's influence in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government is in a state of denial.  The Liberals 
love to brag.  They want to keep their spirits high.  They allege 
that we are the top country in the world based on the UN human 
development index, which most experts say is an economic hoax. By 
dreaming we are number one, they fail to realize the kind of 
economic decline the country is in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Bank says that our standard of living and prosperity 
has dropped from third to twelfth place in the past 10 years.  We 
are the only country in the top 13 industrialized countries that 
has undergone such a decline.  That hits home and that hits home 
hard.  Those are hard, cold facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been displaced by nine countries in the last 10 
years: Kuwait, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Norway, Belgium, 
Austria, Denmark and the United Arab Emirates.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the real indicators of what is happening to us. 
We can look at unemployment.  Let us compare our unemployment at 
8% to 9% to that of our neighbours with whom we compete.  They 
are at 4.3%.  This shows a decline in our economic performance. 
We all know that the level of unemployment is higher if we 
consider the discouraged unemployed workers who are no longer 
searching for jobs and the many involuntary part time workers. In 
a healthy economy there is virtually full employment.  There are 
jobs for everyone and certainly they are full time jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned the Canadian dollar.  Those who do not realize 
what has happened can travel anywhere in the world and see what 
they can buy with the Canadian dollar.  On taxes, pay more and 
get less; $2,020 more in taxes in the last six years.  Taxes kill 
jobs.  Taxes kill incentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about the debt and the size of government, but in 
conclusion basically our productivity is falling.  Our standard 
of living is falling.  Our unemployment rate is double that of 
our U.S. cousins.  As well, we have the highest taxes in the 
industrialized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has nothing to be proud of in the budget.  It is 
a budget of pay more and get less, and the Canadian public will 
suffer from it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the member's speech very much.  Would he care to reflect 
on the difference between the economy of Alberta and the economy 
of Canada and perhaps draw conclusions about why the economy in 
Alberta continues to surge ahead while the economy in Canada 
languishes?  Our place in the world has diminished over the last 
several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I come from central Alberta 
which has seven world scale petrochemical developments.  There 
are 11 quarter sections of land being developed in housing. There 
has been a huge increase in what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I meet with the executives of those companies.  I welcome them 
and ask them why they are there.  The reasons are low feedstock 
costs, less government, and the efficiency and productivity 
opportunities in that community.  The advantages are obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could go to the gulf coast.  They could go to Saudi Arabia. 
However they have chosen Alberta because it is a place where 
taxes are low, government interference is much less, and people 
have an incentive to do much better.  The entrepreneurial spirit 
is alive and well in Alberta.  I am afraid that what we have here 
does nothing but kill it.  That is the big problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, would the hon. member make clear to those watching and 
the few on the other side who are listening today the issue the 
government keeps bragging about, that it has balanced the books 
and got rid of the deficit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Yeah. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Already we hear a yeah over there. Would 
the member for Red Deer tell us what the cost has been to 
Canadian taxpayers?  What is the effect of balancing the books 
and the bragging that goes on over there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  A million and a half jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  One member over there says a million and 
a half jobs.  I would like the hon. member to reflect the reality 
in balancing the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government has played a 
shell game.  There is not a lot of honesty.  It is a pretty 
deceitful thing to brag about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI payments have been overcollected.  They have taken close to 
$15 billion and thrown them into general revenues. 
They have kept their bureaucracy as large as ever.  They continue 
to shuffle money from one portfolio to another.  Money moves back 
and forth under one shell, then under another and back to the 
other.  Basically they have bragged about this and said “Look at 
the wonderful job we are doing”.

The servicing of that debt is $42 billion to $43 billion a year. 
Let us think of what we could have if we were able to deal with 
that debt effectively.  Putting maybe $3 billion a year on that 
will take forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like the OECD said.  There is no plan.  There is nothing 
here to brag about.  Until we get that we will not have a 
productive country that does not have the figures I talked about.

the debt.  That is the real issue.

Calgary in the <I>National Post</I> who says that he and his wife 
are noticing that increasing taxes are preventing them from 
getting ahead.  As a matter a fact they are going south to the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says “If I were cynical I would say the attitude of 
successive Canadian governments was to punish success”.  Would 
you agree with this statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Would he agree with this statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the real point is that 
Canadians are getting extremely discouraged because taxes are so 
high. There is no incentive to let businesses grow and provide 
more jobs.  There is no incentive for our young people to stay 
here.  That is what we have to turn around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are discouraged.  They are starting to ask what the 
government can do to fix that.  That is the big question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, something came up in the debate a few minutes ago.  One 
of the few members opposite indicated that about 1.5 million jobs 
were created in our society as a result of the Liberal's balanced 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Yeah. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Another member sitting over there is 
bragging about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put a reality test before us.  For example, I heard 
the Prime Minister bragging six to eight months ago about how 
they had created many jobs.  I thought I should check this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I checked all the provincial brag sheets, the newspapers and so 
on, and each province in turn was saying it created <I>x</I> 
number of jobs and that is why it is doing so well, et cetera. 
The Prime Minister is claiming that he created all the jobs in 
Canada.  The provincial premiers are bragging that they created 
all the jobs in the country.  On and on it goes.  In fact the 
real job creator in the country is private industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand, for the life of me, why governments make 
media announcements indicating that they have created jobs.  The 
fact of the matter is that it is private industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  As usual they do not like what I am 
saying.  We will go into that in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An article appeared in the newspaper today which I want to read 
because it contains some important points that I will address 
about my situation.  Anthony Ostler of Toronto wrote:

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is from one of our young people.  “Ironically, my work as 
a consultant takes me south of the border for more than half of 
the year.  However, I am paid in Canada in Canadian dollars and 
pay taxes at the highest marginal rate.  My colleagues at the 
same pay level in the U.S. take home much more than I do as the 
highest tax bracket does not kick in for them.  So although my 
brain is being drained in the U.S., my tax dollars are still in 
Canada.  One day this may have to change.  My parents immigrated 
here 35 years ago when Canada was nearing its peak.  Maybe I will 
have to pursue greener tax pastures elsewhere”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a sad but true unsolicited commentary from a Toronto 
individual. I just picked that out of a newspaper, but we can see 
that every day in every province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember clearly when I left my home in Nova Scotia 33 years 
ago.  My mother who is watching today will remember. It was 
because there were no opportunities for jobs in Nova Scotia in 
1966.  Quite frankly, today the situation has not improved after 
all those years and successive Liberal governments.  In fact, the 
situation has gotten worse.  I can attest to that fully by having 
some of my young relatives live with me in western Canada because 
they too, although supported with a higher education from our 
universities, go west to get jobs.  So things have not really 
changed that much which is very sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came back from London where I did some work with the 
opposition and government House leaders, whips, the House of 
Lords and others.  In order to cut some of my costs, I stayed 
with two young people from Canada.  They are both recent 
graduates of the University of Victoria.  They are in England 
because they could not get jobs in Canada. These two 
well-educated young men are living not where they want to live 
but where they have to live. Those who know the cost of living in 
England can imagine that their situation there is not the best, 
yet they are trying to fend for themselves and exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite appalling that members on the other side would stand 
and brag about jobs they have created when in fact a lot of this 
country's young people are going elsewhere for jobs.  The tax 
rate is too high.  Some hon. members know this.  We have to deal 
with these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son is highly qualified as a civil engineer and a digital 
animator.  He makes cartoons for television shows.  He is 
attracted to the United States.  They want him down there and are 
willing to pay him big money.  Instead of the taxation rate here 
of above 50% for this young fellow, he can go down there and make 
much more money at a lower tax rate.  This would give him the 
ability to pay off his student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that members on the opposite side would try to present 
a facade that says Canada is in great shape because they have 
balanced the budget and have created <I>x</I> number of jobs. They 
are kidding themselves because this is not the case.  I would 
doubt very much if any one of the members opposite do not know 
some young person who has left Canada because the cost of living 
and unbearable tax rate here are driving them south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about paying more and getting less, I can only 
relate it to my own circumstances and the young people whom I 
care very much for who are paying more in this country.  This 
government has increased the CPP premiums.  They are 
extraordinary increases.  What has the government offered these 
young people in return? 
Again, my son said to me,  “Dad, there is something wrong with 
this.  Today you get about $8,900 for CPP.  These guys have just 
raised the rate around 70-some per cent, and they are promising 
that I will get about $8,600 30 years from now”.  He is an 
engineer.  He gets out his calculators and his slide rules and he 
says there is something wrong with this picture. And there is 
something wrong with this picture.  It is a facade of this 
government.

good that the tax rates were raised to get there.  While it is 
good that there is surplus moneys to pay down the debt and to 
draw down the tax rates, it is not good that the government is 
spending it on other programs by and large to get votes and get 
re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government has got the wrong attitude with this 
whole issue.  It has a lot to do with that.  It should not be 
about getting elected again; it should be about the future of our 
country.  Unfortunately, we have to live with this archaic and 
traditional idea that we have to get money in the hands of those 
who can get us elected rather than pay down the debt, pay down 
the taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things I would have liked to have seen in this 
budget.  I would have liked to have seen some mediocre attempt at 
the very least to deal with the sad drug problem in our country. 
I know the government has been talking about a drug strategy, but 
actually it is an overlay of the Conservative drug strategy of 
1987.  Very little, if anything, has been done to address that. 
That is a subject for another discussion because I have less than 
a minute to tie all this up, but I will be speaking about this 
shortly in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say that as one father and one son and somebody 
who has seen a lot of young people leave our country, I am 
extremely sad to hear government members brag about the jobs the 
government has created.  It has not created jobs unless it has 
been at the cost of the taxpayer.  What creates jobs is private 
industry with a low tax rate.  There are people who want to 
invest in our future without having to pay down debt because it 
was accumulated as a result of governments giving away money it 
could not afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope in an attempt to continue on with this discussion today 
the government will at least listen to what I have said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the member. He made the 
comment that we should not be here doing things to get 
re-elected, that we should be doing what we believe is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House of the words that came from the 
opposition during the whole budget preparation period, in 
October, November and December.  All we heard were comments on 
pepper spray, water spray, gossip on airplanes, et cetera.  Not 
once in the fall did we have a comprehensive debate in the House 
on tax reform or what we should do in this year's budget. 
Literally this year's budget was prepared by the government with 
very little input from the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is very specific.  Can we have an undertaking from 
the opposition, because this budget has been put to bed other 
than a few votes, that maybe over the next few months finally the 
Reform Party will get back on to its agenda of comprehensive tax 
reform, take it seriously, create some meaningful debate in the 
House and stop criticizing for the sake of criticizing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if members on the other 
side bothered to listen, our tax plan was $26 billion in tax 
relief.  The difference is that when we talk, they are not 
listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else that was said here is important to note.  This is 
not just about budgets in the House of Commons.  When we talk 
about pepper spray, the APEC hearings and those kinds of issues, 
the government lost a minister over that issue. That was an 
important issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the comments, the member has to understand, and 
I know it is difficult, that there is more to the House of 
Commons than just one item.  The Liberals' record on taxes has 
been abysmal. Their affront on young people in Vancouver at the 
APEC hearings has been unacceptable.  There are more issues here 
than just one but it will take another day for the member to 
gravitate to that kind of problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member talked about the brain drain.  I think it is an 
important debate this House should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would listen to his own words, he talked about his 
own son who is drawn away for what he referred to as big bucks. 
That is one of things we found on the finance committee in 
looking at this.  When someone goes away to get paid a higher 
salary, no amount of tax relief will change that. It has to do 
with the onus of the responsibility of business and industry 
being able to compete globally for the best talent in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the member refer to Canada's tax rate at 50%?  He will 
know that someone making $30,000 a year pays a tax rate of 25%. 
He will know that somebody who makes $60,000 only pays a tax rate 
of 30% and someone who makes $90,000 only pays a 40% effective 
tax rate—

these arguments because their thick skulls do not understand. 
What I do understand is that there is a 4.3% unemployment rate in 
the United States.  They have to pay a premium in the United 
States to get Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had that kind of record in Canada, maybe we would be a 
little better off but the government is too damned fast in 
raising taxes.  That is the problem.  The government is slow if 
not totally inefficient on paying debt but the Liberals do not 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we say?  The only real answer is to get rid of this 
government and then manage it on a more efficient basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to bring some optimism to this debate on what has been 
described as our health care budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here in my capacity as chair of the government caucus on 
post-secondary education and research.  Since 1994 it has been 
working with members, such as the member from Fredericton who is 
here today, and others who will be speaking in this debate, on 
behalf of students, universities, colleges, researchers in 
hospitals, institutes and schools across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In discussing this health care budget I will begin by describing 
one of the highlights of my life.  It was a conversation I and 
two or three other people had 19 years ago with Terry Fox. Terry 
had completed his 42 klicks for the day.  He came into 
Peterborough and was talking to us about what he was doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone asked him why he was raising money for cancer research. 
At that time in Peterborough we had problems with cancer care, 
driving people a long way to get treatment and that kind of 
thing.  Of course Terry had no idea of the vast amounts of money 
that would eventually be raised in his name, but Terry said he 
had decided that the money should go to cancer research. He had 
been a patient and the care had been there for him, and even 
though perhaps there should be some improvements to it, he knew 
that if there was no research in the future there would be people 
just like him.  They might get good care but they would never be 
cured, nor would their disease ever be prevented. Terry Fox 
deliberately channelled the money he raised into cancer research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cancer societies have been in a fortunate situation in 
Canada.  All of us every April go out and raise money for cancer 
and that goes to care.  And many of us participate in the Terry 
Fox runs, and that money goes for research.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research is the foundation of any modern health care system.  It 
is not an extra, it is not some sort of a luxury.  It is an 
integral part of any efficient, modern health care system.  In 
this health care budget we were very fortunate with the financial 
circumstances that we were able to transfer more than $11 billion 
to the provinces for health care in general for the operation of 
hospitals, clinics, long term care facilities, children's health 
centres, home care, the prevention and promotion of health care 
and that kind of thing.  We were able to devote $11 billion in 
that direction.  At the same time, something that has been going 
on since 1994, we were able to devote funds specifically for 
health care research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When medicare was first introduced the focus was on curing 
illness with doctors and hospitals.  Now good health care is as 
much about preventing illness as it is about curing it.  Research 
generates new insights into human biology and disease processes. 
It illuminates the factors that affect the health of people in 
communities.  It leads to the discovery of new cures, to the 
discovery of medical technologies and procedures and it helps us 
to tailor the health care system to the needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget invests close to $1.4 billion specifically for 
improving information systems, promoting health related research 
and innovation, for research into improving first nations and 
Inuit health services and for preventing health problems.  This 
will ensure that our doctors, nurses, administrators and others 
have the most up to date knowledge, information, treatments and 
cures at their fingertips.  It will also allow them to innovate 
and learn from each other to the benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important investments that will improve Canada's 
health care system in the years ahead.  The decision to invest in 
both what we think of as direct care and in research at the same 
time was the only decision that a responsible government could 
have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important research announcements in the budget 
was the $240 million investment in the new Canadian institutes of 
health research, the CIHR.  These institutes will bring together 
the best researchers and support groups from across Canada in 
areas such as aging, arthritis, women's health, cancer and heart 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year our government caucus on post-secondary education was 
delighted to meet several times with Dr. Henry Friesen, president 
of the Medical Research Council and with the presidents of the 
other granting councils to discuss this new institute's concept. 
Dr. Friesen explained that health research has expanded beyond 
its traditional boundaries of simple medical research. The CIHR 
will offer a modern framework to bring together all fields of 
health research.  It will build on the research base of our 
universities, health and research centres, teaching hospitals, 
federal and provincial governments, and voluntary and private 
sectors by supporting and linking researchers in new ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future research teams representing many disciplines, not 
just medical, will be linked by institutes structured along 
thematic lines to create a powerful across Canada network of 
expertise in areas of importance to us all.  These institutes 
will not be centralized bricks and mortar facilities.  Instead 
they will support and link researchers and support groups located 
in universities, hospitals and other research centres in 
communities all across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting today in modern times to think about what 
health research is.  We need engineers, not doctors, to make new 
joints like elbows, wrists, hips and so on.  We need chemists to 
develop new drugs, not just medical doctors.

so that x-rays and other medical records can be transmitted 
across the country to be interpreted by the best available 
people.  We need telecommunication experts so that doctors can 
diagnose patients who are located thousands of kilometres away. 
We need social scientists to track the success and failure rates 
of various procedures.  We need people to study the best ways of 
delivering health care in our communities, social scientists, 
statisticians, people of that type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern health care would not be possible without a broad based, 
basic research system across all disciplines. That system 
requires an education system to bring up the people who can 
operate and staff it, an accessible, effective education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this health care budget the federal government, in addition 
to the specific health care items which involve huge sums of 
money, has once again been able to invest in fundamental research 
and education across Canada. This is something that has been 
going on from the very first days of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding of the granting councils, the Natural Sciences and 
Engineering Research Council, the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council as well as the Medical Research Council, was 
once again increased.  So was the funding to the National 
Research Council and the funding to the new Canada Foundation for 
Innovation which is providing infrastructure for research in 
communities all across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an example of the diversity of research which is 
necessary to support a really effective health care system, this 
time in the budget there was a fund provided for research into 
various aspects of nursing.  This fund is an endowment to support 
a 10 year nursing research program.  This new research initiative 
will deal with the changing roles and needs of nursing.  This is 
so important in all our health institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fund will be administered by the Canadian Health Services 
Research Foundation, a partner to the institutes I mentioned. 
This research is an example of focusing on basic health care, the 
care that nurses provide, helping to provide it in the most 
effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have seen more support for the SSHRC, for the 
NRC and for northern research but the momentum of supporting 
basic research in this country has continued in this budget and I 
am delighted to see it. I join Nobel Laureate Dr. Michael Smith 
who said: “This budget was a tremendous vote of confidence in 
the research community of Canada.  This is the best federal 
budget I've seen in support of academic research”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief.  My question to the 
hon. member is if the Liberal government is so supportive of 
Canada's health care system and sees it as a top priority, why 
has it been part of the cut from 50% funding promised when Canada 
health care came into effect down to 15%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government believes so much that health care is a 
priority, why did it put $2.5 billion into the millennium 
scholarship fund which will affect only 6% of post-graduate 
students and will not see any benefit until the year 2000? If 
health care was such a priority, why did it do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her 
questions.  I listened to previous negative comments from the 
other side of the House that talked about brain drain and now we 
hear the millennium scholarship mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking here about a health care system now and for the 
future. Where was the support of the Reform Party for the 
millennium scholarship funds which are grants, the first grants 
to Canadian students in many decades?   Where was the Reform 
Party's wholehearted support for the RESPs, the registered 
education saving plans, which again include grants for lower and 
middle income and high income people so they can support their 
children in education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is Reform support, talking about brain drain, for the CFI, 
the Canada Foundation for Innovation, for the increases in the 
granting councils which I have just mentioned?  Where is the 
support for the NRC?  Where was the support for SchoolNet which 
has put all of our elementary schools and all high schools in 
Canada way ahead of the United States on the Internet?

place on this component of the budget.  I speak of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the hon. member.  I would ask him if he would not 
admit to the House today that even with the billions of dollars 
placed back into health care it will simply bring health care 
funding up to 1995 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with a great deal of interest to the research and 
development aspect the member took with respect to health care. 
Is he aware that the two major cost drivers in health care today 
are technology and inflation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going back simply to 1995 levels, if we cannot afford 
technology and it cannot be put into place, how will that help 
the health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I tried to point out, 
this budget is not something that has just appeared.  It is not 
off the wall.  This budget is the culmination of a series of 
budgets we have had in which our main concern has been to 
struggle with the problem that was left by the Progressive 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came in.  We did not ask for it but there was a deficit of 
$42 billion.  We were borrowing almost a $1 billion a week at 
that time.  From the very first year, this government started 
investing in the things I was describing, SchoolNet, health care 
for women, pre-natal and post-natal health care and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a further step, one more step forward to making 
Canada an even greater place in the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
only have time for a short question.  We recently had people 
before the finance committee who were extraordinarily critical of 
the high tax levels in Canada because they were driving young 
graduates out of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has this government completely failed to do anything about 
high taxes so that we can keep those people in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not my place to 
discuss the substantial tax cuts in this and previous budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we are getting the economy in shape and 
stimulating job creation and so on, it is the federal 
government's responsibility, and fortunately for us the Reform 
Party will never have that responsibility, to build the systems 
and structures today that will make Canada greater and that will 
help our young people today so that they can help us when we are 
old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negativism from that side is of great concern to me. Let us 
have some optimism here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here this 
morning to speak about the budget and the number one issue on the 
minds of Canadians, the future of health care.  It is an issue 
that is very dear to my heart and one that I can speak of from a 
unique vantage point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former provincial minister of health, I saw firsthand the 
challenges the provinces face in providing quality health care 
under difficult financial circumstances.  As Parliamentary 
Secretary to Minister of Health, I have seen health care 
challenges from the national perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased to be speaking at this time when the 
future of medicare has never been brighter, a time when the 
federal government is in a strong financial position, a time when 
federal dollars will be making a positive difference in the 
accessibility of quality health care in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through sound fiscal management, a downward trend toward lower 
taxes, the government's focus on reducing the debt and through a 
significant investment in research and development, Canada is 
moving forward.  This budget will make a real difference in 
health and health care in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time not long ago when babies were born at home, not 
by choice but because their families could not afford to go to 
the doctor.  Often care was not sought until it was too late to 
save a patient.  People died from measles, mumps and chicken pox 
because there was no vaccine to prevent or to respond to an 
outbreak.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good to remember those times.  We are reminded of how 
fragile the human condition is and of the importance of 
protecting Canadian medicare, which protects all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions that I described did not just happen in the 
middle ages or even at the turn of the century.  I am talking 
about this century, the fifties and the early sixties, before 
Tommy Douglas advocated the first provincial medicare plan, 
before the Liberal government in Ottawa established medicare to 
serve all Canadians regardless of their income or their postal 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty years ago my husband lost his mother to breast cancer.  My 
father-in-law lost not only his wife but his business too.  Yes, 
it cost him dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look south of the border to see what kind of 
system we could have had:  one for the rich, another for the poor 
and no access for many.  We only have to ask Canadians who have 
gone south without extra medical coverage, some who have had to 
remortgage their homes or take out bank loans because a loved one 
was in a car accident or suffered a heart attack while on 
vacation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we Canadians have taken a lot for granted.  We have 
expected that a person would get a job when they turned 18 and 
would retire from that same job when they turned 65, that there 
would always be clean air and clean water and that there would 
always be a doctor, a nurse or a hospital nearby when we needed 
care.  To that extent we have been fortunate in Canada.  As the 
United Nations reminds us, we live in a country that for the 
sixth consecutive year has ranked number one in the world as the 
best place to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the last decade we have learned a few lessons.  We 
cannot live on borrowed money forever.  We have learned that the 
resources of this country are not limitless.  Perhaps the 
greatest lesson that we have learned is one of individual 
responsibility, which ironically is the theme that has been 
echoed through the great works of the early philosophers. 
Accepting personal responsibility is a hard lesson.  But learning 
responsibility has been important to all of us; to learn to 
appreciate the things we have and what is most important to us, 
setting priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old saying which people say whenever they are down 
or whenever they are broke:  “At least you have your health”. 
Aside from their families, I believe what Canadians cherish the 
most is their health.  They also cherish the quality of health 
care which they have come to rely on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mother wants to know that there is a doctor in the emergency 
room when she brings her sick baby to the hospital.  A heart 
patient wants to know that there is an operating room available 
24 hours a day.  A family wants to know that their elderly mother 
will have nursing home care when she is too ill, too frail to 
look after herself, but wants to remain as independent as 
possible for as long as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government understands.  We understand the importance of not 
just preserving medicare, but continuing to make it better.  That 
is going to take more than just money.  That is why the Liberal 
government has invested another $11.5 billion in health care over 
the next five years.  We as a government have a responsibility to 
the people of Canada today and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of that responsibility has been to put our own fiscal house 
in order and to eliminate the deficit.  We know that in times 
past it has been very difficult because of that deficit for the 
government to be able to act on behalf of Canadians, to put this 
country's social programs on a firm fiscal foundation.  Without 
that foundation, given the challenges of change, Canadian health 
care was seen as a house of cards just waiting for a strong wind 
to make it collapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the future is bright.  As we go forward into the future we 
must never forget the lessons we have learned from the past.  We 
have learned to stop treating medicare like an illness and 
hopefully we will start treating it like a patient.  Treating it 
like an illness meant that we lurched from crisis to crisis, 
never certain of what the future would hold.  Ensuring the future 
of medicare means that we needed to stop using band-aid 
solutions. We needed to look at the overall health of medicare. 
We needed to listen to experts.  We wanted to listen to 
Canadians.  Then we had to establish priorities for the future.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why our government established the National Forum on 
Health.  That is why we developed a plan for the future.  The 
cornerstone of that plan is the recognition that the provinces 
have their job to do in renewing and strengthening the delivery 
of services.  To do that job successfully they need the security 
of long term, stable funding from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agreed to provide that guaranteed funding, $11.5 billion for 
medicare over a five year period.  That is the largest health 
transfer payment to the provinces in the past two decades.  I 
want to emphasize that not even five years ago was this kind of 
investment possible.  It is possible today because the Liberal 
government made the hard choices over the last five years and 
took our fiscal responsibility very seriously.  Now we are able 
to look to the future with confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are already seeing the differences of additional funding 
and what that is making happen in the provinces.  The provinces 
which have the responsibility for service delivery are already 
announcing the re-opening of emergency wards and the provision of 
other services which are necessary to secure the health of 
Canadians everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a responsibility beyond providing 
money.  Our responsibility goes beyond just giving the provinces 
money and we are taking those responsibilities very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key role the federal government plays nationally is working 
with our partners to prevent and promote good health.  That means 
making health information available to Canadians to help them 
make the right choices, to inform people, especially our youth, 
about the hazards of smoking, drinking and taking drugs, and to 
help young families make healthful choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget will help improve the overall health of Canadians, 
particularly Canadians who fall through the cracks because we are 
taking an early intervention approach.  Rather than waiting to 
treat, we are intervening to prevent.  We are being proactive. 
We are assisting pregnant women.  We are also dealing with issues 
like contaminated foods before they happen.  We are investing 
money to strengthen the federal food safety program.  Rather than 
just spending money after the fact to treat environmental 
illnesses, we are being proactive.  We are providing management 
for the control of toxic substances.  Rather than ignoring the 
needs of rural Canadians, we are looking at ways to improve 
services for rural and remote communities.  We want to use 
Tele-health and the new technologies that are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three hundred and twenty-eight million dollars is available to 
further develop health information systems that will link 
together all of those who provide care through national networks. 
In these ways the Liberal government is showing leadership in 
working with the provinces to re-invent medicare, with an 
emphasis on appropriately treating the patient, not just the 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much more to do.  I believe that Canadian medicare must 
adopt an accountable, integrated approach to health care, one 
which will bring together hospital resources with all other 
health services to meet the needs of our communities.  Canadian 
medical and scientific professionals must share best practices 
and focus on outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must move toward a system that breaks down the silos and puts 
an end, once and for all, to the turf wars that have plagued 
medicare in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our aim as we move forward into this new era is to work together 
and to empower ordinary Canadians.  Today medicare in Canada is 
stronger than ever thanks to the commitment, in writing, of 
provincial governments across this country.  We are determined to 
create a real system that will be there for all Canadians when 
they need it.  This budget will help to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have been listening to this debate for some time.  The Liberal 
government has destroyed our health care system.  It has cut $24 
billion from health care spending since 1993.  When the Canada 
Health Act came into existence the federal government agreed to 
share 50% of the cost with the provinces.  It has now dropped to 
15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government should apologize to Canadians for causing 
the health care system to be in the shape it is today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians now know that it is going to take many years to 
rebuild our health care system which was destroyed by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government has put the health care system in this 
position.  Now it is spending millions of dollars of taxpayers' 
money in a damage control campaign.  The finance minister— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The parliamentary 
secretary has one minute to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the big difference 
between the Liberal Party and the Reform Party is that we support 
the principles of the Canada Health Act.  We say no to American 
style medicine and no to user fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I humbly stand today in this House of Commons, the same House of 
Commons that voted unanimously to make the Canada Health Act a 
reality in this country.  I stand proudly as the member of 
parliament for Thornhill, but also as an individual who has 
watched this nation build an internationally acclaimed medicare 
system for all of us.  I have watched the growing pains.  I have 
watched it falter.  But together, with this budget and with the 
support of all Canadians, we can assure that Canadian style 
medicare will be there for future generations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder how proud the member is of the fact that 200,000 Canadians 
are on waiting lists for health care today.  How proud is she of 
the fact that 1,400 doctors have left Canada in the last two 
years?  I wonder how proud is she—and this is a little ironic 
given the rhetoric we have heard—of the fact that so many 
desperate Canadians who cannot get timely health care are being 
forced to go to the United States to seek treatment.  Under this 
government equal access does not mean equal access to treatment, 
it means equal access to a waiting list.  How proud is the member 
of those facts that have been created by her government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, everyone realizes that 
there are enormous challenges for change.  But the one thing that 
we believe in and that we stand for is that we can work together 
to ensure that Canadians have timely access to quality health 
care.  That is what distinguishes us from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's rhetoric does not match its policies.  It 
would scrap the Canada Health Act.  It would bring in user fees 
and American style medicine.  This party says no.  We believe 
that by working together we can solve the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally all countries are facing problems.  Nobody has 
found the perfect answer.  We are looking around the world and we 
are working together to ensure that Canadian health care will be 
there for Canadians when they need it.  The provinces, which have 
the responsibility for the delivery of services, have committed 
to work together and to use their technologies to create a more 
integrated and accountable— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is pretty hard for me to understand what is going on in the House 
and across the country.  From 1995 to 1998 the federal government 
cut $22 billion from transfers to the provinces.  In the next 
five years it will invest $12.5 billion.  That is half the amount 
it cut and it will take five years to do it.  How can she say 
that we are in the best position we have ever been in when our 
parents and our children, when they go to the hospital, are left 
in the hallways instead of being given a bed?  As a Canadian, how 
could she be proud of that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is 
factually incorrect.  With this budget the health portion of the 
Canada health and social transfer will be fully restored.  That 
will also give predictable and stable funding to the provinces 
which deliver those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government took office it faced a $42 billion deficit 
and a debt that was out of control.  Today the debt and the debt to 
GDP ratio are on a downward trend.  The tax burden is being 
reduced, particularly for the neediest.  Also we have been able 
to secure social programs. This makes the single largest 
commitment to Canadian medicare.  Transfers of $11.5 billion over 
five years, with $3.5 billion immediately to help the provinces 
solve their problems, is the single largest commitment in over 
two decades.  That is a real commitment and those are the facts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased, as a Bloc Quebecois member, and as the sovereignist 
member for Lotbinière in particular, to speak today in this 
debate on the federal Ontario Liberal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Paul Martin budget of last February 16 was a slap in the 
face to the people of Quebec, a painful one.  It is a purely 
political budget, as Alain Dubuc, editorial writer for <I>La 
Presse</I>, wrote the day after what I would call the worst possible 
social injustice toward the Quebec people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alain Dubuc is, as hon. members know, not the most sovereignist 
editorial writer at <I>La Presse</I>. 
He was, however, very clear in describing it as follows “The 
budget tabled by the Canadian Minister of Finance is purely 
political”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say “The budgetary approach in this sixth Martin 
budget wallowed in the same quagmire as most actions by the 
Chrétien government, the difficulty of making choices and 
setting priorities, the lack of focus, concern with the short 
term, and political calculation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Mr. Dubuc neglected to say is that this government has 
already made up its mind, and that its choice is to promote a 
unitary country, a centralizing country, which has been 
concentrating its efforts ever since October 1995 on weakening 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is in mourning.  Our unemployed are weeping.  Our sick 
people are in despair, and the middle class is up in arms 
against the way this government is acting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario, however, is jubilant, with Mike Harris heading things 
up, because he got the fine sum of $1 billion out of this 
government under the social union framework agreement, a 
centralizing union that skims off the provinces' powers, which 
they have enjoyed since the start of Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This centralizing union suits to a “T” the current Prime 
Minister, who, in the course of his career, has become an expert 
in reneging on his word and his signature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The masks of the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Health and 
the Prime Minister fell on February 16.  The Liberal plot was 
revealed, it was a plot against Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meeting on February 4 was another example of the repeated 
offensives by the Prime Minister against Quebec. 
We will recall the patriation of the Constitution in 1982 and 
the Meech Lake accord, which was scuttled by this politician, a 
loyal apostle of the Trudeauism of the 1970s.  And what about 
the failed supreme court attempt by the famous chameleon Guy 
Bertrand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going on about the budget, I would like to talk about the 
fine parade of federal ministers in Quebec last week.  This 
government was so aware that this budget concerned Quebeckers 
that last week it sent two fake Santas in red suits.  The people 
of Quebec could see, despite the costumes, that what was coming 
out of the mouths of these fake Santas was false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should imagine the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
trying to talk about figures.  Just as here in the House, no one 
understood him. 
And the Minister of Finance had the gall to say that his budget 
was transparent.  Something slipped his mind when he came to 
meet Quebeckers last week and that something was Bill C-28.  Fine 
little bit of tampering to protect his shipping business. In 
particular, he forgot to say how he was robbing the employment 
insurance fund.  There is a word for that, but I cannot say it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> You can say it is pillage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Yes, indeed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 19, in Plessisville, which is located in my riding, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development hastily met the 
local media. He did not meet the unemployed, but the media. The 
minister clearly remembered his experience of last year, when he 
tried to make fun of the BC mine workers, in Thetford Mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about what the Liberals have done to help Quebec's 
health sector. They just approved the establishment of a medical 
police whose sole purpose will be to spy on our health system 
and to recommend to federal Liberals a more centralizing 
strategy, in order to bring Quebec's health sector under federal 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for employment insurance or, rather, poverty insurance, only 
36% of those who contributed now qualify for benefits. Three out 
of every four young people have been excluded, while seasonal 
workers remain the most affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of this policy is that people are leaving some of 
Quebec's most scenic regions. Members should look at what is 
happening in the Gaspé and North Shore areas. The Bloc Quebecois 
has made numerous appeals in this House, urging the government 
to correct the flaws of the employment insurance reform. What 
did the Minister of Finance announce to the unemployed? Nothing. 
Absolutely nothing. The minister continues to pump money out of 
the employment insurance surpluses and he keeps asking more from 
his servant, the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latter answered the call by setting up a harassment scheme 
designed to target Quebec's unemployed. 
This quest to get money from the jobless is taking place in the 
Quebec riding of Lotbinière, where the minister went and got $6 
million. In Quebec, over a period of just eight months, the 
minister got $144 million, all this for the benefit of beautiful 
Ontario, and also to provide money for the federal government, 
so that it can interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
This is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the social and economic impacts of that 
reform. A very good study done by the Canadian Labour Congress 
shows that, from 1993 to 1997, my riding suffered a shortfall of 
$12 million. This hurts regional development and it results in 
people leaving the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development has the nerve to 
keep telling us, in the House, that the employment insurance 
reform is fair and equitable for Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a suggestion. 
From now on, so as to better describe what he has been doing 
since he was first appointed, the minister should call himself 
not the Minister of Human Resources Development, but the 
minister of human misery development.  Unemployment is a cash 
cow for the Liberal government, true or false? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> True. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B>  In the 1999 budget, the government 
confirms that it misappropriated the $7 billion EI surplus in 
1998-99 and that it intends to repeat the performance with the 
anticipated $5 billion surplus in 1999-2000.  This surplus is 
still being underestimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1998 report, the chief actuary, who is a credible 
individual, far more so than the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> He is not a sovereigntist either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Relying on assumptions similar to those 
used by the minister in his budget, the chief actuary estimates 
that the annual surplus in 1999 will reach $6.22 billion.  And 
the shocker:  by the end of 1999, the surplus accumulated by 
this government in the last few years will have reached $26 
billion, all of it lifted right out of the pockets of unemployed 
workers, SMEs and the most disadvantaged members of society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say what I think of this Liberal government, Mr. 
Speaker, because it would be unparliamentary, but I am utterly 
disgusted with its arrogance and unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government says we made no suggestions. That it does not 
know what to do about EI.  I have news for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what it would have been nice to hear from the Minister 
of Finance.  There is nothing tricky about it, except that, if 
these fair social principles were observed, the Minister of 
Finance would lose his cash cow.  He would no longer be able to 
pay down the deficit and meddle in the affairs of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will list what the Bloc Quebecois would have liked to have 
seen in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, improved eligibility: abolition of the 
discrimination toward certain categories of unemployed persons 
based on their so-called presence in the labour force, such as 
the number of hours required for eligibility; reduction from the 
present 700 hours to 300 hours for eligibility for special sick, 
maternity and parental benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, increase in maximum number of benefit weeks from 45 to 
50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, abolition of the so-called intensity rule which imposes a 
gradual decrease from 55% to 50% of the benefit level for 
claimants making regular use of employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, transparency of the EI account: employment insurance 
account distinct from government operations and employment 
insurance rate determined solely by the employment insurance 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, reimbursement of EI contributions to those whose total 
insurable earnings are under $5,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, elimination of the rules reducing the amount of benefits: 
abolishing the freeze on maximum insurable earnings; restoring 
the 52 week base period; calculating benefits on the number of 
weeks required to qualify during which earnings were highest; 
and allowing people to earn 25% of maximum benefits weekly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These suggestions have been incorporated into six bills tabled 
in this very House.  This, in my opinion, would create an 
employment insurance program which would be fair and equitable 
for the people of Quebec and for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address another issue relating to employment 
insurance, fiddling with zones. 
This is the greatest invention yet of the federal government for 
depriving people of a program to which they are entitled and for 
creating an awful mess, like the one we have in my own riding of 
Lotbinière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lotbinière county municipality is part of a zone where the 
unemployment rate is at 7.2%.  As a result, a worker has to have 
worked a minimum of 630 hours to qualify for 17 weeks of 
benefits.  In another region or zone right next to it, and still 
within the riding of Lotbinière, that same person would have to 
work only 490 hours to qualify for 23 weeks.  The Lotbinière 
county municipality is at a considerable disadvantage because of 
this regional rate and is deprived of any possibility of access 
to active job creation measures such as the job creation fund 
and the short weeks program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the employment insurance plan was created, it was supposed 
to help everyone without restriction and regardless of region. 
This government found a way to fiddle with the zones and to make 
sure that, in Quebec, as in my riding, no one understands.  A 
person comes to me saying he lives in a certain municipality and 
has the right to draw 23 weeks of benefits.  In another, he 
would be entitled to only 17 weeks.  Try to explain that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan is impossible.  In this regard, I announce my 
intention to launch a vast operation to mobilize all the 
socio-economic and community stakeholders in the RCM of 
Lotbinière, the community decision makers, to get the Minister 
of Human Resources Development to correct his department's 
officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be tabling here in the next few months a complete file 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  I hope he does 
not consider it a political action, an action by the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
It will be an action by the entire population of the RCM of 
Lotbinière, which is part of the riding of Lotbinière, a 
follow-up operation, a necessary operation. It will be an 
operation intended to break this longstanding social inequity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to speak about the agriculture section of this 
budget:  a big improvement over last year.  The Minister of 
Finance devoted a tiny paragraph to agriculture in his 
voluminous 276 page propaganda document.  Last year, there was 
not a single line, so it is a vast improvement.  He announced, 
once again, the disaster program the minister of agriculture 
announced hastily before Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has had two specialities of late: it announces 
programs during recesses and organizes leaks of the 
deliberations of parliamentary committees to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, last week the Minister of Agriculture announced his 
program when all the members of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food were in Washington to take part in 
information sessions organized with American officials and 
politicians to prepare future WTO negotiations. What a nice show 
of transparency on the minister's part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that, in its dealings with the provinces, this 
government will be fair and equitable toward Quebec, 
particularly hog farmers, who were saved by the intervention of 
the Lucien Bouchard government. If the recent social union 
agreement is any indication, we should expect the worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn our attention to the future WTO negotiations. 
Agriculture is the first item on the agenda. 
These negotiations are under the supervision of the Minister for 
International Trade, who is an Ontarian, with the help of the 
Minister of Agriculture, another Ontarian, and of the Minister 
of Industry, another Ontarian. It is these three ministers who 
will represent Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say I am concerned. I am even distressed by the fact 
that these Ontarians will make decisions for us Quebeckers. The 
social union tells the tale: one billion for beautiful Ontario, 
where the vast majority of federal Liberal members come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we talk about sovereignty. To the people of 
Lotbinière and of Quebec I say we have to mobilize. 
We must talk more and more about this blueprint for our society, 
this project for the future, this project that gives hope to our 
young people, that will ensure Quebeckers' full development, 
that will give us the international prominence that we deserve, 
and that will finally liberate all Quebeckers from the yoke of 
the federal government. That project is Quebec's sovereignty.

Speaker, I am afraid my French is not very good.  It is pretty 
rough around the edges.  My friend, the member for Lotbinière is 
very troubled.  Perhaps he could tell me why he is afraid of 
anyone from Ontario or from Canada's other provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke would like an answer 
from the member for Lotbinière.  I think the member for 
Lotbinière has a problem. He did not invent sliced bread.  I 
call on him to explain the equalization payments Quebec 
receives, which are over $1 billion.  Can he explain that to me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has just shown 
that information gets distorted when it goes from one side of 
the House to the other.  There is a psychological barrier in the 
House, and the federal Liberals are unable to understand how 
unfair they have been to Quebec in the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget contained $1 billion in health transfer payments for 
Ontario as opposed to only $150 million for Quebec. 
Equalization payments were withheld for three years.  With 
equalization, normally, if the federal government were fair and 
spread its research and development dollars around equitably, 
not only would we not have received a cheque, we would have 
given one to other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is reducing Quebec to poverty, and I hope that 
the members opposite, including Jean Chrétien's valiant 
Liberals, will realize it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I 
missed the start of the hon. member's speech, because I was held 
up in committee.  What I did hear, however, sounded absurd, and 
I wonder how he could say such things here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Lotbinière absolutely must work for 
separation, let him go to Quebec to do it, let him run 
provincially.  Here we are working for Canada, working in the 
interests of Quebeckers and of all Canadians.  That is what the 
House of Commons is for, and there is nothing shameful about 
receiving a salary from the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when reference is made to equalization payments, the social 
transfer, Ontario ministers, I would also point out to the hon. 
member for Lotbinière that Stéphane Dion is, to the best of my 
knowledge, a Quebec MP who is working very hard in the interests 
of Quebeckers and Canadians, for one can do both these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he claims that the amounts allocated to Ontario, British 
Columbia or Alberta as transfer payments are unfair, then let 
him do the calculations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> You have borrowed from the employment insurance 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> I wonder why there is shouting from the other 
side.  We listened to them; let them listen to us.  Let them 
show us some respect.  When it is said that Quebec receives $960 
per capita in transfer payments, whereas Ontario receives $836, 
is this equitable?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, the previous government asked the three richest 
provinces to accept a two-year freeze on transfer payments so as 
to give the other provinces, including Quebec, a chance to get 
through the recession.  That is now past. The governments were 
notified that there would be a return to equity as far as 
transfers were concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bouchard, then a minister in the Conservative government, 
had said that this was necessary.  Now he claims to have never 
heard of such a thing.  Odd, since he was there.  As for 
equalization payments and the unexpected $1.4 billion cheque 
given to Quebec, which could give it the possibility of 
eliminating its deficit, there is no mention of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B>  We don't want charity. We pay $30 billion in 
tax money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B>  Yes, but we get 29% of Canadian transfer 
payments, although we account for 24% of the population.  What 
do the hon. members across the way have to reply to that?  Let 
them stop shouting and try to find some solutions to the 
problems, instead of always blaming someone else and never 
taking a look at themselves in the mirror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, it makes me laugh to hear the 
member saying the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs defends 
the interests of Quebeckers.  It does not swell my confidence at 
all.  We have a hard time understanding him, here in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He landed in Quebec last week to try to explain the budget, when 
he has a hard time understanding the Canadian Constitution.  It 
is clear.  Education, health and municipalities are provincial. 
It is easy to give out figures, as the member for Beauce has 
just done.  It is easy to treat us as separatists.  I know no 
Quebeckers who do not want to become increasingly sovereignist 
in this province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get taken, as was the case in the recent budget, when we 
see the social union, they can talk all they want about 
transparency.  When were we consulted about investing only $150 
million?  The Prime Minister did not even honour his signature. 
And what about social union: a fine bit of blackmail.  “We need 
you in the next election.  We need you to fight the 
sovereignists.  We will give you money.  A million dollars in 
Ontario, a bit to B.C. and to Alberta”.  Do people find that 
fair and equitable?

Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, is my hon. colleague aware of the way the 
federal government treats British Columbia and the way it has 
closed the only land base in the province that is most likely to 
have a major earthquake in an urban area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he aware that British Columbia gets very little in 
procurement from the federal government?  Is he aware that 
British Columbia does not have the representation in the House of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that I paid 
particularly close attention to the issues of Quebec, but I know 
that all the provinces are penalized by the federal government's 
actions.  I can see the concerns of my colleague from B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows the budget was unfair.  Everyone understands that 
this government is centralizing.  Everyone, except the federal 
Liberals, understands that this government makes a mockery of 
provincial jurisdictions.  There is a problem.  There are only 
some 150 people in Canada who do not understand that there was 
nothing for the provinces in this budget and that there was 
nothing to promote development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support my colleague, and the Bloc Quebecois supports any 
cause that defends provincial jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his comments on the budget, many of 
which tend to dispel the myth the government is trying to create, 
the myth that this is a good news budget, the myth that is being 
perpetuated by the government's spending of millions of dollars 
to advertise it as a good news budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day the people in Halifax West and in various 
other ridings across the country will ask themselves whether they 
have a job, whether they will still have to stand in line for 
health care, whether they will get out from under the heavy 
student debt load they are experiencing, whether they will have a 
place to live, whether they will be getting EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very important issue that was not addressed by the budget 
was the question of a national shipbuilding policy for Canada, 
which would certainly help the Atlantic provinces with employment 
and with economic spin-off.  There was a meeting a while back 
which involved the parties, but the Liberals did not send anyone 
to it.  Will the member comment on whether the budget should have 
addressed the issue of a national shipbuilding policy?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, not too long ago, the Bloc 
Quebecois supported the unemployed in New Brunswick. This was a 
show of solidarity. We realize that the federal system is making 
people leave the Atlantic region in droves.

Quebeckers. They got rid of them. They will take care of them at

welcome the opportunity to participate in the budget debate.  I 
express gratitude to the people of Fredericton and in fact to all 
Canadians for the sacrifice and the patience they have shown in 
the last five or six years as we have attempted to deal with the 
deficit we inherited upon taking office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to understand the 1999 budget, we have to go back at 
least that far and recognize that in the sixties and seventies, 
with all the best and noble intentions, federal and provincial 
governments of all political stripes attempted to bring about 
regional equity in terms of economic development in Canada. 
I would also hasten to add that for the most part most of these 
programs worked.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take some offence to those who would suggest that this entire 
exercise that has been characterized as the welfare state has not 
been a success.  In a vast majority of cases it has been very 
successful.  But the country's economy did not grow at the rate 
that was anticipated, and as a result we were not able to sustain 
the rate of growth of some of these social programs. Very quickly 
it affected many Canadians in a way we would rather not have 
happened, but Canadians understood their responsibility, 
Canadians understood what government had to do and they made some 
very serious sacrifices. We owe Canadians a debt of thanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been able to make those programs sustainable into the 
next millennium.  We have been able to deal with the deficit 
which we inherited.  The 1999 budget is here and the deficit 
dragon has been slain as many have said and we are looking to 
reinvest around two fundamental areas. The first fundamental area 
around which we must invest is wealth generation.  The second is 
to determine the appropriate way in which the wealth that is 
generated serves the collective and public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government with this budget has demonstrated our position 
that economic growth in Canada will accompany a shift away from 
what for the last 100 years was almost entirely a resource based 
economy to a knowledge based economy. Hence there is a 
significant investment in all kinds of research. There is 
research around pure science, applied research, information based 
research, research in the social sciences and humanities, public 
policy and program research.  Health research has been mentioned 
by any number of speakers to this point.  There is also health 
care best practices and research into the new demographics and 
how we are going to deal with the aging population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own constituency of Fredericton has a significant IT industry 
employing thousands of engineers, computer programmers and others 
in the knowledge based industries, and that is growing every day. 
In fact our unemployment rate is 2% better than it was in 1993 
and that is in the face of tremendous restraint as a provincial 
capital, not only the restraint that was exercised by the federal 
government but also a period of restraint by the provincial 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Greater Fredericton Economic Development 
Corporation and Jacques Dubé who works with our municipalities, 
the province, the cities and municipal councils of Fredericton, 
Oromocto and New Maryland, with the chambers of commerce and the 
local labour development board, and most important in the face of 
the need to invest in knowledge and research, the universities, 
UNB and St. Thomas. I also have to pay tribute to ACOA, the 
regional economic development agency, for its foresight and good 
work.  It assists universities on a regular basis in a way which 
I think very often is unappreciated by some members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example I can think of as the kind of economic 
development opportunities that will spring out of this R and D is 
a small project at UNB.  It was announced in the last six months. 
It was financed through the transitional jobs fund, which has 
been characterized in other less flattering ways as a program by 
other members of the House.  In this case the transitional jobs 
fund was used to invest in a metal detection research project at 
UNB.  When items go through the metal detectors at airports and 
other places, it can be done with more sophistication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am reminded to mention that I am splitting my 
time with the Secretary of State for Science, Research and 
Development and Western Economic Diversification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project has already created jobs in Fredericton. It 
presents a wonderful opportunity for the kind of economic growth 
our region needs if we want to move beyond our traditional 
position of not being at the national average in numbers of 
unemployed and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our region felt the impact of the last five or six years more 
than most because we were so heavily dependent, whether it was on 
national defence or transfers from the government.  Therefore, 
when the federal government went through a period of restraint we 
felt it more than anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to take our place in line as we reinvest. 
We have dealt with the deficit and are dealing with the debt. 
As we reinvest it is very important that our region makes its 
case for the kind of investment that will allow us to step away 
from the traditional transfers that are so often associated with 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of government spending and the quality of life 
issues, it is obvious that the Government of Canada heard 
Canadians.  That is the reason it has made the significant 
investment of $1.5 billion in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to remind the House, particularly when I hear members of 
the Reform Party and Conservative Party talking about the money 
that is being restored is money that was cut earlier, in the 1995 
budget where the reduction in transfers to the provinces was 
announced, the official opposition had the opportunity to present 
a motion of non-confidence in the government. At that time 
significant cuts had been announced in terms of correcting the 
imbalance between revenues and expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it was not the cuts which caused the Reformers to 
suggest non-confidence in the government.  In fact, at that time 
the opposition said that the government did not cut enough. I 
remember this specifically because I was the chair of a caucus 
committee that was concerned about the CHST and the impact on our 
region and on provinces with less resources. Notwithstanding the 
current debate in terms of the health care system and so on, when 
those decisions were originally taken, we must remember the 
position of the opposition at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about the 1999 budget, in addition to what has been 
announced, we have also invested in children through the national 
child benefit.  We have invested in students through the 
millennium scholarship fund.  We have invested in research at the 
universities through the innovation foundation.  We have 
increased the CHST, the first time by $1.5 billion and we have 
increased it since then by an additional $11.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important to recognize because when the reductions were 
made in 1995 they affected universities, they affected welfare 
and they affected health. When we are talking about the money 
that has been restored, we have to talk about the money that has 
been restored for health, post-secondary education and welfare, 
all of this before the 1999 budget which has reinvested a 
significant amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of this, we have provided low and medium income tax 
relief.  We have invested $375 million in the quality of lives of 
the members of the armed forces.  This is very important to me as 
I represent CFB Gagetown in my constituency.  We have invested 
$400 million in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer my congratulations to the Minister of 
Finance and the Prime Minister for supporting the Minister of 
Finance and to all Canadians who have been the source of the 
sacrifice and the determination that has allowed this to happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as you probably know, last week the ministers of the crown were 
in the province of Quebec rightly correcting distortions Lucien 
Bouchard had made, which was to say that with 24% of the 
population, Quebec was not getting its fair share of money. These 
were absolute distortions.  As a matter of fact I would 
characterize them as lies that the premier of the province of 
Quebec was engaged in.  They correctly pointed out that instead 
of there being less than 24%, which represents the population, I 
believe the number was 32%, 33% or 34%, or whatever it is.  They 
were correcting the records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the member, I would also like to correct the 
record of the Liberals.  At the same time that Bouchard was 
putting out those ads, the Minister of Health was putting out ads 
talking about how health was the most important thing in the 
world to this government.  He was putting $3.5 billion in and 
$11.5 billion, all of these numbers, but forgetting completely, 
and as a matter of fact I charge distorting the truth, the fact 
that there has been—

question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if there has been $16 
billion taken out of health care—forget CHST and just talk about 
health care—and it will take the government five years to put a 
total of $11.5 billion back in, why should this be characterized 
as anything different from the kind of advertisements the premier 
of the province of Quebec put out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is half right; I 
think the premier of Quebec was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfers to the provinces around health are very 
complicated. Either the hon. member does not understand the 
complexity of these transfers or he is involving himself in the 
kind of activity he characterized others as being involved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made a significant shift in the way the provinces 
receive the funding from the federal government by way of tax 
credits, tax points.  Those tax points cannot ever totally deal 
with this problem because those parts of the country, such as New 
Brunswick, that do not have the same level of economic activity 
would not be able to provide the same level of activity as other 
richer provinces.  That is the reason the system was divided 
between tax points and cash transfers when those transfers were 
originally announced.  That is also the reason that in some 
period of time during the course of this, I think it was in 1981, 
that the cap was put on the transfers to the richer provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and the province of New Brunswick have taken the position that 
it is time we took those caps off. I am sure the member from 
British Columbia would welcome that decision.  As for the 
transfers, it is a lot more complicated than the hon. member 
would have us believe. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member opposite mentioned ACOA and economic development. 
ACOA has been a key player in the Canada infrastructure program, 
cost shared by the federal government, provinces and 
municipalities. This has aided a lot of small communities get 
basic infrastructure which they needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member tell me why there is nothing in the budget 
which would aid the continuation of this program for those vital 
infrastructure projects? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would share the member's 
enthusiasm for the infrastructure program and ACOA.  I only say 
the reason the budget did not contain another infrastructure 
announcement is that the Government of Canada decided to invest 
in health care, which is where Canadians wanted us to invest.  I 
look forward to the possibility of infrastructure investments in 
future budgets.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Science, Research 
and Development) (Western Economic Diversification), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to make a 
few comments on the budget, which I reviewed very closely and 
which I discussed with Canadians across the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made well over 50 calls and talked with well over 200 people 
about this budget.  I want to share some of their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people felt that it was really a very balanced approach to 
the finances, to handling or managing if you wish, the finances 
of the nation.  They were pleased with that. Clearly there were 
some who would have preferred a little more here or a bit more 
there, but overall I think it was fair and objective.  If we look 
at the newspapers and the people with whom we talked, the report 
would be an extremely positive one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly make the following points, the first one being 
about the tax reductions.  Some people have tried to pooh-pooh 
them, tried to say that they were too small, too modest.  Of 
course I would like, as I am sure my colleagues would like, to 
pay fewer taxes.  But the truth of the matter is that if one 
looks at what was done last year, add what was done this year, 
when all of that is implemented there will be $16 billion plus 
worth of tax reductions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with colleagues a very interesting fact.  Let us 
pretend for a moment that I have the authority to give every 
individual tax filer a dollar a day tax break.  Most people would 
say that is not a whole lot, and it is not really.  However, at 
the same time there are 15 million taxpayers in the country.  If 
we were to multiply the $15 million a day by 365 days a year, we 
would find the cost to the federal treasury in lost revenue would 
be $5.4 billion.  That is a whole lot of money.  It all depends 
on from what end we look at the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have tried to suggest that the transfers for health 
are not terribly significant.  Of course that is not true.  They 
are large.  They are immense at $11.5 billion over the next five 
years.  That is a lot of money.  A lot of people have not talked 
about the $1.4 billion in research which will permit a number of 
important initiatives to try to understand better what we get 
from the $80 billion expenditure in health in Canada on a yearly 
basis.  There are significant investments in health which are 
seen extremely positively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area of science, research and development has not been 
talked about a whole lot, a group of programs for which I have 
special responsibility.  I want to share with my colleagues some 
of the comments made with regard to those decisions.  I want to 
make sure they understand that they are not just coming from me.

1997 budget there was a massive investment of $800 million in the 
Canada Foundation for Innovation.  Then the budget of last year 
added to the granting councils and a number of other initiatives 
so we would be doing leading edge research, which is what we are 
talking about when we talk about a knowledge based society and a 
knowledge based economy.

knowledge.  It is clear that the budget reinforces key measures 
taken in previous budgets.  I have mentioned those.  It is clear 
that we have announced an innovation strategy that reinforces key 
building blocks for renewing Canada's knowledge based economy. 
The key building blocks are there for improving that which we 
have, renewing Canada's knowledge base, clearly investing in 
research and development and innovation, and supporting the 
commercialization of knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget sets a direction for reducing our level of taxes to 
make Canada a location of choice for knowledge workers to live

takes a number of positive steps in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the $1.8 billion invested in science, research

area?  We have invested in the Canadian Foundation for

considerable funding for minorities, who will now be in a better

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
budget '99 did not give any meaningful tax relief to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the budget discriminated against parents who chose to 
stay home to take care of their children.  The budget did not 
make any significant efforts to pay off the debt.  The budget did 
not do anything for small businesses.  They are completely left 
out of the loop in the budget.  The government's $24 billion in 
cuts since 1993 have caused the destruction of our health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member ask his government to cancel the damage 
control ad that is running in the newspaper, wasting millions of 
Canadian taxpayer dollars?  Is this not simply an ad to hide a 
pay more, get less budget? 
This ad denies Canadians the right to know or the right to 
express themselves.  It is a campaign to deny that the budget 
destroys health care.  Will the member ask his government to stop 
that ad?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for the question.  I would have hoped he might have been a bit 
more objective.  Clearly the government has a responsibility to 
inform Canadians with regard to the programs it has and to the 
decisions it has made in the budget.  That is exactly what is 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the comments about destroying the health care 
system, this is absolute nonsense.  We had a $42 billion deficit 
when we came into power.  That has been eradicated.  What has 
been the major investment that has been undertaken subsequent to 
that?  It has been in health with $11.5 billion dollars in 
transfer over five years to the provinces.  There will be $1.4 
billion to undertake research which will improve the quality of 
health care for all Canadians throughout the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the other comments that he made, particularly 
the reduction of taxes, I indicated how superficial the Reform 
Party agreement is.  If we gave a dollar a day tax reduction to 
the 15 million Canadians who file taxes, it would cost the 
government $15 million a day.  In one year it would cost $5.4 
billion.  Does Reform not get it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first, I am sure the hon. member recognizes that the deficit was 
put there by previous Liberal governments.  I know he will take 
responsibility for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quickly touch on two issues.  One is the $5.4 
billion per year.  I assume if a dollar a day per taxpayer adds 
up to $5.4 billion per year the hon. member recognizes that when 
his government charges a dollar a day to the taxpayers of Canada 
it also generates revenue of $5.4 billion per year, which it has 
been increasing and not decreasing over the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question about research and development.  I give full 
marks for the dollars being put back into the budget for research 
and development.  Would he touch on the Canadian aerospace funds 
of $400 million which were recently detailed in the WTO report as 
being an illegal subsidy to Canadian aerospace? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have three points 
to make.  I would have hoped my colleague from the Conservative 
Party would have been a bit clearer and more precise than my 
colleague from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over nine years the Tories let the debt climb to almost $600 
billion; they almost tripled it in nine years.  When we came into 
power in 1993 the debt was $190 billion.  It took us about four 
years to get it down to zero.  He wants to forget that, but I 
will not let him forget and neither will my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the TPC he should know that we are following the 
interim report very closely.  We want to make sure that we 
respond in an appropriate kind of manner.  I assure my colleague 
that we will do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the overall investments in science, research and 
technology, this is good news for all Canadians: young Canadians 
and people who want to stay in Canada.  This is good news for 
Manitoba.  This is good news for every province and each of the 
three territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleague will stand and applaud the government's 
decisions in that area as well as decisions in other areas such 
as gradual tax reductions which will accumulate and will 
translate into significant savings.  We are not pie in the sky. 
We will not promise something we cannot sustain and then have to 
remove.  We will do it step by step and we will get there just 
like we did with the elimination of the deficit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
while the Tory members and the Liberal members are arguing with 
each other about whose to blame, I can categorically say that 
they are both to blame for the sorry state of affairs in Canada 
today.  I will be sharing my time in debating the budget with the 
member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberal government came to power 500,000 more Canadian

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget we are debating today the finance minister 
announced $300 million for the national child tax benefit.  I 
know there are some members from the government who will argue 
that this was a noble gesture, but we have to say it is one that 
does absolutely nothing to address the fundamental flaws in the 
benefit systems, namely that it is not indexed to inflation and 
it does nothing to assist the poorest of the poor, kids and 
parents who are on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This last policy is in keeping with a continual bashing of poor 
people by this government and the government before it. It is 
really abysmal that the last time a federal budget increased 
support for families on social assistance was in 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deindexing of the child tax benefit means that the value of the 
child benefit declines in real terms by 3% each year.  It really 
allows the government to get away with saying that it is actually 
increasing dollars to kids in working poor families while knowing 
full well that those dollars will be recouped.  It is part of a 
culture of deception, a culture that has been cultivated by the 
finance minister and by this government. This budget fails 
Canadian children again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also fails the homeless.  The federal budget is a 
national disgrace on housing and homelessness.  Not a single 
penny has been allocated for new spending and this means no new 
social housing units this year and no money for homelessness 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A serious federal response to this disaster requires money to be 
put on the table.  This budget was the ideal time for the federal 
government to show us it is ready to take on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January and February of this year I visited large urban 
centres and smaller communities across Canada to see for myself 
the consequences of deliberate public policies that leave Canada 
with the dubious distinction of being the only industrialized 
country in the world without a national housing strategy. What I 
saw, what I heard and what I experienced shocked me and should 
shock the finance minister, as the issue of growing poverty and 
homelessness becomes even more visible and more tragic as more 
people die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every community I visited I was struck by three basic issues, 
the lack of adequate incomes and high rents that drive people 
into poverty, the impact of the lack of new social housing 
construction, and the desperate need to improve and maintain the 
standard of low income market housing starts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget was an opportunity for the finance minister to 
recall his own words in 1990.  I will recall those words for him. 
Then in official opposition as chair of the Liberal Party's task 
force on housing, the now finance minister condemned the Tory 
government for doing nothing while the housing crisis continued 
to grow out of control: “The government sits there and does 
nothing.  It refuses to apply the urgent measures that are 
required to rebirth this deteriorating situation.  The lack of 
affordable housing contributes to and accelerates the cycle of 
poverty which is reprehensible in a society as rich as ours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years later the finance minister steamrolled his own 
report and in its place introduced a budget that slashed all 
federal funding for the creation of new social housing.  That 
single act alone meant that 75,000 new social housing units that 
had been targeted for construction were never built.  This was a 
decision that has now denied tens of thousands of families the 
right to decent and affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget comes at a time when Canada is facing one of its 
largest national disasters in its history.  The big city mayors, 
the city councils of Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa-Carleton, Nepean, 
over 400 organizations and 1,200 individuals have recognized the 
homelessness crisis in Canada as a national disaster. However, in 
no way does this budget even begin to address this disaster, 
thereby condemning hundreds of thousands of people to struggle in 
misery, even risking death, without federal relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also comes at a time when the Prime Minister has 
been invited numerous times by the mayor of Toronto, the Toronto 
<I>Star</I>, the Toronto disaster relief committee, and the leader 
of the NDP to tour the disaster in the city of Toronto and to see 
with his own eyes the destruction it has wrought on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it is the Prime Minister's responsibility to review 
the disaster that is the direct result of his government's 
policies, he has not apparently had the time nor the commitment 
to do this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe if the Prime Minister or the finance minister saw the 
crisis firsthand like I have done, they would be moved to action. 
Anything less, and this budget is much less, is a devastating 
shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget also fails Canadians on health care.  Let us put the 
so-called health budget in perspective.  Liberal cuts to the 
Canadian health and social transfer since 1995 now amount to 
$21.5 billion.  More than half of that was in health care 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year the budget puts back only $2 billion, not exactly the 
cause for celebration that we have been led to believe.  Members 
of the government keep repeating $11.5 billion. That is what they 
want us to remember about this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they want us to forget is that $11.5 billion is spread out 
over five years and only puts back half of what has been taken 
out. It gets worse.  We will not get the ongoing benefit of the 
$11.5 billion because it is not cumulative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of the next five years, only $2.5 billion will have 
been permanently added to the transfer.  It is like a wage bonus 
instead of a wage increase.  It is a one time fix that really 
leaves us no further ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the federal share of health spending is not going to 
change significantly either.  This is a real measure of what has 
happened in terms of public policy around health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When medicare began, the federal-provincial ratio was 50% 
federal dollars and 50% provincial dollars.  When the Liberals 
came to power, the federal share dropped to 18%.  Now it is down 
to 11%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In five years after this so-called reinvestment in health care, 
we will only be back up to 12.5%.  We have to ask how much clout 
will 12.5% buy with provinces that are sliding toward two tier 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall this budget, despite being characterized as a good news 
budget, actually widens the gap between the rich and the poor. 
Information from the National Anti-Poverty Organization has made 
it clear that if we look at two single people, one earning 
$15,000 and one earning $100,000 and apply the so-called tax 
relief measures in this budget, in actual fact the gap between 
their incomes will actually increase by $658.  It is very clear 
that this budget is actually increasing inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On education as well this budget gets a failing grade.  I was at 
a community college in Vancouver, Langara Community College, just 
the other day talking to students.  They asked me whether there 
was anything in this budget that would help students with the 
incredible student debtload they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I searched high and low.  I went through every page.  There is 
not a single item in this budget that will assist students in 
Canada who are now reeling and suffering from high tuition fees 
and student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Canadian Council on Social Development gives this 
budget an F, a failing grade, when it comes to post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has also failed unemployed workers who are still 
suffering from the massive cutbacks to the unemployment insurance 
program while the $20 billion surplus sits there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to say to the government that this budget has failed 
Canadians who are most in need.  I heard a Liberal member earlier 
talk about the sacrifices that have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in my riding of Vancouver East who are still 
hurting, who are still unemployed, who are still on the street,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to first of all congratulate and commend my hon. colleague 
for her very relevant remarks on this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She mentioned the gap widening between the rich and the poor. 
She talked about how this budget affects those who are most in 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small community in my riding of Halifax West, a black 
community called Upper Hammonds Plains, is adjacent to a large 
water supply which is the water supply for Halifax and Dartmouth. 
The water supply runs right past this community.  In fact, land 
was taken from this community to make this water supply 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people do not get water.  Seniors, young people, people 
within the community cannot get water unless they pay an 
astronomical price to hook up.  Yet this budget could have 
resolved that kind of problem by putting money into an 
infrastructure program that would enable a project to go ahead to 
give water to this community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of how this budget has not really dealt 
with the very real problems of people within communities that are 
necessary to be dealt with in order for people to progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree that programs of this nature should 
have been included in the budget programs aiming at the homeless, 
seniors, young people and so forth?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is true that one can go 
to any community in Canada and see very critical situations where 
local communities have devised the solutions that are necessary 
but which lack, in many cases, the federal resources such as an 
infrastructure program.  The Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities has been calling for a nationally shared 
infrastructure program to do exactly the kinds of things the 
member describes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also visited communities in the far north of Manitoba with my 
colleague from Churchill.  These communities basically had people 
living in homes with no sewage or water hook-up.  It is 
unbelievable to think that this still exists in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree with the hon. member that these kinds of basic 
necessities are things that should have been addressed not only 
in this budget, but because of the massive cutbacks that we have 
seen since 1993 we now have a crisis situation in many of these 
smaller communities and certainly in the larger cities as well. 
We still see people who are trying to get by even without the 
very daily essentials of shelter, water, adequate housing, 
adequate income, food and so on.

congratulate my colleague from Vancouver, who toured the country 
and who has seen first hand how this government has hurt the 
homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI changes mean that 800,000 Canadians no longer qualify for

</I></B></P><P align=left>What impression did my colleague form in touring the country?  I 
would like to know if the comments I heard about employment 
insurance were similar to those she heard, both from those who 
no longer qualified for EI benefits and from the homeless. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in our travels across 
Canada and looking at emergency shelters, talking to activists 
and people living in shelters or on the street, I talked to them 
about homelessness and housing.  My colleague talked to 
unemployed workers who were suffering because of the EI cutbacks. 
We heard much the same thing.  I talked to unemployed 
construction workers who were living in emergency shelters 
because their last unemployment insurance cheque had run out. 
They were now waiting to go on welfare because they had no 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprisingly, I also talked to employed construction workers who 
were living in emergency shelters in Toronto.  They found the 
rents were too high for their low wages.  Because they were 
involved in short term work, they knew they would not qualify for 
EI and would then face with a situation where they could not 
afford adequate housing because of the unaffordable rents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cutbacks to the EI program are directly contributing to the 
increase in poverty and homelessness in Canada.  If anyone does 
not believe that they should visit a shelter and talk to people 
to find out what the reality is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the 
1999 federal government budget which I and my colleagues believe 
is increasingly being recognized more for its usefulness as a 
public relations tool than for its substantive impact on the 
lives of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by following up on the comments made by a 
colleague of mine, the Liberal member for Saint Boniface, who 
tried to suggest that it was perfectly legitimate for this 
government to spend $3.6 million advertising this budget on the 
grounds that it was providing some sort of public service to 
Canadians. 
I would urge all members across the way to look at the ads, 
listen to the radio ads and tell me where there is any element of 
public service.  It is absolutely clear that the expenditure of 
$3.6 million does nothing more than provide a public relations 
exercise for this government to deal with its political crisis. 
It is sheer propaganda.  There is no public service in those ads. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the question:  Is it not obvious that these ads are 
necessary because the government failed to convince Canadians 
that this truly was a health care budget?  Is it the case that 
Canadians, and particularly Manitobans, are seeing through this 
government's propaganda and in fact recognizing that the Liberals 
are putting back a little bit of what they took out of our health 
care system and acknowledging that we are in this crisis today in 
large measure because of Liberal government policy to begin with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question today and every day will be:  Will the government 
put all of the money that is available for health care into 
patient care and not into propaganda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two criteria by which one must address any federal 
budget.  The first is to ask the question:  Does the budget serve 
as a road map for achieving the stated objectives and goals of the 
government?  The dilemma for the government is:  How does it map 
out a strategy if it has not been able to recognize the critical 
nature of the health care system or to recognize its own 
responsibility and culpability in the chaos that we are now 
finding in our health care system right across this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to remind my colleagues in the House that it was 
just a couple of months ago that members on the Liberal benches 
stood in the House and suggested that there was not a crisis in 
our health care system.  They ridiculed members in my caucus and, 
by implication, all Canadians who were raising concerns about the 
crisis that we were finding in health care systems from one end 
of this country to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that all across Canada—and Canadians know 
this—years of federal neglect and cutbacks have taken their 
toll.  But the fact that the Liberal government felt compelled to 
come up with a so-called health budget resulted from the cries 
and pleas of hundreds of thousands of Canadians who faxed, who 
wrote, who spoke out, who yelled from the rooftops about the 
impact of federal Liberal decisions on our health care system. 
It was only with constant public and political pressure, and a 
relentless stream of individual horror stories, that the 
government finally was forced to at least acknowledge some of the 
problems at play in Canada's health care system and to put some 
money back into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other criteria by which one must analyse any federal budget 
is to ask whether the budget seeks to improve the lives of 
Canadians.  How does it shape the economic and social realities 
of its citizens? The main purpose of a budget is to show 
Canadians what are its values, what are its priorities and it 
makes political choices based on those priorities and values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government then chooses a tax break of $8,000 for a 
millionaire and does nothing for a single parent on social 
assistance, it shows that its values are fundamentally one sided. 
When it engages in incredible hoopla about a health care budget 
but fails to address the long term survival of Canada's health 
care system, it shows that the priorities of the government are 
shortsighted and politically motivated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have now had a chance to look closely at this 
so-called health budget.  In their reflection I think they bring 
to mind that old saying “If you are starving you do not refuse a 
meal”.  The fact that there is money for health care is 
certainly an improvement after years of cuts.  I will acknowledge 
that and my colleagues have acknowledged that.  Health 
researchers have indicated that they are pleased there is some 
additional money for them.  Nurses, although still worried about 
how they will survive in their jobs, have acknowledged that at 
least the government is prepared to spend a little money to look 
into the problems of the profession.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, after all is said and done, it is clear to Canadians 
with every day that passes that there is very little in this 
budget to ensure the preservation and strengthening of medicare 
in this country.  There is absolutely no attempt to look at and 
address the root causes of ill health and there was not even a 
signal that this government is prepared to keep up to its 
promises around a national home care plan and a national drug 
plan, both of which are desperately needed in this country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so striking about this budget, when we strip away all 
the hype, is just how little it offers.  This is truly a lesson 
in underachievement.  It may solve the Liberals' political 
crisis, but it does not come close to solving the Canadian health 
care crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there ever was an opportunity to take dramatic steps to set 
things right after the damage this government has done, this was 
it.  The deficit was gone and enough surplus money was there to 
make a difference.  But instead, by holding back, Canadians will 
have to wait five years just to return to where they were on 
health care in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us for a second put the health budget in perspective. 
Liberal cuts to the Canada health and social transfer since 1995 
now amount to $21.5 billion and more than half of that is in 
health funding.  This year the budget puts back only $2 billion, 
not quite the cause for celebration we have been led to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government keep repeating $11.5 billion.  That is 
what they want us to remember about the budget.  What they want 
us to forget is that the $11.5 billion is spread over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse.  We will not get the ongoing benefit of the $11.5 
billion because it is not cumulative.  By the end of the next 
five years only $2.5 billion will have been permanently added to 
the transfer.  It is like a wage bonus, instead of a wage 
increase.  It is a one time fix that leaves us no further ahead. 
Where does that put us in terms of the federal share of health 
care spending in this country?  Where does that put us from the 
days when it used to be 50:50 federal-provincial cost sharing? 
Where does it put us in terms of when this government took over 
in 1993, holding an 18% share of health care spending in this 
country?  At the end of five years this budget, by all accounts, 
will get us up to 12.5% of all health care spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all members opposite of the advice of their former 
adviser, Tom Kent, who said that it is absolutely imperative as a 
starting point for the federal share to get as quickly as 
possible up to 25%.  Only then will we have the ability to ensure 
that medicare is preserved, strengthened and enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made a small step toward accepting the blame 
for the health care crisis that it has contributed to.  There is 
some repentance in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our challenge to all members of the Liberal government is to 
develop policies, think creatively and pursue noble goals around 
actually preserving our medicare model.  It will not happen at 
this rate.  The private control of health care is increasing at a 
rapid rate.  Members across the way, especially those from 
Ontario, will know what has happened to the home care system in 
that province and how big, private owned American companies like 
Olsten are taking over the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members opposite to join with us in preserving medicare 
and ensuring that the principles of medicare are applied to the 
whole continuum of care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend my hon. colleague for her very important remarks 
concerning the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One important point that she raised with respect to the budget 
was, as a measurement, one should ask the question:  Does it seek 
to improve the lives of Canadians?  I think that is a very 
important point.  We know that over the past number of years the 
government has been taking a very close look at equal pay for 
work of equal value. 
There have been a lot of studies and negotiations and a decision 
was rendered in terms of certain occupational categories to show 
that the people in those categories were not being paid properly 
and yet the government insists on not correcting that situation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not see anything in the budget which would work toward 
improving the lives of those Canadians who have been underpaid, a 
lot of them female in a lot of the categories.  I did not see 
anything in the budget that would help to improve the lives of 
those Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member care to comment on my observations in that 
regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question from my colleague.  It is a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask the question:  How can this be called a health 
care budget when there is nothing in it to deal with the economic 
and social disparities in our society which contribute to ill 
health, disease and poor quality of life?  How can it be 
fathomed, this being a federal health budget, when we have third 
world conditions on reserves and when a reserve such as God's 
Lake Narrows in my province of Manitoba has just reported 12 
cases of TB?  That certainly is an important issue that the 
government has failed to address.  There must be a focus on 
disease prevention and health promotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue my colleague raised concerned economic 
disparities.  As the gap grows between the rich and the poor and 
those at the low end of the wage scale do not see any benefit and 
are not able to improve their quality of life or even their 
ability to survive on a day to day basis, how does that affect 
their health?  We know from study after study that money may not 
buy happiness, but it certainly does buy health.  We know that 
when one's income improves, one's health also improves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern with the budget is not only its failure to 
acknowledge that, but that it actually worsens the situation by 
not dealing with unemployment, by not dealing with wage 
inequities, by not dealing with homelessness, by not dealing with 
poverty and by not dealing with deplorable living conditions on 
and off reserves in the country.  This government is actually 
contributing to ill health and the spread of disease in the 
country and it is not doing one thing to build a healthier 
society over the long term. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Cambridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to compare the content of the 1999 
budget with the results of my pre-budget consultations.  In doing 
so I challenge the opposition's thesis that this is a budget 
which ignores the priorities of Canadians and does not address 
the concerns and issues facing Canadians today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During August, September and October I held numerous meetings 
with various groups of constituents, including local business 
representatives, community activists, a local Rotary chapter, 
members of the Women Entrepreneurs of Canada and an arts focus 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I solicited input for the budget from constituents 
through my summer householder and I received numerous calls and 
letters with additional suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At all of my consultations I distributed two budget charts.  One 
chart clearly demonstrated that for the 1998-99 financial year 
the interest payment was estimated at $44 billion.  Moreover, the 
chart also clearly indicated that an operating surplus of $47 
billion existed prior to the interest payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget chart number two analyzed interest rate sensitivity and 
showed how significantly the interest expense increased with 
minor increases in interest rates.  An increase from 7.2% to 7.5% 
triggered an additional charge of $1.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report that my consultations produced the 
following results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, paying down the debt was the recommendation most often 
made.  Virtually everyone thought that some form of action was 
necessary.  Many constituents felt that paying down the debt was 
the best way of reducing future interest expenses.  Constituents 
also noted that our current debt level leaves us vulnerable to a 
recession and rising interest rates. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245
<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second and on the other hand, very few argue that debt reduction 
should be the government's singular priority.  Most felt that we 
should be able to reduce debt and address one or more other 
needs.  A close second to paying down the debt was restoring 
funding to health care with increased emphasis on preventive and 
home care approaches.  The great majority called for the federal 
government to restore the health care component of the provincial 
transfers.  Constituents specifically noted the reduction in the 
number of hospital beds, the waiting time for emergency treatment 
and that the waiting lists for surgery had become intolerable 
especially in the province of Ontario. Constituents also felt 
that the health care system needed more innovation and 
flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week or so before the budget I met with a constituent of mine, 
Mr. Sam Dionofio, a member of the executive committee of the 
volunteer board of the Heart and Stroke Foundation.  He 
encouraged me to support funding for the Canadian institutes of 
health research which in turn would greatly enhance 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health research.  He advised 
me that the Canadian institutes of health research represents an 
opportunity to greatly expand Canada's health research efforts 
and Canadian productivity.  It would ensure that our health 
research capacity is strengthened relative to the changing global 
environment and he urged me to note that health research 
represents an investment in our future and economic well-being. 
While debt repayment was also cited as a priority the previous 
year, this year health care priority and health care spending 
showed a marked increase as a concern by my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third and interestingly enough, there was no widespread call for 
major tax cuts but a reduction of almost every tax was more or 
less mentioned once or twice.  However, most constituents felt 
that if the government were to cut taxes, the greatest consensus 
was for general tax relief for low income people.  Other tax 
changes included cutting employment insurance premiums. I was 
delighted to see that the top priorities of my constituents were 
also the top priorities of the government and that they were 
addressed in the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget takes action on three fronts.  First, it 
maintains sound economic and financial management.  Second, it 
invests in key economic and social priorities.  Third, it 
provides tax relief and improves tax fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget acknowledges that strong economic growth and a 
reduced debt burden better enable the government to fight tax 
relief and thereby make key investments.  This is why the 1999 
budget confirms that the era of deficit financing is over and 
that the government will continue to deliver balanced budgets or 
better again this year, in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001.  This will 
be only the third time since Confederation that the federal 
government has been deficit free for at least four consecutive 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget goes even further.  It acknowledges that another key 
issue for any nation is its national debt.  Last year Canada's 
debt to GDP ratio saw its largest single yearly decline since 
1956-57, from 70.3% to 66.9%.  In the current fiscal year of 
1998-99 it should still fall to about 65.3%.  By 2000-01 the debt 
ratio should be down to just under 62%.  This progress on debt 
reduction brings with it real bottom line benefits to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995-96 when the debt to GDP ratio was at its peak, 36 cents 
out of every federal revenue dollar went to paying interest on 
the debt.  Last year with the debt ratio dropping, the portion of 
each revenue dollar servicing the debt fell to 27 cents. What 
does this mean to Canadians?  It means that we are freeing up 
moneys to strengthen health care, access to knowledge, to provide 
needed tax relief, to fight child poverty and to invest in a more 
productive economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to keeping the debt to GDP ratio on 
a downward path.  A key element of this strategy is a debt 
repayment plan. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to present a fiscal plan which will 
include a contingency reserve as a buffer against unexpected 
financial pressures.  The current plan contains a contingency 
reserve of $3 billion each year.  When that contingency reserve 
is not needed, such as last year, it will go directly to paying 
down the public debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I wish to address the budget's investment in key 
economic and social priorities by investing in health care, 
research and innovation and other key areas to improve Canadians' 
ability to work and to improve their quality of life.  Action to 
sustain and strengthen health care is a key priority of this 
government and a central initiative of the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget announced that the provinces and territories will 
receive from the federal government an additional $11.5 billion 
over the next five years specifically for health care.  This 
funding marks the largest investment this government has ever 
made.  This investment is helping our provinces deal with 
Canadians' concerns about health care, waiting lists, crowded 
emergency rooms and diagnostic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the commitment to strengthening health care does not 
stop there.  Among other things, the budget announced that the 
federal government will further invest in research and health 
problem prevention.  Specifically, funding for health research 
and innovation was increased by $500 million.  Of these moneys 
the budget set aside $240 million to support the Canadian 
institutes of health research, the innovative proposal developed 
to integrate health research relayed to me by my constituent, Mr. 
Dionofvio.  The proposal was wholeheartedly supported by the 
Heart and Stroke Foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last but not least, the budget also invests $287 million to 
improve efforts to prevent health problems from occurring.  One 
of these initiatives includes $75 million to the Canadian 
prenatal nutrition program to help high risk pregnant women to 
have healthy babies.  In the past the Women's Health Centre and 
the Parkdale parents primary prevention program at St. Joseph's 
Hospital in my riding have been beneficiaries of this program 
which, in turn, has benefited new born babies ensuring that they 
have a healthier start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by quoting a statement made by the Minister of 
Finance when he visited my riding in November: “We understand 
where our priorities lie.  We will balance the books and we will 
pay down the debt, but we will do so much more.  This great 
nation is more than a balance sheet”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the 1999 budget not only attains the goals noted 
in the Minister of Finance's statement but it also embodies the 
spirit of that statement.  We are building today for a better 
tomorrow. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of quick questions for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday Stats Canada came out with a report that said personal 
incomes grew last year at one of the fastest paces of this 
decade.  We applaud that.  But it still was not enough to keep up 
with the even faster rate at which governments are pulling money 
out of Canadian pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to respond to what Stats Canada has said. Also, 
in 1993 when we came to this parliament it was announced that we 
had to do something.  There were 1 million children living in 
poverty.  Now we have 1.5 million.  These miracle workers over 
there have not solved that problem.  Will this be the budget of 
budgets that will take care of those difficulties?  I would like 
her response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for quoting me some statistics. I would like to quote him some 
statistics as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that in 1998 453,000 jobs were created.  Another 87,000 
jobs were created in January.  Unemployment is down to 7.8%.  I 
submit that the plan put in place by this government in the last 
budget and since 1993 has been working.  The statistics prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to child poverty, this government is to be 
commended for what it has done.  In the 1997 budget $8.5 million 
was put into the Canada child tax benefit.  In last year's budget 
there was another $8.5 million for a total of $17 million.  In 
the 1999 budget there is another $300 million for low income 
families and children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have great respect for the previous speaker from the 
Liberal Party and I have a very simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member know how much was in the EI surplus or how much 
is in it and can she tell the House, in her opinion, where it is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I have the same great respect for him as he 
has for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my hon. colleague across the way that there is no 
surplus.  I suggest the member look at the budget sheets we have. 
Income goes in under the consolidated revenue fund and expenses 
are made.  There is no surplus fund.  There is no reserve fund. I 
believe the media feed these things that are not true. It does 
not exist and has not existed since 1986. One of the concerns 
noted by my constituents is to bring EI rates down and they have 
actually come down. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member mentioned in her dissertation the effect that 
interest rates have on the deficit and the paying off of the debt 
and the deficit.  Is the member aware that the Canadian Bond 
Rating Service has criticized the last budget as being heavy on 
spending and light on tax and debt relief?  In fact, that could 
reflect an increase in interest rates and this government 
obviously would then have to pay more money in order to service 
the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have the member indicate what the long term plan 
of the government is to retiring that debt. We see a contingency 
fund of $3 billion that will be used to retire the debt only if 
it is not used for something else.  Perhaps the member would like 
to answer those two questions regarding interest rates and the 
contingency plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, not being an economic 
expert I cannot really comment on the bond ratings. One of the 
things this government is trying to do through our debt payment 
plan, which I noted during my discourse, is reduce the debt to 
keep interest rates down.  That is the way to keep them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the fears mentioned by my constituents was that by not 
paying down that debt, by not paying attention to that debt, we 
will have a problem and we will be subject to interest rates 
going up.  The interest rate sensitivity is important and it is 
also equally important that we continue to pay down that debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I think this plan of action the government has speaks for 
itself: 7.8% unemployment and more jobs created in this country 
than in any other G-7 country.  I submit the Minister of Finance 
is on the right track. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address the budget tabled on February 16 by the hon. 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by congratulating the hon. minister on his sixth budget. 
This is a budget that once again confirms that the era of 
deficit financing is over.  This is the second year in a row for 
a balanced budget.  The minister should be particularly proud of 
his accomplishment given that this has not been done since 
1951-52. The Minister of Finance also deserves credit for 
listening to Canadians and for his strong leadership on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget incorporates many suggestions made by constituents 
from my riding of Cambridge who are members of my community 
advisory council.  In particular, the minister has listened to 
their suggestions about how to address the health care crisis, 
the need for greater accountability in health care and the need 
for tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal government took office in 1993, we inherited a 
$42 billion deficit and in just four years we had moved to a $3.5 
billion surplus.  Today with another surplus we are starting to 
see the results of the deficit battle and we are working to 
improve the quality of life for all Canadians in three key areas, 
health care, knowledge and innovation, and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first and the largest investment, I should say reinvestment, 
is in our health care system.  Medicare is one of our most 
cherished social programs. 
It guarantees to all Canadians regardless of their financial 
means equal access to high quality care services based on need, 
not ability to pay. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of my community advisory council have told me, the 
number one priority of our health care system should be to heal 
people.  In order to do that it is vital that we identify 
priorities and spend resources responsibly. That is why this 
budget announced that the provinces and territories will receive 
$11.5 billion.  There will be a $3.5 billion immediate one time 
supplement with a remaining $8 billion to be provided over the 
next four years.  This is an investment to help provinces, and 
communities like Cambridge, deal with immediate health care 
concerns, waiting lists, crowded emergency rooms and diagnostic 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment to strengthen health care does not end there. 
The 1999 budget also announced that the government would further 
invest about $1.4 billion in health information systems, 
research, first nations and Inuit health services, and health 
problem prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course good health and effective health care are much more 
than an issue of hospitals and clinics. Canadians want and 
deserve to know how their health care dollars are being spent and 
with what results.  They want more accountability.  This budget 
will help to deliver that by investing nearly $330 million in 
health information initiatives such as building a national health 
surveillance network to electronically link laboratories and 
public health offices across the country; by establishing a 
Canada health network, accessible by computer and telephone; and 
by providing better reports on the health of Canadians and the 
functioning of the health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, this budget invests $287 million to improve efforts to 
prevent health problems from occurring.  These initiatives 
include:  the Canada prenatal nutrition program; modernizing and 
strengthening the federal food safety program; improving the 
management and control of toxic substances in the environment, in 
food and in drinking water; continuing to explore innovative 
approaches in the area of rural and community health; and 
combating diabetes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also makes a significant $550 million cash infusion 
into funding for health research and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already outlined the government's significant investment 
in health and medical research.  The budget also takes additional 
steps to promote knowledge and innovation with a $1.8 billion 
investment over this fiscal year and the next three years. 
Included in this $1.8 billion will be an additional $200 million 
for the Canada Foundation for Innovation to support world class 
research infrastructure in the areas of health, the environment, 
science and engineering; $60 million to establish one smart 
community demonstration project in each province; $60 million for 
the GeoConnections initiative; and an additional $90 million for 
the networks of centres of excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final two elements of this budget's investment in knowledge 
and innovation are especially relevant to many businesses in my 
riding of Cambridge.  This government understands the benefits of 
investing in knowledge and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third most important element of the 1999 budget is tax 
relief.  Our government is committed to substantially reducing 
taxes as and when we can and in the fairest way possible. This 
budget proves that. However, we must not forget that for tax 
relief to be permanent, it must be affordable and not jeopardize 
the soundness of Canada's finances.  As resources become 
available, the government will provide as much tax relief as 
possible.  This will occur year after year with each budget 
building on the progress made this year and the years before. 
This is the responsible way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is doing well.  We are deficit free.  Our unemployment 
rate while still too high at 7.8% is the lowest it has been since 
1990.  We are outpacing the rate of job creation in any other G-7 
country:  368,000 jobs in 1997 and 453,000 in 1998 and there are 
additional measures in this budget that will continue this trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are staying the course.  We are investing in key national 
priorities such as health care, job creation and tax relief.  We 
are continuing to pay down our national debt.  We are providing a 
balanced approach to government and fiscal management and 
Canadians are starting to see the results. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member in his comments made reference to the many 
suggestions received by his constituents prior to the budget. The 
hon. member who spoke before him made the same comment.  I 
certainly want to commend them on that very important aspect of a 
parliamentarian's work, that is, consulting with constituents and 
getting that kind of input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that certain statistics were cited about jobs that were 
created.  We all know that statistics can be interpreted and 
phrased in a way to say what we want them to say.  I tend to look 
at what is really happening in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at my riding of Halifax West and in other parts of 
my province, I see industries closing down.  The Volvo plant was 
shut down in Halifax which put many people out of work.  In Cape 
Breton there is the Devco situation and the phasing out of the 
mine which is putting people out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We end up with a vicious circle. People are out of work.  I do 
not see in the budget any real commitment to have a plan to 
offset those kinds of disadvantages. We get a circle where people 
become unemployed and it is difficult for them to get EI because 
the criteria are much more strict than it used to be.  It is 
difficult to get training. This perhaps leads to health problems, 
depression, family breakdown.  We are right back to needing 
additional health care and additional services to carry on to 
meet the needs of the people who suffer from being unemployed. 
Any money that was put in to this great health budget is very 
quickly eaten up, to the point where we are worse off than we 
were before if we do not tackle the industry problems and those 
kinds of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, what is being done?   What concrete 
measures have been taken to offset the kinds of problems I cited 
that lead to unemployment and a downturn in the economy in my 
area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that way back my community of Cambridge was 
considered to be the shoe industry capital of Canada.  The shoe 
industry died out and the high technology industry moved in. Only 
five years ago the unemployment rate was 11.2% and today it is 
7.8%, but it is still too high.  Fortunately for my community the 
high technology industry is growing and prospering. I understand 
the situation is not the same in other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this fiscal approach to economic growth, I believe that the 
private sector will continue to create jobs.  Hopefully jobs will 
be created in the hon. member's community as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, would the hon. member not admit that what the federal 
government has done over the past five or six years is to 
download its responsibilities for Canadians in various social 
services to the provinces, and because of the belt tightening by 
the federal government the provinces have now had to download 
their responsibilities to the municipalities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there is a municipality in Canada that has not 
suffered from a lack of provincial funding in terms of municipal 
services. The provinces turn around and say that it is because of 
a lack of federal funding for the various concerns, whether it be 
infrastructure, education or health. 
Would the member not agree that that was basically the premise of 
the federal government?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree that the $7 billion for this year alone taken 
from unemployed workers and employers who also pay that premium, 
money that does not belong to the federal government, is really 
the basis for the surplus of this budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I was elected, I 
worked in a factory in the automotive industry.  I contributed to 
the unemployment fund.  I was lucky that in 25 years I did not 
draw from that fund for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member remembers the fiscal situation of this nation 
in 1993 and can compare it to the situation today.  He should 
recognize there is a confidence among Canadians in this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to point fingers at any government of the past 30 
years.  We as a society enjoyed life and handouts, but the time 
has come when we cannot afford to hand out and spend, spend and 
spend. Today we have to be fiscally responsible and accountable, 
not just to ourselves but to our children and their children. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
beginning, I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my 
time with the hon. member for St. John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to voice my disappointment, and that of the people 
of Madawaska—Restigouche, in the most recent federal budget.  The 
government's intention was to pull the wool over Canadians' 
eyes, but most of them have seen through it to what the 
government really had in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chronic unemployment problem in a number of this country's 
regions remains unchanged.  The excessive tax burden remains 
unchanged.  The battle against poverty remains unchanged. 
The issues around proper use of the employment insurance fund 
remain unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And if this is supposed to be a health budget, as the government 
expects us to believe, I would like to have it explained to me 
how restoring funding to its 1996 level can be a cause for 
celebration for the Liberals.  Since 1993, the Liberals have cut 
only 9.4% in government program expenditures, while they have 
slashed 34.2% from transfer payments for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, 57.5% of program cuts made by the Liberals have 
been made at the expense of the old and the sick.  Hospitals are 
short-staffed and waiting lists for treatment continue to grow. 
The provinces cannot improve this situation unless there is a 
real reinjection of federal funds into the health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did this government offer them, in its budget?  The 
Liberals will reinject $11.5 billion into provincial transfers 
for health care and education over the next five years.  Of 
this, $3.5 billion will be paid immediately in the Canada 
transfer for health and social programs as a one time additional 
payment, and the provinces can use it up within the next three 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The votes accounted for in 1998-99 will be placed in trust until 
the CHST legislation is passed.  It is a shell game.  The other 
votes will be paid out in stages.  The floor is raised to $15 
billion and will stay there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the Liberal fanfare, spending on health care will 
reach only 1996 levels. 
The financial commitment over five years contains no indexation 
mechanism taking inflation and demographic changes into account 
leading to an annual increase of some $3 billion for health care 
costs, totalling $80 billion annually.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An overall plan is needed to get the health care system working 
again.  Unable to establish priorities and a long term plan, the 
Prime Minister and his Minister of Finance have managed to 
balance their budget on the backs of workers, the poor, the sick 
and the old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are now trying to care for the sick, left through their 
fault on a waiting list, by putting a band aid on them.  Workers 
and Canadian businesses were hoping for more of a break in this 
federal budget. 
Unfortunately, all they got was the usual Liberal rhetoric.  The 
government is going to take away $3 and give them back $1, for 
their own good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as though the government thinks that it can fool Canadians 
and that Canadian workers and businesses do not understand that 
the money now being spent by the government is coming out of the 
EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
seems to be seeing the light.  A few weeks ago, the <I>Journal de 
Montréal</I> reported what the minister thought about the EI fund. 
In a burst of frankness, he admitted that the $20 billion 
surplus in the fund was actually an illusion because it had 
already been spent.  He expressed his doubts about how the fund 
had been used and recommended that there be a public debate on 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although they are only a beginning, I applaud the minister's 
reflections and hope he has the courage to defend them in 
cabinet, because the pillage cannot go on.  The Liberals 
continue to think that they know better than Canadian taxpayers 
how to spend the money the latter have earned by the sweat of 
their brow.  The government can increase the basic personal 
exemption by $500 and look for praise, but the reality is that 
it could have done much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1997 election campaign, my colleagues and I have 
maintained that the basic personal exemption could be increased 
to $10,000, instead of the meagre $7,131 proposed by the 
Minister of Finance and his government.  This would have given 
all Canadians some long-awaited tax relief and would have meant 
that 2 million low income Canadians no longer had to pay income 
tax. These 2 million Canadians could have breathed a little 
easier and put more food on the table. 
If raised to $10,000, the basic personal exemption would have 
left a single person with $700 more, and a married person or 
single parent with $1,500 more.  What a pity that this will not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's hike in Canada pension plan 
contributions in 1997 will add $120 in taxes on the Canada 
pension plan in 1999.  Net social security taxes have increased 
$60 in 1999.  Because the improved basic personal exemption 
takes effect only on July 1, 1999, an individual with an income 
of $39,000 will have to pay $3 more in federal taxes in 1999. 
And the federal government calls this a tax decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is refusing to lighten the tax burden that is 
crushing Canadian workers and making the Canadian economy less 
competitive. 
High taxes penalize initiative, are a hindrance to job creating 
investment and encourage highly skilled Canadians to move on to 
greener pastures. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed Canadians have not been duped by this smoke and mirror 
budget.  What has been handed down has fallen short on what was 
needed for low income Canadians, taxpayers and workers. 
Canadians can take heart, however, that some of their elected 
officials are listening to them and are willing to offer them the 
much needed relief they deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member used a term that was quite relevant when he talked 
about the budget being a smoke and mirror budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because I think about the very practical problems 
which could have been addressed in the budget, one being support 
for Halifax's bid for a piece of the pie with respect to becoming 
a superport.  Here we are on the brink of making history.  We 
stand at a point where we can benefit not only the Atlantic area 
but all of Canada by Halifax being properly supported to win the 
bid to handle the post-Panamax ships.  Yet there is nothing in 
the budget that made any real commitment to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The closest I have seen was just the other day in an article in 
the paper saying that the federal minister promised support if 
metro won the bid.  I do not feel that businessmen go on the if 
prospect.  If there had been a firm commitment stating some 
amount that was reasonable and tangible—surely we have experts 
who can figure out exactly what it would cost for our port to be 
upgraded to handle these ships—we would stand a much better 
chance of gaining that bid.  Other areas have done it.  I think 
New York has put a price on what it would cost for it to fix up 
its harbour but we say we cannot do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree with me that the budget has been very 
deficient in nailing down concrete specific action which would 
encourage economic development not only in Atlantic Canada but 
right across the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.  He hit it right on the nose when he said the 
government had no plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly with the recent closure of Devco in Nova Scotia one 
would have thought the Liberal government would have had a 
parallel plan like we did when the base was closed in Summerside 
and the GST centre was opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the long term plan of the government is not in 
place and there was no announcement for these workers.  The 
superport would certainly have been great compensation for this 
closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the budget and what it says about the $11.5 
billion for health care in the next five years.  It is an 
important factor.  The member has probably heard a lot about it 
in his own riding.  People are on waiting lists, waiting for 
serious operations.  Nurses and other workers are overworked. The 
$11.5 billion in five years will take us back to the point where 
we were in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take into account the aging population and inflation. 
Just to show how the government's long term plan works, $3 
billion a year times five years is $15 billion.  Since 1996 we 
have had a very large shortfall, but certainly the government has 
no long term plan.  Unfortunately that is the case for Nova 
Scotia as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member referred to the cash transfers that we outlined in the 
budget.  I think he misspoke himself with regard to the $3.5 
billion which is presently available to all provinces.  It has 
been paid into a trust to permit that very thing.  They are not 
separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware of the tax point consequences with regard to 
overall health transfers to the provinces?  Is he familiar with 
those and that in fact the amounts he is talking about have not 
taken into account the increase in tax revenue the provinces are 
getting because they have taxing authority?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, I take them into 
account.  I know about tax points.  I would like to bring to the 
attention of the hon. member that the day after the budget 
presentation the Liberal finance minister of New Brunswick 
applauded the budget.  After we reacted to it, a couple of days 
later the same finance minister said that there would be 
shortfalls in New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are shortfalls in the budget for New Brunswick as far as 
transfers are concerned.  There are shortfalls as far as health 
care is concerned.  If we read the fine print in the budget, we 
see that in five years we will be back at the same place where we 
were in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may call this a good budget, but unfortunately there 
are people who are still waiting for a good budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
join with my colleagues in congratulating the hon. member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche on his insightful remarks and thanking him 
for sharing his time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to participate today in the budget debate that 
pretends to repair some of the damages inflicted by the Liberal 
government on our health care system.  In reality it only offers 
empty platitudes and grossly inadequate action to address the 
very serious problems in the Canadian health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might find it convenient for their own partisan political 
reasons to characterize the budget as the health care budget, 
despite the fact that it represents only nominal measures to 
compensate for the savage cuts the government and the finance 
minister have made to transfers to the provinces for health, 
education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be able to stand here and praise a budget that 
actually does something for Newfoundland and Labrador.  Instead, 
the budget is devastating to the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  Not only does it not transfer adequate money back to 
the health care and education systems, but it does not do 
anything for the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador.  With its 
equalization changed to a per capita basis, the government has 
actually made it unbelievably difficult for Newfoundlanders to 
stay in Newfoundland and to expect reasonable levels of Canadian 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the brief time I have I will compare two budgets: the budget 
of last year which was the education budget and the budget of 
this year which is the health care budget.  We were reminded by 
the Liberal fanfare of last year's budget that they had the 
education budget even though it accomplished precious little to 
actually improve the situation of students.  Members opposite 
appear to be of the opinion that they have made the lives of 
students easier.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If 
government members were actually listening to their constituents 
and listening to students they would know that every increase in 
tuition fees and student debt load makes it almost impossible for 
low income students to receive a higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did that higher education, post-secondary budget of last 
year do for education in Canada?  Did it make education more 
accessible for students?  The bottom line according to the 
Canadian Federation of Students is that the so-called education 
budget did very little to help students.  Personal debts for 
graduating students are comparable to the size of mortgages and 
the money announced for the new millennium scholarship program 
will help only seven out of every one hundred students if and 
when it ever comes into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the deep gouging in the federal transfers by 
the government have created a higher education system that is 
almost impossible for students to attain.  These are the facts 
surrounding the budget which the Minister of Finance claimed 
would take important steps toward repairing the damage done in 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If his budget of last year for post-secondary education was such 
a failure in helping students, how can we expect the results of 
the health care budget of this year to perform?  After years of 
Liberal cutbacks in transfers to the provinces, transfers they 
pay for health care, education and social assistance, many of the 
problems are of such a magnitude that they cannot be fixed by 
short term approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a crisis in the emergency wards across Canada.  There 
is probably not a member of the House of Commons, not a member of 
a provincial legislature, not a doctor, not a nurse, not a 
nursing assistant who does not have a terrible story to tell 
about the damage that has been done to our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was home the other day I met a lady who is now in her 
mid-eighties.  I spoke with her husband for a while.  He told me 
that she would have to wait nine to twelve months to get a simple 
cataract operation done in St. John's, Newfoundland. 
That might not sound bad to the Minister of Finance or to the 
Minister of Health, Mr. Speaker, but if your mother or your aunt 
or one of your family had to spend the next nine, ten or twelve 
months of their lives not being able to pour a cup of tea for 
themselves or not being able to walk across the kitchen, you 
would have to say that there is something seriously wrong with 
the Canadian health care system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals claim in this budget that they will put back $11.5 
billion in cash transfers to the provinces for health over the 
next five years.  In other words, they are going to cap the 
transfers at $15 billion.  Despite the Liberal fanfare about the 
would-be health care budget, health care spending at that point 
will only be back to 1996 levels, which we know were atrocious. 
After the five year financial commitment, which comes with no 
escalator clauses and does not take into account the fact that 
inflation and demographic changes are going to add about $3 
billion a year to Canada's health care bill, on an accumulative 
basis the Liberals will have cut $17 billion from transfers to 
the provinces.  They have put very little of that back with this 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of 
the health care system.  The lack of priorities shown by the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance and the absence of any 
apparent long term plan led them to balance the budget on the 
backs of Canadian workers, the poor, the sick and the elderly. 
Now they are trying to use a band-aid to cure a health care 
system which they themselves have put on the critical list.  We 
all hope it is not too late to undo the damage done to the health 
care system by the billions of dollars of cuts made by the 
Liberal government.  The inadequate measures that this government 
is offering in place of any kind of serious long term plan do not 
give anyone much real hope, faith or confidence that this is 
about to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial reaction from the Liberal government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador is that there are some really important 
questions which the Minister of Finance has failed to answer 
satisfactorily.  Some of these questions are of particular 
interest to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Now we have 
two levels of Liberals, two levels of government telling us two 
different stories.  One thing that has become clear is that the 
net effect on the transfers to the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador will be substantially less than the finance minister 
indicated in his budget.  His counterpart, the minister of 
finance for Newfoundland, calls the measures included in the 
federal budget laughable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers cited repeatedly by the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, who represents Newfoundland in the federal cabinet, have 
been challenged by the media and by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically with regard to the impact of these transfers on 
health care, let us look at the reaction of the provincial 
minister of health, again a Liberal minister.  I would like to 
remind my colleagues that she says the province is going to take 
a very hard hit, that this federal budget creates a two tier 
health care system and that it is not good enough.  That is the 
Liberal minister of health for Newfoundland talking about a two 
tier health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the two tier health care system that so many speak of 
for the rich and poor.  This is a two tier system in which for 
certain essential medical services people in Newfoundland and 
Labrador will have to go to Toronto or some other part of Canada. 
There will be two tiers of health care in Canada:  one for the 
poorer provinces and one for the rich provinces.  As the Liberal 
minister of health for Newfoundland says, that is simply not good 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another factor in this budget is the changing of equalization to 
a per capita system.  Is that going to help the poorer provinces 
of Canada?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The change 
to an equalized system, pushed by the Ontario caucus of this 
Liberal government so that people in Ontario receive the same on 
a per capita basis as people in Newfoundland and Labrador, is not 
the idea of equalization.  Equalization is one of the fundamental 
tenets on which Confederation is based.  It says that money will 
be taken from the rich and well to do parts of Canada so there 
will be equal services in all parts of Canada. What really has 
happened here is that the poorer we are the less money we get and 
we are still supposed to supply a first class health care system. 
How can we do it without money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget, if nothing else, has destroyed one of the 
fundamental principles of Confederation:  the fact that the rich, 
the well off and the well to do are to help those in Canada who 
are not as rich or as well to do.  What it means in Newfoundland 
on a per capita basis, because our economy has not been helped, 
because so many things in the province and in this country are 
not helping the regions of Canada, is that in the last three 
years it has lost 30,000 people. 
Those 30,000 people will not be on our rolls for the transfers 
from the Government of Canada to the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will that benefit health care in Newfoundland?  How will 
that give us a better system?  We would love the Minister of 
Finance to visit Newfoundland, talk to his old colleague and 
friend Brian Tobin, and explain to him, the premier of the 
province, how this is supposed to be beneficial to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland we look at it in some ways as being another 
resettlement program which was created to resettle some of the 
smaller communities in Newfoundland during the sixties and 
seventies by a former Liberal government.  In effect, this 
budget, with its equalization changes, will resettle a lot of 
Newfoundlanders to other parts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this budget is more successful at solving health care 
problems than the education budget of last year was at solving 
education problems.  I can only say that our caucus and my 
colleagues on this side of the House are very skeptical.  On 
behalf of the government and the people of Newfoundland, I say 
that we are downright suspicious that this will do anything for 
the health care system in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member referred to a two tier health care system.  I am sure 
he will know that under the principles of the Canada Health Act 
we have a universal, accessible, affordable, comprehensive and 
publicly administered health system which means that every 
Canadian is entitled to a health care system which is the same no 
matter where they are in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member seems to be talking about this raising or lifting of 
the ceiling for Ontario and B.C., because they have been getting 
less than their share, as somehow taking away from Newfoundland. 
It does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not believe that each and every Canadian should get the 
same contribution to their health care?  Is everybody not getting 
the same, equally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously the member does 
not understand the function of equalization.  The function of 
equalization is for the well to do provinces of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  The CHST is not equalization.  You don't 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  The transfer payments are meant for 
health, education and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As equalization is changed so that everyone gets treated fairly 
across the country on a per capita basis there will be regions 
of Canada which simply will not have the funds to deliver equal 
and adequate health care, or what the member refers to as 
universal, affordable and high quality health care.  It is simply 
not going to happen in the poorer regions of this country.  There 
is no way to do it without money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget was supposed to put money back into the health care 
system, but in Newfoundland that simply will not happen.  The 
Liberal minister of health for Newfoundland, as well as the 
Liberal premier, who has so much in common with the finance 
minister, knows that we will have a worse health care system 
rather than a better one in Newfoundland and Labrador as a result 
of this budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly have a great deal of sympathy with my 
colleague from Newfoundland in that he has outlined some distinct 
problems that province is having. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those in my area were very disappointed with this budget.  With 
our paved roads going back to dirt roads and with our railways 
being abandoned for hundreds of miles, the word transportation or 
roads was not mentioned.  From a province which probably pays 
more money on a per capita basis in fuel tax, we got zip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is true that there is a two tier system, how many tiers 
will there be if the present rate of funding continues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in reality what is 
happening in this country, and this budget has done nothing to 
alleviate it, is that many tiers of service are being created. 
The idea of Canada, the idea of Confederation, the idea of 
sharing, the idea that the rich can help the poorer provinces is 
simply no longer a part of this government's priorities. 
There is an Ontario dominated caucus with Ontario dominated 
priorities.  All I can say is that we are going to have a two 
tier health care system in Newfoundland.  We have a two tier 
system of job creation.  We have a two tier system of highways in 
Newfoundland.  All I can see with this government's philosophy is 
a continuation in the deterioration of the fairness that used to 
be a fundamental part of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a quick question for my hon. colleague from the 
beautiful province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree that if the government wanted to give tax 
breaks or tax concessions to the majority of Canadians that a 1% 
reduction in the GST-HST, as we have in our province, would be a 
great start to reducing the tax burden on average Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would be an excellent 
idea to reduce the GST or HST, but that is not going to happen as 
long as we have a Liberal government that is so enamoured with 
the GST-HST system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to participate in this debate and to focus on health 
care.  I would like to say to my friends from the fifth party who 
are dispensing advice on the budget that it is like learning fire 
prevention from an arsonist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that they left us with a $42 billion deficit, I 
cannot really believe that we can take some of their comments 
very seriously.  I would point out to members of the fifth party 
when they talk about 1995 levels that we are talking not about 
borrowed money.  This $11.5 billion is not borrowed money.  I ask 
members to keep that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has continued to build on the strong fiscal 
foundation that was first started in 1993.  Our economic house 
was in a serious state of disrepair.  Our financial house was 
sinking with a $42 billion deficit, unemployment which had gone 
through the roof and investor confidence that was sluggish.  The 
government rolled up its sleeves and presented to Canadians the 
state of our financial affairs.  Canadians rallied to the cause. 
They understood that large deficits and astronomical debt would 
cripple Canada for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governing means that one has to establish priorities and has to 
work with all sectors of society to rebuild our economy.  The 
1999 budget continues to build on the sound and prudent fiscal 
management that the Minister of Finance has put into place over 
the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians embraced the deficit reduction strategies of the 
government.  Together we have been able to eliminate the deficit, 
bring in two balanced budgets and forecast two more balanced 
budgets.  In 1998-99 Canada will balance the books or better.  It 
is the first time since 1951-52 that the government has been 
deficit free for two consecutive years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has recorded four consecutive balanced 
budgets, which is only the third time since Confederation. 
Canada is the only G-7 nation to do so with a strong fiscal 
discipline to help Canada get into a position to focus again on 
the priorities that matter to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to focus on one of those priorities and that 
is health care.  Investing in Canadians and in the future of 
health care is the cornerstone of this budget.  Our publicly 
funded health care system is one of the key elements that defines 
our identity.  Canadians point with pride to this particular 
social program.  It is a policy that has helped to shape our 
quality of life as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been increasingly worried about the future of 
health care.  They are worried that this comprehensive program 
will not be there when they need it.  Canadians told us that they 
want a health care system that will be able to meet the needs and 
the challenges of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government, working in partnership with the 
provinces and territories and the volunteer sector, provides 
leadership in developing policies, enforcing health regulations, 
promoting disease prevention, enhancing healthy living and in 
strengthening and securing our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government provides funding for provincial and territorial 
health systems throughout Canada through the health and social 
transfer, the CHST.  This budget provided the largest single new 
investment in health care, $11.5 billion over five years for the 
health of Canadians.  Again, it was not borrowed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these increased transfers this budget injected 
$1.4 billion over three years into a number of important health 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent federal, provincial and territorial health agreement 
reaffirmed all government support for the five principles of the 
Canada Health Act:  universality, comprehensiveness, 
accessibility, portability and public administration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget provides through future increases in the CHST $8 
billion, an additional $3.5 billion as an immediate one time 
supplement that the provinces will have the flexibility to draw 
down on according to their needs, according to their own 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For provinces like Ontario this budget proposes to eliminate 
provincial disparities of CHST allocation over the next three 
years.  The provinces will then receive identical per capita CHST 
entitlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, investments in the health of Canadians this year and 
over the next three years include developing and improving health 
information systems to assist in establishing a more integrated, 
effective and appropriate system of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a round table I had in my riding last year on this with the 
Minister of Health, that was the very important issue that was 
brought to the fore.  I am very pleased to see the minister 
responding in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Areas of other investment include the Canadian institutes for 
health information, the Canadian health network, the Canadian 
healthy infoway and Health Canada information, improving 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we examine the Canadian health network as an example, this 
network will provide Canadians with one stop shopping for 
credible, current information on health promotion and disease, 
prevention, self-care and the performance of the health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Oak Ridges hospitals such as York Central 
Hospital and Markham—Stouffville Hospital will benefit from 
these initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fast growing communities like Richmond Hill, the tools have 
been given to address issues related to the ever increasing 
demands on our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>York Central Hospital has told me that the federal budget is 
indeed good news, that it is a positive step that will help it 
relieve the increasing pressures to meet the growing health care 
needs of our rapidly growing community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out, as did the member for Don Valley East, that the 
health care budget is a step in the right direction on a long 
term approach to working with our partners, the provincial and 
municipal governments, on one of the causes of homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people who live with mental illness are homeless because 
they were discharged from institutions like hospitals.  By 
targeting health care in this budget, by providing the provinces 
with more money for health, we are dealing with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Minister of Finance for listening to 
Canadians and for providing the necessary dollars to make sure we 
continue to have the best health care system in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to my colleague's speech with interest.  It has a common 
theme.  Liberal members always want to talk about what it will be 
like in the future.  They never talk about their record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about their record for a second.  Here is the 
Liberal record.  Liberals cut $21 billion out of health care. Now 
they want us to give them credit for putting $11.5 billion back 
in over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourteen hundred doctors left Canada in the last two years.  Two 
hundred thousand people are on waiting lists and people in record 
numbers have to go to the United States for American health care 
because this government does not give Canadians proper health 
care. What does the member have to say about that abysmal record? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I referred to members of 
the fifth party as taking advice on fire prevention from an 
arsonist. Listening to the official opposition, it is like asking 
a pyromaniac to hold the matches for safekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our record speaks for itself.  Very clearly we have done the 
job.  That party would dismantle the health care system in this 
country.  That party would take apart the very foundation that 
Canadians have in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  I would point out facts to the 
opposition members if they would stop heckling over there and 
listen for a minute but unfortunately they are not very good 
listeners.  They like to prevaricate the truth but they do not 
like to listen to the real facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing the job.  We are continuing to do the job.  In 
terms of providing the necessary health care, we have given the 
provinces and the territories the tools to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would defy members of the opposition to put their health 
proposals on the table in comparison to this government's.

allocated in the budget to the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, a very extensive report was done by the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs 
detailing quality of life issues for our military. Recently we 
have seen stories coming out in the media about the terrible 
experiences that many families have had with respect to 
inadequate housing and the effects of moving from one place to 
the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It kind of bothers me when I see that the amount that was 
allocated is $525 million over three years when the minister's 
own minimum estimate was $700 million.  Then we see the 
government still giving out money for things like a company 
producing a dumb blonde joke book.  That speaks for itself.

for his question.  I certainly applaud the government's moving in 
the right direction with regard to the money for our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are elected usually from four to five years and they 
cannot do everything in one budget.  It is a major step toward 
improving the quality of life for armed services personnel.  It 
is clearly $525 million better than we had before this budget. 
It clearly addresses many of the issues that the standing 
committee reported on.  The Minister of National Defence has done 
an excellent job in listening to those concerns, providing those 
concerns to the Minister of Finance and clearly we are on the 
right road. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member a question with respect to the 
impact on Ontario.  In Ontario the impact of the budget is that 
first of all Ontario will receive its share of $3.5 billion.  In 
addition there is a per capita amount that will affect both B.C., 
Alberta and Ontario.  In addition there is a further $2 billion, 
of which Ontario's share is approximately 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in knowing the hon. member's response to 
all of that money that is to flow to Ontario and how it should 
impact on a variety of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question.  It is clearly outlined that in the most 
populous province in the country there has obviously been 
provincial restructuring of hospitals, et cetera, and these 
dollars will be extremely important to making sure that residents 
who live in Ontario will be able to get the kind of health care 
they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, in conjunction with the provinces, there is no question 
that these dollars will obviously be used by the provinces 
effectively.  The Ontario government, having signed the health 
accord, has committed to making sure that the issue of chronic 
care beds that are needed and reducing the waiting period for ER 
as an example will be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear the Premier of Ontario telling us that this is a good 
budget and therefore he likes where these priorities are going. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to speak on budget '99 which has as its 
theme building today for a better tomorrow; yes, a better 
tomorrow for our adults and youths of today and for our fellow 
citizens yet to be born in anticipation of the coming century of 
the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's news Statistics Canada reported that the Canadian 
economy for the whole of 1998 grew at the rate of 3%, turning in 
one of its best quarters of the decade at 4.6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For individual Canadians today's news reports that the 
disposable income for the whole year, when adjusted for 
inflation, was up 1.5% from 1997, a real gain in real income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this type of economic growth that the federal government 
is committed to sustain and surpass.  Indeed it is a key goal of 
the government to create a strong economy that generates well 
paying jobs and ensures a higher standard of living for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why budget '99 will invest more than $1.8 billion over 
the remainder of this fiscal year and the next three years in 
advanced research, in innovation, in the information highway and 
in support of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I focus on these budgetary items, let me at once say how 
extremely pleased my constituents of Winnipeg North—St. Paul 
received the news that among these other items, budget '99 is a 
health budget as well. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT47"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT47"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1355

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional $11.5 billion, $3.5 billion of which is an 
immediate one time supplement available this fiscal year, has 
been earmarked specifically to the health care system over the 
next five years, over and above the $12.5 billion cash floor 
presently in the Canada health and social transfers.  This is a 
truly substantial amount that has been welcomed by provincial 
governments whether of the NDP or Tory banners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This additional allocation translates to $425 million over five 
years for my home province of Manitoba.  This health component of 
the budget reflects more than the amount itself.  It reflects the 
common vision that all premiers and territorial leaders confirm 
as undertakings they had previously given in an exchange of 
correspondence with the Prime Minister at the first ministers 
meeting on February 4, 12 days before the budget was announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reflects their undertakings that they remain committed to the 
five principles of medicare, universality, portability, 
accessibility, comprehensiveness and public administration.  It 
reflects the common vision that they achieved in the framework 
for social union signed shortly before the budget was announced, 
that all levels of government, federal, provincial and 
territorial, would make themselves accountable to Canadians in an 
open and transparent manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This common vision includes the belief that research is at the 
core of a quality health care system, a system that will improve 
care and treatment, prevention certainly and hopefully a cure. It 
is about our hope as Canadians that a woman will overcome the 
tragedy of breast cancer and a man the tragedy of prostrate 
malignancies, that a grandfather and a grandmother will be spared 
premature loss of memory and that a son and daughter will regain 
nerve functions following a devastating accident or injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hence, budget `99 has also earmarked a substantial amount for 
health research, $25 million to create a new research fund 
henceforth to be called the nurses using research and service 
evaluations, or NURSE fund for short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new initiative is to enhance the leadership role that 
nurses deserve to play in the health care system now and in the 
future. Also there is $35 million to the Canada health services 
research foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of the next three years the Medical Research Council and 
Health Canada's national health research and development program 
will see an increase of $27.5 million and $2.5 million, 
respectively, to their annual budgets.  This new allocation is to 
provide immediate support for advanced health research.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, Onward Willow helps our newest residents to

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Oakville, co-operation between government and the private

</I></B></P><P align=left>Designed to meet the needs of the 21st century, Sheridan's 
computer numerical control centre offers industry based training 
for programmers, setters, operators and technical staff.  This 
program is a highly efficient way to prepare individuals to meet 
the skills level required by today's job market.  The college's 
new centre of excellence demonstrates our government's 
willingness to help Canadian manufacturing companies in their 
quest to compete on international markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so, we also contribute to the creation of a dynamic and

</I></B></P><P align=left>After week one, Ontario leads the medal standings and the race

an overwhelming thumbs down on the weekend, echoing the results

one-half per cent of the voters, 76 people, supported the deal.

governments misrepresenting the terms of this treaty.  They know 
that the real cost of the Nisga'a deal is almost three times what 
their governments claim the cost to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians know that because government underestimated 
the value of lands and resources the province is contributing to 
the deal, they will get stuck with 75% of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the last 
Liberal budget confirmed the inability of the technocrat who 
acts as Minister of Human Resources Development to protect the 
poor in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A budget that provides an annual tax reduction of $2,123 to a 
person earning $250,000, compared to a measly $115 for someone 
earning $30,000 shows nothing but contempt for democracy and 
fairness, and is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the Minister of Finance manage to grant such reductions 
to his rich friends after having targeted for five years the 
poor, the students and those on welfare, and after shamelessly 
dipping into the employment insurance fund? Words are not strong 
enough to condemn the contempt shown by this government toward 
the poor.

Party, but in his speech he emphasized strongly how he was a 
card-carrying member of the PQ and BQ, two movements committed to 
the breakup of our country. He was received, let me say, with a 
standing ovation.  What hypocrisy. Not long ago, we must 
remember, the Reform Party said no more prime ministers from 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the Reform Party has not yet realized that we have an 
electorate that is sophisticated and tuned in to government and 
specific party initiatives and policies.  With the Reform Party's 
antics and outrageous statements it seems it certainly has the 
knack for underestimating the public's intelligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I have to say, Mr. Speaker, is you can change the clothes, 
you can do the makeover, but you cannot change the person. Reform 
is Reform is Reform, otherwise known as the flat earth party.

this past week Reform members have had the unbelievable gall to

of health care insurance, such as basic deductibles, medisave 
accounts, choice of insurance coverage, and complete coverage for 
catastrophic illness”?  Reform of course.  Which party's leader 
has said that “we want to remove those sections of the Canada 
Health Act that deny provinces the flexibility to require some 
Canadians to pay at least a portion of their health costs”? 
Reform.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TAXATION 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday Statistics Canada restated the obvious that 
taxes are up yet again thanks to the Liberal government.  The 
Prime Minister cranked up income taxes and payroll taxes by a 
whopping 6% in one year so that even when the economy grows it is 
the government's income that grows faster than the taxpayers' 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister tax away most of the income increases 
that Canadians managed to earn last year? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, because the economy is performing very well we are 
having the benefit of having an economy that is well managed and 
the revenues are coming accordingly.  That gave the government 
the opportunity over the last two budgets to reduce income taxes 
by $16 billion over a period of three years.  There have been 
major tax cuts since we have been here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian economy did not grow by 6% last year. The 
disposable income of Canadians did not grow by 6% last year. The 
average Canadian did not get a 6% increase in income last year. 
Yet the government takes 6% more in income and payroll taxes from 
those Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister insist on a 6% higher tax collection 
last year with even higher taxes to follow in 1999? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since we have been the government we have managed the 
economy in a way that we have managed to reduce the deficit from 
$42 billion to zero.  Now the big problem is that this government 
has managed the economy so well that people are worried that we 
might have more money in the coffers than predicted. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the record of this government is collecting $42 billion 
more in taxes this year than it collected when it came to office. 
The worst part of it is who is being hit the hardest.  It is not 
the high income Canadians.  It is the poorer families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia a family with two children and earning only 
$25,000 will pay a 70% tax on every extra dollar of income it 
earns.  If the Prime Minister is not embarrassed by the highest 
taxes ever charged in Canada, is he not embarrassed by the fact 
that he is taking those taxes for the most part from the poorest 
Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have managed the economy in a way that, for example, 
this year the spending of the government will be 12% of GDP. That 
is the lowest in 50 years.  We have managed to have more revenues 
because we have 1.6 million more Canadians who are working who 
did not have jobs when we were elected in 1993. 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
year the government went $7.6 billion over budget in its 
spending.  StatsCan has confirmed it.  Canadians are now paying 
the highest taxes that they have ever paid in history.  Out of 
all those people who are paying extraordinarily high taxes it is 
single income families that are paying the most proportionately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the Prime Minister and his government discriminate 
against single income families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, since we took 
office, even though we were running a huge deficit, reducing 
taxes has been one of our priorities.  Even when we were in 
deficit we started by selective tax cuts for Canadians with 
disabilities, for the charitable and voluntary sector, for 
students.  The most massive tax cut of all for lower income 
Canadians was the child tax benefit going to low income working 
families, $2 billion with this budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
earth to the minister. If they are cutting taxes, why does 
StatsCan say that they are now at record high levels?  Why is the 
minister running away from the question?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this government discriminating against single income 
families?  Why is a family making $50,000 paying $4,000 more in 
taxes than a dual income family? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the facts are 
that from day one personal income tax reductions have been an 
important part of our government's fiscal plan.  With this budget 
a two income family earning $50,000 with two children gets a 15% 
decrease in its income taxes.  The same family with a $30,000 
income pays zero federal income taxes.  The same family with a 
$20,000 income gets a federal tax credit of $3,600. This is our 
commitment to the Canadian middle class.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
is not what the resolution he said he is referring to says.  The 
millennium scholarships represent a political decision to ensure 
visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister say such a thing, namely, that he is

he himself refuses to assume his political responsibilities,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all, legislation 
creating the foundation, an independent body, was enacted. 
Second, Minister Legault's letter called for us to ignore the 
National Assembly resolution and went back to the demand for 
opting out with entitlement to compensation, which is not part 
of the National Assembly resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preference was to ignore the principles of the National 
Assembly resolution, and to revisit the question of the right to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the

confirmed yesterday that he was speaking with the Quebec Liberal

Now the World Bank has confirmed that real commodity prices are

recognized a number of the disparities.  Let me recite them for 
the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we have a single earner family we have a spousal credit of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that last year single income families paid 92% more 
federal tax than dual income families.  Under the 1999 budget 
that discrimination gets even worse.  Families with a stay at

first, Quebec's share will be determined by using demographic

scholarships; and, third, the scholarships will be awarded while 
avoiding any duplication and ensuring the necessary visibility 
for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not a reasonable position, and will the minister come to

National Assembly's resolution. It is absolutely reasonable and 
I believe we will easily reach an agreement with the Quebec

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the

should remind him, in an absolutely reasonable manner, that, on 
February 15, the Quebec Minister of Education asked to meet him 
to negotiate on the basis of that resolution, to sign an 
agreement and to settle the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is serious about settling the issue, will he do 
the reasonable thing, assume his political responsibilities, sit 
down with Quebec officials, sign an agreement and thus allow 
Quebec students to benefit from the program?

the legislation makes it possible to meet the resolution's three 
reasonable objectives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They also have close to twice the expenses: the work related

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is women who stay home to look after their families and 
parents who stay at home work as hard as those who are in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
for years it has been a mystery to Canadian families why the tax 
system discriminates against those who make the sacrifice of 
forgoing a second income to have a parent stay home and raise the 
children but now, lo and behold, we have found the government's 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It believes families that decide to keep a parent at home to 
raise the kids are not working.  Let me tell the secretary of 
state that stay at home parents work harder than many people who 
are generating income and they deserve recognition in the tax 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government continue to justify a tax system that 
tells stay at home parents they are second class citizens? 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have from the 
beginning of the process of individual tax reform recognized very 
strongly the role that a stay at home spouse can play in a 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why under the child tax benefits we have a $1,340 
benefit that is not otherwise available.  This is why under our 
system it is possible for a single worker in a family to 
contribute up to $13,500 to an RRSP for a non-working spouse. 
This is part of our philosophy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal philosophy is to say to people who decide to keep a 
parent at home and forgo a second income, to make an economic 
sacrifice, to do what they think is best by their children, that 
they will be discriminated against and have to pay more taxes 
than a family with more income.  It makes no sense.  It simply is 
not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House recognized that in the last parliament when it passed 
a Liberal member's motion to stop tax discrimination against 
single income families.  When will the government begin to 
address this gross inequity and level the playing field for 
families that make sacrifices for their kids? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we on this side 
of the House recognize that we have further reductions in 
personal income tax to make.  This has been part of our 
philosophy from day one when we took office.  This is why we have 
targeted it in areas of priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that we do not have unlimited funds to do 
everything that we might like to do.  We have had to be prudent 
in our tax cuts.  We have made many spending cuts, going down to 
record low levels as the Prime Minister has pointed out.  These 
have been tough choices that we have had to make on behalf of 
Canadians.  We are committed to ongoing cuts to personal income 
tax and we will make—

and in this case the increases that have taken place, the

Whether they are equalization payments or health transfers, they 
are for the benefit of Canadians.

policy changes in this budget.  But he seems to have forgotten in 
his new Liberal math that 1.2 million taxpayers were added to the

300,000 will be added back on in the next two years as a result 
of bracket creep.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I was indicating when debate was interrupted for 
question period, budget '99 has allocated $30 million for the 
Medical Research Council and Health Canada's national health 
research and development program for each of the next three 
years. This new allocation is to provide immediate support for 
advanced health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, at the University of Manitoba, researchers are 
working to reduce the 30% rejection rate for kidney transplants. 
Moreover, $65 million is initially set aside in the year 2000-01 
to support the launch of the envisioned Canadian institutes of 
health research, an amount that will be increased to $175 million 
the year thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combination of all the initiatives announced in budget '99 
is to increase the funding for health research, both medical and 
nursing, by $550 million over the remainder of this fiscal year 
and the coming next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now return to the component of the budget that focuses on 
creation, dissemination, sharing and the application of knowledge 
as it impacts the economy, and on the component of the budget 
that supports employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next three years $465 million has been earmarked for 
the youth employment strategy and another $110 million per year 
for the Canada jobs fund.  These two particular strategic funds 
alone will help ensure a bright future for our youth as well as 
attend to the employment needs of our adults of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, to help create knowledge, the federal government has 
earmarked the following budgetary amounts:  $200 million to the 
Canada Foundation for Innovation; $75 million to the Natural 
Sciences and Engineering Research Council; $15 million to the 
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; $31 million to 
the National Research Council; and $55 million for biotechnology 
research and development by federal science based departments and 
agencies. These amounts total $376 million for initiatives to 
create knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, to help disseminate and share the created knowledge, 
budget '99 has allocated the following amounts:  $60 million to 
smart communities to establish demonstration projects that 
promote the effective use of information technologies in such 
areas as education and lifelong learning, government services, 
business and industry, employment, library and information 
services, transportation and culture; and $60 million to 
GeoConnections to make available to the information highway 
comprehensive and integrated data about Canada's geography, 
environment, people and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, to commercialize knowledge so as to reap the economic and 
social benefits for all Canadians, budget '99 has allocated the 
following amounts:  $90 million to the networks of centres of 
excellence; $150 million to technology partnerships Canada; $50 
million to the Business Development Bank of Canada to expand 
financing for small and medium size knowledge based and export 
oriented businesses; and $430 million to the Canadian Space 
Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget '99 is indeed the best budget of them all.  These 
initiatives in budget '99 are the products of the determination, 
will and sacrifice that Canadians have collectively shared since 
1993 when they entrusted this government to change their despair 
to hope, their pessimism to optimism, their doubt to a renewed 
sense of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am humbly proud to be part of this government's team that 
worked with Canadians to succeed in eliminating the national 
deficit, balancing the books of the nation and reducing the 
national debt and personal income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be part of this government that believes we have 
achieved what we have achieved not because of any single value we 
have pursued, but because of the many values we have advanced 
together, because of the sharing and openness we have shown to 
each other as fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be part of this government team that working with 
Canadians is truly building today for a better tomorrow.

have known for a number of years that the federal government is 
making surpluses.  A round of extravagant spending has begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, The Minister of Human Resources Development, with the help 
of the enforcement assistance fund, provided $35,000 for a study 
on the establishment of a technological company in the Asbestos 
RCM.  This financial assistance to one person represents and 
will always represent structural duplication, because there 
existed and still exists a federally funded CFDC, a community 
futures development corporation and a Government of Quebec 
funded CLD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul justify his 
government's use of the surplus in the employment insurance 
fund, which, by the way, should be set aside solely for future 
users, that is, the unemployed?  How can he justify his 
government's spending $35,000 to duplicate structures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, for example, did he not give this money to the very 
responsible diversification committee in the Asbestos RCM, 
chaired by Jacques Lussier? Or why did he not give it to the 
community futures development corporation, chaired by Raymond 
Simon, the mayor of Pontbriand, a corporation governed by the 
federal government, or to the CLD, headed by Rivard Beaudoin? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The awarding of this $35,000 to a single individual, who spent 
barely five months on his study, represents high class social 
assistance. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have noted that in 
the question the hon. member has not really doubted the merit of 
the study.  He has only raised grave doubts as to the duplication 
of the efforts. In other words, it appears to be more about a 
wounded ego than anything else.  On that note I would say that 
unless he says that it was not a good study, that type of 
question should not merit an answer at this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the member for Winnipeg North—St. 
Paul, if he feels this budget is so good and he was doing a lot 
of bragging about it in his speech, why did the government feel 
it had to spend $3.6 million to advertise it and engage in its 
public relations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope the member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul is as 
concerned as we are about the $500,000 the Manitoba Conservative 
government is spending on feel good health care ads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member will join with us in condemning both the 
Manitoba Conservatives and the federal Liberals for wasting 
public money to engage in self-serving ads. Would he not agree 
that every penny available should go into the care of patients 
and not into propaganda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I should note that the 
member opposite was a member of the provincial legislature.  At 
that time if at any time the provincial government she was part 
of did not inform Manitobans on the government's programs, then I 
would say she would have a legitimate basis to pose that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the substance, it is our duty as a federal government to 
inform Canadians of the budget.  How can we not be proud of $11.5 
billion for the health care system as new money over and above 
the $12.5 billion that is presently there? Even the NDP premier 
of Saskatchewan applauded budget '99.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know they have a record of late of being very soft on crime.

budget.  We know the RCMP computer system is rusting out, yet 
millions and millions have been pumped into a useless gun

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has this government set such a low priority for law 
enforcement in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, I 
think we have allocated sufficiently in this budget for the law 
enforcement agency of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gun control law is now part of the law of the country, part

<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish I could say it was a great pleasure for me to 
rise today to address this budget.  This budget is a disaster, as 
every Canadian is learning.  I am sure hon. members opposite will 
be riveted by the speech I am about to deliver.  Maybe they will 
be quiet enough to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I start this afternoon by focusing on the beginning of the 
finance minister's rather lengthy budget speech: “A budget 
always brings its own special vocabulary.  We talk in the 
language of rates and ratios, of percentages and decimals, of 
accounting methods and measures.  What all this obscures is what 
budgets should be about.  It is to make the lives of Canadians 
better.  It is to improve their standard of living”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the finance minister is obscuring is that the rates, ratios 
and numbers do not lie.  The numbers are his undoing.  His 
accounting practices are unorthodox and are not even supported by 
the auditor general.  The numbers show clearly that increases in 
payroll taxes and bracket creep have not been offset by his 
minuscule tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this is what budgets should be all about.  They should 
be about being straight with Canadians.  They should be about 
telling them the whole story or, as Paul Harvey says, at least 
the rest of the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not take my word for it.  Neville Nankivell calls this budget 
“a clunker, disappointing and miserly in its approach to 
reducing what are the highest overall taxes of any major 
economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Diane Francis of the <I>National Post</I>: “The 
latest budget is a big con job designed to hoodwink Canadians 
into believing that health care costs are why they cannot get the 
dramatic tax cuts they deserve.  The fact is Canadian taxes are 
excessive due to unbridled public spending on non-health items. 
Canadians are being taxed to death and this budget is insulting 
to taxpayers by perpetuating myths”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business calls the budget 
“disappointing and a missed opportunity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is spending a lot of money advertising this 
budget, as my colleague just pointed out, but it is not being 
straight with Canadians.  My constituents voted to re-elect me 
because I call them as I see them.  I would like to clarify for 
Canadians facts and fiction, or the myths and realities of this 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister made choices in his budget and the 
consequences of those choices need to be explained to Canadian 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Myth number one is that the Liberals have not increased taxes. 
In fact, we are to believe we just got a tax cut. Unfortunately 
even Canadian Airlines is perpetuating this myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reality number one is that Canadian taxpayers will pay $2,020 
more in taxes in 1999 than they did in 1993.  That is $42 billion 
more, 42 thousand million dollars more.  That is a tax hike of 
34%, the highest tax increase in the world.  That is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a five year period but even if a comparison with 1999 to 
last year is made, Canadians will still be paying more in taxes 
due to mammoth increases in CPP premiums and of course because of 
bracket creep.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Myth number two is that Canadians' taxes are higher in order to 
pay for universal health care.  Reality number two is the latest 
OECD health data report reveals that the United States spends 90% 
more on each citizen on public health care than Canada does. 
Even with the so-called reinvestment in health care, Canadians 
are getting $4.3 billion less in health care spending from these 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take health care spending out of the picture Canadian 
taxes are double the rate of the Americans. The reality is that 
health care has nothing to do with the exorbitant taxes being 
charged by this bunch of Liberals across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to love myth number three, that excessive taxes do not 
harm Canadian businesses or the economy.  Just ask the industry 
minister.  According to him, high taxes are good for business. 
Reality number three is Canada's taxes are double that of the 
U.S. and, surprise, our unemployment rate is nearly double that 
of the United States.  Coincidence?  I think not.  Payroll taxes 
and user fees have taxed small businesses, the engine of job 
creation, out of prosperity into a daily struggle just to 
survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One small example of this government's lame brain policies is 
the recent change to T-4 slips.  It used to fit four forms on a 
page which could be sent out in a standard letter sized envelope. 
The geniuses at Revenue Canada decided to change that format. 
Now only three forms fit to a page and due to their new and 
improved size, they require larger envelopes.  Members are 
probably saying big deal, so they need new envelopes.  The 
postage for these new envelopes is 90 cents instead of the 46 
cents it cost for the old form.  That is just one small example 
of how this government nickels and dimes small business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Myth number four is that the finance minister says his budget 
will give substantial tax relief to low income Canadians, in fact 
it will more than cover bracket creep for all Canadians.  Reality 
number four is the minuscule tax cut given to low income 
Canadians is only half the amount of money they would receive if 
the finance minister would index personal income taxes.  In 1980 
a person making $10,505 paid no income tax.  Now that same person 
pays taxes on only $6,496.  Britain does not start taxing until 
$9,000 and the U.S. not until $9,500.  No wonder our best and 
brightest are fleeing the country.  Is there a pattern developing 
with this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Myth number five is that the Liberals have been prudent—they 
love that word—and have balanced the budget by cutting costs and 
responsible priorizing.  Reality number five is the single 
largest expenditure in this budget is interest on the national 
debt, which has grown by over $130 billion since 1993.  The 
Liberals reduced 70% of the deficit by raising taxes while only 
cutting costs by 2%.  The finance minister also got a break from 
lower international interest rates.  The reality is this budget 
was balanced by charging Canadians more taxes and giving them 
less in return.  That is neither prudent nor responsible. It is 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Myth number six is that Canadians are better off today than they 
were before the Liberals took over in 1993.  Reality number six 
is Canadians are worse off today than they were in 1993.  I take 
no joy in saying that. There is no victory for the official 
opposition in that statement.  This government has failed 
Canadians.  It uses smoke and mirrors to manipulate the truth so 
Canadians will feel better about themselves and blindly spend 
more money so government revenues will climb even higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers the finance minister says obscure what is important 
about a budget are all that is important about a budget.  I will 
list them so members can see for themselves why the finance 
minister wants to avoid them.  Canadians are paying $900 million 
more in income tax through bracket creep.  Canadians are paying 
$1.14 billion more in CPP premiums just to receive less in 
benefits when they retire; in simpler terms, paying more, getting 
less.  Canadians are paying $42 billion more in taxes in 1999 
than they were in 1993.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The national debt has risen by $130 billion since 1993. Balanced 
budgets are the result of excessive tax hikes and onerous cost 
recovery schemes. Canadians are receiving $4.3 billion less in 
federal health care in 1999 than in 1993; paying more, getting 
less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget was supposed to make the lives of Canadians better. 
It was supposed to increase their standard of living.  These are 
the finance minister's own words so he must admit that he has 
failed, for Canadians are being forced to pay more and get less. 
We pay more taxes and get less health care.  This is obviously 
reversed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote once again Diane Francis who hits the nail right on the 
head, despite the cries of protest from the other side, when she 
says: “Ottawa should be forced to work backward.  Taxpayers 
should demand back the billions Ottawa has over collected since 
1993 in the form of pro rata tax cuts, to repay the unfair 
deindexing in an era of non inflation.  After all, working 
backward while paying for essentials is exactly how Canadian 
households and business must conduct their financial affairs. 
Canadians struggle to pay escalating taxes, rents, food and other 
expenses.  Why hasn't Ottawa ever suffered?  Because it does not 
have to.  That's why this budget is a national insult”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we get to 
questions and comments I wanted to confirm with the hon. member 
for Prince George—Peace River that he was splitting his time. Is 
that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Yes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
those who were listening to the speech probably heard the message 
from the member that Canadians are paying higher taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quickly wrote down what I saw in the last couple of budgets. I 
saw an increase in the child care expense deduction from $5,000 
to $7,000 for those who provide child care for preschool 
children. I saw a total elimination of the 3% surtax that was 
intended for deficit elimination.  I saw a $675 increase in the 
basic amount of the non-refundable tax credit for all Canadians. 
I also saw that 600,000 Canadians were no longer paying tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, and the member has not taken it into account, I 
saw the government provide each and every Canadian with the 
opportunity to invest in RESPs for their children's education, 
another $400 a year annual credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also saw a $1.7 billion increase in the non-taxable child tax 
benefit.  I could go on but being an accountant I sat down and I 
calculated that Canadians in fact are paying less in taxes and 
getting more non-taxable benefits than they ever have since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member mean by bracket creep? Does he understand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the 
hon. member should ask that question.  I asked the question who 
is the bracket creep some four years ago.  I wanted someone on 
the other side to take responsibility.  Someone on the other side 
has to be this fellow, this mystery man named bracket creep that 
keeps ripping more and more taxes out of Canadian pocket books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is bracket creep sees that people are taxed more and 
more heavily because it is not indexed to inflation.  Taxes are 
not indexed to inflation and therefore people are put into a 
higher bracket and taxed more heavily. This results in more and 
more revenue flowing into government coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the tax credit for child care for 
preschool children.  It is interesting that the member raised 
that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I see you are on the edge of your seat. Are you 
having a problem?  Maybe the House could help you out with it. I 
am not sure what the problem is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The problem is we 
have another question coming. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to 
remind my colleague from Prince George—Peace River that his 
Reform Party health critic said that the $50 million designated 
for rural health care is an excellent investment by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are investing in Canadians, rural Canadians.  I know this 
member represents a rural part of Canada.  So these moneys along 
with telehealth and telehomecare will make a great difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Prince George—Peace River agree with his 
colleague from Macleod?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, are you going to give me 
enough time to adequately respond this time?  Or, are you going 
to be on the edge of your seat the whole time I am standing here 
and make me nervous about how much time I have left to respond? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member of 
Prince George—Peace River has a minute and 30 seconds and it is 
counting down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in that case I will try to be 
brief.  Obviously the Liberals must get something right in their 
budget.  Some small part of their budget must do some good for 
Canadians.  That does not overcome the sad fact that the Canadian 
people are the ones who are paying over and over again for every 
small increase in health care or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said repeatedly in this place for five long years that 
the government has never got its priorities right about spending. 
It would have much more money to invest, as it likes to call it, 
in health care if it would quit spending money so foolishly and 
quit going over budget all the time like it is doing again in 
1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In his speech the member referred to the Department of 
Revenue Canada as geniuses.  I think he would like to correct the 
record on that.  He tried to say that was a reality and we all 
know that is a myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if that was a point of order I 
need my cowboy hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that I was being very sarcastic in 
referring to Revenue Canada as geniuses.  If those geniuses over 
there cannot figure out then they are not geniuses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I do not know how to match that enlightened exchange.  I left my 
cowboy boots off but I will do my best to get into this pay more, 
get less budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am shocked and appalled at some of my hon. friends opposite 
who purport to know what wealth creation is all about. They know 
how to balance a budget and to meet a payroll.  One of my friends 
from Mississauga South claims to be an accountant.  My 
condolences to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people should know how to read a set of financial 
documents.  They should be able to understand what a surplus is, 
what a deficit is, what a tax is and what a spending increase is. 
Apparently they do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent the last several years of my life studying public 
finance.  I may not be any great expert, but I can say that the 
budget document presented to this place by the finance minister 
three weeks ago was not a budget.  When it comes to presenting in 
a transparent fashion the public finances of the country the 
budget was a joke.  No serious financial analyst in the country 
would give the budget a unqualified grade in terms of the 
transparency of its reporting of public spending and government 
taxing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has to be the starting point of this debate.  Even though 
most laymen do not want to spend much time sifting through the 
details and the numbers to come to the bottom line, the reality 
is that we as parliamentarians must be able to read that document 
and understand what the heck is going on in terms of spending, 
taxing, debt borrowing and debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot do that because the finance minister has become the 
laughing stock of public accounting.  He included spending in 
this year's budget that will happen two years from now.  In some 
areas of this year's budget he included spending that happened 
two years ago.  He called spending increases like the child tax 
credit entitlement a tax cut.  There are some tax increases which 
he calls spending cuts.  As a starting point, it is virtually 
impossible to get to the bottom of what the budget is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as the opposition do not have to make an argument about the 
fact that the budget will actually increase the taxes of 
Canadians and will result in fewer government services than was 
the case in 1993.  We do not have to make that case because 
people know it intuitively.  They know it through their 
experience.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People know they are paying more taxes now than they ever have 
before in their lives because of the irresponsible fiscal 
policies of the government.  They know that the standard of 
health care which they receive is at a lower level than they can 
ever remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to make a political argument to the 186,000 
Canadians who stand today on waiting lines for essential health 
care services.  We do not have to make a political argument to 
the 1.2 million low income Canadians paying taxes today who were 
not paying taxes when the government came to power in 1993.  We 
do not have to make a political argument about the effect of the 
budget and its predecessor budgets on middle class single income 
earner families that are paying more and more and more year after 
year, even though they are working harder and trying to play by 
the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to make that argument because they see it on 
their paycheques.  They see it when they go to the emergency 
rooms.  They see the deterioration of public service as a result 
of the government's misplaced spending priorities.  They see that 
they are struggling harder and harder just to get by.  It really 
is not a question of making a political argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Mississauga South just now and earlier 
during question period the hon. Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions suggest that among other 
things the budget would somehow take 600,000 low income Canadians 
off the tax rolls by allegedly raising the basic personal 
exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as I pointed out in question period, with the new Liberal 
math they forget to tell us the whole story.  Part of the story 
is that since 1993, 1.2 million low income Canadians, those who 
can least afford it, many of whom are under the poverty line, 
single mothers and single parents struggling to get by or seniors 
on fixed incomes, have seen themselves pushed on to the tax rolls 
by the government's pernicious back door tax grab called bracket 
creep, by the pernicious tax on inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these people get a cost of living adjustment in their pension 
cheques or their minimum wage income from working in the labour 
force, if they get an automatic COLA, a cost of living 
adjustment, they end up paying taxes not because they are making 
more in real terms—they are making the same in real terms—but 
because the government decides to generate more revenue to 
finance its insatiable appetite for spending in a way that is not 
transparent, in a way that Canadians cannot see it and in a way 
that parliament cannot approve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a study released last week by the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation, an organization with which I have some familiarity, 
it was reported that since 1986, since the then Progressive 
Conservative government brought in bracket creep and deindexed 
the tax system with respect to any inflation under 3%, the 
government has generated an annual revenue haul of $12 billion. 
That is just as a result of bracket creep.  Next year Canadians 
will end up paying $1,300 more than they did before as a result 
of the consequence of bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has added 1.2 million people on to the tax rolls. 
It has pushed millions of modest income Canadians into higher tax 
brackets.  Then it claims, lo and behold, that by some absolutely 
token adjustment in the basic personal exemption in the budget it 
will be lifting 600,000 Canadians off the tax rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members forget to tell us that they have not indexed 
the tax system to inflation.  They have not eliminated the 
pernicious tax grab called bracket creep.  It continues its nasty 
work of increasing taxes on Canadians so that 300,000 more 
Canadians will be paying taxes two years from now as a result of 
the effects of bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just do some simple math here.  Liberals may have to get 
out their calculators to follow it.  If we take the 1.2 million 
people the Liberals have added to the tax rolls since 1993 and 
subtract their figure of the number of people who will be taken 
off the tax rolls as a result of the increase in the personal 
exemption, we end up with a net of 600,000.  If we add to that 
600,000 new taxpayers the 300,000 who will end up back on the tax 
rolls as a result of bracket creep, what is the net number? Maybe 
some of my friends opposite could not follow the math, but 
900,000 low income Canadians will be paying taxes two years from 
now. 
These are the Canadians the government claims to speak for in 
terms of those who need the most help from society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to make the argument because grassroots Canadians 
make it every day.  As revenue critic I get flooded with letters 
from people who tell me about it.  For example, a constituent of 
mine, James Mitchell, e-mailed me recently to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just read about the federal Liberal budget.  I am married, have 
two small children.  My wife has chosen not to work but to stay 
at home and raise them.  I make $80,000, which is sort of a 
middle class income, and therefore the government treats me as a 
cash cow.  As an employee I have no deductions.  My wife has been 
forced to dip into RRSPs.  I don't get a tax credit for her or 
for our children.  We are living from paycheque to paycheque and 
have no savings.  I am appalled that the Liberal view is to spend 
instead of reduce taxes.  While I was born and raised in Calgary 
I feel that there is no hope in this country for a family like 
ours.  I am now making plans regrettably to move to the United 
States where I will be able to save for my future and provide for 
the education of my two children and at the same time maintain 
and improve my standard of living. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a tragedy, a tragedy that was reiterated by Arthur 
Friedrich who wrote to the <I>National Post</I> yesterday.  He is 
a steelworker who indicates that at one point he was a campaign 
worker for the minister of heritage.  He says that he will be 
moving to the United States as well.  He started work as a 
steelworker.  He goes through his family's fiscal situation and 
winds up by saying that he is being bludgeoned by the tax system 
and deeply wishes that things were different.  “I like Canada 
and really wanted to stay, but I no longer see any future for my 
children in this land”.  This is the tragedy of the Liberal 
government's pay more, get less approach to fiscal mismanagement, 
and it must end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. 
member from Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all allowed to make mistakes. Reformers brought forward 
their budget for one or two years.  I believe it has been here 
for a few years.  I wonder out loud why they are no longer 
bringing forth a budget document or, if they have one, why they 
are hiding it.  It was a great idea to have this shadow budget 
until the world collapsed on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their budget the Reformers would slash and burn and sacrifice 
the future of Canadians.  They would sacrifice health care of 
Canadians.  It is not fair for them to turn their backs on our 
seniors, our youth and our unemployed just for the sake of tax 
cuts to make some certain area of the country more wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House believe in our country and in its 
citizens.  Reformers almost made a mockery of my saying that we 
invest in our country and in our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member the same question I asked another member. 
He is a person who represents a very urban area. The budget 
offers many possibilities of funding programs for people in 
remote areas of the country and in rural Canada.  When I stand in 
the House I am speaking for all people in the country.  I want to 
represent all people in the country.  What about the $50 million 
designated for rural Canada which the Reform Party health critic 
says is an excellent program?  Does the hon. member believe in 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
I can advise the member that unlike any other opposition party, 
at least in my political lifetime, the Reform Party has year 
after year presented a detailed alternative to the government's 
fiscal plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would like it, he can get it from the website at 
www.reform.ca or by writing me postage free at the House of 
Commons.  The document he would be looking for is called “Taxes 
and Health Care: A Prebudget Submission of the Official 
Opposition”.  We go through in some great detail the kind of 
choices we would make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we would spend more on health care, more than the 
government has.  We would completely replace the $16 billion 
cumulatively that has been taken out of the health care system by 
the hardhearted misplaced priorities of the government.  We would 
do it not by raising overall spending.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals cannot imagine.  They say how can you increase one 
program without increasing overall spending?  It is magic.  The 
word is called priorities.  We think health care is a higher 
priority than the kind of corporate welfare that was increased in 
this budget by grants, subsidies and loans to corporations, their 
friends in the big corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think health care could be increased not by increasing 
overall spending but by cutting low priority spending and the 
kind of pork barrel ministry of the minister of heritage and by 
reducing subsidies to bloated crown corporations and by 
privatizing redundant crown corporations that can operate more 
efficiently in the private sector and by eliminating grants and 
handouts to interest groups.

to the problems of the health care system today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all the comments of his colleagues around support for a 
parallel private health care system, support for core and 
non-core health services being available outside medicare, what 
is the position of the member's party with respect to support for 
for-profit companies?  What does the Reform Party think about 
money from the federal budget going into a province like Ontario 
to fund, to line the pockets of large American based corporations 
like Olsten to provide home care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the real position of the Reform Party when it comes to 
the steady slide toward an Americanized two tier health care 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, our position is that we 
support a universal, accessible, publicly administered health 
care system that is administered by the provinces with national 
standards agreed on by the provinces in a co-operative fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are opposed to is the kind of multi-tier health care 
system that governments like this federal Liberal government and 
the NDP governments in Saskatchewan and British Columbia have 
given us which have forced Canadians on to these waiting lists in 
such a way that if they want to get their critical care tended to 
they now feel they have to take their private dollars and go to 
private clinics in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is wrong.  That kind of two tier NDP style health care 
should come to an end by properly protecting the public system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the members for Prince 
George—Peace River and for Calgary Southeast.  The member for 
Prince George—Peace River said tell the story, tell the whole 
story, we are not shooting straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member for Calgary Southeast.  Not once in his 
remarks did he offer any constructive alternative.  Leadership is 
all about dealing in hope.  The reality that Canadians surely 
understand is that six years ago we had an unemployment situation 
of 11.4% when we assumed power.  When this budget was announced 
it was 7.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not proud.  None of us are proud of that 7.8%, especially 
in remote areas of our country where we have unemployment numbers 
far in excess of that and especially the huge numbers related to 
youth unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be candid.  We cannot be proud of those numbers.  When we 
talk about dealing in hope, we talk about where we were six years 
ago and where we are heading.  What is the trajectory of where 
this government's financial plan is headed?  I believe the 
Minister of Finance has the trajectory going the right way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few Canadians realize that one of the things we have had to 
do in order to create an economic climate that would cause 
businesses to invest in Canada and those businesses here to 
further invest was create a climate of stability, a climate where 
those jobs that have been created in the last few years, almost a 
million and a half, would remain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not happen unless the expenditure plan of this 
government came under some control. Quite frankly I am surprised 
that the Reform Party does not take credit for this.  The reality 
is that because of the pressure of Reform in the last six years 
in my humble opinion the cuts around here have been so drastic in 
so many areas. This was done all in the name of putting the 
fiscal framework of this country back together. I think quite 
frankly that we have gone in many cases away too far with the 
fiscal discipline in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget we are just beginning to see a return to a 
sensitivity toward some of those things that really built this 
nation. We are beginning to replenish the health care system in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I say quite openly, I still think we have a long way 
to go.  The reality is we had to do it in the context where at 
the same time we could keep the economic confidence of this 
country moving forward.  We all know how fragile economic 
confidence is.  I think the Minister of Finance has been faced 
with a very tough balancing act.  He has had to get that 
trajectory of fiscal responsibility going the right way but at 
the same time we all know that average Canadians, low income 
Canadians and seniors have carried an awful lot of economic pain 
on their backs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier in my remarks, today is the day when we should 
be dealing in some hope.  The member for Calgary Southeast should 
have stood here today and acknowledged the fact that the fiscal 
framework was heading in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Calgary Southeast when it comes to 
comprehensive tax reform.  I totally agree.  I think this is one 
issue for parliamentarians in all parties.  The separatists have 
already said in committee if they ever did become a separate 
country the first thing they would do is have comprehensive tax 
reform.  I believe the economy is going so well now, even though 
there are better times still needed, that separatism is almost 
dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent last week in Quebec City and it is hard to find a 
separatist.  They are all coming home.  They are all coming back 
to the reality that Canada is a much better place whole than 
divided. That to me comes from an economic climate that is 
improving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in the House today satisfied that we are heading in the 
right direction.  Do we have to do more?  Yes. We have to do a 
lot more, especially in Atlantic Canada.  We have too many young 
people in Atlantic Canada who have absolutely no work and there 
does not seem to be any opportunity for work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Reform Party calls it, not patronage, but pork 
barrelling. I would be proud to push, press, prod the Minister of 
Industry to move some of that innovation money to Atlantic Canada 
where those highly educated young Atlantic Canadians could get 
involved in computer programming, creativity, computer 
manufacturing and become a leadership section of Canada in the 
whole realm of information technology.  Would I take $1 billion 
and move it to Atlantic Canada and reinforce that sector out of 
the information technology fund, the knowledge based fund? I 
would do it in a second. 
I know the Reform Party calls that pork barrelling.  I do not 
call it pork barrelling when we see a region of this country that 
needs extraordinary help because its natural resource fell away 
from it through no fault of its own.  That is what I would do 
about that problem of youth unemployment in Atlantic Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the members across the way that we still have a long 
way to go, but the fact of the matter is we are seeing all kinds 
of hope right now.  The fiscal framework is moving in the right 
direction.  The health plan is being replenished.  There are 
actually little sparks of hope for comprehensive tax reform in 
this budget.  There was at least an attempt by the Minister of 
Finance to get lower income Canadians off the tax rolls.  It did 
not go far enough in my opinion, but those are the kinds of 
things that a constructive opposition would acknowledge and then 
complement with some specific ideas of its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far here today I can honestly say that all I have heard have 
been dealers in gloom.  That is not leadership.  They should be 
dealers in hope and they failed that test today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hope the member talks about should be the hope 
of the millions of Canadians who have been driven into the ground 
by the oppressive tax regime of this Liberal government. That is 
the hope the Reform Party holds out for Canadians, that some day 
when this government is replaced by a fiscally responsible 
government, by a government that recognizes the hard work and the 
sacrifice made by hardworking Canadians, we will give them the 
tax relief this government will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to talk not in rhetoric as the previous members did but 
in facts.  Let us look at the Liberal record since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the average working Canadian has seen his paycheque 
decrease by over $2,200 in increased taxes, increased taxes per 
Canadian worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian household has seen a decrease in disposable 
income by over $4,000.  That is over $4,000 that families cannot 
spend on food and clothing and education, let alone try to save 
any money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen the overall taxes increased by this government 
by 40— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not rhetoric.  I 
say this humbly to Canadians that we came to the responsibility, 
the trust for this government with 11.4% unemployment and it has 
been reduced to 7.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a cost to Canadians to create that economic 
climate to maintain jobs, plus the 1.5 million that had been 
created.  There has been a cost.  The member is right.  I have 
acknowledged that he is right.  One of the single biggest issues 
that we have to face as a whole parliament is comprehensive tax 
reform.  In the process of getting there, do not knock the hope 
that we are moving in the right direction.  That is a very 
principal point.

of the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Broadview—Greenwood realize that, since the

ask the member to be honest with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that he is satisfied with this tiny, little increase in 
the basic personal exemption when what we continue to see in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the day the member for 
Calgary Southeast was elected to this Chamber I actually 
celebrated his victory because I thought from day one that when 
he got here he would press all of us to get into comprehensive 
tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should have been doing that three months before the budget. 
Instead we played around with pepper spray and gossipy 
conversations on airplanes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pray that this member, who understands tax reform better than 
all of us put together, will make it his personal mission in the 
next six months that we get on to comprehensive tax reform so 
that it is part of the next budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora—Rainy River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to commend my colleague from Broadview—Greenwood 
who has been a seatmate of mine for 11 years now.  Since we 
entered this debate some 11 years ago a lot of changes have 
occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member for Calgary Southeast is quite new to 
this place, so he may have forgotten who he used to vote for 
before the Reform Party came along.  I am sure he would like to 
tell us sometime who he used to vote for before he decided to 
create his own party.  Now he is going to try to create another 
one because he is not happy with the one he has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little disturbed that he cannot seem to get his parties 
right, but he does know that the party he voted for when I was in 
opposition with my colleagues here on that side was a government 
that racked up a huge deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we first got to this place some 11 years ago, as the member 
for Broadview—Greenwood said, Canadians had absolutely no hope. 
Everywhere I went in Kenora—Rainy River, one of the largest 
rural ridings in Canada, probably one of the largest pieces of 
geography for one member to represent in all of North America, 
everyone was very down and out and very depressed about where we 
were going as a country.  I can understand why because there were 
no choices, no options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year was the first time in my voting life that I voted for 
a government that had a balanced budget.  Imagine that.  I am not 
exactly a young man, but the fact remains that I have never voted 
for a government that had a balanced budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the pundits say last year?  Not much.  They had a real 
tough time saying congratulations to the Canadian government for 
starting to get its fiscal house in order and starting to show 
some understanding of how the country should be run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we had a second balanced budget.  Of course the right 
wing pundits were out there saying “That is not good enough. You 
have got two balanced budgets for the first time in 50 years, but 
you have got to start getting your act together.  The country is 
going to fall apart because you did not cut enough, you did not 
do enough in debt reduction and you are starting to spend 
money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the criticisms that I have heard so far about the 
budget.  This is a very telling tale.  The criticism of this 
budget is that we did not spend enough on health care, we did not 
cut taxes enough and we did not reduce the debt enough.  That is 
the kind of criticism that I think is exceptionally well placed 
because when I first got here these debates did not occur.  We 
were so confused as a country, wondering whether we were ever 
going to get out of the quagmire we were in, that we could not 
even criticize how much debt we paid down or how big a tax cut we 
would have.  We were wondering whether we were going to be a 
third world country soon because of what we were doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are at the point where we can see some hope.  Canadians 
are showing that.  We are having debates now, serious debates 
about where we are going.  The fact is that we have balanced 
budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a discussion about the fact that unemployment has 
gone from 11.4% to 7.8%.  When we first got here, if unemployment 
had been at 7.8%, we would have been dancing in the streets.  Now 
we are being criticized that that is not good enough because the 
Americans have 4.5% unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is a great debate because my riding is a big rural 
riding.  I wish my friend from Prince George—Bulkley Valley was 
here because, quite frankly, I am quite concerned about this 
whole debate of tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts over there from 
rural members of the Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the parts that interests me about the budget is the 
flexibility to build a nation.  Where I come from building a 
nation means building infrastructure.  Without government there 
would be no infrastructure.  We can bet in Kenora—Rainy River, 
where three-quarters of my riding has absolutely no roads, no 
infrastructure at all, that that is a great potential for the 
future of our young generation.  If we keep talking only about 
how much tax we have, are we ever going to get to building a 
nation?  That is what I want to do in rural parts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend billions of dollars on a national highway 
program, a national infrastructure program part two, so that we 
can start putting money where it really belongs so our kids will 
have a future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had my way I would rather pay the debt down than make tax 
cuts because I have no sense of urgency to help Conrad Black who 
is one of the people responsible for the big taxes and the big 
debt we have in this country.  It was his newspapers that were 
all supporting of Mulroney and his crew when they kept racking it 
up and up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand why members of the Reform Party jumped ship.  I 
would have jumped ship too if I had to sit there every day and 
try to explain as a right winger why somebody who was supposedly 
right wing could not get their fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next issue really is the future.  We have been through the 
past as opposition members.  We have now seen our government, 
since 1993, go from a $42 billion deficit down to balanced 
budgets, with a commitment for two more.  We are now entering 
into a very key time in our country's development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said to the electorate of Kenora—Rainy River in 1993 when 
I ran for the second time, I see this as a ten year program.  It 
is going to take us one term to clean up the mess.  It is going 
to take us another term to start to build a nation.  We are now 
doing that.  We are basically going on our seventh year.  I think 
it is important now that the debate start to get away from the 
nonsense of whether there is a little scandal here in the shower 
or whether there is APEC or whether there is this or that.  I 
think we need to start talking about where we want this country 
to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members an example of what I mean.  One of the 
issues that I have discussed with the Minister of Health is the 
issue of rural health.  Some people in this place talk about 
lineups.  Some people talk about emergency procedures. 
Where I come from we have neither.  We do not have lineups 
because we do not have hospitals.  We do not have emergency 
procedures because we do not have doctors.  This is not about 
rich and poor, this is about rural and urban.  We need a national 
rural health care plan in Canada.  The $50 million that the 
minister put in was all based on rural caucus asking this 
government to start recognizing the needs of rural Canada and 
ways that we could treat rural Canada differently because of the 
geography that we live in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite amazed that my colleague from Prince George—Peace 
River would even suggest that his main priority as a rural 
Canadian is to have tax cuts.  I was in his riding two years ago. 
His infrastucture needs and his abilities to create an economy 
are the same as mine.  He is a long way from getting where he 
wants to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start talking about hope.  Hope is the ability of 
governments to have flexibility.  It is the ability of 
governments to decide what their priorities are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know where the Reform Party is at.  It is at the point where 
it says it needs to recreate itself because it is not getting to 
where Canadians want it to be as a good alterative because it 
does not reflect the values of Canadians.  Perhaps Reform members 
should think twice about why there are certain little areas that 
they are plugging into and start thinking about the huge picture, 
the vision of the nation as a whole.  Then they would become a 
good alternative to this government if it got off track.  But so 
far it has been on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Never an alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  The lone Tory who is here says 
never.  I am not too worried about that, quite frankly.  But I 
really think that the government itself needs to be pushed on the 
vision of what Canada should look like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having to do it ourselves internally because Reform 
members spend their time trying to figure out:  “Here is one 
couple, they get this.  Here is another couple, they get that”. 
Can we imagine what the people at home are thinking?  They just 
do not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get real.  Let us get serious about why they are in 
opposition.  I really would like to see them focus on the issues 
that Canadians put them there for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that is important to me is the vision of the Liberal 
Party.  I have urged the ministers involved, now that we have our 
fiscal house in order, to put together the vision for the new 
millennium.  Our vision is going to carry us for about 50 years 
if it is a good vision, as the visions of past generations have 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Minister of Finance has done an excellent job of 
starting that process, of putting us in line to have this great 
debate.  I look forward to the debate.  I look forward to the 
different visions because in the end Canadians will decide.  So 
far they have bought the Liberal Party's vision and have said to 
the other parties “No thanks.  We don't agree with you.  We 
think you are way off base”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get into the next phase.  The next few budgets will 
really define where we go as Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this member says that Canadians have bought into this 
government's vision.  Let me remind him of one thing.  This 
government won 100% of the power in the last election with 38% of 
the vote.  The lowest plurality in Canadian history resulted in a 
majority government.  It lost the election in eight of the ten 
provinces and it won 101 of the 103 seats in Ontario with less 
than half of the vote.  If that is Canadians buying into this 
vision, then I would like to see what he really means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that I was voting for the Tory government 
before I became a Reform MP.  I can advise him that I was on the 
national policy committee of the Liberal Party of Canada as a 
supporter of John Turner because I was disgusted with the fiscal 
irresponsibility of the then Tory government.  I became equally 
disgusted with the fiscal irresponsibility of this Liberal 
government.  That is why I came to Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member then tells us that Conrad Black is to blame for the 
deficit.  He did not own any Canadian papers back in those days. 
I wish he—

Kenora—Rainy River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not blaming 
Conrad Black.  I was just suggesting to the folks who are writing

little more in depth.

them.  But when we read the <I>National Post</I> we get the sense 
that if we just cut taxes, everything would be happy around here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only wanted to make it clear to the member that I understand 
he had to jump parties in order to get elected.  God bless him, 
he is here.  But I do not think he has made much of a difference 
or a dint so far. Do not blame Ontario, which is a large portion 
of the Canadian population, that they voted for one party 
massively because they could not buy into the nonsense of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the last member who spoke, because he 
played a role in the employment insurance reform. 
If the government wants to give people hope, it ought to see to 
it that they have food on the table, as the hon. member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac often points out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You should look at what your government is doing in its budget 
to restore hope in the fisheries, which comes under its 
jurisdiction, particularly as regards the issue of catches. 
Instead of interfereing in a jurisdiction that is not yours, 
namely health, what did you do? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what do we have in answer to the fishermen from Newfoundland 
now?  What can we do for them?  What kind of hope can they have? 
If the member can answer that, the fishermen in Gaspé will 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes I did speak of hope 
and I am a supporter of the EI reforms that were made and this is 
why. There was a necessity in this country to deal with 
behavioural change.  I do not for a minute think it is acceptable 
for members of parliament to suggest to their electorate that it 
is okay to be on unemployment insurance, that it is a good thing 
to be on unemployment insurance, that people can work for two or 
three months a year in the fishery and then spend the rest of the 
year on EI and say that that is good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole objective of EI reform was to bring in behavioural 
change so people would say to themselves “Maybe now that my 
children are growing up I may not be able to do anything about it 
but maybe I can move them into industries where there is more 
potential”.  We will be proactive enough.  That is why we have 
the regional development programs in Quebec, ACOA in Atlantic 
Canada, WED in the west, FedNor in Ontario.  The whole objective 
is to help people. That is what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the member that the federation has given Quebec $8 
billion to $10 billion more than it gives back to the federation. 
This country is working because it is sharing its resources to 
help have not regions.  I do not think the separatists are going 
to get away with this continued—

takes me longer than that to clear my throat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was all caught up in this visionary concept that the member 
for Rainy River and the Liberal Party bring to this country. 
However, I was not quite that caught up with it because one of 
the parts of their vision was to rip up the free trade deal that 
was put in place by a previous government. A part of their vision 
obviously is to put health care back to 1995 levels.  Is that the 
part of the vision the member from the Liberal Party embraces, to 
scrap the free trade agreement and bring health care back to the 
1995 level where we should be well ahead of it in the year 2003? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 1993 we did not run 
to scrap the free trade agreement; it was the election before 
that.  I know the member was probably busy running Brandon so he 
did not have time to keep an eye on it. In 1993 we ran on the 
fact that we needed to make some improvements to the free trade 
agreement and that is exactly what we did.  But let me tell the 
member very quickly that $42 billion are 42 billion reasons why 
there are very few of those members left on that side.

comments, the hon. member for Wild Rose, 30 seconds. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
the hon. member talks about 7.5% unemployment, why does he never 
talk about the 70%, 80% and 90% unemployment in the aboriginal 
communities?  Why do the Liberals not mention that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the Liberals not talk about the poverty of children? 
There were a million children in poverty when this government 
came to power and now there are a million and a half.  Why do the 
Liberals not do something about that?  They should sell their 
Challenger jets and give the money to the Children's Aid Society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quit giving away free flags.  The Liberals should start thinking 
about the dumb things they are doing with money. They never talk 
about the dumb things they do.  They should start mentioning a 
few of those things.  Look at the public accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me make it very 
clear to the member, I represent 51 first nations so I do not 
need a lecture from him on the needs of aboriginal people.  I 
have forgotten more about aboriginal policy and politics than he 
will ever know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member really cared about aboriginal people, he would 
start by supporting C-49.  C-49 which we voted on yesterday is a 
good move for economic development to get people out of poverty 
in those first nations.  What does he do?  He plays the game of 
oh, there are a couple of women who are going to be upset about 
this, or they might have some rights that the municipalities or 
provinces already take for granted so we cannot do that because 
natives are not capable of looking after themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my experience with the first nations communities that I 
represent, if we keep on the track that this government has set 
out to build a partnership, we will see the unemployment rates in 
those communities go down.  If they take on the municipal vision 
of the Reform Party, they will go backward. That is why there is 
not one aboriginal in my region who will ever vote Reform as long 
as the party is around.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure and a great deal of interest to be sure that I rise 
today to participate in the budget debate in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True to form, the Liberal government has once again tried to 
convince the public that it is the grand champion as far as 
money management is concerned.  I have some doubts about this, 
and I would like to demonstrate that this is, in fact, a vast 
coverup operation to justify the directions being taken by a 
government that never stops meddling in areas that do not belong 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the ones really responsible for balancing the 
budget, the ones that merit congratulation, are the people of 
Canada. 
The Minister of Finance may well take advantage of any and all 
opportunities to tell people that he has worked miracles with 
Canada's finances, but we are nobody's fool.  Everyone knows 
very well that it is the middle class taxpayers and the 
unemployed who have done the job, the people who keep seeing a 
bigger and bigger chunk of their paycheques disappear, not the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a first examination of this year's budget, it would be easy 
to buy into the minister's announcement that he will be reducing 
the cuts by $9 billion over the next three years, to $33 billion 
rather than $42 billion.  Nevertheless, these are still cuts 
imposed on the provinces, and there is no cause for celebration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, things are not all that rosy, for roses have thorns. 
The Liberal government is taking advantage of the awkward 
situation in which it has placed the provinces to force a whole 
new round of interference on them in exchange for a certain 
increase in transfers.  After depriving the provinces of 
billions of dollars for health care, the Liberals want to spend 
hundreds of millions in statistics and on paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Minister of Finance has nothing to crow about because, as 
the auditor general pointed out in his report last April, he 
does not meet accounting standards and juggles financial 
statements to achieve his ends. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, the Liberal government has been making bigger and 
bigger mistakes in its deficit and surplus forecasts.  In the 
1999 budget, the Minister of Finance continues his juggling, 
despite the warnings of the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois have revealed the real figures.  While 
the Minister of Finance is predicting no surpluses for the next 
three fiscal years, we can say that the reality of the matter 
will be quite different.  For 1999-2000, surpluses should be on 
the order of $15 billion, whereas for 2000-01, they will be 
around $20 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, although the Minister of Finance had 
ample funds to introduce intelligent measures in response to the 
terrible job, health and poverty problems, he chose not to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, there is no doubt that the public has paid dearly 
for the terrible cuts in health, education and social 
assistance.  Unemployed workers saw their EI benefits drop or 
disappear entirely because of tighter eligibility criteria. And 
I will not mention the recovery quotas imposed by the Minister 
of Human Resources Development on his employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these sacrifices generated several billions of dollars for 
the EI fund and it is these surpluses in part that were used to 
lower the deficit. 
When we know that the government has not put one red cent into 
the EI fund since 1990, that the fund is growing at the 
astonishing rate of $2.5 million an hour, and that six persons 
in ten do not qualify for benefits, it is simply scandalous to 
see the Minister of Finance dipping into the fund whenever he 
wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy in the Sherbrooke region is down $23 million since 
the reform.  Another thing to consider when looking for who is 
really behind the reduced deficit is the increase in government 
revenues.  It is the taxpayers who, since 1994, have enabled the 
government to increase its revenues by contributing 56% of the 
increase in tax revenues and 14% through the GST, which, by the 
way, the Liberals promised to scrap in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of 1993-94, when the Liberal government took office, 
Quebeckers and Canadians paid $51.4 billion in personal income 
taxes. By the end of the year 1999-2000, they will be paying $75 
billion per year. This is an increase of $24 billion or 46%, and 
it amounts to $654 per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget did not change anything. Quebeckers and Canadians are 
always paying more for less. Once again, the government is 
collecting money from ordinary people. Even if salares increase 
from year to year, the mere fact that the government has not 
indexed tax rates and tax credits since 1986 means that people 
have less money in their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the case of a person who, in 1986, had two children and was 
earning $25,800. Because of the cost of living increase, that 
person's salary was $35,400 in 1996. 
However, this does not mean that person is earning more. First, 
the fact that the tax on the additional income was not indexed 
means that the person now has $3,790 less in disposable income 
than in 1986. Also, since the GST credit was not indexed, 
another $944 is gone. Then, because the federal family allowance 
was not indexed, another $544 has disappeared. Non-indexation of 
the child tax benefit means an additional shortfall of $602. 
Finally, we must take into account the child benefit, which 
still existed in 1986 and which represents a further drop of 
$1,157.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did the calculations and a person who earned $25,800 in 1986 
and who is now making $35,400 has $7,047 less than in 1986. So, 
under this federal system, a middle class worker must constantly 
pay but is always getting less for his money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have expected the minister to use the surpluses to 
tackle urgent issues, such as job creation, the fight against 
poverty and the funding of social programs, which he, along with 
his colleagues, dismantled. But no. True to himself, the 
Minister of Finance chose instead to help the wealthiest people 
in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the government is wasting billions of dollars in 
inadequate and mismanaged programs.  We need only think of the 
grants and contributions it makes through various departments 
such as Industry Canada or Heritage Canada, without any follow-up 
to show that our friends opposite are incapable of properly 
managing public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of the Liberal government's laxness are the 
renovations to the buildings on Parliament Hill, which will cost 
Quebec and Canadian taxpayers $1.4 billion.  A fine priority 
when we consider all the problems in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at length about the irregularities the Liberal 
government allows to go on, but the list is too long.  I will 
have the opportunity to come back to it and unmask the guilty. 
And I will do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to those that the millionaire Minister of Finance 
has looked after in his budget, that is, society's most well 
off.  The minister, in his magnanimity, has chosen to eliminate 
the 3% surtax on those with incomes over $60,000. This means 
that someone earning $250,000 will be entitled to $3,800 in tax 
savings this year.  People earning $120,000 will get about $700, 
whereas taxpayers with an average income of $50,000 will save 
only $350. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of people, who earn on average only $30,000, will 
save a meagre $90.  The minister is far from fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sixth budget of the Minister of Finance will go down in 
history, because the people of Quebec will long remember the 
bitter taste it left them.  This year's budget is an insult to 
the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the Minister of Finance has accomplished with his many 
cavalier measures is to show the public what really lies behind 
the masks of the Liberal cabinet members from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can these federal ministers from Quebec claim to represent 
their constituents?  I wonder, because what they have allowed to 
happen is unacceptable.  Why did these people stand by while 
Quebec was once again given the short end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The infamous social union agreement that the Prime Minister and 
his sidekick the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tried to 
get the Government of Quebec to endorse is completely 
ridiculous.  Although Quebec did not sign the agreement, the 
Minister of Finance used this piece of paper to amend the 
already tenuous balance of the social transfer formula as he 
wished and with no advance warning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government decided unilaterally that it would change the 
rules of the game this year.  In the past, federal transfer 
payments for health were based on a traditional formula, but 
now, without warning, it has been decided that population will 
be the criterion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not surprisingly, the result of these changes is that the 
richest provinces will now suddenly get the biggest slice of the 
federal transfer pie.  No wonder the Premier of Quebec found 
himself on his own at the February 4 first ministers meeting. 
The government had just negotiated an agreement, to his 
detriment, with Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta that would 
mean a big pay-off for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearer now why these three provinces were such staunch 
defenders of the social union.  For the upcoming fiscal year, 
Ontario will get $1 billion of the CHST, British Columbia $400 
million and Albert $300 million.  What will Quebec get?  A 
paltry $150 million.  It is ridiculous.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance would have us believe that Quebec is 
benefiting from the federal government's generosity through 
equalization. I remind the minister that the equalization 
program has been in place for a long time and that its purpose 
is to give provincial governments adequate revenues to enable 
them to provide public services at reasonably comparable quality 
and tax levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $1.4 billion that the federal government is sending to 
Quebec was owed to us, because the calculations for previous 
years were erroneous. The federal government is sending $1.4 
billion after depriving us of $6.5 billion since 1994. I say the 
minister could have done better, much better. 
And members should not try to tell me that we are getting more 
than our fair share. Since 1994, 39% of the cuts made by the 
Minister of Finance to social transfers have affected Quebec, 
compared to only 32% in the case of Ontario. Once again, the 
Minister of Finance does not seem very fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the real issue is why these equalization payments are made 
to us, and not to other provinces, such as Ontario. The answer 
is simple: it is because Quebec's economy is weaker than the 
economy in Ontario, which has always enjoyed preferential 
treatment on the part of the federal government. If Quebec got 
its fair share of federal investments, it would more than likely 
not receive equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Quebec is only getting 20% of the federal 
government's current spending in goods and services, only 18% of 
the federal funding to businesses, and only 14% of the federal 
money invested in research and development. I would be remiss if 
I did not also mention the $2 billion the federal government 
owes to Quebec for harmonizing the GST. Members can imagine the 
difference all these billions could make in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I said this budget would go down in history is 
simple: this budget is the last straw when it comes to the 
arrogance displayed by the federal government toward Quebec. 
After intruding in education last year with its millennium 
scholarships, this government is doing the same thing again this 
year in health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa will therefore be injecting $1.4 billion into health, 
although this is still a provincial jurisdiction.  What 
conclusion can one come to about such measures, which do nothing 
but duplicate services Quebec is already offering to the 
population?  What a fine waste of time, money and energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having cut billions of dollars from transfer payments, having 
smothered the provinces, which were already busy tidying up 
their own finances. and did not need any additional burden, and 
having provoked an unprecedented crisis in the health field, the 
Minister of Finance and his colleague the Minister of Health 
have piled arrogance on top of arrogance, by imposing their 
views upon the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget contains in particular $328 million for health 
information systems. However, I would like to know how such a 
measure will make it possible to shorten the waiting time in our 
constantly overburdened emergency departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creation of the national health surveillance network with its 
budget of $190 million over the next three years, is another 
example of inappropriate and pointless spending, for such a 
network dealing with the detection of serious illnesses and the 
electronic linking of Canadian laboratories will not respond to 
the real and crying needs of the health care system in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creation of the Canada health network, telehealth and 
telehomecare are other measures dreamed up by the federal 
government to create still more administrative structures it can 
control from Ottawa.  People will understand that this is 
obviously part of the Liberal plan to satisfy their unquenchable 
thirst for visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian institute for health information is another 
institution that will receive funds to report periodically on 
the health of Canadians and their health system, specifically on 
waiting lists, and the doctors and specialist assignments and 
the most effective courses of treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the federal government, this funding will promote a 
better accounting of health care.  While all the provinces 
rejected the annual health care report card, the government is 
doing indirectly what it cannot do directly under the 
Constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of what the federal government has come up with 
to waste public money, and we know it does not lack for ideas in 
this area, is the famous research and evaluation fund for 
nursing staff, which will conduct research in the amount of $25 
million over the next ten years to, among other things, come up 
with solutions to the challenges to nursing staff in the coming 
decade.  But what exactly does this have to do with the federal 
government, I wonder? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we can add to this dismal list of federal interference 
the amount of $75 million to be spent over the next three years 
on prenatal nutrition programs, and the $50 million, again over 
the next three years, to find ways to attract doctors to rural 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After thoroughly reviewing the budget, it is clear to me that 
the Minister of Finance is trying to make us believe that this 
is a budget that is fair to all Quebeckers and Canadians. 
However, this is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a gift to the privileged in our society, whether 
they are individuals or rich provinces, at the expense of the 
unemployed and the poor. Moreover, as members will have noticed, 
the Liberal government is doing something with this budget that 
it has no right to do, that is to ignore the Constitution and 
once again get involved in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers are no fools. Our determination to take control our 
own destiny is strengthened when we see the real nature of the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the member for Broadview—Greenwood said he did not think 
there were many separatists in Quebec any more. He is right. 
There are not many separatists in Quebec, but there are more and 
more sovereignists, particularly as a result of the Liberal 
government's budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from the Bloc for his speech and have a 
question that has to do with the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually it has to do with the health care expenditures the 
government made in the budget which were nowhere near what it 
took out.  Nevertheless it did put some back in.  It also has to 
do with the fact that Quebec did not sign the social union.  I 
think the reason it refused to sign the social union was a good 
one.  The reason it refused to sign was that the federal 
government refused to give up any of its authority which under 
the Constitution does not really belong to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government keeps asserting its spending power and in 
so doing effectively blackmails the provinces into accepting 
money that initially comes from people in the provinces.   If a 
province did not accept the money it would simply go to another 
province.  We are in a situation where effectively the provinces 
have to accept the rules of the federal government or they will 
be denied money and will not be doing the job that they should be 
doing for their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague from the Bloc agree with that analysis and 
that it is time for a more co-operative approach to dealing with 
programs like health care that fall into provincial jurisdiction? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin:</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed the Government of Quebec, 
which did not sign the social union agreement along with the 
other provinces, was soundly punished for this.  According to 
the federal budget, social transfers are made on a per capita 
basis, but if one looks at the reality, there is $150 million 
for Quebec and about $900 million for Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doing the math, this must mean Ontario has a population of some 
42 million, since Quebec has approximately 7 million.  So it can 
already been seen that, where the social transfer is concerned, 
and they speak of payments according to population, the figures 
do not balance out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health is a provincial area of jurisdiction.  It is one Quebec 
is capable of managing properly. 
While Quebec, and a number of other provinces, were concluding 
that health reform was necessary, the federal government was 
brutally slashing health funding, which pretty well hamstrung 
all the efforts the provinces and Quebec were putting into 
health.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, with all these surpluses in its coffers, the federal 
government is trying to interfere in all manner of areas in 
which it has no business, seeking any excuse, seeking to justify 
its existence.  As far as I am concerned, however, the federal 
government no longer has any reason to exist. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to rise to take part in this budget 
debate, however sad that example of the Reform from Alberta 
cozying up to the separatists may have made me.  It is surprising 
that the comparison the Bloc did not make was to the fair share 
that Alberta received in this budget as well which was so warmly 
received by Mr. Klein. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the leadership of our Prime Minister, the federal 
government has now created conditions where Canadians can be 
optimistic about the future.  After years of difficult choices, 
the finances of the nation are now solid and the government can 
act on those things that matter to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By far the greatest priority for Canadians is the strength of 
our public health care system.  Over the next five years, an 
additional $11.5 billion will be transferred to the provinces to 
be used in meeting the health care standards that Canadians have 
a right to expect. 
In my own province of Ontario, an increase of almost $4.4 
billion will go into health care. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is an obvious element of our quality of life and our 
quality of life is clearly dependent on our standard of living. 
The question is how can we maintain or, better still, how can we 
improve our living standards in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1987 we have done okay.  Our standard of living has grown 
by 7%.  However, when we look at our American neighbours we see 
that in the same time they have increased their standard of 
living by 17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand why this has happened we need to look at the 
productivity growth rates that we have realized in Canada over 
that period of time.  Productivity, the measure of the efficiency 
with which people, capital, resources and ideas are combined, is 
the most important determinant of our standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately over the last 25 years Canada has had the lowest 
rate of productivity growth in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If productivity in Canada had grown by 1.2% per year faster, 
which is the gap between the average U.S. and Canadian growth 
rates, our per capita income would have been $7,000 per year 
higher than it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that last fall the finance committee of this 
House warned that the slower rate of productivity growth is a 
cause for real concern for Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to an Ekos survey, 82% of Canadians believe that 
increasing Canada's economic productivity is essential to 
improving our standard of living.  Canadians understand the 
challenge.  With time and a concerted effort, the government and 
the private sector acting in partnership can make sure that all 
Canadians see an increase in their wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a strong foundation from which we can work.  The broad 
economic conditions of the country are coming together.  Last 
year this government recorded the first budgetary surplus in 28 
years.  Our inflation rate has been the lowest in more than a 
generation and interest rates are low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And on the employment front, Canada is creating jobs at a rate 
unequalled in the G-7. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have demonstrated that when they put their minds to a 
task, as they did to eliminating the deficit, they can achieve 
their goals.  This aptitude will stand us in good stead for the 
productivity challenge to which we must now turn our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the nation's accumulated debt, first of all, the 
government acknowledges that debt is simply too large.  The 
Minister of Finance has confirmed that we will make greater and 
greater inroads on the debt and in this fiscal year alone the 
debt to GDP ratio should drop to 65.3%. 
In the last two years we have seen the retirement of $20 billion 
of market debt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada's overall tax burden ranks about the average 
among the G-7, but the reality is that it is higher than that in 
the United States which is our major competitor. In the budget 
the government set out its plan for tax relief, that it needs to 
be fair, it needs to be focused on the individual and it needs to 
be sustainable or permanent.  Taken together, the 1998 and 1999 
budgets provide tax relief totalling $16.5 billion over three 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, stronger productivity growth will require stronger 
business investment in technology, machinery and equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four, we need more foreign investment in Canada because it can 
bring new technology and ideas. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, Canadians must take more chances, innovate more often and 
bring our ideas to market.  The government's decision to invest 
an additional $50 million in technology partnerships Canada 
signals that we understand innovation is a strong determinant of 
productivity growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still though, Canada's private sector spends less on research 
and development as a share of its GDP, despite our more generous 
R&D tax incentives.  Fewer than 1% of Canadian firms perform any 
R&D. 
Moreover, not enough Canadian ideas are commercialized in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, while the World Economic Forum ranks Canada first in 
knowledge workers, we are not following through with on the job 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, our exports are concentrated in too few firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together, training, trade and R&D, the World Economic 
Forum ranks Canadian businesses as 15th in terms of company 
operations and strategy. And that ranking is dependent on too 
few firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government started down the productivity path with a program 
called “Building a More Innovative Economy” in 1994 and has 
broadened its strategy with the last federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the Canada Foundation for Innovation was created with 
an $800 million dollar investment from the federal government. 
The foundation's mandate is to fund new and modernized research 
infrastructure.  This budget will increase that investment by an 
additional $200 million. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that our research infrastructure is fully utilized by 
the brightest minds in the country the government has further 
increased its total support to the research granting councils and 
to the National Research Council by more than $120 million.  We 
are accelerating our efforts to disseminate knowledge.  The 
budget will broaden access to the information highway with $60 
million for the smart communities demonstration projects.  Our 
networks of centres of excellence have brought together the best 
of our brains in a uniquely Canadians way that creates ideas like 
sparks off a flint. I want to see those sparks ignite and blaze 
in as many productive paths as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government has invested an additional $90 
million in the networks of centres of excellence.  Moreover, by 
investing an additional $430 million over the next three years in 
the Canadian Space Agency and thereafter stabilizing its annual 
budget of $300 million, the government has determined that 
Canadians will participate in exploring the space frontier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians compete with the best in the world we can win. We 
can come out ahead.  It happened in the automotive sector, the 
pharmaceutical sector, the aerospace and biotechnology sectors. 
Our investments in education, training and technology pay 
important dividends in jobs and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look to the 21st century we can pull that same resolve 
together as a nation to address the productivity challenges that 
are core to high quality accessible health care, a strong 
educational system, second to none, a society that provides real 
opportunities for youth and security for their parents and 
grandparents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a further step in implementing the long term plan 
that we began to set out in 1994.  Success is a journey, not a 
destination.  With this budget, we continue our progress on the 
road of success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is a lot of 
interest so we will ask everyone to keep their questions and 
comments to one minute.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
quoted all sorts of figures the budget has miraculously put at 
the service of the general public for industry, research and 
technology. However, I would like to tell him about other 
figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, there were 1,218,000 Canadian children living in 
poverty. By 1996, that number had climbed to 1,481,000, an 
increase of 263,000 since this government came to office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, 564,000 people over 65 were living in poverty, compared 
to 655,000 in 1996, that is 91,000 more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, there were 991,000 families living in poverty, compared 
to 1,230,000 in 1996, an increase of 239,000 since this 
government took office. These figures are from the National 
Council of Welfare, which is the government's advisory council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government may say that $300 million will be given through 
the child tax benefit— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry to interrupt, 
but the hon. member's time has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, clearly, the hon. member is 
ignoring the fact that we created over one and a half million 
jobs since we were elected in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is also ignoring, and this is part of the Bloc Quebecois' 
philosophy, the creation of wealth. She is ignoring the 
challenges of productivity. She thinks we can find solutions to 
the problems by handing money around everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must find the solution to creating wealth here in Canada. 
This is how we intend to proceed, to create jobs, to achieve 
success. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister went on and on about how productivity is a problem in 
Canada.  He is right.  We do have a problem with being productive 
and keeping up with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister pointed out there has been job growth.  He failed 
to mention that it is part time job growth, the self-employed. 
The Americans have produced all kinds of full time jobs but 
Canada has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on and on about all the programs that he had initiated 
and about all the spending they were going to do.  Noticeably 
absent from his speech was any emphasis at all on our record high 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister make the connection between record high taxes 
and our lack of productivity?  Does he still believe that high 
taxes actually increase productivity like he said just before 
Christmas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is wonderful to hear 
the errors of statement coming from the member for Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number one, of course I spoke about taxes.  Perhaps he missed 
that point of my speech.  I said that they were higher than in 
the United States.  If taxes are the only issue with respect to 
productivity, perhaps the hon. member for Medicine Hat can 
explain why, with higher tax rates, countries like France and 
Germany have achieved higher levels of productivity growth. 
Goodness, that is hard to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what I do not understand about Reformers is that we hear 
them every day saying they want more spending on health care, 
more spending on crime control, more spending on defence.  They 
have a bigger list of more spending items than you can shake a 
stick at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, somehow or other they think we will pay down 
the debt and lower taxes as well.  I understand why they need to 
start a new party.  The arithmetic in their old party just does 
not add up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
minister agree that the debt has been paid down on the backs of 
unemployed workers and by means of the EI fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister gives wonderful statistics with respect to 
unemployment, saying that it has gone from 11% to 7.8%. However, 
the government never explains why there has been an increase in 
the number of food banks in Canada and what the statistics on 
them are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government never tells us how many 25 and 30 year-olds are 
obliged to continue to live with their parents and how their 
parents have to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the figures I would like the minister to give us, for 
these are the figures that really count and that are on the 
minds of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is nothing as 
unreformed as a New Democrat from outside Ontario where they 
never had to face the prospects of governing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What underlies that question is a complete inability to do the 
arithmetic which drove the country to the point of bankruptcy in 
1993, led by the province of Ontario where the New Democrats for 
five years spent their way into oblivion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have created the conditions by creating jobs, by seeing job 
creation expand and by seeing people go back to work.  There are 
more people working in Canada today than at any time in our 
entire history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the NDP needs to understand and what the member needs to 
understand is that once we get to the basic problem of creating 
prosperity in society, problems that are solved by getting people 
to work, by increasing our productivity, by being competitive, by 
contributing to the factors that make the quality of life here 
the best in the world, we get to the source of the problems that 
he wants to talk about.  We cannot solve one without dealing with 
the other. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister questioned everybody's arithmetic in the House today 
except his own.  He mentioned that the debt was going down, that 
they had been paid it down by $20 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Yes, $20 billion.  I apologize.  I see 
the dollar figure on the debt stays exactly the same for the next 
three years; not one dollar less than it is this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he say there are $20 billion less of debt and in his own 
books it is the same for the next three years?  That is funny 
arithmetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have 
that question because if the hon. member does not understand it 
probably a lot of Canadians have not understood as well that the 
way we declare our deficits is a very cautious method.  In other 
words, we take into account all the accrued liabilities from 
pensions which are not due in the current year.  That means we 
accrue debts that actually do not require us to outlay cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said is that over the last two years our market debt, in 
other words what we have actually gone to the markets and 
actually borrowed from the bankers of the world, has been reduced 
by $20 billion.  That is not small change in my books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are over time but 
there seems to be an awful lot of interest in continuing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I raise on a point of 
order.  I think you would find unanimous consent to stretch 
question and answer period for another 10 minutes for the 
Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for South 
Surrey—White Rock—Langley has requested unanimous consent of

to stand before you to share my thoughts on the budget delivered 
by the Minister of Finance.  You and I may share them alone, Sir; 
no one else is paying any attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next few minutes I will analyse a number of different 
aspects of the budget.  I will focus on health care and look at 
economic conditions and tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oxford County is like many other rural regions of the country. 
It is made up of people who work hard for a living, raise their 
families and try to give something back to their community. 
My constituents have told me in the past that they want the 
government to get its fiscal house in order.  Each year after the 
budget they have said to me: “Good work, Finlay, but we need to 
go further and reduce the national debt”.  I have received many 
letters over the past five and a half years from constituents who 
wanted a zero deficit but also wanted the essential programs 
protected and preserved.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At times our task seems impossible.  As a new MP at the time of 
the 1994 budget, I looked at our previous $42 billion deficit and 
worried about the fiscal legacy we were about to leave our 
children and grandchildren.  It was not a task I looked forward 
to.  Nor, I imagine, did any member of the House at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We conquered the deficit.  No matter what the future holds for 
our Minister of Finance—some would say he has an exciting future 
ahead of him—he will be known as the man who led Canada away 
from the economic abyss to a future filled with potential for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 federal budget builds upon our past budgets not only in 
terms of tax cuts and fiscal balance but by ensuring that 
Canada's most important social program, health care, has been 
protected and preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the message I was very happy to carry to the municipal 
councils in the town of Tillsonburg in Zorra township during the 
House recess last week.  I look forward to discussing it with 
health care providers and hospital administrators throughout 
Oxford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent united alternative convention we did not hear 
the demagogues of the right talk about private health care 
although I am sure many espoused it in private.  Why would they 
not espouse this basic tenet of Conservative philosophy?  It is 
because they know Canadians believe that universal access to high 
quality, affordable health care is essential to Canada's quality 
of life.  It is something that defines us as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may ask what the federal government has done to protect 
medicare in the budget.  Through substantial funding increases 
and strategic investment the budget is about using the resources 
freed up by balancing the budget to strengthen and modernize 
medicare so that it can cope with emerging demands and adopt new 
technologies to meet the needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the federal Liberal government commit a minimum 
increase of $11.5 billion over the next five years to the Canada 
health and social transfer to the provinces.  It also allocates 
an additional $1.4 billion over the remainder of this fiscal year 
and the next three fiscal years to our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This funding includes the following: $328 million to improve 
public access to high quality health care information and to 
better inform Canadians about the performance of their health 
care system, consistent with the social union framework agreed to 
by all the provinces; $240 million to support the development of 
the Canadian Institute of Health Research; $150 million in 
additional funding for health related research for the advanced 
research granting councils, the National Research Council and 
Health Canada; an additional $200 million for the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation; $190 million to better meet the health 
needs of first nations and Inuit communities; and $287 million to 
improve prenatal nutrition, food safety, toxic substances 
control, to foster innovation in rural and community health, and 
to combat diabetes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to call the 1999 federal budget a health care budget. 
It was accomplished through the sacrifice of Canadians from coast 
to coast and it builds upon the success of the government's 
deficit fighting efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can look my constituents in the eye and tell them that our 
most essential social program has been strengthened and preserved 
for our collective future.  I only hope that the provincial Tory 
government in Ontario will ensure that rural regions like Oxford 
see the full benefits of this funding increase through improved 
service and quality of care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is about more than health care.  It is also a record 
of achievement which seeks to build a better economy for 
Canadians.  When the government took office, the national deficit 
stood at an all time high of $42 billion.  No federal government, 
either Liberal or Conservative, had delivered a balanced budget 
in almost a generation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Tough fiscal medicine, economic growth and job creation have 
combined to eliminate the deficit and give Canadians a balanced 
or a better budget for two years in a row.  This is significant 
because it is the first time since the government of Louis St. 
Laurent that the federal government has been deficit free for two 
consecutive years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister pointed out in his speech, the government is 
committed to further balanced budgets or better in 1999-2000 and 
2000-01.  This will make only the third time since Confederation 
that the Government of Canada has recorded four consecutive 
balanced budgets.  It is a legacy I am very happy to hand over to 
my children and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balanced budgets have provided room for the government to 
provide tax cuts to Canadians.  We recognize that tax relief and 
tax fairness are essential to improving the Canadian standard of 
living.  As I have said before, we can only provide tax cuts that 
we can afford and that are sustainable.  It makes no sense to 
provide tax cuts one year and then revoke them the next, or to 
butcher a program as Reform proposes every time the economy goes 
into a tailspin.  Our approach is balanced.  It is moderate and 
it is sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quickly summarize the tax cuts in the budget.  The basic 
personal exemption will be increased by $175 to a total of $675. 
This extends to all taxpayers along with last year's increase of 
$500 to low income Canadians.  As of July 1 the 3% surtax on 
personal income will be eliminated for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean to average Canadian taxpayers?  It means 
that single taxpayers earning $20,000 or less will see their 
taxes reduced by at least 10%.  Typical one earner families with 
two children and incomes of $30,000 or less will pay no net 
federal income tax.  Families with incomes of $45,000 or less 
will have their taxes reduced by a minimum of 10%.  Every 
Canadian can look forward to a tax cut and 600,000 lower income 
Canadians will no longer pay any federal income tax at all.  That 
is an increase of 200,000 over last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers across Canada were also happy to see in the budget the 
federal commitment to producers suffering from the income crisis 
they faced this past year.  The federal government in the budget 
committed to paying 100% of the cost of the agriculture income 
disaster assistance program in the first year, up to $600 
million.  The provinces will fund the major part of the program 
in the second year, resulting in a 60:40 cost sharing ratio over 
the two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the House that there are many farmers in Oxford County 
waiting anxiously for this assistance.  It is heartening to see 
that the government has found a way to furnish assistance and to 
seek out the funding necessary to provide an essential part of 
our economy when it is needed.  It is also encouraging to see 
that all the provinces but one have co-operated, and we hope that 
one will be onboard before too long.  Some economic turmoil 
cannot be forecast but the government has proven that it can 
react proactively to ensure those affected suffer as little as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much more about the budget that I applaud like the 
funding for innovation and research, but I will now close with 
some words from my favourite playwright, William Shakespeare.  In 
the last scene of <I>As You Like It</I> the Duke says:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the member for Oxford's usual lack of courage is clearly in 
evidence here when he says he will vote for the Minister of 
Finance's budget.  He is not as brave as the member for York 
South—Weston who voted against the Minister of Finance's budget 
because his party refused to keep its promise to abolish the 
GST.  He was kicked out of the party and his constituents 
rewarded him in 1997 by re-electing him to office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member for Oxford failed to point out is that, of the 
100% of workers who pay EI premiums, only 41% qualify for 
benefits.  The $20 billion surplus was used to balance the 
budget, and that is the fact of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, his government will have cut health care by $33 
billion by 2003.  He does not tell us that.  The government says 
that it will add a few billion dollars, but it has already cut 
$42 billion.  The member for Oxford lacks courage and will fall 
to his knees and vote for the budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not sure how the GST 
got in here. I did not promise to get rid of the GST, and many of 
us on this side of the House did not.  I remind the member that 
when he is talking about debt, when we took office 36 cents of 
every revenue dollar went to service the debt.  We used to have 
that day in July or August which was the day when we finished 
paying.  Now that is 27 cents on every revenue dollar, which is a 
25% increase and which accounts a great deal for our being to put 
more money into the programs that Canadians want and need. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the member's comments.  He 
mentioned the disaster relief program for farmers across the 
country.  I am from Okanagan—Coquihalla and we have an orchard 
industry that brings to the Okanagan Valley some $700 million a 
year which we are very proud of.  I think now and then all 
Canadians enjoy B.C. apples.  That has been a tradition across 
the country.  We are well known for our high quality products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two years our orchardists have been ravished with 
disastrous weather, crop failures and a number of situations. The 
member with a lot of pride defended the program in this budget 
that has been set up for the agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member if all people in the agricultural 
industry are so happy about the process that has been set up why 
then did tree fruit growers in the Okanagan Valley announce 
yesterday that they plan to cut down their apple trees in the 
Okanagan Valley, destroying a complete industry, on March 15? 
Could the member please give the orchardists in the Okanagan 
Valley some encouragement that this process and relief program 
will come sooner than sometime in July or August and that relief 
will be immediate for these people who are suffering a great 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>  Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague makes 
an excellent point.  I was happy to have visited that area of 
British Columbia last fall.  I talked to some of the apple 
growers.  I know that prices were a concern and I know that 
weather was a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a disaster relief program that we are talking about.  As 
I understand it, any agriculturalist can apply for the relief. 
The methods and the application forms will be on websites by 
Friday this week.  The hard copy should be ready in a couple of 
weeks.  Although the minister is unable to say exactly what it 
will be, the turnaround time will certainly be earlier than July.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
to respond briefly to the member's comments, it has been 
announced that the orchardists will have to wait until after they 
get their income tax returns which could be considerably down the 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of the people of Okanagan—Coquihalla to take 
part in this debate on the Liberal government's pay more and get 
less budget.  I say pay more and get less because Canadians are 
paying more in taxes but getting less in services like health 
care than they were before the Liberals took office in 1993. 
They are paying more and getting less and that has been a 
consistent theme by this Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a lot of excellent speeches today on health care 
and taxes from the official opposition and other members, but I 
have chosen to spend my time on a national institution, a very 
proud institution, the Canadian Armed Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently while conducting some research in my office I came 
across a lead story from the <I>Globe and Mail</I>.  The date of 
article was February 28, 1951.  The article was entitled 
“Canadians jubilant over orders to go to Korea”.  This article 
detailed the decision of the Canadian government to contribute 
significant troops to the conflict in Korea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The articled stated that Canadian soldiers were excited because 
they were proud and indeed Canadians from coast to coast to coast 
were proud of the contribution the Canadian Armed Forces could 
make to the Korean conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other article I point out was also from the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, dated February 21, 1959. The article announced 
Diefenbaker's decision to scrap the Avro Arrow project due to 
budgetary considerations.  In another article that day by the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> there was an editorial deploring the 
decision to force the Canadian government to purchase high tech 
equipment from the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two articles reminded me that in the 1950s Canada had a 
significant military establishment for a middle power, a place 
that we should hold today on the international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to scrap the Avro Arrow cost Canadians 13,800 jobs 
mainly in the province of Ontario.  The <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
pointed out that despite the cost of the Avro Arrow program, 
these 13,800 workers were Canadian taxpayers.  The money spent on 
the project would remain here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The editorial concluded by stating: “And now what?  Now the 
brilliant array of engineering and technical talent which built 
up this great Canadian industry will be dissipated.  Now these 
highly trained men and women, the one national asset, will 
probably go”.  The editorial asks where.  The answer was to the 
United States.  They did go and they formed the backbone of NASA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their exit from Canada foreshadowed today's brain drain of 
skilled workers who are leaving Canada due to high taxes in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring up these two historic issues of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
not to reopen the debates on the decision to send troops to Korea 
or to scrap the Avro Arrow but to point out that Canada in the 
1950s was taken seriously as a middle power.  We had a serious 
military establishment, one that we as Canadians were very proud 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the call came in 1951 we were ready to go, not to maintain 
the peace but to fight a war.  Our armed forces totalled 120,000 
personnel.  We contributed a brigade group, ships and aircraft to 
the UN sanctioned war in Korea.  By 1959 we had a serious 
aerospace industry providing Canada with its defence 
requirements.  Defence was taken seriously enough that the 
defence spending budget accounted for 20% of federal spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1950s and into the 1960s our armed forces 
contribution to peace and security helped earn Canada a premier 
place among the world's nations. 
By the 1970s this started to change with the election of another 
Liberal government, Pierre Elliot Trudeau's government.  I 
remember those days well because I was a young leading seaman in 
the Canadian Armed Forces serving on a Canadian destroyer escort. 
I watched firsthand as Trudeau's cuts did devastation on the 
Canadian Armed Forces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>By the late 1970s our soldiers were the best paid in the world. 
However, I remember numerous incidents where our ships were 
docked in Halifax and Esquimalt due to a lack of fuel. To make 
matters worse, training was hampered due to a lack of ammunition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under today's current Liberal regime things are much worse. 
Since 1993 the defence budget has been slashed by an additional 
28% while the demands placed on our troops in the Canadian Armed 
Forces have increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At just over $9 billion defence spending accounts for only 6% of 
the federal spending, down from 20% in the 1950s and a minuscule 
expenditure compared to the $42.5 billion spent each year paying 
interest on the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian defence expenditures account for 1.1% of GDP while the 
average defence expenditure for our NATO allies is 2.4% of their 
GDP.  Again, we are out of whack completely when we spend 1.1% on 
defence spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of this Liberal government's cuts to defence spending 
has been dramatic. We have seen our troops drop to 60,000 from 
73,000 in 1993. We find it impossible to meet Canada's stated 
defence policy objectives.  Hardest hit is our army, our land 
forces.  Most army units are manned at only 65% of their 
authorized strength.  Despite the Canadian population hovering 
somewhere around 30 million we can barely muster 800 troops to 
send to Kosovo. Even then they will be poorly armed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1998 the Auditor General of Canada reported to the 
House of Commons on the state of the Canadian Armed Forces 
equipment and expressed grave concern about the deterioration of 
equipment that was preventing our forces from fulfilling Canada's 
defence policies.  In terms of the army the auditor general 
pointed out that operationally it had not kept pace with 
technology to modernize equipment, leaving it vulnerable to 
threats.  Its infantry and armour could be detected, engaged and 
defeated long before our personnel even knew the enemy was 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cannot be taken lightly. The auditor general has 
unequivocally stated that the money for capital funding would 
decrease even further due to the high maintenance and operating 
costs of servicing aging equipment, as we see daily with stories 
about our Sea King and Labrador helicopters, the Aurora aircraft, 
but enough of the facts and figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that this Liberal government has decimated the 
Canadian Armed Forces, leaving Canada at best a freeloader on the 
backs of our allies and at worst utterly incapable of fulfilling 
our defence policy objectives, including protecting our own 
sovereignty. This is a national embarrassment, a disgrace not 
only to our troops but a disgrace for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Providing for the defence of its citizens is one of the prime 
responsibilities of any federal government.  Here as in other 
areas the Liberals have failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades now the Canadian forces have done more for Canada 
than meet the call to arms.  They have been a national 
institution that cannot be ignored, a national institution that 
should be used by this federal government to build unity from 
coast to coast with our militia units, with our reserve force and 
with the pride that our service people serve with around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do feel that pride: Canada's World War I victory at Vimy 
Ridge, our role defeating Nazi Germany, Italy and in France in 
World War II, our record as premier peacekeepers around the 
world. Notice I said “our”, our victory, our role, our record. 
They are our armed forces, our Canadian Armed Forces.  Despite 
the best efforts of the Liberals Canadians are proud of the men 
and women who serve in our forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Liberal government not to ignore the Canadian Armed 
Forces.  The minor and minuscule increases are not enough to keep 
our combat capable forces in place today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise today to address the latest version of the 
Liberal budget on behalf of the citizens of Lethbridge. I have 
been looking forward to this chance to chronicle the assault of 
this government on the Canadian taxpayer, the unfortunate soul 
who is paying more but getting less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is now the sixth straight time that Canadian taxpayers have 
had to suffer through a Liberal budget.  For the last six years, 
Canadians have endured slash and burn budget cuts that have 
devastated health and social transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have downsized our armed forces as my colleague 
just mentioned to a hollow shell, sacrificed environmental 
protection, tightened and restricted EI benefits, reduced 
portions of our national highway system to gravel, and worst of 
all, increased taxation revenues.  Simply put, taxpayers in 
Canada have been paying more but they have definitely been 
getting less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government took office in 1993, Canadians were paying 
$51.4 billion in personal income tax for the year.  At the end of 
this year, personal income taxes will have risen 46% to $75 
billion, an increase of $24 billion.  This is an increase of $650 
for every Canadian. This shell game which has been foisted on 
Canadians by the finance minister has forced Canadians to pay 
personal income taxes that are 56% higher than the G-7 average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we can forget the infamous promise to scrap the GST. 
We heard a bit about that today. When the Liberals took over, 
Canadians were paying $15.7 billion in GST per year.  By this 
year's end, Canadians will be paying $21.6 billion, an increase 
of $5.9 billion, or about 38%.  That translates into about $156 
more per Canadian for a tax that this government promised to 
abolish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if these increases were not bad enough, the government is set 
to hike CPP premiums by 73% over the next six years.  Sadly, the 
former chief actuary of the CPP, before he was fired for not 
singing from the Liberal song sheet, estimated that this increase 
would likely not even be enough to save the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To top it all off, the government has added insult to injury by 
ripping off taxpayers by overcharging them on their EI premiums. 
According to the chief auditor for this program, the government 
has been overtaxing Canadian workers by an average of 37% for the 
last five years.  Canadians now pay more of their hard earned 
money for a plan that delivers them fewer benefits, that is, if 
they even qualify under the strict new rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sad truth that the Liberal government refuses to 
tell.  The Liberals hide behind their sleight of hand accounting 
practices, practices the Auditor General of Canada does not 
approve of.  They hide behind their spin doctors and their 
rhetoric machines.  They boast about EI reductions but say 
nothing about CPP hikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals took over the reins of government from their 
partners, the tax and spend previous government, total federal 
tax revenues were $94.3 billion and total government revenues 
totalled $107.3 billion.  At the end of this year, the federal 
tax revenues will top $131 billion, an increase of $36.8 billion 
and total government revenues will be $149.4 billion, an increase 
of $42 billion. Members opposite can claim that the government is 
raking in these record revenues because of the strong economy, 
and they do. But how do they explain that when the economy only 
grew by 3%, government revenues grew by 8%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have made myself perfectly clear.  Canadians are 
paying more than they ever have before and they are getting less. 
What are they receiving for these astronomical increases in 
taxes?  What do they have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a two tier health system. The health care system that 
Canadians have come to rely on is under siege.  Waiting lists 
have increased 8.5% in one year to over 187,000 in 1997.  Almost 
200,000 people in Canada are waiting for health care services. 
The waiting time to see a specialist has increased 38% and the 
number of hospital beds have decreased by 25% in some provinces. 
My own daughter in Edmonton with a severely broken ankle waited 
42 hours for surgery to repair it just a month ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when the Liberals first took power, CHST payments were 
about $1,453 per taxpayer. 
But today after this budget, these payments per taxpayer have 
dropped to $1,005.  That is a drop of 31%.  So Canadians are 
paying more and getting less.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has announced with great fanfare that it is 
putting back $11.5 billion over five years into the transfer 
payments for health care.  But if we look at the Liberal record 
at the end of this five years, we will see that cumulative CHST 
reductions will total $50 billion by the end of the five years. 
The Liberal government has taken $5 and it will give $1 back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget was to be the cure to what was ailing the health 
care system, but Canadians are still paying more and getting 
less.  They are paying more for out of pocket medical expenses 
and will be getting $4.3 billion less in health care in 1999 than 
they did in 1993.  That is the legacy of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our soldiers have suffered.  The Canadian armed forces, the 
brave men and women who have dedicated themselves to their 
country, those who are willing to put their lives on the line, 
have borne the brunt of the government's politics.  These 
politics have put the well-being of our troops at risk.  The 
defence policies of the government have led to a serious 
deterioration in the morale of this once proud force.  It has 
left the armed forces with equipment that is 20 to 40 years old. 
It has cut personnel levels by almost 25% and has threatened to 
cut even more to balance the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effects of the government's cuts have cost the defence 
department about $7.8 billion since 1993-94 and now the finance 
minister offers a pitiful $175 million per year.  It is an insult 
to treat our soldiers with such disrespect.  They deserve more, 
not less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing seems sacred to the government.  With this budget the 
Liberal track record on the environment went from bad to worse. 
Across the country contaminated sites sit like a cancer on the 
land.  These sites are affecting the health of Canadians, yet the 
government refuses to take a leadership role in their cleanup. 
Look at Sydney, Nova Scotia, the tar ponds.  Nothing has been 
done.  Lots of talk but no action.  We are paying lots and 
getting nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In six years the government has not made any serious effort to 
protect our endangered species through legislation despite its 
international commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1998 the environment committee released a report that 
outlined the serious deficiencies in the enforcement capabilities 
of Environment Canada.  Funding levels have been cut to the point 
where enforcement officials are stretched so thin that they are 
falling behind in training and cannot enforce many of the 
increasing number of environmental regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is beyond belief that when the government was sitting on a 
$10 billion surplus it did not take the environment more 
seriously.  Contrary to what the finance minister may think, the 
environment cannot survive on empty promises of relief for next 
year.  Time is running out now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the point has been made.  Canadians are definitely 
paying more and they are getting less.  They are paying $2,000 
more in taxes since the government took office and they are 
getting at least $1,500 less for health and other services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fact is the savings that Canadians have are dwindling. 
Canadians are unable to put any money away and they are starting 
to use their savings just to get by from day to day.  Canadians 
do not deserve this.  They bore the burden of the deficit cutting 
and deserve to share in the benefits.  Nine out of ten Canadians 
say they want tax relief, not new spending, as their number one 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Reform government would deliver comprehensive tax reform 
beginning with $26 billion in total tax relief phased in over 
three years.  These reforms would simplify the tax system and, 
combined with the elimination of marriage and child care 
penalties, will deliver thousands of dollars per year back into 
the pockets of the average Canadian family of four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care is on life support and needs a major federal 
cash infusion.  Reform would deliver immediately $2 billion to 
boost federal transfer payments.  Wasteful government spending in 
other areas would be eliminated to give health care the priority 
it rightly deserves and Canadians are demanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs a reliable health care system with stable funding, 
funding that does not wildly fluctuate from year to year.  Reform 
would also right the injustice done to Canadians like Joey Haché 
and compensate all victims of the hepatitis C tainted blood 
system.  This is not a question of money, it is a question of 
fairness and a question of equality for all Canadians.  It is 
doing the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our soldiers earned our respect.  A $1 billion increase in 
defence spending would equip our soldiers with the tools they 
need to do the jobs that we ask them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform would introduce a credible plan for reducing the size of 
our national debt.  The debt will consume $43.5 billion in 
interest payments alone this year, robbing Canadians of funding 
for programs that they really need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they say, the proof is in the pudding.  Under this government 
Canadians will continue to pay more and get less.

Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in my constituency a number of 
businesses are choosing to leave Canada because of the high tax 
program of the Liberal government.  They are going down to the 
states because their investment is a little more secure down 
there and the tax rates are lower.  Students are taking jobs in 
the states because of the high taxes they would pay on income 
here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's riding is very close to the American border. I 
am wondering if he also is finding that it is a trend in today's 
society for businesses and young people to move down to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
that question.  It is interesting that just last week while I was 
in the constituency a young man came to me.  He has been offered 
a job in the states.  This young man has been looking for a job

better, the pay is better, the take home pay is much more, and 
the prospects are better for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have come across a document. The <I>National Post</I> published 
some headings from e-mails it received from Canadians about the 
budget. I would like to let members know how Canadians feel about 
this.  These are the headings from e-mails received at the paper: 
Taxed to death and back.  The non-stop robbery. Bludgeoned dry. 
Feeling milked dry.  Overtaxed.  Tax depression.  Taxpayer ready 
to revolt.  Tired of no value for my taxes.  Drowning in taxes. 
Lament decay of incentives.  How dry I am. Bludget:Bloodget. 
Excessive taxation.  Milked and bludgeoned.  Support for a tax 
revolt.  The bludgeoning of taxpayers.  Milked and fed up. Ottawa 
bludgeons.  The tax bite.  Hate this country and government.  I 
have the bludget blues.  Taxed into oblivion. Bludget alias big 
joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not coming from this side of the House.  That is coming 
from Canadians across the country.  That is how Canadians feel. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague across the way.  Chicken 
Little obviously is alive and well and the sky is falling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we listen to the opposition we hear that there have been no 
tax cuts.  One of the things I find very disturbing in this House 
is that clearly the acoustics on that side are not very good. 
That side is not listening to the fact that we have been reducing 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated earlier in the day that when we talked about the 
$11.5 billion in terms of health care, it was not borrowed money. 
Those guys are into the borrowed money scheme.  We are not into 
borrowed money.  We are going to pay as we go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would read the tax information with regard to the 
budget, he would clearly see that in order to have sustainable 
tax cuts, we have to be in the black.  We have to have the money. 
Clearly we are not prepared to finance tax cuts that are not 
doable.  That is what we have been doing. We have been doing over 
$16.7 billion in terms of tax cuts in the last two budgets alone. 
Listen to the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one thing that has to be 
done before there is any credibility is to take care of expenses. 
This government has refused to cap its expenses. The finance 
minister, the tax minister every year, comes up with more places 
to spend the money.  The Liberals do not want a surplus Canadians 
can look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not talk about what we think. 
Let us talk about the Canadian Bond Rating Service report which 
notes: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that budget 1999 includes a greater resource allocation towards 
expenditure priorities with fewer tax and debt reduction 
incentives.  In fact, the government has made no direct or 
specific commitment towards debt reduction other than to allocate 
its residual surplus after spending goals have been met.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one 
cannot believe one's eyes when reading the Reform amendment 
before us today which urges the House to reject the budget.  The 
members for Calgary Southeast and Medicine Hat are recommending 
in their amendment a rejection of an increase of $11.5 billion in 
health care over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party, with his amendment, further 
recommends rejection of the following: Canadian opportunities 
strategy, $1.8 billion; Canada Foundation for Innovation, $200 
million; and National Sciences and Engineering Research Council, 
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the National 
Research Council, $176 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party with its amendment today also recommends the 
rejection of $96 million toward the establishment of small 
communities.  It rejects $75 million toward Canada prenatal 
nutrition programs; $150 million toward technology partnerships; 
$50 million to expand rural and community health; $795 million 
for the youth employment fund and the Canada jobs fund; and $42 
million for improving management and control of toxic substances. 
It also rejects some tax relief, some $1.5 billion this year; 
$2.8 billion next year; and $3.4 billion in the year 2001-02. 
This is what the Reform Party is advocating today with its 
amendment on which we will vote shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having outlined the sham of the Reform Party position with 
respect to what it would like Canadians to be denied by its 
amendment, which does not take into account the positive aspects 
of the budget, one must also say a word of caution on the fanatic 
belief of the Reform Party in lowering taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When taxes are lowered services are lowered.  When taxes are 
lowered there is a longer wait for services.  When taxes are 
lowered there are poorer services.  When taxes are lowered good 
programs for youth, seniors, underprivileged, housing, et cetera, 
are cancelled.  When taxes are lowered university tuition costs 
are increased.  When taxes are lowered the waiting list for child 
care is increased.  When taxes are lowered laws cannot be 
properly enforced.  Water and air quality, to give an example, 
suffer as a consequence, and human health does too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is foolish to believe that lowering taxes leads to better 
standards of living.  Actually the reverse is the reality and 
Canada, with its level of taxation, is considered by foreigners 
the country in which they want to live and visit as shown by our 
immigration statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago the national Liberal caucus committee on 
sustainable development, chaired by the hon. member for 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, recognized the significant 
relationship between human health and a healthy environment and 
produced a document in which it says that human health is 
directly affected by the state of our environment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document concluded by quoting the Ontario Medical 
Association in a press release dated May 13, 1997, in which it 
said that air pollution was a public health crisis, drawing 
attention to the fact that it called for stringent action on smog 
causing emissions and other matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget we find that the elements related to health could 
lead to the paving of the way for the next budget, namely a 
budget that could possibly take place in February of next year 
and could be devoted to the environment and sustainable 
development.  When we start dealing with health we inevitably 
find our way to the roots of good health and proper public health 
and, therefore, to the basic elements of the way in which we 
approach the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having established the possibility of a future budget on the 
environment it is desirable to provide some input to the 
government on the question of expanding the concept of 
environmental protection to embrace the broader idea of 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be desirable that a budget on the environment and 
sustainable development would examine the present capacity of the 
federal government to enforce its own laws and to launch at the 
same time programs that would permit an improvement in the 
performance of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Environment Canada, Transport Canada and the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food in the name of public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a budget that would look at Canada's international 
commitments related to environmental protection and sustainable 
development.  It would look at our implementation of agenda 21 as 
stemming from Rio, our commitments under the Basel convention, 
our commitments through the Kyoto agreement on climate change, 
and determine which are the fiscal and taxation measures that are 
facilitating our move toward the reduction of climate endangering 
emissions and the removal of tax incentives that stand in the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a budget that would look at the sustainability of 
our natural resources particularly in the fishery and forests. It 
would look to our ability to compete through the function of 
energy efficiency because through a higher energy efficiency than 
the one we have achieved so far we could also be more 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next budget of the Government of Canada, if it devotes and 
focuses its attention on the environment and sustainable 
development, would be one that would put into practice the 
document that was published in 1995 under the heading “Turning 
Talk Into Action”.  In that document the Government of Canada 
expresses the firm belief that our economic health depends on our 
environmental health.  It is believed that the federal government 
can help shape a better future for all Canadians, a future 
characterized by sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that same document, which was signed by 21 cabinet ministers 
and by the Prime Minister, the following statement was made: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we want to play a leadership role in turning 
sustainable development thinking into action.  This is why we are 
now taking the next step of establishing a framework in which 
environmental and economic signals point the same way. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to achieve that plateau of pointing in the same way.  A 
framework which integrates sustainable development into the 
workings of the federal government is one this document espouses 
right across the board.  It concludes by saying that the 
Government of Canada is committed to getting government right by 
making government greener.  “This is our commitment to 
Canadians”, the document concludes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity of presenting this intervention and 
expressly hope that the next budget will be on environmental 
protection and sustainable development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, does the hon. member feel that the 
government has given the right priority to environmental issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless I missed something there was no indication in the budget 
that the government had any concerns about the environmental 
issues facing the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question. 
The government has given priority in the budget to health issues. 
Evidently health is intimately connected to environmental issues. 
The allocation of $11.5 billion to health is a good foundation on 
which to build an approach to environmental issues in the next 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret to note that the Reform Party amendment before us urges 
the rejection of the allocation of $11.5 billion to health which 
the budget has launched.  For the life of me I cannot understand 
why the Reform Party is taking such dog in the manger position 
instead of supporting the very fact that the government is 
injecting a substantial amount of money into health over the next 
few years.  It should support this measure and it should indicate 
to its constituents that this is a good move in the right 
direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member led us to believe that he understands that lowering 
taxes is bad for Canadians.  He said something to effect that if 
we lower taxes we will then have to lower services for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not realize that the interest charges on the $600 
billion that we owe would provide tremendous amounts of programs 
for Canadians?  As a matter a fact, it would be $44 billion or 
$45 billion worth each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would he address that?  Would he mind clearing that up for 
me?  Would lower taxes in his opinion be bad for Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a lack of 
knowledge of economic realities on the part of the hon. member 
and his party that requires further education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put it this way.  The Reform Party fails to understand 
the fact that the debt as the economy expands remains the same 
and proportionally becomes smaller and smaller as years go by. 
Therefore the debt is no longer an economic preoccupation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preoccupation of the government is the right one, namely by 
putting its money into health, education, technological 
development and research to provide the foundation for a positive 
economic future, not by looking backward in terms of reducing the 
debt which in proportion to the total national wealth is becoming 
smaller and smaller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals believe that the role of the government is to make 
investments and not to make the banks happy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is saying that the danger of reducing taxes is that 
programs would have to be cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree with me that cutting employment insurance has 
hurt working people?  My question is very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I fully agree with the 
hon. member.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is slightly humbling to speak after the valiant 
veteran from Davenport but I will intercede on behalf of my 
colleagues in the House to bear with me for eight or ten minutes 
as I give a dissertation of the great qualities of this 1999 
budget that the wonderful Liberal Party has brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may come as no surprise to my colleagues that I stand in 
support of this Liberal government's 1999 budget which will 
increase prosperity and lead Canadians into a new world economy 
for a new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of this century the prosperity of the Canadian 
economy was of course dependent on entering a world economic 
environment that provided funds for investment and markets for 
exports.  One hundred years later, after Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who 
was responsible for this rather profound and provident policy, 
this current Liberal government is continuing to keep Canada at 
the forefront as one of the top industrial nations in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my constituents in the great riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, the 1999 budget represents a 
continued commitment to the military and the revered Liberal 
institution of universal health care which some of the members 
opposite want to eviscerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased tax cuts will also improve everyone's standard of 
living, including the hon. member from Sleepy Hollow opposite, 
and create the foundation for much needed economic growth and 
development not only in the great upper Ottawa valley but 
throughout this tremendous country called Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clearly evident to this Liberal government after 
consultations with Canadian from coast to coast to coast that 
health care should be the number one priority in this budget. 
Without a doubt health care was our number one priority and, I 
might be so bold, it should be the number one priority for some 
of the members opposite because I think some of them should 
indulge in good health.  I know we have on occasion a boxer over 
there and a former professional athlete, but I think that was 
something like 40 or 50 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this health care issue we have given back over $11.5 billion. 
This was hard earned money Canadians really needed and really 
wanted. They stuck with us. The Liberals won the election in 
1993.  Thank goodness we did because this country was going 
nowhere fast, hitting the wall because the Conservative 
government left us with an astronomical $42 billion a year annual 
deficit.  We had to eradicate that deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we do that?  We did that in consultation with all 
Canadians.  They agreed with that.  We were honest with them, we 
were truthful with them.  We said when we have balanced the books 
without a doubt we will put that money back to where we believe 
it is most needed and health care is the number one issue. We 
have given that $11.5 billion back.  As a matter of fact, the 
funding now in 1999 is higher than it was in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Ontario some people have tried to somehow 
extrapolate that it is the federal government's fault for 
closures of hospitals and the downsizing of the health care 
portfolio. Everyone knows that the provincial Tory government in 
Ontario must have been cerebrally incapable of understanding 
basic economics that if it gives 30% tax cuts which amounted in 
Ontario to about $4.5 billion it will have to find the money 
somewhere else or make dramatic cuts.  In the province of Ontario 
those dramatic cuts came in the health care field.  That 
government should never have done that until it balanced the 
books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now balanced the books in two consecutive years. That 
has not been done since 1952. This Liberal government has done 
that. We have done it in a fair and equitable manner.  Now we 
have decided to give back.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important area where we must give money back is to the 
military which we have done to the tune of $175 million a year 
for the next four to five years.  Hopefully, as long as we keep 
balancing the books, which rest assured we will do, we can 
continue this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers just talked about this.  They talked the big line in 
their no start or fresh start, whatever they call it, that they 
were going to balance the books in 2000.  We on this side of the 
House did it in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old axiom in life that talk is cheap.  I think they 
are just blowing smoke.  I do not think they ever had the will 
power or the capacity to actually balance the books.  We did it. 
When they are yelling, screaming and making rather inappropriate 
and intemperate remarks, it is probably just blatant jealously 
that we actually could do something that they could not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have balanced the books for two consecutive years.  It has 
not been done since 1952.  We have given money back to the 
military.  I have a great military establishment in my riding, 
CFB Petawawa.  We are looking after those people because the 
quality of life for the military certainly was not there. 
Unquestionably it needed more money and we have delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member opposite wants to talk about taxes, 
lowering taxes.  We have lowered taxes.  Six hundred thousand 
Canadians are no longer on the tax roll.  If the hon. member for 
Wild Rose makes a big salary then he has to pay his taxes.  He 
should look after the poor people.  My goodness, go on a diet and 
you will not have to spend so much money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got rid of the 3% surtax that was an egregious tax brought in 
by the former Conservative government.  It made a dramatic mess 
of the economy. We spent the last six years trying to clean up 
the mess it made and, I might add, we are doing a remarkable job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He was one of our great prime 
ministers.  I want the members opposite to pay strict attention 
to this.  Sir Wilfrid Laurier said that liberalism is inherent in 
the very essence of our nature.  It is the desire of happiness 
with which we are all born into the world.  We constantly 
gravitate toward an ideal which we never attain.  We dream of 
good but never realize the best.  And thus it will be as long as 
people are what they are.  As long as their immortal soul 
inhabits a mortal body their desires will always be vaster than 
their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our desire on this side of the House is that as we move into a 
new millennium we follow that Laurier legacy.  We will thrive and 
survive under a Prime Minister who knows what has to be done and 
goes ahead and does it and with a government that is caring and 
compassionate for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are leading a national effort, this Liberal Party, an effort 
which will spread to all sectors of society, to equip Canadians 
to compete in a changing world, a new world for a new millennium, 
I say to the member for Wild Rose.  That is why we are investing 
in knowledge, innovation, research and development.  It will mean 
expanding opportunities for not only ourselves but for our 
children and for the hon. member's great, great-grandchildren 
because I am sure he has some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty years from now in the year 2020 it will be our children, 
my children, not the hon. members' great, great-grandchildren, 
who will be leading the great riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke and leading Canada into the 21st 
century.  They are our future.  They will be looking after us in 
our old age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future belongs to societies whose economies are sound, whose 
children are well prepared and which invest in knowledge, 
innovation and education.  However, these changes cannot be 
achieved by the federal government alone. They require a 
partnership at all levels of government, the public sector, the 
private sector, the trade unions, the volunteers and even members 
opposite, although sometimes we would not need their input to 
tell you the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 1999 budget and future budgets will take us into the future 
and into a new millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand his enthusiasm.  If we look at what Ontario got, $1 
billion, with $150 million for Quebec, I understand his 
happiness, like that of most of his colleagues from Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to know if he is aware of the Constitution 
of Canada.  All the budget did was encourage interference in 
provincial jurisdictions.  Does the hon. member really know his 
Constitution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleague to tell the 
people of Quebec the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that several billion dollars in equalization 
payments are leaving Ottawa for the Province of Quebec.  It wins 
all the time with equalization payments.  We must be careful and 
tell people the truth.  Is he afraid to do so?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member made a comment about the Liberal government being 
caring and compassionate.  I wonder if the member may wish to 
expand on that a bit and talk about his caring and compassionate 
government as it refers to hepatitis C, as it refers to the 
gutting and the destroying of the health care system in this 
country and perhaps the caring and compassionate Liberal 
government when it chased our children from this country to the 
United States because of an overburdened taxation system.

opposite, does he call a party that doubles the national debt in 
a nine year term caring and compassionate?  Let us get serious 
here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to speak about the question I asked on December 8, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People sometimes wonder why those of us on this side of the 
House lose our voices. It is because we have to speak up loudly 
on certain issues.  On the other side, they do not seem to 
understand the problem they have created for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, after the Liberals were elected, 61% of the unemployed 
could qualify for benefits. That number has dropped to 38%. Even 
the United Nations blamed the Liberal government for its cuts in 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a question to the Deputy Prime Minister, and got the 
following response from the parliamentary secretary: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member refers to what is called the B/U rate and suggests 
that it is down around 40%. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is referred to here is the number of people qualifying for 
employment insurance.  I continue with the response: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The correct number is 78%. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The correct number is not 78%. 
It has gone down to less than 36%, because the 78% is 78% of 
36%.  That is the correct number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand how my colleague over there can stand up and 
state that 78% of Canadians can qualify for employment 
insurance, with all the cuts that have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to receive maternity benefits, a woman has to have 
accumulated 700 hours.  A person who becomes sick needs 700 
hours, and a newcomer on the workforce 910 hours.  That is what 
I tried to explain in the House, that the cuts in employment 
insurance have resulted in only 36% of people paying into 
employment insurance being able to draw benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled across the country, province by province.  I 
have even gone to Whitehorse in the Yukon.  I have heard the 
horror stories resulting from the cuts that are affecting people 
throughout the country.  It happens not only in the Atlantic 
region, but in Regina, Winnipeg, Nanaimo, Vancouver, Prince 
George, Whitehorse and Windsor, in the riding of the Deputy 
Prime Minister, where people working in the automotive industry 
are suffering from the cuts to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that, on the other side of the House, the member can 
rise and say that 78% of Canadians qualify for benefits?  She 
then turns around and says that these are people who have not 
worked.  Does she think we are crazy or what?  We know that 
people who have not worked do not qualify for employment 
insurance.  These are not the people we are talking about.  We 
are talking about those who have worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> I say to my colleague, that on Prince Edward 
Island, it is the same thing.  They cut thousands of people in 
this province, and they are not very proud of you.  I know 
because I went there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the mistruths that are spouted in this House, because 
when the hon. member says I am not speaking the truth and that 
78% of Canadians qualify for benefits, I say that is not true. 
Only 36% of those who contribute to employment insurance receive 
it.  That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope my colleague understands the figures.  If she does 
not, maybe it is time she went back to school.

just cause were eligible for EI benefits. This 78% is based on a 
new survey by Statistics Canada specifically designed to answer 
questions about EI coverage. Indeed the survey is called the 
Employment Insurance Coverage Survey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study released by the department in the fall concludes that 
the BU ratio, which is the number the member opposite chooses to 
use, that is the 42%, is the indicator used by the member to 
confuse and frighten workers but is not, I repeat not, a good 
indicator of coverage effectiveness by the EI system because it 
includes all unemployed Canadians irrespective of their 
attachment to the labour market or whether they have paid into 
the EI program or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member suggest that all unemployed Canadians 
should automatically receive EI?  For example, should someone who 
has never worked a day in his or her life be entitled to EI? 
Should someone who decides to quit a job in order to go back to 
school be entitled to EI? 
If someone is self-employed and does not pay premiums, should he 
or she be entitled to EI?  If someone is being paid severance 
pay, should he or she receive EI at the same time?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on December 2, I asked the minister of fisheries why he 
authorized a fishery for his friend and campaign contributor 
which resulted in a kill of 30,000 coho in a no-kill zone, a 
number the government questioned in error.  I was outraged by the 
kill and DFO bureaucrats were alarmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa warned north coast managers in Prince Rupert that the 
more that becomes known of the coho kill the bigger the issue 
would become.  I could not agree more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 21 last the minister announced that coho stocks were in 
crisis, some bordering on extinction.  There were to be no 
fisheries directed at coho anywhere on the coast by any fishermen 
and a zero retention of coho caught in other fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 19 the coast was divided into red and yellow zones.  In 
red zones there was to be zero mortality of coho.  Nevertheless, 
in red zones there were to be a number of small, highly 
restricted, experimental recreational fisheries.  Such a fishery 
was authorized in the Dixon Entrance on the north coast of the 
Queen Charlottes.  Problems became apparent immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a weekly coho report dated June 24 officials issued a warning 
to the minister: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concern for Dundas Island red zone sport fishery growing. 
Encounter rates of coho climbing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, a promised observer program to monitor the fishery 
was not put in place until halfway through the season and when 
they were hired there were only four of them for six fishing 
areas.  The July 29 report indicated for area one that coho 
abundance was high throughout Dixon Entrance and that it did not 
matter where one went or what they did, coho were being caught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coho encounter rate was estimated to be 11 to 1 at Langara 
Island, although they acknowledged that many believed it to be 
much higher.  The August 5 report indicated that in area three at 
Dundas Island East monitors were reporting an encounter rate of 
20 coho caught for every chinook taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The August 12 report indicated that area one lodges continued to 
be fully operational with about 320 anglers per day.  It reported 
coho encounters were a continual occurrence, noting that unguided 
vessels were remaining in areas where coho abundance was high. 
It also noted that there continued to be reports that some 
fishermen were not treating the coho well when releasing which 
could be increasing mortality.  Area one coho encounters were 
then estimated at 80,000.  The report goes on to estimate that 
area three coho encounters were 142 coho for every chinook 
caught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had promised that the fishery would be closed if 
there were coho mortality.  There was a continuous coho kill that 
reached alarming proportions, yet he took no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the north coast of the Charlottes the minister was not 
interested in conservation.  He was only interested in providing 
a special opening for the lodge based fishery operated by his 
friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer DFO scientists undertook a special mortality study 
on recreational catch and release for coho.  Scientists found a 
mortality rate of slightly more than 25% for coho caught in 
recreational fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In estimating a 30,000 coho kill in the waters of the north 
coast and the Queen Charlottes, I used a coho-chinook encounter 
rate of 10 to 1, not the 142 to 1 documented in area three or 
even the 11 to 1 documented at Langara Island.  I also used a 
mortality rate of 10%, not the 25% rate DFO scientists found in 
their study.  A minimum of 30,000 coho were killed in this 
no-kill zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question remains.  What does no kill mean to the minister? 
Does it mean that only his friends and campaign contributors can 
go fishing?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member was 
quite wrong in his preamble and quite wrong in his last 
statement.  The minister has made it very clear that he believes 
in conservation and protecting the fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to establish some of the facts, harvest management plans 
for Pacific salmon in 1998 were based on two conservation 
objectives:  zero fishing mortality for upper Skeena and Thompson 
River coho salmon stocks, and where these stocks were not 
prevalent, only selective fisheries which clearly demonstrated 
that the risk of coho bycatch would be minimal were permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sport fishery that the hon. member for Delta—South Richmond 
is concerned about is at Langara Island in the Queen Charlotte 
Islands.  This fishery was designated an experimental pilot sport 
fishery for chinook salmon.  There was non-retention of coho. 
Even though fishers could not keep the coho they encountered, 
departmental scientists accounted for a portion of the coho that 
may have died after being released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two methods were used to estimate the number of coho encountered 
in this sport fishery:  a creel survey estimate by the Haida 
first nations and an estimate by departmental patrolmen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using an accepted mortality rate of 10%, it was estimated that 
coho mortalities ranged from 4,500 to 13,100, far less than the 
member is accusing us of.  Even using a significantly higher rate 
of 20%, the estimated mortality of Skeena coho from the 
experimental sport fishery at Langara Island was only .4%.  This 
is considerably less than the mortality resulting from the north 
coast commercial fishery which was estimated to be 2% to 3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These successes are a direct result of the management policies 
introduced in 1998 and reflect our commitment to conservation. We 
intend to put fish first, and the minister is certainly doing 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to go into more 
detail regarding my question to the Minister of National Defence 
on February 4 when I raised concerns about the governments 
administration of the Anthrax vaccine to members of Canada's 
armed forces in the Persian Gulf last spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Details of this matter came to light as a result of the 
treatment of Sergeant Michael Kipling of Winnipeg who refused to 
submit to the Anthrax vaccination last March.  He was 
subsequently sent home, cited for breach of the National Defence 
Act and is now awaiting a court martial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our view that Sergeant Kipling had every right to refuse 
the Anthrax vaccination and that his case has revealed serious 
negligence by the Canadian government in the administration of 
the vaccine generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have several concerns, which are as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government did not take the proper safety 
precautions to ensure the vaccine given to the troops was safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from the FDA in the United States that the company which 
produced the vaccine relabelled an outdated lot of drugs. That is 
particularly interesting since today it is our understanding that 
there is no viable vial of Anthrax vaccine left in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government did not test the vaccine itself and 
relied on the testing done by the company itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no independent testing done.  Mitretek simply used the 
results of the tests by the company in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FDA in the United States has shown that there have been no 
studies done on the long term effects of this drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Anthrax vaccination has been linked to the gulf war syndrome 
yet this country continues to dismiss, and is probably the only 
country in the world to dismiss, this syndrome and reduce it to a 
matter of stress on the part of the troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of involvement by the health protection branch was 
noticeable and nothing was done to certify the vaccine.  It is 
just another indication that the government is reducing its 
regulatory responsibilities and dismantling the health protection 
branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have several recommendations.  One, that the government 
investigate the administration of the anthrax vaccine.  Two, that 
it initiate a review of the policies vis-à-vis vaccinations to 
allow for some method of waiver and some choice.  Three, that 
there be an involvement of the health protection branch to get a 
scientific assessment of this vaccination and any other 
inoculation used on our troops.  Four, that the government stay 
the charges and stop the court martial proceedings involving 
Sergeant Michael Kipling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sergeant Kipling has had an exemplary record during his 26 years 
of service in the Canadian armed forces.  He raised serious 
concerns about the health and safety of the Anthrax vaccination. 
It would seem to us that, given his safety concerns, given the 
facts we have learned subsequently about the case and all the 
circumstance involved in this issue, surely it is unfair for the 
government to proceed with a court martial for Sergeant Michael 
Kipling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the anthrax vaccine 
administered to members of the Canadian forces deployed in the 
Gulf had not expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was tested according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
directives in 1996 and its expiry date extended to 1999.  Before 
it was used to vaccinate Canadian and American troops, it was 
also tested for strength, safety, sterility and purity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. defence department asked Mitretek, an independent 
American firm, to supervise testing and to audit the results of 
testing by the manufacturer, Michigan Biologic Products 
Institute, in January and March 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the vaccine we received was again tested on the  orders 
of the U.S. defence department, in accordance with FDA 
directives.  These additional tests confirmed that the vaccine 
was both safe and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of those vaccinated against anthrax suffered 
no ill effects.  A very few experienced a small local reaction, 
comparable to that caused by other vaccines currently used in 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our policy for pharmaceuticals is to obtain from Health Canada 
approval to import, store and distribute vaccines licensed in 
other countries but not in Canada before DND gives them to our 
personnel.  This is exactly what we did with regard to the 
anthrax vaccine last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember the operation in the gulf was potentially 
dangerous.  The government has worked in good faith and in the 
best interests of the men and women of the Canadian forces to 
provide them with the best protection possible.
